COMMENTARY


Understanding Behavioral Finance Can Give You the Edge

Most successful people don’t want to think that they are incapable of being rational about their wealth, but it is important to point out why your financial advisors plays an important role in reminding you how to be “smart” about your wealth.

Financial and Tax-Related Identity Theft - Part Two

 As I discussed in Part 1 of this article, identity theft is now the most common consumer complaint—with over 10 million total identity theft cases per year. It not only has tarnished the reputations of Fortune 500 brands such as Anthem, Target and Home Depot, but it also has infiltrated security-conscious
government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service.

Financial and Tax-Related Identity Theft - Part One

With the 2015 revelation that the IRS data breach involved over 330,000 taxpayer records (the IRS originally reported only 104,000 records were compromised), and more breaches followed, the IRS is finally under sufficient pressure to implement some formal procedures to assist taxpayers who have experienced a governmental, corporate or other data breach.

The Charitable Remainder Trust - Having your cake and eating it too!

As many of you know, President Trump has proposed lower tax rates across the board, including taxes on capital gain income and ordinary income rates. In addition, the 3.8 percent Obamacare Medicare tax on net investment income may also be on the chopping block.

Whether or not the proposed tax changes tax place, CRTs should remain a smart strategy for generous taxpayers planning to sell appreciated assets such as marketable securities, real estate and certain closely held businesses.

Our Strategy
In the investment business, it is easy to talk about diversification: Most investors understand that it is beneficial to diversify their assets, so most investment providers focus their marketing efforts on their devotion to diversification. However, the measure of a firm’s commitment to effective diversification can be found in the strategy (or lack thereof) they employ.
At Capital Directions, our investment strategy is based on the science of investing built upon decades of academic research and institutional application. Our portfolios are designed to accomplish one, single task – to capture the market’s return while minimizing risk through prudent diversification. Our philosophy is firmly grounded in both Efficient-Market Hypothesis (EMH) and Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).
EMH helps us understand asset pricing. It asserts that all known information is already reflected in the value of any asset, thereby making it is improbable to consistently uncover securities whose real value deviates from its market value. With millions of investors seeking the highest risk-adjusted return on their capital, competition quickly drives prices to their fair value. 
MPT guides us in the construction of our portfolios. One of the most important and influential economic theories ever postulated (it won the Nobel Prize in 1990), MPT provides the framework for creating optimal portfolios by closely considering the relationship between risk and reward. MPT proved that by commingling poorly correlated asset classes together in a portfolio, the portfolio’s risk could actually be lower than the sum of its individual parts. MPT is the gold standard for prudent diversification; in fact, it was the underpinning of the Uniform Prudent Investors Act, which governs prudent fiduciary procedure in 44 states in the U.S.
Contrary to what Wall Street would like you to believe, market timing and security selection add very little, if any, return to a portfolio, and we eschew such tactics in our portfolio management. We do not follow the latest investment fads, chase performance or engage in will emotion-based trading in our clients’ portfolios. All of these activities will significantly reduce the probability of delivering the risk-adjusted returns that are there for the taking for investors – and their advisors – who stay the course.
Instead, using EMH and MPT as our guides, we focus our actions on factors that have a high probability of creating a successful investment strategy: 1.) Diversifying both within and across a wide variety of asset classes; 2.) Minimizing fees and transaction costs as much as possible; and, 3.) Maximizing our clients’ after-tax returns. Finally, we will closely monitor the portfolio to ensure the structural integrity is never compromised. 
By embracing proven academic theories and building an investment strategy focused on factors that can be controlled, we can create portfolios that have a much greater likelihood of success for our clients than the typical trading-intensive, performance chasing approach that Wall Street sells investors.

Our Beliefs
It has been said that golf is a simple game but not an easy game, and the same could well be said of investing. History shows that the stock market has always rewarded investors who were well-diversified and invested for the long-term, and yet most investors do not enjoy those rewards. A 2013 study by Dalbar, Inc. revealed this disconnect; it showed that, during the 20-year period from 1994 – 2013, the stock market enjoyed an annual return of 9.22% per year. Meanwhile the average investor earned only 5.02% a year. 
So if the path to investment success is so simple … why do so many investors deviate from that path?
In a word: Emotion.
Investors fail to appreciate the nearly insurmountable pull that emotions have on their investment decisions. In booming markets such as the dot.com bubble in the late 1990s, the dominant emotion is greed. In periods of market turmoil, such as the financial crisis of 2008-09, the dominant emotion is fear. Both fear and greed are the enemies of investment success, because they cause investors to make short-sighted decisions that deviate from their long-term investment plan. And those short-term movements end up costing investors as a group billions in lost returns year-after-year – returns that were there for the taking.
We believe, therefore, that one of the key responsibilities of an outstanding wealth manager is to be the emotional barrier between clients and their money. To create a prudent, well-diversified investment strategy appropriate for the client’s needs, and then act as a voice of calm reason during periods of market extremes to make sure there are no emotion-driven deviations from that strategy. This will help ensure that our clients are in the market, all the time, to enjoy its long-term rewards
To minimize the investor’s emotions, we believe an outstanding wealth manager must minimize unnecessary volatility. And that is why at Capital Directions we employ the tenets of Modern Portfolio Theory as our investment strategy.

Advice & Dissent



Jack Calhoun | 
			Principal
Examining the common (non)sense that causes investors to fail.



Flight or Freeze? 
August 2012
“Don’t just stand there – do something!”
That is the refrain of anxiety, fear and panic. It is the fight-or-flight survival instinct put into words – a plea to do anything other than stay put.
Sometimes the notion of taking action makes perfect sense. If, for instance, your car stalls out on the railroad tracks and a freight train comes barreling around the bend, then staying put is clearly unwise.
When it comes to investing, however, the notion of “taking action” during times of perceived danger in the market is misguided and dangerous. And it is precisely the sort of counter-intuitive concept central to investment success that very few people who manage their own portfolios are ever able to understand or embrace.
Before we explore this notion in more depth, a caveat: The wisdom of staying put during periods of market turmoil depends entirely on the soundness of your current strategy. Investors with portfolios heavily concentrated in individual stocks or invested in narrow market sectors should indeed take action to diversify their portfolios, but the time do this is before the market volatility swoops in and knocks your portfolio value in half or more. (See: Wachovia, Delta, GM, et al.)
For those who are invested in a well-diversified portfolio strategy, it is vital to stay the course in times of turmoil. Unfortunately, the “blink moments,” as we call them, always coincide with the exact moment of maximum stress in the market. The greater the stress, the harder it is to say put, because every time we pick up the paper, click on the financial web site or turn on the TV, we hear the “experts” urging us to “do something.”
But what, exactly, is the “something?" This is the logical next step in this progression and the one that people usually fail to consider. When panic sets in, as it did in the fall of 2008 and again in the summer of 2011, investors become obsessed with “fleeing from” without considering what they are “running to."
With that in mind, let’s examine what investors historically have considered the safe havens in times of turmoil to see if they really are a safer alternative to stocks:
Gold: Gold is often touted as a safe haven in turbulent markets and as a way to moderate volatility or even generate healthy returns. The reality, however, is that gold is a more volatile asset than common stocks. Over the past 10 years, the volatility of gold (as measured by standard deviation) was 19.06% versus S&P 500 volatility of 15.99% -- and this was during a decade that saw three significant market declines! Many people fled to gold following the downgrade of the U.S. debt rating in August 2011. And yet from September 2011 through June 2012, the price of gold plunged from $1,884 to $1,599, a decline of 15.13%. During the same time, the S&P 500 rose 16.01% from 1174 to 1362. Those who fled stocks for gold and thought they were getting “safety” actually suffered a cumulative loss of more than 30%!
Bonds: Fixed-income is the traditional asset class used to moderate equity volatility. In the past four years, however, individual investors have flooded into fixed income as a refuge from the perceived risk of investing in stocks. In just the second quarter of 2012 – and despite a 30% gain in stocks the prior six months – volatility-weary investors pulled $35 billion from stock funds and plowed $59 billion into bond funds. 

Unfortunately, many such investors are only trading a perceived risk for a guaranteed risk. Having found the extremely low yields of high credit quality bonds to be unattractive (the current Barclays Aggregate Bond Index yield is 2.01%), many investors are running to high yield, low credit quality bonds in pursuit of returns. Unfortunately, these junk bonds will suffer significant losses of principal when interest rates rise, exposing their investors to significant volatility. As seen in the chart below, high yield bonds have risk more closely aligned with equities than high credit quality bonds.

On top of this, the low interest rate environment and high demand for safer assets has driven bonds to significant premiums when compared with equities. The Price to Earnings ratio of the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index has skyrocketed to 49.75 vs. 13.88 for the S&P 500.
Cash: There can be a temptation to throw one’s arms up, pull out of the market and seek the safety of cash amid uncertainty. However, there is a very real risk of loss of purchasing power if fleeing exclusively to cash. Inflation in the U.S. as measured by the Consumer Price Index has been 3.57% over the past 80 years. With current average money market rates at 0.48%, inflation will rapidly erode a pure cash position’s real value.

Often times investors view a move to cash as temporary, vowing to get back in the market once volatility subsides. Unfortunately, such investors usually make a move to cash after they have experienced the downturn and then fail to get back in the market in time for the subsequent rebound. Investors pulled billions from stock mutual funds last fall and fled to cash after the market’s dramatic plunge following the downgrade in the U.S. credit rating. Those who waited just two months to get back in the market, however, missed a 13.44% gain in the S&P 500, and if they waited six months they missed a 29.09% gain.
The bottom line is that investing involves risk. The best way to mitigate that risk is to have a well-diversified portfolio and a proper balance of stocks and bonds appropriate to your risk and return needs. After that, the best strategies you can employ are time, patience, faith and fortitude. History shows that market downturns have always worked themselves out over time – if you stayed put.
As one of the industry’s most respected and revered figures, Vanguard founder John Bogle, says about market downturns:
“Don’t just do something – stand there!”

Is the Rally for Real? 
March 2012
A recent article in the Atlanta Journal Constitution featured an angle that I have seen frequently in the media in the past few weeks, which can be summed up in five words:
“Is the rally for real?”
In other words, are stocks going to continue to climb, or are we due for another downturn?
My first thought whenever I read these articles is: What do they mean by “real”? When I look at the gains stocks have enjoyed going back to the recent market low in October, they certainly seem real to me:

So the actual question that is being asked in these articles is: Will the market keep going up?
Now we get to the heart of the issue. The folks who are really worried about whether the stock rally is real are the ones who didn’t participate in it. They are the investors – and investment managers – who got out of the market back in the summer, or never got in it at all after bailing out in 2008-09. Those investors are terrified of buying high and enduring another downturn in the market, which would further compound their losses. They are stuck in the never-ending spiral that is market timing: Always wondering when to get out and when to get back in.
The intrepid investors who have stayed put are enjoying their double-digit gains going back to October – and triple-digit gains going back to March 2009 – and aren’t as anxious about whether the rally is “real”. They have much to show for their discipline, and they know that if the market does go down in the short term it will, sooner or later, reverse its course again. They don’t have to worry about buying high and selling low, because they don’t engage in that loser’s game.
The simple fact is that the market just gained between 20% and 30% in about five month’s time. And the bulk of those gains came in October, when the European debt crisis was in peak frenzy and things were a long way from “calm.” Folks who got out of the market just until things “calmed down” now have their wish, and they have a conundrum. While they were waiting for things to calm down, the market took off. And now they sit on the sidelines wondering what to do.
The rally is for “real”, because it “really” happened. Whether the market goes up, down or sideways from here is beside the point. The lesson is that gains happen in the stock market right when you least expect it, and you want to be sure you are there when they happen.

Is The Recent Market Volatility Really "Unprecedented'? 
November 2011
I attended a symposium in Austin, Texas recently where the esteemed finance professor, Gene Fama, addressed our group. If you aren’t familiar with Dr. Fama, he is one of the pioneers of Efficient Market research, is often referred to as “the father of modern finance,” and has been a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Economics. So, to borrow the old E.F. Hutton line, “when Dr. Fama speaks, people listen.”
After his presentation, Dr. Fama took some questions from the crowd, and his response to one of them caught my attention. When asked for his perspective about the extreme volatility that has been plaguing the financial markets since August – and, really, since 2008 – he had an interesting response.
“The volatility we have seen is not unusual from a long-term historical perspective,” Dr. Fama said. “But it is unusual compared to the volatility we became used to over the past few decades.”
This may be hard for you to believe, but it’s easy to see looking back at the historical record. While volatility in recent years has spiked, it is consistent with other times of turbulence, notably the 1930s and ‘40s (and in truth, it has been a good deal less volatile than the Depression era). This may not exactly be comforting, but it is at least informing.
“But wait!” you say. “Why do I keep reading about the ‘unprecedented volatility’ we are seeing in the market today?”
The answer is that the media isn’t interested in perspective, it is interested in drama. Financial reporters love to focus on point declines in the market, because it draws people’s attention. And when reporters get to go on air and breathlessly tell us that the Dow experienced, say, its fourth-largest point decline ever, that makes for some captive viewers.
Point declines, however, are very different from percentage declines, and percentage declines are really the only logical way to judge volatility. After all, a one-day drop of 500 points at Dow 12,000 is not nearly of the same significance as it was at Dow 2,200, which happened in October 1987. At Dow 12,000, that decline was about 4%; at Dow 2,200 it was about 23%.
In that regard, consider the following list of the 20 largest one-day percentage declines in the Dow Jones’ modern history: 

Notice anything interesting about this chart? That’s right – not one of the declines from recent weeks even made the top 20 largest percentage declines. And even at the height of the panic in 2008, only one day cracked the top 10. So I take exception with the argument that these swings in the market have been unprecedented.
This isn’t to say, however, that the recent swings haven’t been unusual. Referring back to the table, it is interesting to note that fully 50 years passed between the 1937 downturn (at #11) and “Black Monday” 1987, the mother of all one-day percentage declines that is #1 by a large margin.
Looking back at a timeline of one-day percentage swings of 3% or more in the Dow from 1928 – 2008, we can see this trend in which volatility took a long holiday during middle part of the century: So while we can’t say the market volatility we have seen in the past few years has been unprecedented, we really have to go back to the Depression era to find a time that rivaled our current market environment. This is consistent with a central reality: Financial crises lead to extreme volatility in the financial markets, and until the crisis is resolved, the volatility will likely remain. And we are in the midst of the worst financial crisis we have seen since the 1930s.
While politicians trade in rhetoric, markets deal with realities. And the reality the market sees right now is a heavily indebted developed world that can’t meet its obligations. And so, in its own heavy handed way, the market is forcing the issue by essentially voting on the policy moves that European and American governments are making to improve their balance sheets. The market is applying pressure to politicians by giving a Bronx cheer to any efforts it deems ineffective in getting our debt crisis under control, and the same thing is happening overseas in Europe. And this is serving to force our politicians to deal with things they’d just as soon kick down the road to the next crisis.
In the short- to intermediate-term, therefore, stock volatility may well be like the relative who drops by and then just keeps hanging around, wearing out his welcome. In the long run, however, issues and crises have a way of resolving themselves. As the old economic saying goes, “If something can’t continue, it won’t.”
This is where long-term investors need to be extremely careful about the dangers of, as financial writer Nick Murray refers to it, “Volatility Fatigue.” After years of enduring wild swings in the market, it can be easy for investors to throw in the towel and flee the market “until things calm down.” But the stock market is a leading economic indicator, and things turn decisively upward in the market long before crises resolve themselves.
We saw this coming out of the bear market lows in March 2009, and no doubt we’ll see it again as events in the developed world resolve themselves in the years ahead. Alas, just as we saw two years ago, most of the investing public will be on the sidelines when it happens.

Muni Bond Mayhem, Or Just Another Version of "A Nightmare on Main Street"? 
February 2011
One of the most painful things about my line of work is watching the investing public commit one grievous mistake after another and being unable to do anything about it. I can help my clients avoid the emotional, reactionary missteps that are so tempting in times of turmoil, but there is nothing I can do for the masses who seem predestined (hey, I’m a good Presbyterian) to destroy themselves in every conceivable market cycle. No matter what the situation, the majority of investors do the wrong thing every time. It’s like being forced to watch a horror movie in slow motion, over and over and over again…
So, as I look at the recent happenings in the municipal bond market, all I can think is: “Here comes A Nightmare on Main Street, Part 214.”
First, for some context, here is a brief review of the average American investor (we’ll call him “John Q. Public”) and his experience over the past 15 years:
• In the late 1990s, John Q. Public loaded up on technology stocks, especially “dot-com” stocks. When the bubble burst in the spring of 2000, he lost about 80% of his investable assets.

• After the tech bubble burst, Mr. Public took whatever funds he had left and fled to the “safety” of cash investments. And he did indeed feel safe there for awhile, until the market suddenly took off in the spring of 2003, gaining 50% in 12 months while he earned 1% in money-market funds.

• In the mid-2000s, Mr. Public then tiptoed back into the risk pool, but he was still wary of stocks from his frightening experience in the 2000-03 bear market. So he split the difference and went mostly into bonds, just in time for interest rates to go up, which caused his bonds to fall in value. He lost money here, too.

• With the stock market back to record highs by 2007, John Q. Public realized what a fool he had been. The recovery was complete and all was safe with stocks! And, oh, what returns those financial and real estate stocks had delivered! He loaded up on rock-solid banks and financial service companies. Then the subprime financial crisis hit. The Dow fell nearly 60% over the next two years, and many financial stocks went under entirely. By early 2009, Mr. Public was once again completely fed up with “losing money in stocks” and went back to cash, locking in catastrophic losses. 

• Right on cue, the market enjoyed its strongest gain in 80 years. From its March 2009 low, the Dow gained 90% in 18 months, but Mr. Public missed it. By late 2009 – fed up with making literally nothing in cash – John Q. Public went, not to those risky old stocks, but back to bonds. Safe, secure bonds. Except the safe, secure bonds weren’t delivering returns much higher than cash. So Mr. Public went searching for “yield”, moving farther out on the yield curve and lower down in credit quality. He invested in the supposed safety of municipal bonds, but opted for the higher-yielding, longer-term variety – never stopping to wonder why those bonds were producing such high yields in a low interest-rate environment.
And that brings us, inevitably, to today’s “muni bond crisis” that has been heavily touted in the headlines. Last fall, famed analyst Meredith Whitney issued a dire forecast for municipal bonds, and small investors panicked en masse. Municipal bond funds were swamped with redemption requests, forcing many of the funds to dump their bonds on the market at discounted prices to raise cash. That created a huge glut of bonds on the open market, and prices dropped accordingly.
Most experts believe that the muni bond market overall remains extremely secure. In a report last month, ratings agency Standard & Poors noted, “We believe the crises that many state and local administrators find themselves in are policy crises, rather than questions of governments' continued ability to exist and function… (The crises) are more about tough decisions than potential defaults." (See: Standard & Poor's, U.S. States and Municipalities Face Crises More of Policy Than Debt.)
S&P went on to say in the report that, for significant defaults to occur, state and local governments would have to face revenue declines roughly double to what they were during the Great Depression – an unlikely scenario to say the least.
Unfortunately, small investors have not grasped this reality and are selling muni bonds without regard to risk or return. That has forced yields higher because new issues coming to market must be competitive with the existing issues being sold at fire-sale prices on the secondary market. And that, in turn, has sent prices lower for all existing muni bonds.
What is lost on most investors is that municipal bonds come in almost as many flavors as Baskin Robbins’ ice cream. Consider this: While there are only about 8,500 publicly traded stocks in the U.S., there are millions of municipal bond issues in a wide variety of structures. There are general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, pre-refunded bonds, insured bonds, taxable muni bonds, escrowed-to-maturity bonds, and many others. The type of bond, the maturity of the bond, and the credit worthiness of the issuing municipality all play heavily into the risk and return characteristics of the bond.
Not surprisingly, therefore, the selloff in the muni market has not impacted all bond prices the same. Muni bonds of high credit quality, and with short- to intermediate-term maturities, have not been much impacted by the so-called crisis. Many of these are general obligation bonds, backed by the taxing authority of the municipality and insured against default. Some even have “pre-refunded” features in which Treasury Bills have been escrowed to ensure that the principal is there to be repaid when due.
The spread in performance between these types of bonds and the lesser quality, longer term bonds that enticed small investors with their higher yields has been eye-popping. For example, while the Pimco High Yield Muni Bond fund declined a whopping 9% from mid-November to mid-January, the DFA Short-Term Muni Bond fund only declined about 1%.
Unfortunately, most individual investors once again succumbed to return chasing and followed their quest for yield out to the edges of the yield curve, ending up in high-yield funds that they have now sold for 10% losses, or, worse individual issues like 30-year munis that have sold for losses of 20% to 30%. It has been a jarring realization for these folks that “safe and secure” bonds can be as volatile as stocks – perhaps even more so – if you are in the wrong bonds at the wrong time.
Alas, all of this pain could have been avoided if the investing public had subscribed to our philosophy about fixed income at Capital Directions: “Bonds are a risk-reducer – not a return-juicer.”

About Our Firm
Capital Directions has grown to be one of the leading fee-only, Registered Investment Advisors in the Southeast through one vision: helping our clients succeed.
We were founded with that focus in 1985. As we helped our individual clients achieve their most important financial goals, they also asked for our help with their company retirement plans and we developed an expertise in that area.
Our clients’ involvement with foundations and endowments also led us to extensive  experience managing assets for those institutions.
By the late-1990’s, our focus on helping our clients succeed expanded into the creation of a program to help CPAs deliver wealth management and retirement plan solutions to their clients.
Today, we help a broad range of clients succeed through three services:
•	Wealth Management – Providing financial leadership for successful professionals and their families.
•	Retirement Plans – A better way to do the 401(k).
•	Advisor Services – Helping CPAs deliver exceptional wealth management and retirement plan solutions.
Each service is grounded in the vision of helping our clients succeed by understanding their goals and the values that drive those goals; then creating customized strategies to achieve those goals.
Contact us to learn how we can help you succeed.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

There are so many different fee structures and specialties, knowing how to sort through your options is difficult. You trust your financial advisor with your money, so it is important to make the best possible decision.How to Choose a Financial AdvisorWhen you start your search for a financial advisor, you need to find someone whose skills matches your needs. That means you need to recognize what you are looking for before you start looking.Here are some common needs from financial advisors: Cash flow management Budgeting Retirement planning Investing Paying for children's education No financial advisor is perfect for every need, which is why it is so important to understand your needs before hiring anyone.How to Find a Financial AdvisorYour first step in choosing a financial advisor after examining your needs is to find potential advisors. You will want someone who is easy to reach, and ideally not too far from your home or office so it is easy to get to a meeting if needed.There are over 750,000 registered financial advisors in the United States. SmartAsset's financial advisor search tool can help you navigate to the best advisor for your needs. Answer questions about where you live, your plans for retirement, and other financial priorities. In just a few minutes, you'll be all set and SmartAsset will have an advisor contact you.Questions to Ask a Financial AdvisorOnce you have found a few advisors, you should interview them to decide who is the best fit for your needs. Here are some example questions to ask to make sure you end up with the right advisor.How many years of experience do you have as a professional financial advisor? Do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money? It is best to find someone with plenty of experience. Advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the storm.What is your strongest focus area in financial planning? Some advisors are experts in retirement. Others have expertise in estates and trusts. Others still are best suited to help you pay for your child's education. Some financial advisors focus on people who are self-employed. Be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need, not what someone else needs.What is your budgeting philosophy? Every family's budget is unique. Budgets can be very detailed or more general. Some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals, others take a more balanced approach. Find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yours.How are you compensated? Some financial advisors are “fee only.” This means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services. Many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio. The worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds. In this case, a conflict of interest exists. The advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needs.How much does it cost to work with you? After learning how they are paid, make sure you know how much you will pay. No one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meeting.Are you a fiduciary? Fiduciary means putting your needs first. Many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first, even if it means they earn less money. However, many financial advisors are not fiduciaries, and can give you advice that is not in your best interest.Do you own the same investments you'll suggest to me? Do they put their money where their mouth is? Advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flag.How have your client's portfolios performed? How did you handle their portfolios during the Great Recession in 2008? These questions get to the root of their performance. If the advisor does not readily share this information, they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past.  Make Sure Your Financial Advisor is LicensedFinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed. The most common and important license for a financial advisor is the CFP, or Certified Financial Planner. CFPs are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topics.Series 7 and Series 63 licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks, bonds, and other investments on your behalf. Make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an up-to-date license.Beware of Lofty PromisesIf an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the 2016 Presidential Campaign, proceed with caution. Promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done. Further, no advisor can promise that they will beat the market.At the end of the day, many financial advisors have similar skills. They use comparable tools and reports to stay up-to-date on the markets and help find the best investments for you. If any advisor gives you a bad vibe, don't feel bad looking elsewhere.Choose an Advisor You Can TrustAfter you have met with a few advisors, it is time to make your decision. Asking about licenses, fees, and past performance is black and white. There are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjective.Do you like the person? Do you trust them? Would you trust them with your daughter's education fund? Your retirement?If you have been able to limit your list down to your final few, it is time to trust your gut. It is important to have an advisor you like, trust, and enjoy interacting with. Your money is too important to put in the hands of someone you don't trust. Pick and advisor who feels like a partner who will stand beside you through your financial journey. If you do, you'll be on track for a great financial future.If you're ready to start, answer a few questions in SmartAsset's financial advisor selection tool and you'll be contacted by a few advisors in your area to choose from.

COMMENTARY


Understanding Behavioral Finance Can Give You the Edge

Financial and Tax-Related Identity Theft - Part Two

 As I discussed in Part 1 of this article, identity theft is now the most common consumer complaint—with over 10 million total identity theft cases per year. It not only has tarnished the reputations of Fortune 500 brands such as Anthem, Target and Home Depot, but it also has infiltrated security-conscious
government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service.

Financial and Tax-Related Identity Theft - Part One

With the 2015 revelation that the IRS data breach involved over 330,000 taxpayer records (the IRS originally reported only 104,000 records were compromised), and more breaches followed, the IRS is finally under sufficient pressure to implement some formal procedures to assist taxpayers who have experienced a governmental, corporate or other data breach.
