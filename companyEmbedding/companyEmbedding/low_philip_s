Ultra-low power solutions

 

In order to meet user demands and expectations, smart battery-powered products need to have a maximum autonomous lifetime. For this, the product must use as little power as possible. But how to achieve that? Outstanding low-power design can’t be solved on component level – you have to consider the complete system and all functions to ensure a maximum operating lifetime on a single battery charge. Our ultra-low power solutions service helps you do so.
Your benefit
In the world of digital connected products & systems, ultra-low power solutions require the ultimate balancing act. There are a great many factors that can interact and influence power consumption at – and even across – different levels in the system, such as…

Are there functions which could better be located outside a connected product – for instance, in the cloud – to help extend the maximum operating life?
Can functions possibly be combined to reduce power consumption – and are there suitable components for that?
How can I maximize processing speed, wireless links and other areas of product performance in the face of low-power requirements?

The answers to power-related questions are not always obvious, and can be particularly complex. For instance, in some cases, the most efficient solution could involve using more – rather than fewer – components. By making use of broad insight into all factors that influence power consumption, our experts can determine the optimal power-performance equilibrium for your product. If desired, this can also include an operational prototype that demonstrates the targeted operational lifetime.
Have our ultra-low power experts contact you Discuss your challenge with our business development manager
We deliver
Philips Innovation Service follows various phases in developing ultra-low power solutions for wearables and other products. Our experts can also provide individual, one-off support at each one:

System architecture analysis
Analyzing the overall system architecture of the product. In what ways does it support – or not support – ultra-low power operation? After identifying changes that would be advantageous, we outline the architectural choices and their justification in a document for discussion.
Function analysis
Analyzing the various product functions (power aspects of the battery/mains, function power management, low-power connectivity, etc.), specifying their requirements, and selecting possibly suitable alternative components. Here, we often collaborate with component suppliers to identify the ‘ultra-low power potential’ limits. We may also investigate energy harvesting options.
Power budgeting
Determining the most optimal power-consumption configuration (including desired states, i.e. sleep vs awake, over time) based on all available data of the different components – while also best fulfilling all other product requirements.
Prototyping
Demonstrating the validity of the design, if desired, by making a prototype, which can also be a first step in the product development phase..

Our approach
To achieve the best ultra-low power design possible, it must be approached from a system point of view. We first analyze system architecture to identify how we can maximize ultra-low power potential. After making any necessary adaptations, we then do the same for functions and components. Then, we make one or more power budgets to analyze different configurations. All of these steps are typically done in a number of iterations. Eventually, we propose an optimal configuration that can be operationally demonstrated in a prototype.

UV Purification

 
Clean drinking water is essential to our health and wellbeing. Yet in developing nations all over the world, and even in western countries, many public water supplies get contaminated with harmful microorganisms
 
Philips UV lamp systems have the power to deactivate these microorganisms. Over the past 15 years, we’ve partnered with purification experts to create technology that will give everyone access to clean water and air.
 
Drinkable water, in an instant
Philips InstantTrust is a complete water disinfection solution. It provides instantly clean water, regardless of the liquid’s temperature, and is optimized for Point-of-Use applications. UV lamps like these are applied in many applications, including industrial and municipal water treatment, swimming pools, Jacuzzis and fish ponds.
 
UV lamps can help medical environments too. Infections originating in hospitals affect up to 10% of patients during their stay. Approximately 20% of these infections are transmitted via contaminated surfaces and air. Disinfection systems incorporating Philips UVC lamps have the power to disinfect air and surfaces.

Product family information


 Following the successful introduction of the CoreLine High-bay in 2013, the upgrade to a new generation further improves the total cost of ownership and provides optionally DALI dimming for even further savings. Designed as a replacement for HPI 250/400 W luminaires, CoreLine High-bay G3 offers customers all the benefits of LED lighting – fresh light quality, longer service lifetime, reduced energy consumption and less maintenance – from a trusted manufacturer. At the same time, it delivers clear benefits for the installer too. The luminaire can be installed on the existing grid. Electrical connection is straightforward: there is no need to open the luminaire for installation or servicing. And being smaller and lighter than conventional luminaires, it is very easy to handle.





































































Benefits






Simple point-to-point replacement for 250 and 400 W HPI high-bay luminaires





Energy savings up to 69%









Significant reduction in maintenance

Product family information


 With the introduction of the GentleSpace LED luminaire in 2011, Philips achieved a breakthrough in high-bay lighting, offering a huge reduction in power consumption, a long service life and an innovative design. Now, with GentleSpace gen2, Philips continues to improve even further: an improved total cost of ownership, even in extreme conditions with the the GS-2 Xtreme version, which can be used up to +60 °C or 100,000 hrs of lifetime (L80), both ensured by an integrated over-heat protection. In addition, a wide variety of options – e.g. optics, coatings, mounting possibilities, cover materials and suitable for explosive zones 2/22 – are available to ensure an ideal solution for your application. Additionally, the GentleSpace gen2 can be equipped for use in a central emergency grid (PSED).















































































Benefits






Extremely favorable total cost of ownership

                                        Reconstruction technology
                                



IMR sets a new direction in CT image quality with industry-leading low-contrast resolution and virtually noise*-free images. Innovations in hardware and the reconstruction algorithm result in a reconstruction speed – less than three minutes for the majority of reference protocols – that allows model-based benefits to be achieved in even the most demanding applications.

  Industry-leading low-contrast resolution

                                IMR provides significant improvements in low contrast detectability, giving you confidence through enhanced visualization of fine detail and improved accuracy in detecting small, subtle structures. This outstanding improvement helps strengthen the position of CT as the backbone of radiology.
                            








  Lower dose with higher image quality

                                You can achieve 60 - 80% lower dose, and at the same time, improve low-contrast detectability by 43 - 80% and lower image noise by 70 - 83%, relative to standard (FBP) reconstruction.*
                            








  Virtually noise-free images

                                Noise and artifacts limit visualization of critical structural information. IMR breaks the strong linkage between noise and dose, allowing for virtually noise-free** images through 73% to 90% noise reduction, helping reveal information previously hidden in noise.
                            








  First knowledge-based IR for Cardiac CTA

                                IMR Platinum is the first knowledge-based solution to overcome the motion sensitivity associated with traditional model-based solutions. This allows it to be used in highly advanced acquisitions, such as cardiac CTA.

* In clinical practice, the use of IMR may reduce CT patient dose depending on the clinical task, patient size, anatomical location, and clinical practice. A consultation with a radiologist and a physicist should be made to determine the appropriate dose to obtain diagnostic image quality for the particular clinical task. Low-contrast detectability and noise were assessed using Reference Body Protocol comparing IMR to FBP; measured on 0.8 mm slices, tested on the MITA CT IQ Phantom (CCT183, The Phantom Laboratory), using human observers.
** Image noise as defined by IEC standard 61223-3-5. Image noise was assessed using reference body protocol, on a phantom. Data on file.

Question
What are the preparation times and temperature settings for different foods?
Answer
The average preparation times of several other ingredients can be found in the table below. 
The settings mentioned are just indications. These settings may be adapted depending on the origin, size and shape of the ingredients: 

Smaller and fresh ingredients need a slightly shorter preparation time
Less ingredients need a shorter preparation time
Larger and frozen ingredients need a slightly longer preparation time
More ingredients need a longer preparation time
Home-made dough needs a longer preparation time than pre-made dough


Tip: More information and tips on recipes that can be prepared in the airfryer are available on Philips’ My Kitchen website.
        www.kitchen.philips.com


Timetable:
 
 
Note: Add 3 minutes to the preparation time when you start frying while the airfryer is still cold.

Benefits of LED Lighting
LED light bulbs can save you money not only because they are roughly 80% more energy efficient than other bulbs, they also produce far less heat than metal halides, CFLs, and incandescent light bulbs. Upgrading to LED lighting means you won’t spend your summer months cooling down rooms that your light bulbs are busy heating up. While originally a cooler blue tone than incandescent bulbs, LEDs now come in daylight and warm white color temperatures so you can more easily replace your existing bulbs without altering the color of your room. Visit our Lighting Guide to see what difference color temperature makes. LED lighting also offers a superior color rendering index (CRI), so you can see the colors of your artwork or makeup more accurately.
LED replacement bulbs are durable and ecologically friendly. Did you know you can recycle LED bulbs and reduce your carbon footprint up to one third? LEDs outlast the competition, staying bright for up to 11 years of continuous operation. This means less time climbing ladders trying to replace those hard to reach bulbs in vaulted ceilings. 
 LEDs are one of today’s most promising technologies.

No mercury, making them a cleaner alternative to fluorescent and CFL lamps.
The lowest energy consumption of any lighting product to date.
Light quality equal or superior to traditional lighting products.
Life that is 20 times than some traditional lighting products.



LEDs or Fluorescents - Which is More Efficient?


LED light bulbs for the win! When it comes to purchasing energy-efficient lighting, LEDs surpass CFLs by a wide margin. LEDs are instant-start with no warmup time needed. They work well in cold weather, and are substantially more durable since manufactured out of plastic instead of glass. From standard bulbs to fluorescent tubes, LEDs can replicate the same lighting conditions found in fluorescents while lasting longer and using less energy. As an added bonus, all LEDs are RoHS compliant and do not use mercury, a claim that can't be made by fluorescent bulbs.

LED Lighting Options




Standard Shape A19
 - Designed to give the appearance and pattern of a standard incandescent bulb. Standard and A-shape LED bulbs fit the same sockets and fixtures as your current household lights.



3-Way LED
 - A three-way bulb is a light bulb that has two brightness settings instead of the standard on or off. If your lamp or fixture says it requires a three-way bulb, this is the category for you.



Vintage LED Bulbs
- Vintage reproduction bulbs are now available with LED filament. They have a warm orange glow with lower light levels to mimic the style of a vintage bulb on a dimmer as it transitions from yellow to orange. These
Edison style and
Victorian style bulbs make great collector items. Order yours today to make your own steampunk lighting.



Wet Location LED Bulbs
 - A wet location UL rating means these LED light bulbs can be used in humid indoor areas or outdoors where water may drop or flow against the bulb or fixture.



Decorative LED Bulbs
 - Browse
LED globe lights ranging from 3 in. to 1.5 in. diameters or find LED replacement bulbs for your
chandelier light bulbs. The long life of LEDs mean less time on the ladder changing burnt out bulbs. Many LED chandelier lights are dimmer switch compatible and come in a range of color temperature so you can still enjoy the ambiance of traditional bulbs but the energy savings of LEDs.



LED Tubes
 - LED tubes are the emerging standard for commercial and household lighting. Ranging in size from T5 to T12 and a variety of color temperatures, these LED tubes are an easy way to upgrade to energy efficient lighting. Some of them work with or without an existing ballast, making the transition to LED lighting easier than ever. These LED tubes emit the same amount of light as fluorescent T8s, while using a fraction of the power and lasting up to three times longer. LED tubes are especially effective in cold areas like refrigeration lockers where fluorescent tubes are less efficient at producing light.



LED Tape Lights
 - For accents, alcove, and backlighting, LED tape light is a fantastic choice. More flexible than rope light and bright enough for accent illumination, a strip of LED tape light can bring any place to life. There are countless uses and applications for this easily installed new light source.



Shatter Resistant LED Bulbs
 - Dipped in a special coating, these bulbs may still break if dropped, but they won’t shatter into pieces and fly across your floor. We recommend not dropping them, but if you do, these make cleanup quite a bit easier.



LED Night Lights
 - Keep the monsters away with LED night lights. Motion activated, and battery powered, these LED bulbs will light the way to the bathroom or give reassurance that nothing is lurking under the bed when your child needs to reach for a dropped retainer or teddy bear. Mounted using tape or screws, light only the area you need without waking sleeping babies.



Reflectors
 - From the powerful flood and spot lights, to home bound recessed or track lights, reflectors find excellent use indoors or out. LED reflector lamps can provide the same brilliance for less energy and will create far less heat than an incandescent or halogen lamp. As a bonus, they have a higher CRI than fluorescent reflectors for better colors.


Shop by Brand - Shop top brands for LED light bulbs including
Cree and
Soraa. Watch installation videos for help retrofitting an existing structure or give us a call to talk to a licensed electrician.



Things to Consider When Buying LED Lighting




Equivalent Wattage - While lumens are the new standard, it helps to have an easily recognizable guide. Comparing an LED bulb to an incandescent will give you a rough estimate of just how well it will light a room. As a very ballpark figure for LED wattages, 1/4 or 1/5 the incandescent wattage value is usually close to what you need.


Lumens - Lumens directly measure just how much light the bulb gives out in total. On average, a 60-watt incandescent shines at 800 lumens, with roughly 50-100 lumens of difference above or below. The variance depends on manufacturer and age of the lamp. LEDs are directly rated for their max lumen rating and last much longer without dimming of the bulb.


Color Temperature - Your guide to how the light itself will look. Lower values are warmer, with 2700-3000K being a more incandescent "warm white" while higher temperatures like 5000K will deliver a very harsh "stark white" light. Our  Lighting Guide lets you select a color temperature and see how it transforms a kitchen.
        

Driver Content - Because of their design, LEDs do not typically run on AC voltage.  Many LEDs require some form of 
            driver to convert the voltage from AC to DC for proper operation.  The majority of socket-based LED lamps are self-driven, but you should always check before buying to make sure that you buy both an LED and a 
            driver
             at the same time if it isn't self-driven.

Selecting the Right Bulb
Incandescent
Incandescent bulbs, which provide most home lighting, are used in products from nightlights to floodlights. The most common incandescent is a pear-shaped (A19) bulb with a medium-sized screw-type base. Incandescent lights use electricity to heat a filament until it glows white hot, producing light. About 90 percent of the electricity used by incandescent bulbs is lost as heat. This style typically burns for 750 to 10,000 hours.
Halogen
Halogen bulbs contain a small capsule filled with Halogen gas, which emits a bright white light. Long life and full spectrum Halogen bulbs use less energy and last longer than standard incandescent bulbs of the same wattage. The life of these bulbs is around 2,000 to 10,000 hours or two to five years.
Linear Fluorescent
Linear fluorescent bulbs, also known as fluorescent tubes, are more energy efficient than incandescents or halogens because they don't produce much heat. These are the thin, long tube lights often found in kitchens for under-cabinet lighting, or in garages, workshops, and basements. The tubes can last from 10,000 to 44,000 hours—10 to 40 times longer than incandescent lights. Fluorescent bulbs require and are powered by fluorescent ballasts.
Compact Fluorescent
Compact fluorescents, also known as CFLs, provide as much light as regular incandescent bulbs while using just one-fourth of the energy. For example, a 15-watt compact fluorescent light bulb yields the same amount of light as a 60-watt incandescent bulb. Compact fluorescent bulbs last about 10,000 hours—10 times longer than incandescent bulbs.
High Intensity Discharge
High intensity discharge, or HID, bulbs include metal halide, high pressure sodium, and mercury vapor lights. As their name implies, HID bulbs emit a very large amount of light using relatively little power. They are a mainstay of parking lot, street, and warehouse lighting. Like fluorescent bulbs, HID bulbs also require a ballast.
Stage and Studio
Stage bulbs and photography lights are specialized, high output lights used in the entertainment industry as well as in just about any stage or photography studio. Traditionally, these bulbs have used Halogen or HID technology, though LED stage lights are becoming more common.
Miniature Indicator
Miniature indicator bulbs are found in everything from heavy machinery to instrument panels. Though we carry hundreds of miniature bulbs, you can find the replacement you need by identifying the numeric code stamped on the base of your old bulb.
Automotive
Automotive bulbs include everything from Halogen headlight capsules to the tiny incandescent bulbs that go in makeup mirrors and everything in between. No matter the make or model of your car, we have the bulb that fits.

LED Troffers
We carry 2x4, 2x2, and 1x4 LED troffers in 3,500K to 5,000K color temperatures. These troffers are great for schools, hospitals and commercial office spaces because they provide clean, even illumination with energy savings.

Our suspended fluorescent fixtures are suitable for surface or pendant mounting. Available in 2, 3, 4, and 6 lamp options.
Security Lighting
We sell battery-powered and LED security lighting. Our battery-powered systems, quartz bullet flood lights and motion sensors can keep your property safe.
High Bay FixturesHigh bay fixtures are ideal in commercial and industrial spaces. Choose from compact fluorescent, metal halide/pulse-start, and LED fixtures that are temporary, non-ballasted, or made from spun aluminum.
Fluorescent Strip FixturesFluorescent strip fixtures are suitable for general or task lighting and are easily mounted to the wall or ceiling. Available in 1 to 4 lamp fixtures.

When shopping for bulbs, you’re probably accustomed to looking for watts as an indication of how bright the bulb will be.
The brightness of LEDs, however, is determined a little differently. Contrary to common belief, wattage isn’t an indication of brightness, but a measurement of how much energy the bulb draws.
For incandescent bulbs, there is an accepted correlation between the watts drawn and the brightness, but for LEDs, watts aren’t a great predictor of how bright the bulb will be (the point, after all, is that they draw less energy.) But don’t bother doing the math - there isn’t a uniform way to convert incandescent watts to LED watts. Instead, a different form of measurement should be used: lumens.
The lumen (lm) is the real measurement of brightness provided by a light bulb, and is the number you should look for when shopping for LEDs.


Color Temperature


Shop by Color Temperature
Under 2800 (Warmest)
2800 - 3200
3200 - 3600
3600 - 4000
4000 - 4400
4800 - 5200 (Coolest)


LED lighting offers a range of color tones perfect for any application, from the soft look of an incandescent bulb to the bright white look of daylight. These color tones are called “color temperature” and their measurement is made in degrees Kelvin (K).
LEDs produce a wide range of color temperatures from 0-2900 Kelvin warmer light to 5000 Kelvin and above cool white.


Dimming LEDs
Watch out for non-dimmable LEDs.
Most dimmers, which were likely designed to work with incandescent bulbs, work by cutting off the amount of electricity sent to the bulbs. The less electricity drawn, the dimmer the light. Since there is no direct correlation between LED brightness and energy drawn, you need to ensure your LED on a dimmer switch can result in some LEDs to hum, flicker, or buzz.
If you want your LED bulb to be dimmable, you need to do one of two things: find LED bulbs compatible with traditional dimmers, or replace your current dimming switch with a leading-edge (LED-compatible) dimmer.
Shop dimmable LEDs


Enclosed Fixtures
LEDs can be used in enclosed, semi-closed or open fixtures, but you need to make sure you buy the right LED for your application.
You probably know that LED bulbs run dramatically cooler than incandescent bulbs, but that doesn’t mean they don’t produce heat. LED bulbs do get hot, but the heat is pulled away by a heat sink in the base of the bulb. From there, the heat dissipates into the air, keeping the LED bulb cool, which helps to keep its promise of a very long life.
And therein lies the problem: the bulb needs a way to dissipate the heat. If an LED bulb is placed in an enclosed housing, the heat won’t have anywhere to go, sending it right back to the bulb, sentencing it to a short life.
Consider where you’d like to place your LED bulbs. If you have fully or semi- enclosed fixtures, you need to make sure the LEDs are approved for recessed or enclosed spaces to avert any preformance issues.
Shop LEDs for recessed or enclosed spaces
