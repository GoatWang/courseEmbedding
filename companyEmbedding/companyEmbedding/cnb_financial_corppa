	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS



	This prospectus is part of a registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), using a
	shelf registration process for the delayed offering and sale of securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Under the shelf process, we may, from time to time, sell
	any of the offered securities described in this prospectus in one or more offerings. Additionally, under the shelf process, in certain circumstances, we may provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of a
	particular offering by us. We may also provide a prospectus supplement to add information to, or update or change information contained in, this prospectus.


	We have filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3, of which this prospectus is a part, under the Securities Act, with respect to
	the offered securities. This prospectus does not contain all of the information set forth in the registration statement, portions of which we have omitted as permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC. Statements contained in this prospectus
	as to the contents of any contract or other document are not necessarily complete. You should refer to the copy of each contract or document filed as an exhibit to the registration statement for a complete description.


	You should read this prospectus together with any additional information you may need to make your investment decision. You should also read
	and carefully consider the information in the documents we have referred you to in Where You Can Find More Information and Incorporation of Certain Documents by Reference below. Information incorporated by reference after the
	date of this prospectus may add, update or change information contained in this prospectus. Any information in such subsequent filings that is inconsistent with this prospectus will supersede the information in this prospectus or any earlier
	prospectus supplement.


	As used in this prospectus, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms we, us,
	our and the Company mean, collectively, CNB Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries and their predecessors. In this prospectus, we sometimes refer to the common stock and preferred stock collectively as the offered
	securities.








	WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION



	We are subject to the information requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and file
	annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. You may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may
	obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, we file many of our documents electronically with the SEC, and you may access those documents over the Internet. The SEC maintains a

	CAUTIONARY NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	This prospectus and the information incorporated by reference in it, as well as any prospectus supplement that accompanies it,
	include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to the financial condition, liquidity, results
	of operations, future performance and our business. These forward-looking statements are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
	Forward-looking statements are those that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations, estimates and intentions that are subject to
	significant risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors (some of which are beyond our control). Forward-looking statements often include the words believes, expects, anticipates,
	estimates, forecasts, intends, plans, targets, potentially, probably, projects, outlook or similar expressions or future conditional verbs
	such as may, will, should, would and could. Such known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the statements,
	include, but are not limited to, (i) changes in general business, industry or economic conditions or competition; (ii) changes in any applicable law, rule, regulation, policy, guideline or practice governing or affecting financial holding
	companies and their subsidiaries or with respect to tax or accounting principles or otherwise; (iii) adverse changes or conditions in capital and financial markets; (iv) changes in interest rates; (v) higher than expected costs or
	other difficulties related to integration of combined or merged businesses; (vi) the inability to realize expected cost savings or achieve other anticipated benefits in connection with business combinations and other acquisitions;
	(vii) changes in the quality or composition of our loan and investment portfolios; (viii) adequacy of loan loss reserves; (ix) increased competition; (x) loss of certain key officers; (xi) continued relationships with major
	customers; (xii) deposit attrition; (xiii) rapidly changing technology; (xiv) unanticipated regulatory or judicial proceedings and liabilities and other costs; (xv) changes in the cost of funds, demand for loan products or demand
	for financial services; and (xvi) other economic, competitive, governmental or technological factors affecting our operations, markets, products, services and prices. Such developments could have an adverse impact on our financial position and
	our results of operations.


	The forward-looking statements are based upon managements beliefs and assumptions. Any forward-looking
	statement made herein speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to
	publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

	national banking chartered institution. In December of 2006, County National Bank changed its name to CNB Bank (the Bank) and became a state bank chartered in Pennsylvania and subject to regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of
	Banking and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.


	We are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of
	Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In general, we are limited to owning or controlling banks and engaging in such other activities as are properly incident thereto. In addition to the Bank, we have three other subsidiaries, CNB Securities

	the central Ohio markets of Bucyrus, Cardington, Fredericktown, Mount Hope and Shiloh, as well as the markets of Worthington and Upper Arlington in the greater Columbus, Ohio area, with 8 branch locations. We continue to operate these branch
	locations as FCBank, a division of CNB Bank. In July 2016, we acquired Lake National Bank of Mentor, Ohio. We operate the two former Lake National Bank branches in Mentor, Ohio as part of the ERIEBANK division of CNB Bank. Bank on Buffalo, a
	division of CNB Bank, began operations in November 2016 with the opening of a loan production office in Buffalo, New York.

	subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to our amended and restated articles of incorporation and by-laws, as amended and restated. The description below does not contain all of the information that you might find useful or that might
	be important to you. You should refer to the provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and by-laws, as amended and restated, because they, and not the summaries, define the rights of holders of shares of our common stock. You

	General




	Our
	amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize us to issue 50,000,000 shares of stock, no par value. As of December 30, 2016, there were 14,473,482 shares of common stock issued and there were no outstanding options exercisable for
	shares of our common stock.


	Each share of our common stock has the same relative rights and is identical in all respects to each other
	share of our common stock. Our common stock is non-withdrawable capital, is not of an insurable type and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental entity.




	Voting Rights




	Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share on each matter properly submitted to shareholders for their vote, including the
	election of directors. Holders of our common stock do not have the right to cumulate their votes for the election of directors. Subject to certain exceptions, whenever any corporate action is to be taken by a vote of the shareholders, it will be
	authorized by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon. Directors receiving the highest number of votes shall be elected.




	Liquidation Rights




	The holders of our common stock, together with the holders of any class or series of stock entitled to participate with the holders of our
	common stock in the distribution of assets in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of us, whether voluntary or involuntary, will be entitled to participate equally in the distribution of any of our assets remaining after we have
	paid, or provided for the payment of, all of our debts and liabilities and after we have paid, or set aside for payment to, the holders of any class of stock having preference over the common stock in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or
	winding-up the full preferential amounts to which they are entitled.




	Dividends




	The holders of our common stock and any class or series of stock entitled to participate with the holders of our common stock are entitled to
	receive dividends declared by our board of directors out of any assets legally available for distribution. We may not pay dividends or other distributions unless we have paid, declared or set aside all accumulated dividends and any sinking fund,
	retirement fund or other retirement payments on any class of stock having preference as to payments of dividends over our common stock. As a holding company, our ability to pay distributions is affected by the ability of our subsidiaries to pay
	dividends. The ability of our bank subsidiary, and our ability, to pay dividends in the future is, and could in the future be further, influenced by bank regulatory requirements and capital guidelines.




	Miscellaneous




	The
	holders of our common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights for any shares that may be issued. Our common stock is not subject to additional calls or assessments, and all shares of our common stock currently outstanding are fully paid and
	nonassessable. All shares of common stock offered pursuant to a prospectus supplement, or issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of any convertible securities, will, when issued, be fully paid and nonassessable, which means that the full
	purchase price of the shares will have been paid and the holders of the shares will not be assessed any additional monies for the shares.




	Certain Important Charter Provisions




	Our by-laws, as amended and restated, provide for the division of our board of directors into three classes of directors, each class as nearly
	as equal as possible, with each serving staggered terms. Any amendment to our by-laws must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon and, if any shareholders are entitled to vote
	thereon as a class, upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote as a class. Additionally, our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that the affirmative vote of at least
	66% of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote is required to effect a merger or consolidation of the Company into another company that is not a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

	DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK



	The following description is a general summary of the terms of the preferred stock which we may issue. The description below and in any
	prospectus supplement does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to our amended and restated articles of incorporation and the applicable certificate of designations designating the terms of the
	related series of preferred stock and our by-laws, as amended and restated, each of which we will make available upon request. The descriptions herein and in the applicable prospectus supplement do not contain all of the information that you may
	find useful or that may be important to you. You should refer to the provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation, the applicable certificate of designations and our by-laws, as amended and restated, because they, and not the
	summaries, define your rights as holders of shares of our preferred stock.




	General




	We are authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of stock, no par value. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation, subject to limitations
	prescribed in such articles and subject to limitations prescribed by Pennsylvania law, authorize the board of directors, from time to time by resolution and without further shareholder action, to provide for the issuance of shares of preferred
	stock, in one or more series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and other rights of the shares and to fix the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof. As a result of its broad discretion with respect to the creation and
	issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval, the board of directors could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock and, by issuing shares of preferred stock with certain voting, conversion and/or redemption
	rights, could discourage any attempt to obtain control of us.

	Table of Contents





	Ranking




	Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the preferred stock will, with respect to distribution rights and rights
	upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, rank:


	 




	 


	


	 


	senior to all classes or series of our common stock and to all equity securities the terms of which specifically provide that the equity securities rank junior to the preferred stock being offered;




	 




	 


	


	 


	equally with all equity securities issued by us other than those referred to in the first and last bullet points of this subheading; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	junior to all equity securities issued by us the terms of which specifically provide that the equity securities rank senior to the preferred stock being offered.




	For purposes of this subheading, the term equity securities does not include convertible debt securities.




	Distributions




	Holders of the preferred stock of each series will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors, out of our
	assets legally available for payment to shareholders, cash distributions, or distributions in kind or in other property if expressly permitted and described in the applicable prospectus supplement, at the rates and on the dates as we will set forth
	in the applicable prospectus supplement. We will pay each distribution to holders of record as they appear on our stock transfer books on the record dates determined by our board of directors.


	Distributions on any class or series of preferred stock, if cumulative, will be cumulative from and after the date set forth in the applicable
	prospectus supplement. If our board of directors fails to declare a distribution payable on a distribution payment date on any class or series of preferred stock for which distributions are non-cumulative, then the holders of that class or series of
	preferred stock will have no right to receive a distribution in respect of the distribution period ending on that distribution payment date, and we will have no obligation to pay the distribution accumulated for that period, whether or not
	distributions on that series are declared payable on any future distribution payment date.


	If any shares of the preferred stock of any
	class or series are outstanding, no full dividends will be declared or paid or set apart for payment on our preferred stock of any other class or series ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to the preferred stock of the class or series
	for any period unless all required dividends are paid. The phrase all required dividends are paid when used in this prospectus with respect to class or series of preferred stock means that:


	 




	 


	


	 


	if the class or series of preferred stock has a cumulative dividend, full cumulative dividends on the preferred stock of the class or series have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum
	sufficient for the payment is set apart for payment for all past dividend periods and the then current dividend period; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	if the class or series of preferred stock does not have a cumulative dividend, full dividends on the preferred stock of the class or series have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum
	sufficient for the payment is set apart for the payment for the then current dividend period.




	When dividends are not paid
	in full, or a sum sufficient for the full payment is not so set apart, upon the shares of preferred stock of any class or series and the shares of any other class or series of preferred stock ranking equally as to dividends with the preferred stock
	of the class or series, all dividends declared upon shares of preferred stock of the class or series and any other class or series of preferred stock ranking equally as to dividends with the preferred stock will be declared equally so that the
	amount of dividends declared per share on the preferred stock of the class or series and the other class or series of preferred stock will in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued and unpaid dividends per share on the shares of
	preferred stock of the class or series, which will not include any accumulation in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if the preferred stock does not have cumulative dividend, and the other class or series of preferred stock bear
	to each other. No interest or sum of money in lieu of interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on preferred stock of the class or series which may be in arrears.


	Except as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, unless all required dividends are paid, no dividends, other than in common stock or
	other stock ranking junior to the preferred stock of the class or series as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of us, will be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution will be declared or made upon the
	common stock or any of our other stock ranking junior or equally with the preferred stock of the class or series as to dividends or upon liquidation, nor will any common stock or any of our other capital stock ranking junior to or equally with
	preferred stock of the class or series as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of us be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration, or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the
	redemption of any shares of any stock, by us except by conversion into or exchange for our other stock ranking junior to the preferred stock of the class or series as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of us.


	 


	11






	Table of Contents



	Any dividend payment made on shares of a class or series of preferred stock will first be
	credited against the earliest accrued but unpaid dividend due with respect to shares of the class or series which remains payable.




	Redemption




	If so
	provided in the applicable prospectus supplement, the preferred stock will be subject to mandatory redemption or redemption at our option, in whole or in part, in each case upon the terms, at the times and at the redemption prices set forth in the
	prospectus supplement.


	The prospectus supplement relating to a class or series of preferred stock that is subject to mandatory redemption
	will specify the number of shares of the preferred stock that will be redeemed by us in each year commencing after a date to be specified, at a redemption price per share to be specified, together with an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid
	dividends thereon, which will not, if the preferred stock does not have a cumulative dividend, include an accumulation in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividends periods, to the date of redemption. The redemption price may be payable in cash
	or other property, as specified in the applicable prospectus supplement. If the redemption price for preferred stock of any series is payable only from the net proceeds of the issuance of our stock, the terms of the preferred stock may provide that,
	if no stock will have been issued or to the extent the net proceeds from any issuance are insufficient to pay in full the aggregate redemption price then due, the preferred stock will automatically and mandatorily be converted into shares of our
	applicable stock pursuant to conversion provisions specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.


	Notwithstanding the foregoing,
	unless provided otherwise for any class or series of preferred stock, unless all required dividends are paid:


	 




	 


	


	 


	no shares of the applicable class or series of preferred stock will be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of preferred stock of the class or series are simultaneously redeemed; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	we will not purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any shares of the applicable class or series of preferred stock, except by conversion into or exchange for our stock ranking junior to the preferred stock
	of the class or series as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of us;




	provided, however, that the above
	restrictions will not prevent the purchase or acquisition of shares of preferred stock of the class or series pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of preferred stock of the class or
	series.




	Liquidation Preference




	Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, then, before any distribution or payment will be made
	to the holders of any common stock or any other class or series of shares of our capital stock ranking junior to the preferred stock in the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, the holders of each
	series or class of preferred stock will be entitled to receive out of our assets legally available for distribution to shareholders liquidating distributions in the amount of the liquidation preference set forth in the applicable prospectus
	supplement, plus an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid distributions. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of shares of preferred stock will have no right or claim to any
	of our remaining assets. If, upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, our available assets are insufficient to pay the amount of the liquidating distributions on all outstanding shares of preferred stock and the
	corresponding amounts payable on all shares of other classes or series of shares of our capital stock ranking equally with the preferred stock in the distribution of assets, then the holders of the preferred stock and all other classes or series of
	shares of capital stock will share ratably in any distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.


	If liquidating distributions will have been made in full to all holders of preferred stock, our remaining assets will be distributed among the
	holders of any other classes or series of shares of capital stock ranking junior to the preferred stock upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, according to their respective rights and preferences and in each case according to their respective
	number of shares.


	For those purposes, the consolidation or merger of us with or into any other corporation, trust or entity, or the sale,
	lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of our property or business, will not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs.




	Voting Rights




	Holders of preferred stock will not have any voting rights, except as set forth below or as otherwise from time to time required by law, or as
	otherwise provided in the articles of amendment or the resolutions establishing such series and as indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement.

	Conversion Rights




	The terms and conditions, if any, upon which any class or series of preferred stock are convertible into or exchangeable for our other
	securities or rights or those of other issuers, including, without limitation, common stock, debt securities, trust preferred securities or another series of preferred stock, or any combination of the foregoing, will be set forth in the applicable
	prospectus supplement relating to the preferred stock. The terms will include the name of the issuer of the other securities or rights and the number or principal amount of the securities or rights into which the shares of preferred stock are
	convertible or exchangeable, the conversion or exchange price or rate or the manner of calculating the price, the conversion or exchange date(s) or period(s), provisions as to whether conversion or exchange will be at the option of the holders of
	the preferred stock or at our or other issuers option, the events requiring an adjustment of the conversion or exchange price or rate and provisions affecting conversion or exchange in the event of the redemption of the series of preferred
	stock.

	We may also sell the securities offered by
	this prospectus in at the market offerings within the meaning of Rule 415(a)(4) of the Securities Act, to or through a distribution agent or market maker, or into an existing trading market, on an exchange or otherwise.


	The prospectus supplement related to a particular offering will set forth the terms of the offering and the method of distribution and will
	identify any firms acting as underwriters, dealers or agents in connection with the offering, including:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the name or names of any underwriters, dealers or agents;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the purchase price of the securities and the proceeds to us from the sale;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any over-allotment options under which the underwriters may purchase additional securities from us;




	 




	 


	


	 


	any underwriting discounts and other items constituting compensation to underwriters, dealers or agents;

	


	 


	any securities exchange or market on which the securities offered in the prospectus supplement may be listed.




	Only those underwriters identified in such prospectus supplement are deemed to be underwriters in connection with the securities offered in
	the prospectus supplement. Any underwritten offering may be on a best efforts or a firm commitment basis.


	The distribution of the
	securities may be effected from time to time in one or more transactions at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at prices determined as the applicable prospectus supplement specifies.
	The securities may be sold through a rights offering, forward contracts or similar arrangements.


	In connection with the sale of the
	securities, underwriters, dealers or agents may be deemed to have received compensation from us in the form of underwriting discounts or commissions and also may receive commissions from securities purchasers for whom they may act as agent.
	Underwriters may sell the securities to or through dealers, and the dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the underwriters or commissions from the purchasers for whom they may act as agent.


	We will provide in the applicable prospectus supplement information regarding any underwriting discounts or other compensation that we pay to
	underwriters or agents in connection with the securities offering, and any discounts, concessions or commissions which underwriters allow to dealers. Underwriters, dealers and agents participating in the securities distribution may be deemed to be
	underwriters, and any discounts and commissions they receive and any profit they realize on the sale of the securities may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act. Underwriters and their controlling persons,
	dealers and agents may be entitled, under agreements entered into with us, to indemnification against and contribution toward specific civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.


	Unless otherwise specified in the related prospectus supplement, each series of securities will be a new issue with no established trading
	market, other than shares of our common stock, which are listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market. We may elect to list any series of preferred stock on an exchange, but we are not obligated to do so. It is possible that one or more underwriters may make a
	market in the securities, but such underwriters will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or the trading market for, any offered securities.


	In connection with an offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell securities in the open market. These transactions may include
	short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of securities than they are required to purchase in an offering. Stabilizing
	transactions consist of bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the securities while an offering is in progress. The underwriters also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular
	underwriter repays to the underwriters a

	portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the underwriters have repurchased securities sold by or for the account of that underwriter in stabilizing or short-covering
	transactions. These activities by the underwriters may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the securities. As a result, the price of the securities may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open
	market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the underwriters at any time. Underwriters may engage in over-allotment. If any underwriters create a short position in the securities in an offering in which they
	sell more securities than are set forth on the cover page of the applicable prospectus supplement, the underwriters may reduce that short position by purchasing the securities in the open market.


	Underwriters, dealers or agents that participate in the offer of securities, or their affiliates or associates, may be customers of, have
	engaged or engage in transactions with, and perform services for, us or our affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they may have received or receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses.

	Item 15.



	Indemnification of Officers and Directors.






	Sections 1741 through 1743 of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as amended (the BCL), provide that a business
	corporation may indemnify directors and officers against liabilities they may incur in such capacities provided certain standards are met, including good faith and the belief that the particular action is in the best interests of the corporation. In
	general, this power to indemnify does not exist in the case of actions against a director or officer by or in the right of the corporation if the person entitled to indemnification shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and
	only to the extent a court determines that the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification. A corporation is required to indemnify directors and officers against expenses they may incur in defending actions against them in such
	capacities if they are successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of such actions. Section 1746 of the BCL provides that the foregoing provisions shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking
	indemnification may be entitled under, among other things, any by-law provision, provided that no indemnification may be made in any case where the act or failure or act giving rise to the claim for indemnification is determined by a court to have
	constituted willful misconduct or recklessness. Section 1747 of the BCL authorizes a corporation to purchase insurance for directors and other representatives. The foregoing statement is subject to the detailed provisions of Sections 1741
	through 1850 of the BCL.


	As permitted by the BCL, the by-laws of the registrant, as amended and restated, provide that the registrant
	shall, subject to certain authorizations and determinations, indemnify its directors and officers, including the advancement of expenses. The by-laws contain the procedures pursuant to which such indemnification and advancement of expenses may be
	authorized and effectuated, including receipt of certain undertakings by the director or officer as a condition precedent to the advancement of expenses. The by-laws, as amended and restated, provide, among other things, that indemnification shall
	not be made where the indemnification is expressly prohibited by law or where a final adjudication establishes that the directors or officers conduct constitutes willful misconduct or recklessness or was based upon or attributable to the
	receipt from the CNB Financial Corporation of a personal benefit to which the director or officer was not legally entitled.


	As permitted
	by the BCL, the registrant maintains directors and officers liability insurance in amounts and on terms which the registrants board of directors deems reasonable. In the ordinary course of business, the registrants board of directors
	regularly reviews the scope and adequacy of such insurance coverage.


	Any underwriting agreement that we might enter into will provide for
	indemnification by any underwriters of us, our directors, our officers who sign the registration statement and our controlling persons for some liabilities, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act.

	Item 17.



	Undertakings.






	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:


	(1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration
	statement:


	(i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;


	(ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or
	the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume
	of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed
	with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee
	table in the effective registration statement;


	(iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of
	distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement;



	provided, however,

	that paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) do not apply if the information required to be included in a
	post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the registrant pursuant to section 13 or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by
	reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement.


	(2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment
	shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial

	bona fide

	offering thereof.


	(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain
	unsold at the termination of the offering.


	(4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of
	1933 to any purchaser:


	(i) Each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to
	be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and


	(ii) Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5) or (b)(7) as part of a registration
	statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii) or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed
	to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As
	provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration
	statement to which the prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial

	bona fide

	offering thereof.

	Provided, however,

	that no statement made in a registration statement or
	prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time
	of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such
	effective date.


	(5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to
	any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method
	used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or
	sell such securities to such purchaser:


	(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant
	relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;


	(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to
	the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;


	(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the
	undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and


	(iv) Any other
	communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.


	 


	II-2






	Table of Contents



	(6) That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of
	1933, each filing of the registrants annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plans annual report pursuant to
	Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such
	securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial

	bona fide

	offering thereof.


	(7) Insofar as
	indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in
	the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities
	(other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling
	person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
	indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.


	(8) That for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of
	prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4), or 497(h) under the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part
	of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.


	(9) That for the purpose of determining any
	liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that
	time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

	January 6, 2017


	Board of Directors


	CNB Financial Corporation


	1 South Second Street, P.O. Box 42


	Clearfield, PA 16830


	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	We are acting as counsel to CNB Financial Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation (the 

	Company

	), in connection with its registration
	statement on Form S-3 (the 

	Registration Statement

	), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the proposed public offering of up to $150,000,000 in aggregate amount of one or more series of the following
	securities of the Company: (i) shares of preferred stock, no par value per share (the 

	Preferred Shares

	), and (ii) shares of common stock, no par value per share (the 

	Common Shares

	 and, together with
	the Preferred Shares, the 

	Securities

	), all of which may be sold from time to time and on a delayed or continuous basis, as set forth in the prospectus which forms a part of the Registration Statement, and as to be set forth in one
	or more supplements to the prospectus. This opinion letter is furnished to you at your request to enable you to fulfill the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K, 17 C.F.R. § 229.601(b)(5), in connection with the
	Registration Statement.


	For purposes of this opinion letter, we have examined copies of such agreements, instruments and documents as we have deemed an
	appropriate basis on which to render the opinions hereinafter expressed. In our examination of the aforesaid documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the accuracy and completeness of
	all documents submitted to us, the authenticity of all original documents, and the conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies (including pdfs). As to all matters of fact, we have relied on the
	representations and statements of fact made in the documents so reviewed, and we have not independently established the facts so relied on. This opinion letter is given, and all statements herein are made, in the context of the foregoing.


	For purposes of this opinion letter, we have assumed that (i) the issuance, sale, amount and terms of any Securities of the Company to be offered from
	time to time will have been duly authorized and established by proper action of the board of directors of the Company or a duly authorized committee of such board (

	Board Action

	) consistent with the procedures and terms described
	in the Registration Statement and in accordance with the Companys charter and bylaws and applicable Pennsylvania corporate law, in a manner that does not violate any law, government or court-imposed order or restriction or agreement or
	instrument then binding on the Company or otherwise impair the legal or binding nature of the obligations represented by the applicable Securities; (ii) at the time of offer, issuance and sale of any Securities, the Registration Statement will
	have been declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 

	Act

	), and no stop order suspending its effectiveness will have been issued and remain in effect; (iii) prior to any issuance of Preferred Shares,
	appropriate certificates of designation will be accepted for record by the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; (iv) if being sold by the issuer thereof, the Securities will be delivered against payment of valid
	consideration therefor and in accordance with the terms of the applicable Board Action authorizing such sale and any applicable underwriting agreement or purchase agreement and as contemplated by the Registration Statement and/or the applicable
	prospectus supplement; and (v) the Company will remain a Pennsylvania corporation.


	This opinion letter is based as to matters of law solely on the
	applicable provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as currently in effect. We express no opinion herein as to any other statutes, rules, or regulations (and in particular, we express no opinion as to any effect that such
	other statutes, rules or regulations may have on the opinions expressed herein).


	Based upon, subject to and limited by the foregoing, we are of the
	opinion that:


	(a) The Preferred Shares, upon due execution and delivery on behalf of the Company of certificates therefor, including
	global certificates, or the entry of the issuance thereof in the books and records of the Company, as the case may be, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.


	(b) The Common Shares (including any Common Shares duly issued upon the exchange or conversion of Preferred Shares that are exchangeable for
	or convertible into Common Shares and receipt by the Company of any additional consideration payable upon such conversion or exchange), upon due execution and delivery on behalf of the Company of certificates therefor, including global certificates,
	or the entry of the issuance thereof in the books and records of the Company, as the case may be, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.


	This opinion letter has been prepared for use in connection with the Registration Statement. We assume no obligation to advise of any changes in the foregoing
	subsequent to the effective date of the Registration Statement.





	We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement and to the
	reference to this firm under the caption Legal Matters in the prospectus constituting a part of the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are an expert within the meaning of the
	Securities Act of 1933, as amended.


	 








	Very truly yours,

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OFFINANCIAL CONDITION  AND RESULTS OFOPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation is presented to provide insight into management's assessment of financial results. The Corporation's subsidiary, CNB Bank (the "Bank"), provides financial services to individuals and businesses primarily within its primary market area of the Pennsylvania counties of Blair, Cambria, Cameron, Centre, Clearfield, Crawford, Elk, Indiana, Jefferson, and McKean. As ERIEBANK, a division of CNB Bank, the Bank operates in the Pennsylvania counties of Crawford, Erie, and Warren, and the Ohio counties of Ashtabula and Lake. As FCBank, a division of CNB Bank, the Bank operates in the Ohio counties of Crawford, Richland, Ashland, Wayne, Marion, Morrow, Knox, Holmes, Delaware, Franklin, and Fairfield.  The Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Pennsylvania State Department of Banking as well as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries are not necessarily indicative of future performance. CNB Securities Corporation is incorporated in Delaware and currently maintains investments in debt and equity securities. CNB Insurance Agency, incorporated in Pennsylvania, provides for the sale of nonproprietary annuities and other insurance products. Holiday Financial Services Corporation ("Holiday"), incorporated in Pennsylvania, offers small balance unsecured loans and secured loans, primarily collateralized by automobiles and equipment, to borrowers with higher risk characteristics.  When we use the terms "we", "us" and "our", we mean CNB Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries. Management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Corporation's consolidated financial statements and related notes.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in its 2015 Form 10-K, and in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 1 of this report. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year ending December 31, 2016, or any future period.  COMPLETED ACQUISITION / NORTHEAST OHIO MARKET  On July 15, 2016, the Corporation completed its previously announced acquisition of Lake National Bank ("LNB") of Mentor, Ohio for $22.50 per share in cash, resulting in consideration paid to LNB shareholders of $24.75 million. Following completion of the merger, the two branches of LNB in Mentor, Ohio are operating as part of the ERIEBANK division of CNB Bank.  In order to facilitate its entry into northeastern Ohio as ERIEBANK, the Corporation had opened a loan production office in Ashtabula, Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2014. Construction of a full-service branch in Ashtabula began in the third quarter of 2016, with completion anticipated by the end of the first quarter of 2017.  GENERAL OVERVIEW  Management uses return on average equity, earnings per share, asset quality, and other metrics to measure the performance of the Corporation. The interest rate environment will continue to play an important role in the future earnings of the Corporation. During the past several years, in order to address the historically low interest rates that are primarily tied to short-term rates, such as the Prime Rate, the Corporation has taken a variety of measures including instituting rate floors on our commercial lines of credit and home equity lines.  Non-interest costs are expected to increase with the growth of the Corporation; however, management's growth strategies are expected to also result in an increase in earning assets as well as enhanced non-interest income which is expected to more than offset increases in non-interest expenses in 2016 and beyond. While past results are not an indication of future earnings, management believes the Corporation is well-positioned to sustain core earnings during 2016.  Table of Contents  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  Cash and cash equivalents totaled $36.9 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $27.3 million at December 31, 2015. Cash and cash equivalents fluctuate based on the timing and amount of liquidity events that occur in the normal course of business.  Management believes the liquidity needs of the Corporation are satisfied by the current balance of cash and cash equivalents, readily available access to traditional funding sources, Federal Home Loan Bank financing, and the portions of the securities and loan portfolios that mature within one year. The Corporation expects that these sources of funds will enable it to meet cash obligations and off-balance sheet commitments as they come due.  SECURITIES  Securities available for sale and trading securities decreased by $39.2 million or 7.1% since December 31, 2015, and associated cash proceeds were used primarily to fund loan growth. The footnotes to the consolidated financial statements provide more detail concerning the composition of the Corporation's securities portfolio, the process for evaluating securities for other-than-temporary impairment, and for valuation of structured pooled trust preferred securities.  The Corporation generally buys into the market over time and does not attempt to "time" its transactions. In doing this, the highs and lows of the market are averaged into the portfolio and the overall effect of different rate environments is minimized. The Corporation monitors the earnings performance and the effectiveness of the liquidity of the securities portfolio on a regular basis through meetings of the Asset/Liability Committee of the Corporation's Board of Directors ("ALCO"). The ALCO also reviews and manages interest rate risk for the Corporation. Through active balance sheet management and analysis of the securities portfolio, a sufficient level of liquidity is maintained to satisfy depositor requirements and various credit needs of our customers.  LOANS  The Corporation experienced an increase in loans, net of unearned discount, of $223.1 million, or 14.1%, during the first nine months of 2016. Of the total growth, $122.0 million was acquired from Lake National Bank, and $101.1 million was organic growth. Lending efforts consist principally of commercial and retail lending, which includes single family residential mortgages and other consumer loans. The Corporation views commercial lending as its competitive advantage and continues to focus on this area by hiring and retaining experienced loan officers and supporting them with quality credit analysis. The Corporation expects loan demand to be solid and loan balances to grow throughout the remainder of 2016.  ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES  The allowance for loan losses is established by provisions for losses in the loan portfolio as well as overdrafts in deposit accounts. These provisions are charged against current income. Loans and overdrafts deemed not collectible are charged off against the allowance while any subsequent collections are recorded as recoveries and increase the allowance.  Table of Contents  The table below shows activity within the allowance account for the specified periods (in thousands):   Nine months ending Year ending Nine months ending September 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 September 30, 2015 Balance at beginning of period $ 16,737 $ 17,373 $ 17,373 Charge-offs: Commercial, industrial, and agricultural (519 ) (307 ) (219 ) Commercial mortgages (20 ) (486 ) - Residential real estate (244 ) (632 ) (347 ) Consumer (2,397 ) (1,956 ) (1,448 ) Credit cards (54 ) (116 ) (103 ) Overdrafts (167 ) (221 ) (159 ) (3,401 ) (3,718 ) (2,276 ) Recoveries: Commercial, industrial, and agricultural 84 267 39 Commercial mortgages 7 52 51 Residential real estate 72 8 5 Consumer 94 96 76 Credit cards 18 14 8 Overdraft deposit accounts 54 85 68 329 522 247 Net charge-offs (3,072 ) (3,196 ) (2,029 ) Provision for loan losses 2,038 2,560 1,892 Balance at end of period $ 15,703 $ 16,737 $ 17,236 Loans, net of unearned $ 1,800,858 $ 1,577,798 $ 1,516,521 Allowance to net loans 0.87 % 1.06 % 1.14 % Net charge-offs to average loans (annualized) 0.24 % 0.22 % 0.19 % Nonperforming assets $ 16,542 $ 12,918 $ 12,917 Nonperforming % of total assets 0.65 % 0.57 % 0.57 %  The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subject to a formal analysis by the Credit Administration and Finance Departments of the Corporation. As part of the formal analysis, delinquencies and losses are monitored monthly. The loan portfolio is divided into several categories in order to better analyze the entire pool. First is a selection of classified loans that is given a specific reserve. The remaining loans are pooled, by category, into these segments:  Reviewed   Commercial, industrial, and agricultural   Commercial mortgages  Homogeneous   Residential real estate   Consumer   Credit cards   Overdrafts  The reviewed loan pools are further segregated into four categories: special mention, substandard, doubtful, and pass rated. Historical loss factors are calculated for each pool excluding overdrafts based on the previous eight quarters of experience. The homogeneous pools are evaluated by analyzing the historical loss factors from the most previous quarter end and the two most recent year ends.  The historical loss factors for both the reviewed and homogeneous pools are adjusted based on the following six qualitative factors:   levels of and trends in delinquencies, non-accrual loans, and classified loans;   trends in volume and terms of loans;   effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures;   experience and ability of management;   national and local economic trends and conditions; and   concentrations of credit.  The methodology described above was created using the experience of the Corporation's Management team, guidance from the regulatory agencies, expertise of a third-party loan review provider, and discussions with peers. The resulting factors are applied to the pool balances in order to estimate the probable risk of loss within each pool. Prudent business practices dictate that the level of the allowance, as well as corresponding charges to the provision for loan losses, should be commensurate with identified areas of risk within the loan portfolio and the attendant risks inherent therein. The quality of the credit risk management function and the overall administration of this vital segment of the Corporation's assets are critical to the ongoing success of the Corporation.  Table of Contents  The previously mentioned analysis considers numerous historical and other factors to analyze the adequacy of the allowance and current period charges against the provision for loan losses. Management uses the analysis to compare and plot the actual level of the allowance against the aggregate amount of loans adversely classified in order to compute the estimated probable losses associated with those loans. Management then determines the current adequacy of the allowance and evaluates trends that may be developing. The volume and composition of the Corporation's loan portfolio continue to reflect growth in commercial credits including commercial real estate loans.  As mentioned in the Loans section of this analysis, management considers commercial lending to be a competitive advantage and continues to focus on this area as part of its strategic growth initiatives. However, management recognizes and considers the fact that risk is more pronounced in these types of credits and is, to a greater degree than with other loans, driven by the economic environment in which the debtor's business operates.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation recorded a provision for loan losses of $622 thousand and $2.0 million, as compared to a provision for loan losses of $463 thousand and $1.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net chargeoffs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $907 thousand and $3.1 million, as compared to $731 thousand and $2.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in chargeoffs was primarily attributable to consumer loans held in CNB's consumer discount company, Holiday Financial Services Corporation. Included in the $907 thousand and $3.1 million of net chargeoffs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $581 thousand and $2.1 million of net chargeoffs related to Holiday Financial Services Corporation. As a result of the purchase accounting requirements associated with a business combination, the allowance for loan losses previously recorded by Lake National Bank did not carry over to the financial statements of CNB. Instead, CNB recorded a fair value adjustment to the loans acquired from Lake National Bank resulting in a reduction in the loan balance of $4.1 million, which will be accreted into loan income in proportion to the reduction of the loan principal balances.  There were no new impaired commercial loan relationships that required a significant loss reserve in the first nine months of 2016. In addition, one impaired commercial and industrial loan that had a loss reserve of $671 thousand at June 30, 2016 was repaid in full in July 2016, resulting in no loss to CNB.  Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is reasonable and adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in the Corporation's portfolio at September 30, 2016.  FUNDING SOURCES  The Corporation considers deposits, short-term borrowings, and term debt when evaluating funding sources. Deposits increased $208.7 million from $1.815 billion at December 31, 2015 to $2.024 billion at September 30, 2016. $139.8 million was acquired from Lake National Bank, while $68.9 million was organic growth. Periodically, the Corporation utilizes term borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") and other lenders to meet funding needs. Management plans to maintain access to short-term and long-term borrowings as an available funding source.  During the second quarter of 2016, the Corporation repaid FHLB long-term borrowings totaling $40.0 million which carried interest rates ranging from 3.97% to 4.60% and incurred an early repayment penalty of $1.5 million. Resulting interest expense savings for 2016 and 2017 will total $1.9 million.  In September 2016, CNB completed a private placement of $50 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes. The notes will mature in October 2026, and will initially bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears, to, but excluding, October 15, 2021, and thereafter to, but excluding, the maturity date or earlier redemption, the interest rate shall reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month LIBOR rate plus 455 basis points. These subordinated notes were designed to qualify as Tier 2 capital under the Federal Reserve's capital guidelines and were given an investment grade rating of BBB- by Kroll Bond Rating Agency. CNB injected the net proceeds from the subordinated notes into its bank subsidiary, CNB Bank, and intends to use the capital for general corporate purposes, including loan growth, additional liquidity, and working capital. As of September 30, 2016, $35 million of the proceeds from the private placement were held by the Corporation's escrow agent, resulting in an increase in accrued interest receivable and other assets at the end of the third quarter. These proceeds were remitted to the Corporation on the first business day of October 2016.  Table of Contents  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND CAPITAL RATIOS AND METRICS  The Corporation's capital continued to provide a base for profitable growth through September 30, 2016. Total shareholders' equity was $215.5 million at September 30, 2016 and $201.9 million at December 31, 2015. In the first nine months of 2016, the Corporation earned $15.5 million and declared dividends of $7.2 million, resulting in a dividend payout ratio of 46.2% of net income.  The Corporation is required to comply with standards of capital adequacy mandated by banking regulators. On January 1, 2015, rules to implement Basel III capital requirements became effective for community banks.  The rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements in comparison to the previously existing U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduced a new capital measure called "Common Equity Tier 1" ("CET1"), (ii) increased the minimum requirements for Tier 1 Capital ratio as well as the minimum levels to be considered well capitalized under prompt corrective action; (iii) and introduced the "capital conservation buffer", designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer are subject to constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).  The Corporation's capital ratios, book value per share and tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:   September 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 Total risk-based capital ratio 14.11 % 13.18 % Tier 1 capital ratio 10.52 % 12.14 % Tier 1 common equity ratio 9.43 % 10.90 % Leverage ratio 7.71 % 8.73 % Tangible common equity/tangible assets (1) 6.94 % 7.64 % Book value per share $ 14.90 $ 14.01 Tangible book value per share (1) $ 11.98 $ 11.96  (1) Tangible common equity, tangible assets and tangible book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures calculated using GAAP amounts. Tangible common equity is calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and core deposit intangibles from the calculation of shareholders' equity. Tangible assets is calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and core deposit intangibles from the calculation of total assets. Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible common equity by the number of shares outstanding. The Corporation believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors that is useful in understanding its financial condition because they are additional measures used to assess capital adequacy. Because not all companies use the same calculation of tangible common equity and tangible assets, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures calculated by other companies. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is provided below (dollars in thousands, except share and per share data).   September 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 Shareholders' equity $ 215,489 $ 201,913 Less goodwill 38,967 27,194 Less core deposit intangible 3,200 2,395 Tangible common equity $ 173,322 $ 172,324 Total assets $ 2,539,944 $ 2,285,136 Less goodwill 38,967 27,194 Less core deposit intangible 3,200 2,395 Tangible assets $ 2,497,777 $ 2,255,547 Ending shares outstanding 14,465,210 14,408,430 Tangible book value per share $ 11.98 $ 11.96 Tangible common equity/tangible assets 6.94 % 7.64 %  Table of Contents  LIQUIDITY  Liquidity measures an organization's ability to meet cash obligations as they come due. The consolidated statement of cash flows provides analysis of the Corporation's cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, management considers that portion of the loan and investment portfolio that matures within one year to be part of the Corporation's liquid assets. The Corporation's liquidity is monitored by both management and the ALCO, which establishes and monitors ranges of acceptable liquidity. Management believes the Corporation's current liquidity position is acceptable.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ACTIVITIES  Some financial instruments, such as loan commitments, credit lines, letters of credit and overdraft protection, are issued to meet customer financing needs. These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have expiration dates. Commitments may expire without being used. Off balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated. The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment.  The contractual amount of financial instruments with off balance sheet risk was as follows at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands):   September 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 Fixed Rate Variable Rate Fixed Rate Variable Rate Commitments to make loans $ 31,702 $ 235,246 $ 42,803 $ 259,032 Unused lines of credit 0 103,152 0 87,493 Standby letters of credit 0 7,699 0 15,704  Commitments to make loans are generally made for periods of 60 days or less. The fixed rate loan commitments at September 30, 2016 have interest rates ranging from 1.19% to 18.00% and maturities ranging from 3 months to 20 years. The fixed rate loan commitments at December 31, 2015 have interest rates ranging from 1.19% to 18.00% and maturities ranging from 3 months to 20 years.  In October 2015, the Corporation entered into a subscription agreement with Oxer BCP Mezzanine Fund, LP ("Oxer") and committed to invest $5,000 as a limited partner in the fund. Oxer is a Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) that is licensed and regulated by the Office of Investment at the Small Business Administration (SBA). The SBIC license allows SBICs to employ private capital and funds borrowed at a low cost using SBA-guaranteed securities to make investments in qualifying small businesses and similar enterprises as defined by SBA regulations. As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation has invested $1,338 of its $5,000 commitment.  Table of Contents  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  OVERVIEW OF THE INCOME STATEMENT  The Corporation had net income of $6.4 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $5.5 million in the third quarter of 2015.

CNB Financial Corporation Announces Acquisition of Lake National Bank




Establishes foothold in Greater Cleveland market through entry into 
      Mentor






December 30, 2015 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



CLEARFIELD, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CNB Financial Corporation (NASDAQ: CCNE), the parent company of CNB 
      Bank, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to 
      acquire Lake National Bank of Mentor, Ohio, for $22.50 per share in 
      cash, or approximately $24.75 million in the aggregate. Lake National 
      Bank, which was founded in 2005 by the late Lake County businessman and 
      philanthropist Jerome T. Osborne, Sr., had approximately $152.2 million 
      in total assets and $14.1 million in shareholders’ equity as of 
      September 30, 2015.
    


      Following completion of the merger, the business of Lake National Bank 
      will operate as part of the ERIEBANK division of CNB. The ERIEBANK 
      division, led by David J. Zimmer III, has local decision making and 
      oversight with a presence throughout Erie, Warren and Crawford Counties 
      in Pennsylvania and Ashtabula County in Ohio. ERIEBANK was established 
      in 2005 and has grown successfully from a de novo operation to 9 
      locations and over $652 million in total assets in approximately 10 
      years. In 2014, ERIEBANK opened a loan production office in Ashtabula, 
      Ohio, a neighboring community to Mentor, and is currently constructing a 
      full service location in that market.
    

      It is anticipated that customer-facing personnel at Lake National Bank 
      will be largely unaffected, and ERIEBANK plans to grow its business 
      origination effort in Lake County following closing and integration of 
      the transaction. Andrew Meinhold, currently President and Chief 
      Executive Officer of Lake National Bank, will continue with CNB in its 
      ERIEBANK division following closing of the merger. Following 
      consummation of the merger, Jerome T. Osborne III and Lance F. Osborne 
      will be joining the Advisory Board of ERIEBANK, and Joseph T. Svete, 
      Chairman of Lake National Bank, Richard T. Flenner, Jr., Vice Chairman 
      of Lake National Bank, and Richard J. Kessler, Director of Lake National 
      Bank, will begin the ERIEBANK OH Advisory Board of the ERIEBANK division 
      of CNB.
    

      “We are excited to continue expansion of our franchise in Ohio by 
      entering the Mentor market in the greater Cleveland area,” announced 
      Joseph B. Bower, Jr., President and CEO of CNB Financial Corporation. 
      “We have been targeting Mentor as a logical expansion of our ERIEBANK 
      franchise, following up on our most recent expansion into Ashtabula. 
      Mentor is known for its mid-sized commercial and industrial businesses, 
      which we serve extremely well. We feel the same opportunity exists in 
      the greater Cleveland market as in the greater Columbus market, where we 
      also purchased a smaller institution that will allow us to grow 
      organically. We are especially privileged to partner with the Osborne 
      family to continue to serve consumers and small businesses while 
      providing the high level of customer service, which was so important to 
      Jerome Sr. and was the basis upon which he began this bank.”
    

      David J. Zimmer III, President of ERIEBANK, added, “Our ERIEBANK 
      franchise was founded upon many of the same principles that Jerome Sr. 
      founded Lake National. We have the optimal combination of prompt local 
      decision making and oversight, with the product, service and operational 
      support of CNB. We are thrilled with this combination, and excited to 
      provide employees a meaningful and challenging opportunity within our 
      organization, and to provide customers of Lake National with the superior
customer service and product selection that they have come to 
      expect.”
    

      “CNB is the ideal partner for our bank,” said Andrew L. Meinhold, 
      President and Chief Executive Officer of Lake National Bank. “CNB has a

Forward-Looking Statements


      This press release contains statements that may be considered 
      forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the 
      Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 
      1934. These forward-looking statements are intended to be covered by the 
      safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act 
      of 1995, and this statement is included for purposes of complying with 
      these safe harbor provisions. Readers should not place undue reliance on 
      such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. 
      These forward-looking statements are based on current plans and 
      expectations, which are subject to a number of risk factors and 
      uncertainties that could cause future results to differ materially from 
      historical performance or future expectations. These differences may be 
      the result of various factors, including, among others: (1) failure of 
      the parties to satisfy the closing conditions in the merger agreement in 
      a timely manner or at all; (2) failure of the shareholders of Lake 
      National Bank to approve the merger agreement; (3) failure to obtain 
      governmental approvals for the merger; (4) disruptions to the parties' 
      businesses as a result of the announcement and pendency of the merger; 
      (5) costs or difficulties related to the integration of the business 
      following the proposed merger; (6) the risk that the anticipated 
      benefits, cost savings and any other savings from the transaction may 
      not be fully realized or may take longer than expected to realize; (7) 
      changes in general business, industry or economic conditions or 
      competition; (8) changes in any applicable law, rule, regulation, 
      policy, guideline or practice governing or affecting financial holding 
      companies and their subsidiaries or with respect to tax or accounting 
      principles or otherwise; (9) adverse changes or conditions in the 
      capital and financial markets; (10) changes in interest rates or credit 
      availability; (11) the inability to realize expected cost savings or 
      achieve other anticipated benefits in connection with the proposed 
      merger; (12) changes in the quality or composition of loan and 
      investment portfolios; (13) adequacy of loan loss reserves and changes 
      in loan default and charge-off rates; (14) increased competition and its 
      effect on pricing, spending, third-party relationships and revenues; 
      (15) loss of certain key officers; (16) continued relationships with 
      major customers; (17) deposit attrition, necessitating increased 
      borrowings to fund loans and investments; (18) rapidly changing 
      technology; (19) unanticipated regulatory or judicial proceedings and 
      liabilities and other costs; (20) changes in the cost of funds, demand 
      for loan products or demand for financial services; and (21) other 
      economic, competitive, governmental or technological factors affecting 
      operations, markets, products, services and prices.
    

      The foregoing list should not be construed as exhaustive, and CNB 
      Financial Corporation and Lake National Bank undertake no obligation to 
      subsequently revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or 
      circumstances after the date of such statements, or to reflect the 
      occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances.
    

      For additional factors that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, 
      please see filings by CNB Financial Corporation with the SEC, including 
      CNB Financial Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year 
      ended December 31, 2014.

  ABOUT
THIS PROSPECTUS

This
prospectus is part of a registration statement that we filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
using a “shelf” registration process for the delayed
offering and sale of securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”). Under the shelf process, we may, from time to time,
sell any of the offered securities described in this prospectus in
one or more offerings. Additionally, under the shelf process, in
certain circumstances, we may provide a prospectus supplement that
will contain specific information about the terms of a particular
offering by us. We may also provide a prospectus supplement to add
information to, or update or change information contained in, this
prospectus.

We have
filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3, of which
this prospectus is a part, under the Securities Act, with respect
to the offered securities. This prospectus does not contain all of
the information set forth in the registration statement, portions
of which we have omitted as permitted by the rules and regulations
of the SEC. Statements contained in this prospectus as to the
contents of any contract or other document are not necessarily
complete. You should refer to the copy of each contract or document
filed as an exhibit to the registration statement for a complete
description.

You should
read this prospectus together with any additional information you
may need to make your investment decision. You should also read and
carefully consider the information in the documents we have
referred you to in “Where You Can Find More
Information” and “Incorporation of Certain Documents by
Reference” below. Information incorporated by reference after
the date of this prospectus may add, update or change information

“estimate,” “potential” or

in such forward-looking statements will turn out to be correct. Our
actual results may differ materially from those projected in these

  ABOUT
CNB FINANCIAL CORPORATION

We are a
financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956, as amended. We were incorporated under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1983 for the purpose of engaging in
the business of a financial holding company. On April 26,
1984, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of County
National Bank, a national banking chartered institution. In
December of 2006, County National Bank changed its name to CNB Bank
(the “Bank”) and became a state bank chartered in
Pennsylvania and subject to regulation by the Pennsylvania
Department of Banking and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.

We are
subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In general, we are limited
to owning or controlling banks and engaging in such other
activities as are properly incident thereto. We are currently
engaged in four non-banking activities through our wholly owned
subsidiaries CNB Securities Corporation, County Reinsurance
Company, CNB Insurance Agency and Holiday Financial Services
Corporation. CNB Securities Corporation was formed in 2005 to hold
and manage investments and to provide us with additional latitude
to purchase other investments. County Reinsurance Company was
formed in June of 2001 as a corporation in the State of Arizona.
The company provides accidental death and disability and life
insurance as a part of lending relationships of the Bank. CNB
Insurance Agency was established in February of 2003. The company
provides fixed annuity products to banking customers. Holiday
Financial Services Corporation was formed in 2005 to facilitate our
entry into the consumer discount loan and finance business. In
addition to these operating subsidiaries, we have two wholly owned
affiliates, CNB Capital Trust II and CNB Capital Trust III, which
are accounted for using the equity method. These entities were
formed in 2007 for the sole purpose of issuing and selling certain
securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the
assets of the trusts and investing the proceeds thereof in
subordinated debentures.

We do not
currently engage in any operating business activities, other than
the ownership and management of CNB Bank, CNB Securities
Corporation, County Reinsurance Company, CNB Insurance Agency, and
Holiday Financial Services Corporation.

The Bank
was incorporated in 1934 and is chartered in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. The Bank’s primary market area consists of the
Pennsylvania Counties of Clearfield, Elk (excluding the Townships
of Millstone, Highland and Spring Creek), McKean, Cambria and
Cameron. It also includes a portion of western Centre County
including Philipsburg Borough, Rush Township and the western
portions of Snow Shoe and Burnside Townships and a portion of
Jefferson County, consisting of the boroughs of Brockway, Falls
Creek, Punxsutawney, Reynoldsville and Sykesville, and the
townships of Washington, Winslow and Henderson.

ERIEBANK,
a division of CNB Bank, began operations in 2005 when the Bank
established a loan production office in Erie, Pennsylvania and
started offering commercial loan service to businesses located
within Erie and Erie County. During 2006, management opened a full
service branch in the Erie market at a temporary location and in
2007 opened its first two full service financial services stores.
Two additional full service financial services stores were opened
in the Erie community in 2008. In 2009, management opened a
temporary ERIEBANK location in the city of Meadville, Crawford
County, Pennsylvania. Construction has begun on a full service
branch in Meadville, with opening expected in the spring of 2010.
The primary market area for the ERIEBANK division is the
northwestern Pennsylvania county of Erie including the city of Erie
and the city of Meadville.

The Bank
has 26 full-service branch offices and 1 loan production office
located in various communities in its market area.

The Bank
is a full-service bank engaging in a full range of banking
activities and services for individual, business, governmental and
institutional customers. These activities and services principally
include checking, savings, and time deposit accounts; real estate,
commercial, industrial, residential and consumer loans; and a
variety of other specialized financial services. The Bank’s
Wealth & Asset Management Services division offers a full
range of client services.

  DESCRIPTION
OF COMMON STOCK

The
following description is a general summary of the terms of our
common stock. The description below does not purport to be complete
and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to our
amended and restated articles of incorporation and by-laws, as
amended and restated. The description below does not contain all of
the information that you might find useful or that might be
important to you. You should refer to the provisions of our amended
and restated articles of incorporation and by-laws, as amended and
restated, because they, and not the summaries, define the rights of
holders of shares of our common stock. You can obtain copies of our
amended and restated articles of incorporation and by-laws, as
amended and restated, by following the directions under the heading
“Where You Can Find More Information.”

General

Our
amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize us to
issue 50,000,000 shares of stock, no par value. As of
March 15, 2010, there were 8,789,066 shares of common stock
issued and we had outstanding options exercisable for 153,000
shares of our common stock.

Each share
of our common stock has the same relative rights and is identical
in all respects to each other share of our common stock. Our common
stock is non-withdrawable capital, is not of an insurable type and
is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any
other governmental entity.

Voting
Rights

Holders of
our common stock are entitled to one vote per share on each matter
properly submitted to shareholders for their vote, including the
election of directors. Holders of our common stock do not have the
right to cumulate their votes for the election of directors, which
means that the holders of more than 50% of the shares of common
stock voting for the election of directors are able to elect all of
the directors standing for election at any meeting if they choose
to do so. In that event, the holders of the remaining shares will
not be able to elect any person to our board of directors at that
shareholder meeting.

Liquidation
Rights

The
holders of our common stock, together with the holders of any class
or series of stock entitled to participate with the holders of our
common stock in the distribution of assets in the event of any
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of us, whether voluntary or
involuntary, will be entitled to participate equally in the
distribution of any of our assets remaining after we have paid, or
provided for the payment of, all of our debts and liabilities and
after we have paid, or set aside for payment to, the holders of any
class of stock having preference over the common stock in the event
of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up the full preferential
amounts to which they are entitled.

Dividends

The
holders of our common stock and any class or series of stock
entitled to participate with the holders of our common stock are
entitled to receive dividends declared by our board of directors
out of any assets legally available for distribution. We may not
pay dividends or other distributions unless we have paid, declared
or set aside all accumulated dividends and any sinking fund,
retirement fund or other retirement payments on any class of stock
having preference as to payments of dividends over our common
stock. As a holding company, our ability to pay distributions is
affected by the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. The
ability of our bank subsidiary, and our ability, to pay dividends
in the future is, and could in the future be further, influenced by
bank regulatory requirements and capital guidelines.

Miscellaneous

The
holders of our common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights
for any shares that may be issued. Our common stock is not subject
to additional calls or assessments, and all shares of our common
stock currently outstanding are fully paid and nonassessable. All
shares of common stock offered pursuant to a prospectus

Table of

supplement,
or issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of any
convertible securities, will, when issued, be fully paid and
nonassessable, which means that the full purchase price of the
shares will have been paid and the holders of the shares will not
be assessed any additional monies for the shares.

Some
Important Charter Provisions

Our
by-laws, as amended and restated, provide for the division of our
board of directors into three classes of directors, each class as
nearly as equal as possible, with each serving staggered terms. Any
amendment to our by-laws must be approved by the affirmative vote
of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to
vote thereon and, if any shareholders are entitled to vote thereon
as a class, upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of
the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote as a class.
Additionally, our amended and restated articles of incorporation
provide that the affirmative vote of at least 66% of the
outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote is required to
effect business combinations.

Some of
the foregoing provisions may have the effect of deterring hostile
takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of
us.

Since the
terms of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and
by-laws, as amended and restated, may differ from the general
information we are providing, you should only rely on the actual
provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation
and by-laws. If you would like to read our amended and restated
articles of incorporation and by-laws, you   may request a copy from us by following the
directions under the heading “Where You Can Find More
Information.”

Our common
stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol

  DESCRIPTION
OF PREFERRED STOCK

The
following description is a general summary of the terms of the
preferred stock which we may issue. The description below and in
any prospectus supplement does not purport to be complete and is
subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to our
amended and restated articles of incorporation and the applicable
certificate of designations designating the terms of the related
series of preferred stock and our by-laws, as amended and restated,
each of which we will make available upon request. The descriptions
herein and in the applicable prospectus supplement do not contain
all of the information that you may find useful or that may be
important to you. You should refer to the provisions of our amended
and restated articles of incorporation, the applicable certificate
of designations and our by-laws, as amended and restated, because
they, and not the summaries, define your rights as holders of
shares of our preferred stock.

General

We are
authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of stock, no par value. Our
amended and restated articles of incorporation, subject to
limitations prescribed in such articles and subject to limitations
prescribed by Pennsylvania law, authorize the board of directors,
from time to time by resolution and without further shareholder
action, to provide for the issuance of shares of preferred stock,
in one or more series, and to fix the designation, powers,
preferences and other rights of the shares and to fix the
qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof. As a result
of its broad discretion with respect to the creation and issuance
of preferred stock without shareholder approval, the board of
directors could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of
common stock and, by issuing shares of preferred stock with certain
voting, conversion and/or redemption rights, could discourage any
attempt to obtain control of us.

Terms of
the Preferred Stock That We May Offer and Sell to
You

You should
refer to the prospectus supplement relating to the class or series
of preferred stock being offered for the specific terms of that
class or series, including:
