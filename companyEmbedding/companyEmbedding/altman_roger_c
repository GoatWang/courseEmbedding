Early life and education[edit]
Altman was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, and was raised in Boston as a Catholic.[3] His father, a food broker, died when he was 10 years old, and his mother, a librarian, raised Altman and his brother as a single mother.[4] He attended the Roxbury Latin School.[5]
He attended Georgetown University, where he met future President Bill Clinton, and earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1967. In 1969 he earned an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, but took time off in 1968 to work in Indiana organizing volunteers for Robert F. Kennedy's presidential campaign.[6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in 1969, Altman began working at Lehman Brothers, where he grew close to chairman Peter G. Peterson. In 1974, he was made general partner at the age of 28—the youngest in Lehman's history. He left Lehman in 1977 to serve as Assistant Secretary for Domestic Finance in the U.S. Treasury from 1977 to 1981 under President Jimmy Carter, for whom he had fundraised when Carter was Governor of Georgia, and campaigned for in 1976, as well as working on his transition team.[5] As Assistant Secretary, Altman played a "role in negotiating the Federal Government's $1.5 billion bailout of the Chrysler Corporation."[6]
In 1981, he returned to Lehman Brothers, where he became the co-head of investment banking and served on the board of the company and the management committee. During the 1980s, he was a lecturer and adjunct professor at the Yale University School of Management. In 1987, Altman joined the Blackstone Group as vice-chairman and head of its mergers and acquisitions advisory business.[7] During the Reagan-Bush years, he fundraised for Democratic politicians such as Vice President Walter F. Mondale, Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis, and Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton. He also advised two New York City Mayors, Ed Koch and David N. Dinkins.[2]
Clinton administration[edit]
When Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, he urged U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to take Altman on as his Deputy Secretary. He was confirmed in January 1993.[8] Once on the job, Altman was viewed as "the favorite to succeed the 73-year-old Treasury Secretary," and he played a large role in some of the Clinton administration's biggest legislative victories, such as the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the "approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement."[2] He was associated with the moderate economic policies of the Clinton administration" and had a reputation as a "deficit hawk."[9]
However, he resigned in 1994 due to the fallout from his role in a record-keeping scandal connected to the Whitewater controversy.[10][11] After nearly 15 hours of testimony in February 1993 before the House and Senate Banking Committees, he submitted his resignation in August 1994, saying that he hoped his resignation would "help to diminish the controversy." He was succeeded by Frank N. Newman, who was the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance at the time.[2]
Return to private sector[edit]
In 1995, instead of returning to Blackstone,[12] he co-founded Evercore, an "independent investment banking advisory firm" in New York City, and currently serves as its Chairman. By 2014, Evercore was "a major player,"[13] and its investment management arm had more than $14 billion in assets under management, with its investment banking advisory arm boasting $1.5 trillion in "announced transactions."[14] Evercore advised General Motors through its bankruptcy, and was paid $46 million by GM pre-bankruptcy. However, when it asked for a $17.9 million "success fee," a U.S. bankruptcy trustee called the fees "staggering," "inordinately large," and "clearly [exceeding] the bounds of reasonableness" given that "Evercore had no success at finding a purchaser or funder for the Debtors."[15]
Politically, Altman continued to stay in the loop. He advised two presidential candidates—John Kerry in 2004,[16] and Hillary Clinton in 2008.[17] In 2010, President Barack Obama interviewed him as a potential candidate to replace Larry Summers as his National Economic Council director,[9] a job that ultimately went to Gene Sperling.[18]
Other activities[edit]
Altman is a Trustee of the New York-Presbyterian Hospital (and serves on its Investment Committee), Vice Chairman of the Board of the American Museum of Natural History, and Chairman of New Visions for Public Schools. Additionally, he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a Director of Conservation International,[19] and an Advisory Council member for The Hamilton Project, a Brookings Institution economic policy initiative.[20]
Altman is listed as a member of the Steering Committee of The Bilderberg Group, a controversial group of influential business and government leaders who meet annually behind closed doors to foster dialogue between Europe and North America. He participated in all their conferences between 2008 and 2016. [21][22]
Personal life[edit]
His first marriage ended in divorce, and he remarried at age 35 to journalist Jurate Kazickas in 1981. The Rev. James N. English of Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church in Washington, D.C. performed the marriage ceremony at the San Luis Rey Chapel at Cat Cay in the Bahamas.[23] They adopted three children. In 1992, he collapsed while jogging in Central Park due to an irregular heartbeat.[6] His hobbies include jogging, skiing, fly-fishing, and tennis.[5]

Early life and education[edit]
Altman was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, and was raised in Boston as a Catholic.[3] His father, a food broker, died when he was 10 years old, and his mother, a librarian, raised Altman and his brother as a single mother.[4] He attended the Roxbury Latin School.[5]
He attended Georgetown University, where he met future President Bill Clinton, and earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1967. In 1969 he earned an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, but took time off in 1968 to work in Indiana organizing volunteers for Robert F. Kennedy's presidential campaign.[6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in 1969, Altman began working at Lehman Brothers, where he grew close to chairman Peter G. Peterson. In 1974, he was made general partner at the age of 28—the youngest in Lehman's history. He left Lehman in 1977 to serve as Assistant Secretary for Domestic Finance in the U.S. Treasury from 1977 to 1981 under President Jimmy Carter, for whom he had fundraised when Carter was Governor of Georgia, and campaigned for in 1976, as well as working on his transition team.[5] As Assistant Secretary, Altman played a "role in negotiating the Federal Government's $1.5 billion bailout of the Chrysler Corporation."[6]
In 1981, he returned to Lehman Brothers, where he became the co-head of investment banking and served on the board of the company and the management committee. During the 1980s, he was a lecturer and adjunct professor at the Yale University School of Management. In 1987, Altman joined the Blackstone Group as vice-chairman and head of its mergers and acquisitions advisory business.[7] During the Reagan-Bush years, he fundraised for Democratic politicians such as Vice President Walter F. Mondale, Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis, and Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton. He also advised two New York City Mayors, Ed Koch and David N. Dinkins.[2]
Clinton administration[edit]
When Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, he urged U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to take Altman on as his Deputy Secretary. He was confirmed in January 1993.[8] Once on the job, Altman was viewed as "the favorite to succeed the 73-year-old Treasury Secretary," and he played a large role in some of the Clinton administration's biggest legislative victories, such as the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the "approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement."[2] He was associated with the moderate economic policies of the Clinton administration" and had a reputation as a "deficit hawk."[9]
However, he resigned in 1994 due to the fallout from his role in a record-keeping scandal connected to the Whitewater controversy.[10][11] After nearly 15 hours of testimony in February 1993 before the House and Senate Banking Committees, he submitted his resignation in August 1994, saying that he hoped his resignation would "help to diminish the controversy." He was succeeded by Frank N. Newman, who was the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance at the time.[2]
Return to private sector[edit]
In 1995, instead of returning to Blackstone,[12] he co-founded Evercore, an "independent investment banking advisory firm" in New York City, and currently serves as its Chairman. By 2014, Evercore was "a major player,"[13] and its investment management arm had more than $14 billion in assets under management, with its investment banking advisory arm boasting $1.5 trillion in "announced transactions."[14] Evercore advised General Motors through its bankruptcy, and was paid $46 million by GM pre-bankruptcy. However, when it asked for a $17.9 million "success fee," a U.S. bankruptcy trustee called the fees "staggering," "inordinately large," and "clearly [exceeding] the bounds of reasonableness" given that "Evercore had no success at finding a purchaser or funder for the Debtors."[15]
Politically, Altman continued to stay in the loop. He advised two presidential candidates—John Kerry in 2004,[16] and Hillary Clinton in 2008.[17] In 2010, President Barack Obama interviewed him as a potential candidate to replace Larry Summers as his National Economic Council director,[9] a job that ultimately went to Gene Sperling.[18]
Other activities[edit]
Altman is a Trustee of the New York-Presbyterian Hospital (and serves on its Investment Committee), Vice Chairman of the Board of the American Museum of Natural History, and Chairman of New Visions for Public Schools. Additionally, he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a Director of Conservation International,[19] and an Advisory Council member for The Hamilton Project, a Brookings Institution economic policy initiative.[20]
Altman is listed as a member of the Steering Committee of The Bilderberg Group, a controversial group of influential business and government leaders who meet annually behind closed doors to foster dialogue between Europe and North America. He participated in all their conferences between 2008 and 2016. [21][22]
Personal life[edit]
His first marriage ended in divorce, and he remarried at age 35 to journalist Jurate Kazickas in 1981. The Rev. James N. English of Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church in Washington, D.C. performed the marriage ceremony at the San Luis Rey Chapel at Cat Cay in the Bahamas.[23] They adopted three children. In 1992, he collapsed while jogging in Central Park due to an irregular heartbeat.[6] His hobbies include jogging, skiing, fly-fishing, and tennis.[5]

Strengthening the Safety Net to Mitigate the Effect of Future Recessions


In the years following the Great Recession, many economists and policymakers agreed that fiscal stimulus was critical to improving the faltering economy and helping to save or create millions of jobs. There is less agreement, however, on whether the stimulus should have been larger, if it contained the correct mix of tax cuts and targeted government spending, and whether it optimally utilized income support programs—notably TANF and SNAP—to stabilize the economy and protect millions of households from falling into poverty. On May 23, The Hamilton Project at Brookings hosted a policy forum addressing how to make better use of fiscal stimulus in future downturns, with a focus on three new Hamilton Project papers.

                                            I was told no interest for 1 year, not deferred interest for 1 year. I make 1 payment for every paycheck, biweekly, and on the rare occasion I have not been able to make a 2nd payment in a month, if it was not close to the due date, they charged me a late fee I had to fight to...show more

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

“When it came to getting a transcript or applying for a student loan, the buildings weren’t available,” Altman said. “The university leadership and the provost at the time, Edward Levi (who went on to become US attorney general), came under tremendous pressure from then-Mayor [Richard J.] Daley to allow the Chicago Police to come onto the campus and ‘clean it up’.”
The provost’s composure, “extraordinary” judgment, and resolve to protect students’ rights to protest resonated with Altman. It was part of what inspired his commitment to public service and philanthropic pursuits.
“The benefit of going to graduate school is about 50 percent in the classroom, and about 50 percent the ecology of the graduate school and what you’ll learn by just being there.”
Lessons Learned in Leadership
Altman began his investment banking career at Lehman Brothers, becoming a general partner in 1974. Beginning in 1977, he served four years as assistant secretary of the US Treasury. Returning to Lehman Brothers, he later became cohead of overall investment banking, a member of the firm’s management committee and its board.
“I was prepared intellectually for finance, but not practically. Looking back on it, I knew nothing about leadership. I had to learn it on the job. I don’t think there is one formula for leadership.”
In 1987, Altman joined The Blackstone Group as vice chairman, head of the firm’s advisory business and a member of its investment committee with primary responsibility for Blackstone’s international business.
Beginning in January 1993, Mr. Altman returned to Washington to serve as deputy secretary of the US Treasury for two years.
“Leadership in my own experience is a very subtle mix of elements. I don’t think you can lead entirely by consensus just taking a vote on any issue. On the other hand, elements of consensus are very important. There’s a fine line between waving a sword and saying we’re going up that hill and having an approach which builds support among your employees and your teammates, so that you’re not an autocrat. Autocrats—at least in what I’ve ever seen—don’t last too long.”
The Power of Public Service
Growing up in a “classically progressive” Massachusetts family, Altman embraced the civic-minded attitude, and it has deeply influenced his commitment to giving back. “Public service remains my greatest interest,” he said. Altman is a Trustee of New York-Presbyterian Hospital, serving on its Finance Committee, and is a Trustee of MIT. He also serves as Chairman of New Visions for Public Schools.
“The only way that we’re going to enable living standards in this country to begin climbing again is through better educating our population. The pressures of technology and globalization require certain skills that in turn require higher education to achieve. If we don’t get our high school graduation rate up and our college completion rates up, we’re not going to be able to get living standards in this country moving forward again. Education is, more than ever, the doorway to opportunity. And there are too many Americans who don’t go through that door.”
The Value of Entrepreneurship
With a unique vision, Altman launched Evercore in 1995, guided by the idea that clients would be better served by advisers who were not tethered to the demands of a multi-product financial institution. Today, the firm has more than 80 partners, 1,400 employees and has handled over $2 trillion of merger, acquisition, recapitalization, and restructuring transactions.
“The most meaningful thing I ever did in business was found and build up Evercore,” Altman said. His appetite for constant growth coupled with his continued ability to succeed in new directions is proof of his resiliency, curious mind, and entrepreneurial acumen. Throughout a long career now stretching into its fifth decade, he remains invigorated by his work.
“I have never had a boring day in this field. One is constantly taking on new assignments involving different types of businesses with different types of challenges. And, even the same client, two years later, often faces a whole new set of issues.”

Early life and education[edit]
Altman was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, and was raised in Boston as a Catholic.[3] His father, a food broker, died when he was 10 years old, and his mother, a librarian, raised Altman and his brother as a single mother.[4] He attended the Roxbury Latin School.[5]
He attended Georgetown University, where he met future President Bill Clinton, and earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1967. In 1969 he earned an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, but took time off in 1968 to work in Indiana organizing volunteers for Robert F. Kennedy's presidential campaign.[6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in 1969, Altman began working at Lehman Brothers, where he grew close to chairman Peter G. Peterson. In 1974, he was made general partner at the age of 28—the youngest in Lehman's history. He left Lehman in 1977 to serve as Assistant Secretary for Domestic Finance in the U.S. Treasury from 1977 to 1981 under President Jimmy Carter, for whom he had fundraised when Carter was Governor of Georgia, and campaigned for in 1976, as well as working on his transition team.[5] As Assistant Secretary, Altman played a "role in negotiating the Federal Government's $1.5 billion bailout of the Chrysler Corporation."[6]
In 1981, he returned to Lehman Brothers, where he became the co-head of investment banking and served on the board of the company and the management committee. During the 1980s, he was a lecturer and adjunct professor at the Yale University School of Management. In 1987, Altman joined the Blackstone Group as vice-chairman and head of its mergers and acquisitions advisory business.[7] During the Reagan-Bush years, he fundraised for Democratic politicians such as Vice President Walter F. Mondale, Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis, and Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton. He also advised two New York City Mayors, Ed Koch and David N. Dinkins.[2]
Clinton administration[edit]
When Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, he urged U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to take Altman on as his Deputy Secretary. He was confirmed in January 1993.[8] Once on the job, Altman was viewed as "the favorite to succeed the 73-year-old Treasury Secretary," and he played a large role in some of the Clinton administration's biggest legislative victories, such as the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the "approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement."[2] He was associated with the moderate economic policies of the Clinton administration" and had a reputation as a "deficit hawk."[9]
However, he resigned in 1994 due to the fallout from his role in a record-keeping scandal connected to the Whitewater controversy.[10][11] After nearly 15 hours of testimony in February 1993 before the House and Senate Banking Committees, he submitted his resignation in August 1994, saying that he hoped his resignation would "help to diminish the controversy." He was succeeded by Frank N. Newman, who was the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance at the time.[2]
Return to private sector[edit]
In 1995, instead of returning to Blackstone,[12] he co-founded Evercore, an "independent investment banking advisory firm" in New York City, and currently serves as its Chairman. By 2014, Evercore was "a major player,"[13] and its investment management arm had more than $14 billion in assets under management, with its investment banking advisory arm boasting $1.5 trillion in "announced transactions."[14] Evercore advised General Motors through its bankruptcy, and was paid $46 million by GM pre-bankruptcy. However, when it asked for a $17.9 million "success fee," a U.S. bankruptcy trustee called the fees "staggering," "inordinately large," and "clearly [exceeding] the bounds of reasonableness" given that "Evercore had no success at finding a purchaser or funder for the Debtors."[15]
Politically, Altman continued to stay in the loop. He advised two presidential candidates—John Kerry in 2004,[16] and Hillary Clinton in 2008.[17] In 2010, President Barack Obama interviewed him as a potential candidate to replace Larry Summers as his National Economic Council director,[9] a job that ultimately went to Gene Sperling.[18]
Other activities[edit]
Altman is a Trustee of the New York-Presbyterian Hospital (and serves on its Investment Committee), Vice Chairman of the Board of the American Museum of Natural History, and Chairman of New Visions for Public Schools. Additionally, he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a Director of Conservation International,[19] and an Advisory Council member for The Hamilton Project, a Brookings Institution economic policy initiative.[20]
Altman is listed as a member of the Steering Committee of The Bilderberg Group, a controversial group of influential business and government leaders who meet annually behind closed doors to foster dialogue between Europe and North America. He participated in all their conferences between 2008 and 2016. [21][22]
Personal life[edit]
His first marriage ended in divorce, and he remarried at age 35 to journalist Jurate Kazickas in 1981. The Rev. James N. English of Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church in Washington, D.C. performed the marriage ceremony at the San Luis Rey Chapel at Cat Cay in the Bahamas.[23] They adopted three children. In 1992, he collapsed while jogging in Central Park due to an irregular heartbeat.[6] His hobbies include jogging, skiing, fly-fishing, and tennis.[5]

Early life and education[edit]
Altman was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, and was raised in Boston as a Catholic.[3] His father, a food broker, died when he was 10 years old, and his mother, a librarian, raised Altman and his brother as a single mother.[4] He attended the Roxbury Latin School.[5]
He attended Georgetown University, where he met future President Bill Clinton, and earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1967. In 1969 he earned an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, but took time off in 1968 to work in Indiana organizing volunteers for Robert F. Kennedy's presidential campaign.[6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from business school in 1969, Altman began working at Lehman Brothers, where he grew close to chairman Peter G. Peterson. In 1974, he was made general partner at the age of 28—the youngest in Lehman's history. He left Lehman in 1977 to serve as Assistant Secretary for Domestic Finance in the U.S. Treasury from 1977 to 1981 under President Jimmy Carter, for whom he had fundraised when Carter was Governor of Georgia, and campaigned for in 1976, as well as working on his transition team.[5] As Assistant Secretary, Altman played a "role in negotiating the Federal Government's $1.5 billion bailout of the Chrysler Corporation."[6]
In 1981, he returned to Lehman Brothers, where he became the co-head of investment banking and served on the board of the company and the management committee. During the 1980s, he was a lecturer and adjunct professor at the Yale University School of Management. In 1987, Altman joined the Blackstone Group as vice-chairman and head of its mergers and acquisitions advisory business.[7] During the Reagan-Bush years, he fundraised for Democratic politicians such as Vice President Walter F. Mondale, Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis, and Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton. He also advised two New York City Mayors, Ed Koch and David N. Dinkins.[2]
Clinton administration[edit]
When Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, he urged U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to take Altman on as his Deputy Secretary. He was confirmed in January 1993.[8] Once on the job, Altman was viewed as "the favorite to succeed the 73-year-old Treasury Secretary," and he played a large role in some of the Clinton administration's biggest legislative victories, such as the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the "approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement."[2] He was associated with the moderate economic policies of the Clinton administration" and had a reputation as a "deficit hawk."[9]
However, he resigned in 1994 due to the fallout from his role in a record-keeping scandal connected to the Whitewater controversy.[10][11] After nearly 15 hours of testimony in February 1993 before the House and Senate Banking Committees, he submitted his resignation in August 1994, saying that he hoped his resignation would "help to diminish the controversy." He was succeeded by Frank N. Newman, who was the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance at the time.[2]
Return to private sector[edit]
In 1995, instead of returning to Blackstone,[12] he co-founded Evercore, an "independent investment banking advisory firm" in New York City, and currently serves as its Chairman. By 2014, Evercore was "a major player,"[13] and its investment management arm had more than $14 billion in assets under management, with its investment banking advisory arm boasting $1.5 trillion in "announced transactions."[14] Evercore advised General Motors through its bankruptcy, and was paid $46 million by GM pre-bankruptcy. However, when it asked for a $17.9 million "success fee," a U.S. bankruptcy trustee called the fees "staggering," "inordinately large," and "clearly [exceeding] the bounds of reasonableness" given that "Evercore had no success at finding a purchaser or funder for the Debtors."[15]
Politically, Altman continued to stay in the loop. He advised two presidential candidates—John Kerry in 2004,[16] and Hillary Clinton in 2008.[17] In 2010, President Barack Obama interviewed him as a potential candidate to replace Larry Summers as his National Economic Council director,[9] a job that ultimately went to Gene Sperling.[18]
Other activities[edit]
Altman is a Trustee of the New York-Presbyterian Hospital (and serves on its Investment Committee), Vice Chairman of the Board of the American Museum of Natural History, and Chairman of New Visions for Public Schools. Additionally, he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a Director of Conservation International,[19] and an Advisory Council member for The Hamilton Project, a Brookings Institution economic policy initiative.[20]
Altman is listed as a member of the Steering Committee of The Bilderberg Group, a controversial group of influential business and government leaders who meet annually behind closed doors to foster dialogue between Europe and North America. He participated in all their conferences between 2008 and 2016. [21][22]
Personal life[edit]
His first marriage ended in divorce, and he remarried at age 35 to journalist Jurate Kazickas in 1981. The Rev. James N. English of Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church in Washington, D.C. performed the marriage ceremony at the San Luis Rey Chapel at Cat Cay in the Bahamas.[23] They adopted three children. In 1992, he collapsed while jogging in Central Park due to an irregular heartbeat.[6] His hobbies include jogging, skiing, fly-fishing, and tennis.[5]

Sign up   *Invalid email address   Got it   Got it                 By Ezra Klein  By Ezra Klein  September 4, 2012      Roger Altman, co-founder of Evercore Partners. (Win McNamee/Getty)  Roger Altman, a former deputy Treasury secretary and a co-founder of the investment firm Evercore partners, thinks the U.S. economy could be on the verge of an unexpected boom. Here's why: 1. "The housing sector is improving. ... the first signs of renewal have appeared: prices are rising in almost half of the country’s major housing markets. Pent-up demand is huge. Goldman Sachs expects housing starts to hit 1.4m annually by 2015, up from 700,000 this year. After 2015, the total will rise further and boost GDP, as household formation rates and the starts-to-population ratio revert to historical norms." 2. "The breathtaking increase in oil and gas production. Data from the US Energy Information Administration support this. Natural gas output reached an all-time high this year, with shale gas accounting for half of it. On the oil side, U.S. production fell 48 percent from its 1970 high to only 5m barrels a day in 2008. Driven by shale, it is up almost 20 percent from 2008 to 2012. IHS Cera, a research group, projects that oil production will rise another 3m b/d and reach a new high by 2020. Within five years, the oil gains alone could add more than 1 percentage point to annual GDP growth and up to 3m jobs. The fall in natural gas prices will reduce the average utility bill by almost $1,000 a year." 3. "The U.S. banking system has recovered faster than anyone could have imagined. Capital and liquidity have been rebuilt to levels unseen in decades. Legacy mortgage problems are fading. Profits are very strong. Lending is growing quickly: total bank credit outstanding now stands at $9.8tn, according to Fed data, a record high. The proportion of bank lending going to business will next year probably reach a record level." 4. "The U.S. has made a huge leap in industrial competitiveness. Unit production costs are down 11 percent over the past 10 years, while costs have risen in almost every other advanced nation." 5. "The U.S. may surprise itself and the world by rectifying its deficit and debt problems. If Barack Obama is re-elected, he may allow the George W. Bush tax cuts to expire at the end of 2012. That step could force Congress to the negotiating table and produce a large, balanced deficit-reduction programme that would boost confidence, the stock market and private investment." More from Altman here. Is he right? I have no idea. But you don't have to be wildly optimistic about the American economy to expect the next four years to be much stronger than the last four. As I've argued previously, that makes the outcome of this election unusually important, as the winner – and his policy platform, and his party – stands to reap the gains of being in office when the economy finally recovers, no matter whether he or his policies actually deserve the credit.         business  wonkblog     false after3th true          Please provide a valid email address.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).
