Gannett Acquires SweetIQ To Bolster Digital Marketing - Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE:GCI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Gannett Acquires SweetIQ To Bolster Digital MarketingApr.21.17 | About: Gannett Co., (GCI) Donovan Jones IPOs, tech, alternative investments, CEO VentureDeal.comVentureDealSummaryGannett has acquired SweetIQ Analytics for an undisclosed sum.SweetIQ has created a platform for local-oriented businesses to manage their digital presence, reputation and engage their customers and prospects.Gannett hopes to leverage the capabilities in its ReachLocal division as it competes with companies such as Yext for retailer online information management.



 Quick Take Media company Gannett (GCI) has acquired SweetIQ Analytics for an undisclosed amount. SweetIQ has developed a ‘local marketing system’ for businesses with a suite of solutions for marketing and reputation management. Gannett joins a competitive market space with recent IPO company Yext in a quest to be the ‘one-stop shop’ to help local-oriented businesses manage their digital information. Target Company Montreal, Canada-based SweetIQ was founded in 2010 by CEO Mohannan El-Barachi and CRO Michael Mire to help retail chains and marketing agencies standardize company information across the Internet and increase customer engagement across social channels to drive sales growth. The company’s suite of products include:  Local listings management Store locator/Microsites Review management Advanced local campaigns Data analytics Location manager  Below is a brief demo video about SweetIQ’s approach to the shopper journey:  (Source: Sweet IQ) The company raised at least $4.2 million in two known rounds, primarily from Canada-based investors such as Plaza Venture (Matthew Leibowitz), Real Ventures, Retail Group and others.
 SweetIQ’s customer base includes local businesses and Fortune 500 brands with numerous locations throughout the U.S. and Canada. Acquisition Terms Neither company disclosed the amount or terms of the deal. Gannett did not file an 8-K with the SEC, so it is reasonable to assume that the deal amount was not material to its financial operations. As of December 25, 2016, Gannett had $498 million in cash and net receivables and $2 billion in total liabilities, so it would appear that the company had ample resources to pay for this acquisition. Gannett plans to integrate SweetIQ’s solutions into its ReachLocal suite of digital marketing products. Rationale and Commentary In the acquisition announcement, Gannett stated, "The acquisition accelerates the company’s product roadmap and enhances its ability to help businesses measure results of their digital marketing investments." Furthermore, ReachLocal CEO Sharon Rowlands said of the deal,    Businesses want to work with one company that they can trust to help them with all of their digital marketing efforts. This acquisition adds strong product offerings in local listings and reputation management to our suite of digital marketing solutions and strengthens our value proposition with multi-location and national brands. By adding SweetIQ to our portfolio, we can further provide our customers with data-driven insights that drive real-world results.  So, Gannett clearly wants to be that ‘one company’ that can provide a comprehensive group of offerings to retailers of any size. This type of service is similar to that of recent IPO Yext (YEXT). I wrote of Yext’s business and IPO prospects in my article, Yext Sets Proposed Terms For $95 Million IPO. In that article, I highlighted numerous competitors such as Moz Local, Synup, Vendasta, Locu, Manta and LocalSiteSubmit. I also noted Yext’s slowing revenue growth and rapidly increasing Sales & Marketing and G&A expenses as reasons to avoid the IPO. Now, Gannett’s acquisition of SweetIQ brings another worthy competitor to the space. Time will tell if legacy publisher Gannett can finalize its transition from analog to digital, and make inroads in this space.

History[edit]



This section needs expansion with: information on Gannett's early history (1923-1986). You can help by adding to it. (October 2012)


Gannett Company, Inc. was formed in 1923 by Frank Gannett in Rochester, New York as an outgrowth of the Elmira Gazette, a newspaper business he had begun in Elmira, New York in 1906. Gannett, who was known as a conservative,[6] gained fame and fortune by purchasing small independent newspapers and developing them into a large chain, a 20th-century trend that helped the newspaper industry remain financially viable.[7] By 1979, the chain had grown to 79 newspapers.[8]
In 1979, Gannett acquired Combined Communications Corp., operator of 2 major daily newspapers, the Oakland Tribune & The Cincinnati Enquirer, 7 television stations, 13 radio stations, as well as an outdoor advertising division, for $370 million.[9][10] The outdoor advertising became known as Gannett Outdoor, before being acquired by Outdoor Systems (previously a division of 3M), before the company was sold to Infinity Broadcasting, which later became part of Viacom, and was part of CBS Corporation, until 2014 when CBS Outdoor went independent and became Outfront Media.
The company was headquartered in Rochester until 1986, when it moved to Arlington County, Virginia. Its former headquarters building, the Gannett Building, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.[11] Gannett's oldest newspaper still in circulation is the Leaf-Chronicle located in Clarksville, Tennessee. In 2001, the company moved to its current headquarters in Tysons Corner, a suburb of Washington, D.C.
Beginning in 2005 at the Fort Myers News-Press, Gannett pioneered the mojo concept of mobile multimedia journalists, reporters who were initially untethered from conventional newsrooms and drove around their communities filing hyperlocal news via Wi-Fi in various formats including text for print publication, still photos for print and online publication, and audio and video for the News-Press website.[12] The practice has spread throughout the chain.[13]
On March 7, 2011, Gannett replaced the stylized "G" logo in use since the 1970s (notably used on its TV stations as a corporate/local ID with different animations), and adopted a new company tagline: "It's all within reach."[14]
In 2010, Gannett increased executive salaries and bonuses; for example, Bob Dickey, Gannett's U.S. newspapers division president, was paid $3.4 million in 2010, up from $1.9 million the previous year. The next year, the company laid off 700 U.S. employees to cut costs. In the memo announcing the layoffs, Dickey wrote, "While we have sought many ways to reduce costs, I regret to tell you that we will not be able to avoid layoffs."[15]




Gannett Logo used until March 2011.


In February 2012, Gannett announced that it would implement a paywall system across all of its daily newspaper websites, with non-subscriber access will be limited to between five and 15 articles per month, varying by newspaper. The USA Today website became the only one to allow unrestricted access.[16]
On March 24, 2012, the company announced that it would discipline 25 employees in Wisconsin who had signed the petition to recall Governor Scott Walker, stating that this open public participation in a political process was a violation of the company's code of journalistic ethics and that their primary responsibility as journalists was to maintain credibility and public trust in themselves and the organization.[17]
On August 21, 2012, Gannett acquired Blinq Media.[18]
Around the first week of October 2012, Gannett entered a dispute against Dish Network regarding compensation fees and Dish's AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper digital video recorders. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for Gannett's television station. Gannett threatened to pull all of its stations should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement.[19][20] The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.[21]
Acquisition of Belo Corporation[edit]
On June 13, 2013, Gannett announced plans to buy Dallas-based Belo Corporation for $1.5 billion and the assumption of debt. The purchase would add 20 additional stations to Gannett's portfolio and make the company the fourth largest television broadcaster in the U.S. with 43 stations.[22][23] Because of ownership conflicts that exist in markets where both Belo and Gannett own television stations and newspapers, the use of a third-party company (Sander Media, LLC, owned by former Belo executive Jack Sander) as a licensee to buy stations to be operated by the owner of a same-market competitor and concerns about any possible future consolidation of operations of Gannett- and Belo-owned properties in markets where both own television stations or collusion involving the Gannett and Sander stations in retransmission consent negotiations, anti-media-consolidation groups (such as Free Press) and pay television providers (such as Time Warner Cable and DirecTV) have called for the FCC to block the acquisition.[24][25]
On December 16, 2013, the United States Department of Justice announced that Gannett, Belo, and Sander would need to divest Belo's station in St. Louis, KMOV, to a government-approved third-party that would be barred from entering into any agreements with Gannett, in order to fully preserve competition in advertising sales with Gannett-owned KSDK.[26] The deal was approved by the FCC on December 20,[27] and it was completed on December 23.[28] On February 28, 2014, Meredith Corporation officially took over full control of KMOV.[29]
Acquisition of London Broadcasting Company stations[edit]
On May 14, 2014, Gannett announced the acquisition of six stations from the Texas-based London Broadcasting Company in a $215 million deal, including KCEN-TV (NBC) in Waco-Temple-Bryan, KYTX (CBS) in Tyler-Longview, KIII (ABC) in Corpus Christi, KBMT (ABC/NBC) in Beaumont-Port Arthur, KXVA (FOX) in Abilene-Sweetwater and KIDY (FOX) in San Angelo. The company's COO Phil Hurley will also join Gannett to continue his leadership role at the six stations.[30] The acquisition was completed on July 8, 2014; in total, Gannett stations now serve 83% of households in the state.[31] Post acquisition, Gannett now outright owns and operates their first Fox affiliates, KIDY & KXVA.
Split and further deals[edit]
On August 5, 2014, Gannett announced that it plans to split into two independent publicly traded companies, one focusing on its newspapers and publishing, which will retain the Gannett name, and one on broadcasting. Robert Dickey—who currently leads Gannett's newspaper group—will serve as CEO of the former company, leaving Gannett's remaining broadcasting and digital operations under the leadership of Martore. In a statement, she explained that the split plans were "significant next steps in our ongoing initiatives to increase shareholder value by building scale, increasing cash flow, sharpening management focus, and strengthening all of our businesses to compete effectively in today's increasingly digital landscape." Additionally, the company announced that it would buy out the remainder of Classified Ventures—a joint venture between Gannett and several other media companies, for $1.8 billion, giving it full ownership of properties such as Cars.com.[32][33] On April 21, 2015, Gannett announced that the publishing arm would continue to use the Gannett name, while the broadcasting and digital company would be named Tegna—an anagram of Gannett.[34] The split was completed on June 29, 2015. The split was structured so that the old Gannett changed its name to Tegna, and then spun off its publishing interests as a "new" Gannett Company.
On October 7, 2015, Gannett struck a deal to buy the Journal Media Group for $280 million, giving it control of publications in over 100 markets in the Midwestern and Southern U.S. Similar to what Gannett had earlier done with its broadcasting assets, the Milwaukee-based Journal had separated its publishing and broadcasting arms in April 2015, with the E. W. Scripps Company acquiring the television and radio properties owned by the former's technical predecessor Journal Communications and spinning out their respective publishing operations into Journal Media Group.[35] In December 2015, Gannett announced that its local newspapers would be branded as the "USA Today Network", signifying a closer association with the national USA Today paper.[36]
In April 2016, Gannett made an unsolicited bid to acquire the Tribune Publishing Company for $12.25 per-share, or around $400 million. This deal was rejected by Tribune's shareholders in May 2016; in turn, Gannett increased its offer to around $15 per-share (around $800 million). Although the two companies held talks during the summer and into the fall of 2016, disappointing earning reports for Gannett for the second and third quarters of 2016 caused Gannett to pull out of talks on November 1.[37][38][39][40]

Post-split, Tegna retained Martore as the CEO, and Gannett promoted the Newspaper Chief Robert Dickey to be the new CEO.

History[edit]



This section needs expansion with: information on Gannett's early history (1923-1986). You can help by adding to it. (October 2012)


Gannett Company, Inc. was formed in 1923 by Frank Gannett in Rochester, New York as an outgrowth of the Elmira Gazette, a newspaper business he had begun in Elmira, New York in 1906. Gannett, who was known as a conservative,[6] gained fame and fortune by purchasing small independent newspapers and developing them into a large chain, a 20th-century trend that helped the newspaper industry remain financially viable.[7] By 1979, the chain had grown to 79 newspapers.[8]
In 1979, Gannett acquired Combined Communications Corp., operator of 2 major daily newspapers, the Oakland Tribune & The Cincinnati Enquirer, 7 television stations, 13 radio stations, as well as an outdoor advertising division, for $370 million.[9][10] The outdoor advertising became known as Gannett Outdoor, before being acquired by Outdoor Systems (previously a division of 3M), before the company was sold to Infinity Broadcasting, which later became part of Viacom, and was part of CBS Corporation, until 2014 when CBS Outdoor went independent and became Outfront Media.
The company was headquartered in Rochester until 1986, when it moved to Arlington County, Virginia. Its former headquarters building, the Gannett Building, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.[11] Gannett's oldest newspaper still in circulation is the Leaf-Chronicle located in Clarksville, Tennessee. In 2001, the company moved to its current headquarters in Tysons Corner, a suburb of Washington, D.C.
Beginning in 2005 at the Fort Myers News-Press, Gannett pioneered the mojo concept of mobile multimedia journalists, reporters who were initially untethered from conventional newsrooms and drove around their communities filing hyperlocal news via Wi-Fi in various formats including text for print publication, still photos for print and online publication, and audio and video for the News-Press website.[12] The practice has spread throughout the chain.[13]
On March 7, 2011, Gannett replaced the stylized "G" logo in use since the 1970s (notably used on its TV stations as a corporate/local ID with different animations), and adopted a new company tagline: "It's all within reach."[14]
In 2010, Gannett increased executive salaries and bonuses; for example, Bob Dickey, Gannett's U.S. newspapers division president, was paid $3.4 million in 2010, up from $1.9 million the previous year. The next year, the company laid off 700 U.S. employees to cut costs. In the memo announcing the layoffs, Dickey wrote, "While we have sought many ways to reduce costs, I regret to tell you that we will not be able to avoid layoffs."[15]




Gannett Logo used until March 2011.


In February 2012, Gannett announced that it would implement a paywall system across all of its daily newspaper websites, with non-subscriber access will be limited to between five and 15 articles per month, varying by newspaper. The USA Today website became the only one to allow unrestricted access.[16]
On March 24, 2012, the company announced that it would discipline 25 employees in Wisconsin who had signed the petition to recall Governor Scott Walker, stating that this open public participation in a political process was a violation of the company's code of journalistic ethics and that their primary responsibility as journalists was to maintain credibility and public trust in themselves and the organization.[17]
On August 21, 2012, Gannett acquired Blinq Media.[18]
Around the first week of October 2012, Gannett entered a dispute against Dish Network regarding compensation fees and Dish's AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper digital video recorders. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for Gannett's television station. Gannett threatened to pull all of its stations should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement.[19][20] The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.[21]
Acquisition of Belo Corporation[edit]
On June 13, 2013, Gannett announced plans to buy Dallas-based Belo Corporation for $1.5 billion and the assumption of debt. The purchase would add 20 additional stations to Gannett's portfolio and make the company the fourth largest television broadcaster in the U.S. with 43 stations.[22][23] Because of ownership conflicts that exist in markets where both Belo and Gannett own television stations and newspapers, the use of a third-party company (Sander Media, LLC, owned by former Belo executive Jack Sander) as a licensee to buy stations to be operated by the owner of a same-market competitor and concerns about any possible future consolidation of operations of Gannett- and Belo-owned properties in markets where both own television stations or collusion involving the Gannett and Sander stations in retransmission consent negotiations, anti-media-consolidation groups (such as Free Press) and pay television providers (such as Time Warner Cable and DirecTV) have called for the FCC to block the acquisition.[24][25]
On December 16, 2013, the United States Department of Justice announced that Gannett, Belo, and Sander would need to divest Belo's station in St. Louis, KMOV, to a government-approved third-party that would be barred from entering into any agreements with Gannett, in order to fully preserve competition in advertising sales with Gannett-owned KSDK.[26] The deal was approved by the FCC on December 20,[27] and it was completed on December 23.[28] On February 28, 2014, Meredith Corporation officially took over full control of KMOV.[29]
Acquisition of London Broadcasting Company stations[edit]
On May 14, 2014, Gannett announced the acquisition of six stations from the Texas-based London Broadcasting Company in a $215 million deal, including KCEN-TV (NBC) in Waco-Temple-Bryan, KYTX (CBS) in Tyler-Longview, KIII (ABC) in Corpus Christi, KBMT (ABC/NBC) in Beaumont-Port Arthur, KXVA (FOX) in Abilene-Sweetwater and KIDY (FOX) in San Angelo. The company's COO Phil Hurley will also join Gannett to continue his leadership role at the six stations.[30] The acquisition was completed on July 8, 2014; in total, Gannett stations now serve 83% of households in the state.[31] Post acquisition, Gannett now outright owns and operates their first Fox affiliates, KIDY & KXVA.
Split and further deals[edit]
On August 5, 2014, Gannett announced that it plans to split into two independent publicly traded companies, one focusing on its newspapers and publishing, which will retain the Gannett name, and one on broadcasting. Robert Dickey—who currently leads Gannett's newspaper group—will serve as CEO of the former company, leaving Gannett's remaining broadcasting and digital operations under the leadership of Martore. In a statement, she explained that the split plans were "significant next steps in our ongoing initiatives to increase shareholder value by building scale, increasing cash flow, sharpening management focus, and strengthening all of our businesses to compete effectively in today's increasingly digital landscape." Additionally, the company announced that it would buy out the remainder of Classified Ventures—a joint venture between Gannett and several other media companies, for $1.8 billion, giving it full ownership of properties such as Cars.com.[32][33] On April 21, 2015, Gannett announced that the publishing arm would continue to use the Gannett name, while the broadcasting and digital company would be named Tegna—an anagram of Gannett.[34] The split was completed on June 29, 2015. The split was structured so that the old Gannett changed its name to Tegna, and then spun off its publishing interests as a "new" Gannett Company.
On October 7, 2015, Gannett struck a deal to buy the Journal Media Group for $280 million, giving it control of publications in over 100 markets in the Midwestern and Southern U.S. Similar to what Gannett had earlier done with its broadcasting assets, the Milwaukee-based Journal had separated its publishing and broadcasting arms in April 2015, with the E. W. Scripps Company acquiring the television and radio properties owned by the former's technical predecessor Journal Communications and spinning out their respective publishing operations into Journal Media Group.[35] In December 2015, Gannett announced that its local newspapers would be branded as the "USA Today Network", signifying a closer association with the national USA Today paper.[36]
In April 2016, Gannett made an unsolicited bid to acquire the Tribune Publishing Company for $12.25 per-share, or around $400 million. This deal was rejected by Tribune's shareholders in May 2016; in turn, Gannett increased its offer to around $15 per-share (around $800 million). Although the two companies held talks during the summer and into the fall of 2016, disappointing earning reports for Gannett for the second and third quarters of 2016 caused Gannett to pull out of talks on November 1.[37][38][39][40]

Directors and senior executives[edit]
On October 6, 2011, Gannett's chairman, president and chief executive officer Craig A. Dubow resigned, citing health reasons. He was succeeded by Gracia Martore, Gannett's chief operating officer, a 26-year company veteran.[65] Gannett has a ten-member board of directors[66] and 11 senior executives.[67]
Post-split, Tegna retained Martore as the CEO, and Gannett promoted the Newspaper Chief Robert Dickey to be the new CEO.

History[edit]



This section needs expansion with: information on Gannett's early history (1923-1986). You can help by adding to it. (October 2012)


Gannett Company, Inc. was formed in 1923 by Frank Gannett in Rochester, New York as an outgrowth of the Elmira Gazette, a newspaper business he had begun in Elmira, New York in 1906. Gannett, who was known as a conservative,[6] gained fame and fortune by purchasing small independent newspapers and developing them into a large chain, a 20th-century trend that helped the newspaper industry remain financially viable.[7] By 1979, the chain had grown to 79 newspapers.[8]
In 1979, Gannett acquired Combined Communications Corp., operator of 2 major daily newspapers, the Oakland Tribune & The Cincinnati Enquirer, 7 television stations, 13 radio stations, as well as an outdoor advertising division, for $370 million.[9][10] The outdoor advertising became known as Gannett Outdoor, before being acquired by Outdoor Systems (previously a division of 3M), before the company was sold to Infinity Broadcasting, which later became part of Viacom, and was part of CBS Corporation, until 2014 when CBS Outdoor went independent and became Outfront Media.
The company was headquartered in Rochester until 1986, when it moved to Arlington County, Virginia. Its former headquarters building, the Gannett Building, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.[11] Gannett's oldest newspaper still in circulation is the Leaf-Chronicle located in Clarksville, Tennessee. In 2001, the company moved to its current headquarters in Tysons Corner, a suburb of Washington, D.C.
Beginning in 2005 at the Fort Myers News-Press, Gannett pioneered the mojo concept of mobile multimedia journalists, reporters who were initially untethered from conventional newsrooms and drove around their communities filing hyperlocal news via Wi-Fi in various formats including text for print publication, still photos for print and online publication, and audio and video for the News-Press website.[12] The practice has spread throughout the chain.[13]
On March 7, 2011, Gannett replaced the stylized "G" logo in use since the 1970s (notably used on its TV stations as a corporate/local ID with different animations), and adopted a new company tagline: "It's all within reach."[14]
In 2010, Gannett increased executive salaries and bonuses; for example, Bob Dickey, Gannett's U.S. newspapers division president, was paid $3.4 million in 2010, up from $1.9 million the previous year. The next year, the company laid off 700 U.S. employees to cut costs. In the memo announcing the layoffs, Dickey wrote, "While we have sought many ways to reduce costs, I regret to tell you that we will not be able to avoid layoffs."[15]




Gannett Logo used until March 2011.


In February 2012, Gannett announced that it would implement a paywall system across all of its daily newspaper websites, with non-subscriber access will be limited to between five and 15 articles per month, varying by newspaper. The USA Today website became the only one to allow unrestricted access.[16]
On March 24, 2012, the company announced that it would discipline 25 employees in Wisconsin who had signed the petition to recall Governor Scott Walker, stating that this open public participation in a political process was a violation of the company's code of journalistic ethics and that their primary responsibility as journalists was to maintain credibility and public trust in themselves and the organization.[17]
On August 21, 2012, Gannett acquired Blinq Media.[18]
Around the first week of October 2012, Gannett entered a dispute against Dish Network regarding compensation fees and Dish's AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper digital video recorders. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for Gannett's television station. Gannett threatened to pull all of its stations should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement.[19][20] The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.[21]
Acquisition of Belo Corporation[edit]
On June 13, 2013, Gannett announced plans to buy Dallas-based Belo Corporation for $1.5 billion and the assumption of debt. The purchase would add 20 additional stations to Gannett's portfolio and make the company the fourth largest television broadcaster in the U.S. with 43 stations.[22][23] Because of ownership conflicts that exist in markets where both Belo and Gannett own television stations and newspapers, the use of a third-party company (Sander Media, LLC, owned by former Belo executive Jack Sander) as a licensee to buy stations to be operated by the owner of a same-market competitor and concerns about any possible future consolidation of operations of Gannett- and Belo-owned properties in markets where both own television stations or collusion involving the Gannett and Sander stations in retransmission consent negotiations, anti-media-consolidation groups (such as Free Press) and pay television providers (such as Time Warner Cable and DirecTV) have called for the FCC to block the acquisition.[24][25]
On December 16, 2013, the United States Department of Justice announced that Gannett, Belo, and Sander would need to divest Belo's station in St. Louis, KMOV, to a government-approved third-party that would be barred from entering into any agreements with Gannett, in order to fully preserve competition in advertising sales with Gannett-owned KSDK.[26] The deal was approved by the FCC on December 20,[27] and it was completed on December 23.[28] On February 28, 2014, Meredith Corporation officially took over full control of KMOV.[29]
Acquisition of London Broadcasting Company stations[edit]
On May 14, 2014, Gannett announced the acquisition of six stations from the Texas-based London Broadcasting Company in a $215 million deal, including KCEN-TV (NBC) in Waco-Temple-Bryan, KYTX (CBS) in Tyler-Longview, KIII (ABC) in Corpus Christi, KBMT (ABC/NBC) in Beaumont-Port Arthur, KXVA (FOX) in Abilene-Sweetwater and KIDY (FOX) in San Angelo. The company's COO Phil Hurley will also join Gannett to continue his leadership role at the six stations.[30] The acquisition was completed on July 8, 2014; in total, Gannett stations now serve 83% of households in the state.[31] Post acquisition, Gannett now outright owns and operates their first Fox affiliates, KIDY & KXVA.
Split and further deals[edit]
On August 5, 2014, Gannett announced that it plans to split into two independent publicly traded companies, one focusing on its newspapers and publishing, which will retain the Gannett name, and one on broadcasting. Robert Dickey—who currently leads Gannett's newspaper group—will serve as CEO of the former company, leaving Gannett's remaining broadcasting and digital operations under the leadership of Martore. In a statement, she explained that the split plans were "significant next steps in our ongoing initiatives to increase shareholder value by building scale, increasing cash flow, sharpening management focus, and strengthening all of our businesses to compete effectively in today's increasingly digital landscape." Additionally, the company announced that it would buy out the remainder of Classified Ventures—a joint venture between Gannett and several other media companies, for $1.8 billion, giving it full ownership of properties such as Cars.com.[32][33] On April 21, 2015, Gannett announced that the publishing arm would continue to use the Gannett name, while the broadcasting and digital company would be named Tegna—an anagram of Gannett.[34] The split was completed on June 29, 2015. The split was structured so that the old Gannett changed its name to Tegna, and then spun off its publishing interests as a "new" Gannett Company.
On October 7, 2015, Gannett struck a deal to buy the Journal Media Group for $280 million, giving it control of publications in over 100 markets in the Midwestern and Southern U.S. Similar to what Gannett had earlier done with its broadcasting assets, the Milwaukee-based Journal had separated its publishing and broadcasting arms in April 2015, with the E. W. Scripps Company acquiring the television and radio properties owned by the former's technical predecessor Journal Communications and spinning out their respective publishing operations into Journal Media Group.[35] In December 2015, Gannett announced that its local newspapers would be branded as the "USA Today Network", signifying a closer association with the national USA Today paper.[36]
In April 2016, Gannett made an unsolicited bid to acquire the Tribune Publishing Company for $12.25 per-share, or around $400 million. This deal was rejected by Tribune's shareholders in May 2016; in turn, Gannett increased its offer to around $15 per-share (around $800 million). Although the two companies held talks during the summer and into the fall of 2016, disappointing earning reports for Gannett for the second and third quarters of 2016 caused Gannett to pull out of talks on November 1.[37][38][39][40]

History[edit]



This section needs expansion with: information on Gannett's early history (1923-1986). You can help by adding to it. (October 2012)


Gannett Company, Inc. was formed in 1923 by Frank Gannett in Rochester, New York as an outgrowth of the Elmira Gazette, a newspaper business he had begun in Elmira, New York in 1906. Gannett, who was known as a conservative,[6] gained fame and fortune by purchasing small independent newspapers and developing them into a large chain, a 20th-century trend that helped the newspaper industry remain financially viable.[7] By 1979, the chain had grown to 79 newspapers.[8]
In 1979, Gannett acquired Combined Communications Corp., operator of 2 major daily newspapers, the Oakland Tribune & The Cincinnati Enquirer, 7 television stations, 13 radio stations, as well as an outdoor advertising division, for $370 million.[9][10] The outdoor advertising became known as Gannett Outdoor, before being acquired by Outdoor Systems (previously a division of 3M), before the company was sold to Infinity Broadcasting, which later became part of Viacom, and was part of CBS Corporation, until 2014 when CBS Outdoor went independent and became Outfront Media.
The company was headquartered in Rochester until 1986, when it moved to Arlington County, Virginia. Its former headquarters building, the Gannett Building, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.[11] Gannett's oldest newspaper still in circulation is the Leaf-Chronicle located in Clarksville, Tennessee. In 2001, the company moved to its current headquarters in Tysons Corner, a suburb of Washington, D.C.
Beginning in 2005 at the Fort Myers News-Press, Gannett pioneered the mojo concept of mobile multimedia journalists, reporters who were initially untethered from conventional newsrooms and drove around their communities filing hyperlocal news via Wi-Fi in various formats including text for print publication, still photos for print and online publication, and audio and video for the News-Press website.[12] The practice has spread throughout the chain.[13]
On March 7, 2011, Gannett replaced the stylized "G" logo in use since the 1970s (notably used on its TV stations as a corporate/local ID with different animations), and adopted a new company tagline: "It's all within reach."[14]
In 2010, Gannett increased executive salaries and bonuses; for example, Bob Dickey, Gannett's U.S. newspapers division president, was paid $3.4 million in 2010, up from $1.9 million the previous year. The next year, the company laid off 700 U.S. employees to cut costs. In the memo announcing the layoffs, Dickey wrote, "While we have sought many ways to reduce costs, I regret to tell you that we will not be able to avoid layoffs."[15]




Gannett Logo used until March 2011.


In February 2012, Gannett announced that it would implement a paywall system across all of its daily newspaper websites, with non-subscriber access will be limited to between five and 15 articles per month, varying by newspaper. The USA Today website became the only one to allow unrestricted access.[16]
On March 24, 2012, the company announced that it would discipline 25 employees in Wisconsin who had signed the petition to recall Governor Scott Walker, stating that this open public participation in a political process was a violation of the company's code of journalistic ethics and that their primary responsibility as journalists was to maintain credibility and public trust in themselves and the organization.[17]
On August 21, 2012, Gannett acquired Blinq Media.[18]
Around the first week of October 2012, Gannett entered a dispute against Dish Network regarding compensation fees and Dish's AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper digital video recorders. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for Gannett's television station. Gannett threatened to pull all of its stations should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement.[19][20] The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.[21]
Acquisition of Belo Corporation[edit]
On June 13, 2013, Gannett announced plans to buy Dallas-based Belo Corporation for $1.5 billion and the assumption of debt. The purchase would add 20 additional stations to Gannett's portfolio and make the company the fourth largest television broadcaster in the U.S. with 43 stations.[22][23] Because of ownership conflicts that exist in markets where both Belo and Gannett own television stations and newspapers, the use of a third-party company (Sander Media, LLC, owned by former Belo executive Jack Sander) as a licensee to buy stations to be operated by the owner of a same-market competitor and concerns about any possible future consolidation of operations of Gannett- and Belo-owned properties in markets where both own television stations or collusion involving the Gannett and Sander stations in retransmission consent negotiations, anti-media-consolidation groups (such as Free Press) and pay television providers (such as Time Warner Cable and DirecTV) have called for the FCC to block the acquisition.[24][25]
On December 16, 2013, the United States Department of Justice announced that Gannett, Belo, and Sander would need to divest Belo's station in St. Louis, KMOV, to a government-approved third-party that would be barred from entering into any agreements with Gannett, in order to fully preserve competition in advertising sales with Gannett-owned KSDK.[26] The deal was approved by the FCC on December 20,[27] and it was completed on December 23.[28] On February 28, 2014, Meredith Corporation officially took over full control of KMOV.[29]
Acquisition of London Broadcasting Company stations[edit]
On May 14, 2014, Gannett announced the acquisition of six stations from the Texas-based London Broadcasting Company in a $215 million deal, including KCEN-TV (NBC) in Waco-Temple-Bryan, KYTX (CBS) in Tyler-Longview, KIII (ABC) in Corpus Christi, KBMT (ABC/NBC) in Beaumont-Port Arthur, KXVA (FOX) in Abilene-Sweetwater and KIDY (FOX) in San Angelo. The company's COO Phil Hurley will also join Gannett to continue his leadership role at the six stations.[30] The acquisition was completed on July 8, 2014; in total, Gannett stations now serve 83% of households in the state.[31] Post acquisition, Gannett now outright owns and operates their first Fox affiliates, KIDY & KXVA.
Split and further deals[edit]
On August 5, 2014, Gannett announced that it plans to split into two independent publicly traded companies, one focusing on its newspapers and publishing, which will retain the Gannett name, and one on broadcasting. Robert Dickey—who currently leads Gannett's newspaper group—will serve as CEO of the former company, leaving Gannett's remaining broadcasting and digital operations under the leadership of Martore. In a statement, she explained that the split plans were "significant next steps in our ongoing initiatives to increase shareholder value by building scale, increasing cash flow, sharpening management focus, and strengthening all of our businesses to compete effectively in today's increasingly digital landscape." Additionally, the company announced that it would buy out the remainder of Classified Ventures—a joint venture between Gannett and several other media companies, for $1.8 billion, giving it full ownership of properties such as Cars.com.[32][33] On April 21, 2015, Gannett announced that the publishing arm would continue to use the Gannett name, while the broadcasting and digital company would be named Tegna—an anagram of Gannett.[34] The split was completed on June 29, 2015. The split was structured so that the old Gannett changed its name to Tegna, and then spun off its publishing interests as a "new" Gannett Company.
On October 7, 2015, Gannett struck a deal to buy the Journal Media Group for $280 million, giving it control of publications in over 100 markets in the Midwestern and Southern U.S. Similar to what Gannett had earlier done with its broadcasting assets, the Milwaukee-based Journal had separated its publishing and broadcasting arms in April 2015, with the E. W. Scripps Company acquiring the television and radio properties owned by the former's technical predecessor Journal Communications and spinning out their respective publishing operations into Journal Media Group.[35] In December 2015, Gannett announced that its local newspapers would be branded as the "USA Today Network", signifying a closer association with the national USA Today paper.[36]
In April 2016, Gannett made an unsolicited bid to acquire the Tribune Publishing Company for $12.25 per-share, or around $400 million. This deal was rejected by Tribune's shareholders in May 2016; in turn, Gannett increased its offer to around $15 per-share (around $800 million). Although the two companies held talks during the summer and into the fall of 2016, disappointing earning reports for Gannett for the second and third quarters of 2016 caused Gannett to pull out of talks on November 1.[37][38][39][40]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

•Gannett Co. was split off from Gannett in June, 2015.  The remaining media company has rebranded as TENGA and is profiled separately on this database.

2013 and Earlier:
Gannett's IT department leads all internal technology for the company as well as all for its subsidiaries. The data center is located at an off-site location in the Virginia area.

In addition to its corporate headquarters, Gannett maintains a Network Operations Center in Silver Spring, MD. The staff at this location is focused on infrastructure and security. Other IT functions include mobile strategy and operations, desktop services, and corporate telecommunications.

Subsidiaries of Gannett, including USA Today, Gannett Broadcasting, and Gannett Digital, run on IT shared services based at the company's headquarters. However, Gannett does own subsidiary companies that maintain separate IT functions.

Gannett Media Technologies International (GMTI) is located in Norfolk, VA. GMTI develops and distributes software for the publishing industry. Gannett has an online advertising division that includes Captivate Network. The IT staff for online advertising is maintained by upper management who focus on software development and business strategy.

Additionally, regional newspapers maintained by Gannett have smaller IT groups and are overseen by one key person. The upper management for the Lansing State Journal, and Tennessean  also maintain the IT operations for surrounding newspapers in their respective states.

Gannett has various IT directors who oversee different responsibilities like  platform architecture, core business applications, corporate telecommunications, network administration, and  technology planning. 

IT Intelligence Snippets
2013:
• 10-25 tb data volume company-wide across 2 to 5 data centers, and expects an annual data growth of 6-10%.
• 50-74% of its servers are to be virtualized by the end of 2013.
• Corporate IT manages 50 mobile devices, while 15 are managed elsewhere.
• Corporate IT manages 100 desktops.
• Cost is the primary consideration for buying hardware, and it's standardized on 1-2 product vendors.
• Data center strategy is centered on virtualizing x86 servers for most applications; standalone servers or mainframes for business critical applications, standardizing on rack-mount x86 systems and virtualized servers, and minimizing cost.
• Long term plan for running new applications is to add servers and virtualize, but no new facilities are scheduled.

About Us
Gannett Co. Inc. traces its origins to 1906, when founder Frank Gannett and his associates bought a half interest in upstate New York's Elmira Gazette. From that point on, Gannett continued to acquire and oversee multiple local newspapers along the Northeastern United States, and eventually throughout the country. In 1982, Gannett created USA TODAY, a national newspaper that approached content and design in a bold new way.Early on, Gannett established a policy for local editorial autonomy and championed technological advancement at their media organizations—which expanded to their growing network of radio, television and cable stations. As a known leader in the invention and utilization of technology, Gannett continues to set industry standards with its digital and mobile products.On August 5, 2014, Gannett announced it was splitting into two separate organizations. The former head of U.S. Community Publishing, Robert Dickey, was named to lead the new Gannett as its president and CEO.We encourage everyone to be brave, try something new, and have fun while they're doing it. Because following the rules is the opposite of inventive, and we're striving to discover the 'what's next'. We're a collaborative bunch, a performance-based culture, that continually fosters ongoing education and development to keep you inspired. Our goal is to help you create work that you’re proud of, and excel in what we can accomplish together.





Community
