Software maker Astute Solutions will expand its Columbus and overseas offices following an investment from a private equity firm.
The funding from Rubicon Technology Partners LP will be used for product development and to augment sales, said Joe Sanda, who founded the north Columbus company in 1995.

Astute’s software helps brands manage and monitor customer experience at their call centers. It has offices in London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Brazil.
Rubicon, based in Menlo Park, California, says on its website it focuses investments on technology companies with $10 million to $150 million in revenue, making equity investments typically of $20 million to $50 million, with transactions including buyouts and recapitalizing closely held firms.




Sanda, in a voice mail from London, said the investment was not a full acquisition but he did not give other details.
Rubicon this month raised a $216 million fund, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Corum Group, a Seattle-based merger and acquisition advisory firm, said in a release that it  managed the “competitive situation” to choose a growth investor.

Carrie Ghose covers entrepreneurship, venture capital, City Hall, technology and health care for Columbus Business First.
