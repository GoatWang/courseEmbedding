Rare Element Resources Names Lowell A. Shonk As Interim Chairman As Patrick M. James Steps Down






Business Wire




Feb 25, 2015 5:57 PM EST













 


























































  Rare Element Resources Ltd. (NYSE MKT: REE and TSX: RES), a mineral resources company advancing development of the Bear Lodge Critical Rare Earth Project located in northeast Wyoming, reported today that Patrick M. James, Chairman and Director since 2014, submitted his resignation to the Company, effective immediately, due to personal reasons. The Board has appointed Lowell A. Shonk as interim Chairman and will reduce the size of the board from eight to seven.  "Pat, with over 45 years in executive roles within the mining industry, joined our board to share with us his insights on how to successfully transition from an exploration company to a rare earth producer," said Randall J. Scott, President and Chief Executive Officer. "However, because of the professional he is, when Pat felt he was no longer able to give his full attention to this role, he made the choice to step down. We appreciate his many contributions to the board and his confidence in our ultimate success and wish only the best for him and his family. In the interim, Lowell Shonk, a Board member since early 2013, will assume the role of Chairman. Lowell currently serves as chairman of our audit committee and has more than 30 years of experience in financial roles at large, diversified mining companies, like Phelps Dodge and Freeport-McMoran. With this experience he is in an excellent position to help guide us as we advance the Bear Lodge Project."  Rare Element Resources Ltd. is a publicly traded mineral resource company focused on exploration and development of rare-earth element deposits, specifically those with significant distribution of critical rare earths. The Company is advancing development of the Bear Lodge Project, located in northeast Wyoming. Bear Lodge is a significant mineralized district containing many of the less common, more valuable critical rare earths that are essential for electronics, fiber optics, laser systems for health and defense, as well as many evolving green technologies, like hybrid cars, solar panels and wind turbines. Permitting and feasibility work on the Project continue to advance. The Company is a member of the U.S. Department of Energy's Critical Materials Institute, a combined government and private sector organization committed to eliminating supply chain issues for rare earths and other critical elements. Please see CMI's website at https://cmi.ameslab.gov/ for additional details on its mission and members.  For additional information, please visit the Company's website at www.rareelementresources.com.

Rare Element Resources has appointed Lowell A. Shonk, a financial professional with more than 30 years of experience in the mining industry, to its board of directors. He will also serve as the board’s audit committee chair. Shonk is the vice chairman of Cupric Canyon Capital, a private equity company in partnership with Barclays Capital focused on investing in early stage copper projects worldwide. 
PRESS RELEASE
Rare Element Resources Ltd. (NYSE Amex:REE)(NYSE MKT:REE)(TSX:RES) (the “Company”) announced today that Lowell A. Shonk, a financial professional with more than 30 years of experience in the mining industry, has joined its Board of Directors as of April 23, 2013 and will serve as the Board’s Audit Committee Chair. At the same time, Paul H. Zink, a director since early 2012, has tendered his resignation in order to devote his time to his new position as Chief Executive Officer of Americas Bullion Royalty Corp.
Mr. Shonk has held numerous financial-related positions in the last 30 years in companies in the copper, molybdenum, gold, coal, iron ore, industrial minerals and lithium extractive and processing industries, both domestically and internationally. Mr. Shonk served as Vice President of Financial Operations and Analysis at Phelps Dodge Corporation and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold from 1999 through 2009. Prior to that, he spent 20 years in finance roles, including Controller/Chief Financial Officer for various divisions of Cyprus Amax and its predecessor mining companies. Mr. Shonk is the Vice Chairman of Cupric Canyon Capital LP/LLC (“Cupric”), a private equity company in partnership with Barclays Capital focused on investing in early-stage copper projects worldwide. He served as CEO in 2012 and early 2013 and serves as a director for Hana Mining Co. Ltd., a formerly TSX-listed company that Cupric acquired in 2013. He also serves as Chairman of Eiseb Exploration and Mining, Ltd., a privately owned company 55% owned by Cupric, conducting copper and silver exploration in Namibia. Mr. Shonk has a Masters degree from Colorado School of Mines in Mineral Economics and an MBA from the University of Colorado in Finance and Accounting. He is currently the chairman of the audit committee of the Society of Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration (SME).
“Lowell is the definition of the modern miner – well versed in geology but, equally important, possessing the financial background to understand what it takes to develop and operate a profitable mine,” said Donald E. Ranta, Rare Element’s Chairman of the Board. “With his high-level executive mining experience, especially in financing, strategic planning and valuation, we believe he is an excellent addition to the team as we bring the Bear Lodge rare earth project into production.”
Mr. Zink tendered his resignation to the Board on April 23, 2013 in order to focus his attention on developing Americas Bullion Royalty Corp., the mining industry’s newest royalty company. “We are excited for Paul and the opportunity before him. He has been a valuable contributor to the Board in the past year, and we expect that Americas Bullion will benefit as we did from his experience and insights,” concluded Mr. Ranta.
Rare Element Resources Ltd. is a publicly traded mineral resource company focused on exploration and development of rare-earth elements (REEs), with a significant distribution of critical rare earths (CREEs). In addition to the REE exploration and evaluation efforts, the Company controls the Sundance gold project, which is located on the same property in Wyoming.
Neither TSX nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.
