Voice-Automated Production






































 
Skip to content





















HomeProductsSolutionsHow to BuySupportUpcoming EventsNewsContact UsSearchIBC 2017

























VOX and VOX Lite
Turning Listeners Into Viewers WorldwideVOX systems are a breakthrough in voice-automated productions, 
			
			effectively eliminating the need for a technical director during live 
			video productions.









			The intelligence of VOX software auto-detects which microphone is 
			active, triggers a series of camera moves accordingly, and activates 
			Fluent Macros assigned to that microphone. Fluent Macros is a standard 
			feature on any Broadcast Pix integrated production switcher, all 
			compatible  with VOX, to create automatic audio-follow-video. Fluent 
			Macros can be programmed to select camera presets, roll clips and 
			animations, add or remove titles, and even execute sophisticated 
			compositions such as picture-in-picture or a three-box. Plus, multiple 
			macros can be assigned to each microphone - and selection criteria can 
			be established - allowing each automated VOX production to yield dynamic
			live results every time.   

                    
Want to learn more about VOX
























			KEY FeaturesDeliver High-Quality Live Visual Productions
			
Fully automated switching
Up to 22 video inputs
Up to 128 microphones
Up to 12 video inputs
Character Generator included
Up to 180 hours of clip storage
Lots of templates and presets
Control devices; PTZ cameras, recorders, and streamers
Automate using Fluent Macros and playlists
Control panel for manual switching
Link to existing radio automation

VOX ApplicationsVOX can be used in many applications to produce
				entertaining live productions. Any environment featuring multiple 
				microphones can be automated to create video-follow-audio without the 
				need for an operator - saving you time and money at every production. Ideal for Radio Stations, Government Access Broadcasts,
				Corporate Web Productions,
				Auditorium Productions,
				Distance Learning,
				Panel Discussions and more.

Visual Radio User Story - VOX ROCKS the Q-music Beach House



Q-music,
			a radio network in Belgium and Holland, uses VOX to turn its 
			audio programming into online entertainment for its Web-based 
			audience. Since 2011, Q-music has aired live concerts and other events –
			while also streaming video coverage of the performances – LIVE from its
			Q-Beach House in 
			Ostend, Belgium.

Control with confidence: enjoy full movement control from any Broadcast Pix device

Save money on production costs: automate your camera control without comprising quality
Great for any production: from large multi-camera events, like live sports broadcasts, to single camera productions 
Adds future proof technology 


			Control Your Show Cameras By:



			A Professional and Virtual Control Panel
			

			Choose to control your show cameras from any Broadcast Pix control 
			panel using our patented PixButtons and device controls. 

			PixButtons are 
			our dynamic LED displays that show the device or file name assigned it, 
			for maximum switching confidence. Your camera preset positions are 
			displayed across your PixButtons, providing fast-action control over up 
			to 100 different presets positions. PixButtons can also be used to set 
			the speed and movement range of camera panning and tilting. 

			Or if you 
			prefer manual control, rely the dedicated device control area of your 
			panel. Featuring a 3D joystick and knobs, you can manually control 
			almost every aspect of your selected camera including; pan, tilt, zoom, 
			focus, iris and white balance. 


			Multi-View or Touchscreen

			The multi-view display shows thumbnails of each camera preset position. These 
			thumbnails views provide quick and error 
			free camera selections.  In addition, the operator has course and fine 
			adjustment with variable acceleration for creating the perfect shot.
			

			Automation with Fluent Macros
			
			The Fluent Macros process of streamlining a series of switcher moves 
			into one simple step, can further simplify Broadcast Pix camera control.

			automate your next production.

Broadcast Pix's New BP Switch Integrated Production Switchers Offer Full Control-Over-IP
Jun 3 17
Available in FX, MX, and GX models with up to 22 SDI inputs and 12 outputs, Broadcast Pix's Production Switchers enable houses of worship, schools, governments and broadcasters to control live production from control room. Featuring up to eight internal channels for clips and graphics, customizable BPview multi-view and Virtual Studios, units deliver full-motion video and access to all sources through browser-based interface by tablet, phones and laptops. With its new BPswitch family of integrated video production switchers, Broadcast Pix enables houses of worship, schools, governments, businesses, and broadcasters to control a live production from a traditional control room, another facility across the country, or even from home. The new switchers deliver full-motion video and complete access to all sources and workflow tools through a browser-based interface that can be accessed by tablet, phones, and laptops. Broadcast Pix will demonstrate the BPswitch product line at InfoComm 2017 (Booth 4475), which runs June 14-16 in Orlando, Fla. Using the company's BPnet IP ecosystem, BPswitch can be controlled with the Broadcast Pix Commander user interface through Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and other browsers. Commander's simplified and customizable interface help non-technical personnel easily switch live productions, add titles, insert clips, and control robotic cameras. BPnet delivers the new control-over-IP capabilities with ultra-low latency, plus extended encryption and two-factor authentication for secure performance. For more traditional installations, BPswitch is compatible with a range of optional control panels. The 4K upgradeable BPswitch FX, MX, and GX models provide up to 22 SDI inputs and 12 outputs, integrated streaming to Facebook Live and other CDNs, and optional robotic camera control. Like previous Broadcast Pix switchers, BPswitch includes up to eight internal channels for clips and graphics, file-based macros, ClearKey chromakey, Virtual Studios, and customizable BPview multi-view, which can also be used in a browser for easy control of local or remote BPswitch systems over IP.

The upgrade also provides support for Sony IP-based PTZ cameras, including preset positions. Both the cameras and the streaming appliances can be controlled directly through the PixPad. Additional upgrades include new format support, source-based control for enhanced DVE positioning and cropping, and auto-detect capabilities for every input to simplify setup.

Broadcast Pix Reaches New Milestones In Product Shipments


Ships 200th HD system and 1000th overall system to date to WRAL-TV
Billerica, MA - Broadcast Pix Inc. recently announced it has shipped its 200th Slate HD unit and 1000th overall Broadcast Pix SD or HD system to WRAL-TV, a CBS affiliate that broadcasts to the Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina market. The pioneering digital TV broadcaster has purchased two Broadcast Pix Slate 5000 HD live production systems for WRAL NewsChannel, a 24-hour channel offering WRAL news, sports and weather.  The systems will be installed in new chroma key studios built specifically for pre-production of WRAL NewsChannel HD programming, and will go live in December.

WRAL has long been a digital TV innovator, transmitting the first live terrestrial digital signal in July 1996.  In 2005, WRAL began transmitting sports, news and other live programming to Sprint wireless customers using the "News Over Wireless" platform developed by station owner Capitol Broadcasting's CBC New Media Group.  The new Slate 5000 HD systems will also be used for pre-production of WRAL News Over Wireless programming.

WRAL has been a Broadcast Pix customer for three years, using its Slate SD platform for WRAL NewsChannel standard definition programming.  According to Pete Sockett, Chief Engineer for WRAL-TV, cost-savings and single-operator approach of Broadcast Pix drove the decision to purchase Slate 5000 HD systems for his new studios.

 "This all comes down to being a one-man band," said Sockett.  "The integration of a clip store, still store and graphics makes it simple for one person to run the control room.  And compared to building legacy HD control rooms, the Slate 5000 HD reduces equipment costs by as much as $100,000 per studio because it integrates so many production elements into a single unit."

According to Sockett, the new chroma key studios will drive WRAL's focus to produce more local programming without impeding on the production workflow in the main control room.  The compact, single-operator platform of the Slate 5000 HD allowed Sockett and his team to build out "mini studios" for talking head interviews, web programming, News Over Wireless updates, and special green-screen projects.  The Slate 5000 HD is the centerpiece of the new studios.   


The Broadcast Pix Slate 5000 HD is the only live 2 M/E production switcher to include an integrated multi-view monitoring system, clip stores, still stores, character generator and aspect and format conversion. A solo operator can manage complex graphics, animations, clips and effects, as well as control robotic cameras, audio mixers, and video servers. It provides a dramatic improvement over conventional 2 M/E control rooms which typically cost three times as much to buy and three times as much to staff.
