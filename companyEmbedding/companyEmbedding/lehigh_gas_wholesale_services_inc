Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo

Lehigh Gas no more. It's CrossAmerica Partners




Started as a family gas station business decades ago, Allentown's Lehigh Gas Partners has a new name, and new owners.The acquisition of the company's general partner by San Antonio, Texas-based CST Brands was completed this month, and its name has been changed to CrossAmerica Partners LLP. Its partnership units will now trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CAPL.The deal, for $17 million cash and 2.044 million shares of CST Brands stock, leaves Lehigh Gas chairman and CEO Joe Topper in charge of CrossAmerica Partners as its CEO and president. He's now a member of the board of directors of CST Brands.CST Brands CEO and Chairwoman Kim Lubel will become chairman of CrossAmerica Brands' general partner.

"This is a very exciting day for all of us, and signals the start of a new chapter of growth for both CST and the partnership," Lubel said in a statement released by the company. "I am happy to welcome Joe Topper to our leadership team and on behalf of the CST Board of Directors, to the CST Board."Topper said the new name reflects the newly merged company's nationwide reach. "Collectively, CST and CrossAmerica distribute fuel to approximately 3,000 locations in 27 states from California to Virginia, Florida to Maine, and across eastern Canada," he said in a statement.Under the new arrangement, CST Brands, which specializes in developing and operating new gas station/convenience store properties, will build new properties and sell them to CrossAmerica in what is known as a "drop-down" transaction.CrossAmerica will supply the gas stations, and lease them back to CST which will operate them. Proceeds of the sales of the properties will be reinvested in developing new service stations.scott.kraus@mcall.comTwitter @skraus610-820-6745
