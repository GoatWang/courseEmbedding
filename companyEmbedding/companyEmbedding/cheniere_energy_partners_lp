Sabine Pass LNG Terminal
The Sabine Pass LNG terminal is located on over 1,000 acres of land along the Sabine Pass River on the border between Texas and Louisiana, in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. It is located at the widest point on the Sabine River Navigation Channel, only 3.7 nautical miles from the open water and 23 nautical miles from the outer buoy. The channel is maintained at a depth of 40 feet and is not subject to tidal limitations. The terminal has two docks that are recessed far enough so that no part of the LNG vessel will protrude into the open waterway while docked. 
Four dedicated tugs are stationed at the terminal to ensure safe and timely escorts by crews specifically trained to berth LNG vessels. The terminal can simultaneously load or unload LNG vessels from each berth in order to maximize the number of LNG vessels that can be received at the terminal each year.

Corpus Christi LNG
Corpus Christi Liquefaction, LLC (Corpus Christi Liquefaction), a subsidiary of Cheniere Energy, is developing and constructing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal at one of Cheniere's existing sites that was previously permitted for a regasification terminal. The liquefaction project is being designed for five trains with expected aggregate nominal production capacity of up to 22.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG.
The Corpus Christi site is located on the La Quinta Channel on the northeast side of Corpus Christi Bay in San Patricio County, Texas, on over 1,000 acres owned or controlled by Cheniere and is approximately 15 nautical miles from the coast.
Cheniere made a Final Investment Decision (FID) and issued the notice to proceed to commence construction on the first two liquefaction trains on May 13, 2015, and is continuing to market nominal production capacity from Train 3.  To date, 8.42 mtpa has been contracted to third party, foundation customers on a long-term FOB basis under sale and purchase agreements (SPAs). Foundation customers include Pertamina, Endesa, Iberdrola, Gas Natural Fenosa, Woodside, EDF and EDP. Trains 1&2 are fully contracted and Train 3 is partially contracted. Any excess capacity not sold under long-term SPAs to foundation customers is available for Cheniere Marketing.
Our business model differs from other U.S. LNG projects in that in addition to processing natural gas into LNG (tolling model), we will procure the natural gas supply used for feedstock. Once the natural gas is liquefied, the customer takes delivery at the tailgate of the terminal. As a result, Cheniere is expected to become one of the largest buyers of natural gas in the U.S. once all of the trains are operational.
Access to Gas Supply

The Corpus Christi Liquefaction Project is positioned near some of the most prolific oil and gas producing regions in the country. Texas alone produced 27% of total U.S. marketed gas production during 2015, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Cheniere is building a 23-mile 48” pipeline that would connect the Corpus Christi LNG plant to several interstate and intrastate pipelines, giving the facility access to robust gas resources in Texas and the Gulf Coast. In addition, Cheniere has secured transport capacity on third-party pipelines under long-term agreements. Natural gas supply will be purchased from producers and marketers on a short and long-term basis to form a balanced portfolio of natural gas feedstock.

Craft Development Program
Program Overview
Cheniere’s Craft Development Program is a workforce development program tailored to produce the highly skilled welders needed to support ongoing construction in the Gulf Coast and Coastal Bend regions. The program is designed for graduating high school students with welding experience and transitioning military veterans. 
Utilizing partnerships with local community colleges and Bechtel, our EPC contractor, the program consists of two distinct phases: (1) initial welding training at partner colleges or military installations; and (2) customized, advanced welder training at a Cheniere-sponsored training facility.
Once accepted into the program, participants start with structural welding and can advance to combination pipe welding and stainless steel welding over the course of 6 – 18 months depending on their skill level and aptitude. Program participants receive tuition reimbursement during the Phase 1 training and receive full-time pay during Phase 2, as well as additional financial incentives tied to their performance. Successful program graduates could have an opportunity to work at one of Cheniere’s projects currently under construction.

Locally Focused
Recruiting for the Craft Development Program is specifically focused around the communities where Cheniere operates to provide opportunities for candidates from the area. Geographically, there are 3 primary focus areas: (1) Southwest Louisiana; (2) Southeast Texas; and (3) the Coastal Bend Region of Texas. Currently the program is executed through strategic partnerships with Lamar Institute of Technology in Beaumont, SOWELA Technical Community College in Lake Charles, and Del Mar College in Corpus Christi. Additionally, the program sources candidates from over 20 high schools within those areas, as well as Fort Polk in Leesville, Louisiana.

LNG Terminals
Cheniere is among the leading companies in North America strategically pursuing the development, construction and operation of LNG terminals.
Cheniere's premier sites, community focused approach, experienced team and anticipated low construction and operating costs provides the company sustainable competitive advantages. The Company is currently developing, constructing and operating onshore LNG export facilities and related natural gas pipelines located along the U.S. Gulf Coast. The Gulf Coast area is ideally situated for LNG facilities due to its highly liquid markets, with an abundant supply of natural gas and significant network of existing pipeline infrastructure. 
Cheniere's terminal sites are among the best in North America because these sites have the following critical features:

Deepwater ship channels and large acreage positions with proximity to open water 
Substantial local natural gas consumption & existing industrial complexes
Proximity to major interstate and intrastate pipelines 
Abundant and experienced workforce
​Local governments and communities familiar with and supportive of the energy industry 

Cheniere’s competitive advantage is offering attractive options for global LNG buyers:

New source of LNG supply for the global market
LNG pricing tied to U.S. natural gas index
More flexible contract structure, including destination flexibility, ability to cancel cargo lifting with advance notice and FOB purchases of LNG (Cheniere purchases the natural gas feedstock and the customer purchases LNG at the tailgate)
State-of-the-art technology – LNG trains are designed using the ConocoPhillips Optimized Cascade® process

Cheniere recently completed construction of the first 2 LNG trains to have been built in over 40 years in North America at its Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.

Community Relations
Cheniere in the Community
The partnership with our host communities began with our facility siting efforts. The approach was largely educational including the properties of LNG, design considerations and regulations; and Cheniere’s business model and expertise. Cheniere values the relationship that has developed within the communities where we are developing our sites.
Cheniere believes education is the foundation of a strong community, so we look for ways to enhance educational opportunities for individuals. In addition to numerous scholarships and youth outreach activities, Cheniere sponsors other events that make quality educational programs more readily available to the community. Cheniere also understands the importance of medical care and health education to communities, so we partner with local leaders and national organizations to identify high-impact areas for support.
Cheniere is proud of the role we play in the communities where we operate and live - providing over one million dollars to worthy causes in the past 12 months. From rebuilding a children's park in Gregory, Texas, to supporting economic developments efforts in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, Cheniere has established a long tradition of responsible corporate citizenship and will continue to build on our relationships with our neighbors in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, and Corpus Christi, Texas.


Energy Day 2016
On October 15, Cheniere employees participated in the annual Energy Day Festival in downtown Houston. Since its inception in 2011, Energy Day has helped spark students’ interest in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education and the development of new energy technology. It is the nation’s largest energy festival and largest free event of its kind in Houston. Over 22,000 people visited more than 50 interactive exhibits and scientific demonstrations showcasing the ongoing advancements and innovations in the energy sector.
For the third year in a row, Cheniere’s booth was one of the most visited locations of the day. It featured live LNG demonstrations by Cheniere engineers to demonstrate how natural gas transforms into a liquid and its effects on common objects such as a rose, ping pong ball, water bottles and balloons. It also provided an opportunity for employees to discuss LNG safety and how it is will be used around the world.

Teaming Up Against Cancer

On October 15, Cheniere employees, friends and family participated in the American Cancer Society’s Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk in Corpus Christi. The 45 member team walked in honor of breast cancer survivors Iliana Padilla and Amanda Kessler, both spouses of Cheniere employees.

The Cheniere team raised over $8,000, the fourth highest total of the 409 registered teams! This money directly supports groundbreaking breast cancer research, life-saving education, and critical patient services.

Inaugural Sabine Pass Lighthouse Run

On October 15, over 35 employees and family members came out to participate in the Inaugural Sabine Pass Lighthouse Run including 10K, 5K and 1 mile races. Cheniere was a major sponsor of the run held at Holly Beach, Louisiana that featured over 200 runners. Several members of the Cheniere family brought home medals.
The event raised over $30,000 and brought attention to the historic Sabine Pass Lighthouse restoration in Johnson Bayou, near Cheniere’s Sabine Pass terminal. The proceeds are being used to stabilize and restore the notable structure, which was operational from 1857 until 1952.  
“We had a great turnout and a much larger community response than we had hoped for. Without Cheniere and the greater community, this type of event simply could not occur,” said Andy Tingler, Cameron Preservation Alliance president.

Community Relations
Cheniere in the Community
The partnership with our host communities began with our facility siting efforts. The approach was largely educational including the properties of LNG, design considerations and regulations; and Cheniere’s business model and expertise. Cheniere values the relationship that has developed within the communities where we are developing our sites.
Cheniere believes education is the foundation of a strong community, so we look for ways to enhance educational opportunities for individuals. In addition to numerous scholarships and youth outreach activities, Cheniere sponsors other events that make quality educational programs more readily available to the community. Cheniere also understands the importance of medical care and health education to communities, so we partner with local leaders and national organizations to identify high-impact areas for support.
Cheniere is proud of the role we play in the communities where we operate and live - providing over one million dollars to worthy causes in the past 12 months. From rebuilding a children's park in Gregory, Texas, to supporting economic developments efforts in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, Cheniere has established a long tradition of responsible corporate citizenship and will continue to build on our relationships with our neighbors in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, and Corpus Christi, Texas.


Energy Day 2016
On October 15, Cheniere employees participated in the annual Energy Day Festival in downtown Houston. Since its inception in 2011, Energy Day has helped spark students’ interest in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education and the development of new energy technology. It is the nation’s largest energy festival and largest free event of its kind in Houston. Over 22,000 people visited more than 50 interactive exhibits and scientific demonstrations showcasing the ongoing advancements and innovations in the energy sector.
For the third year in a row, Cheniere’s booth was one of the most visited locations of the day. It featured live LNG demonstrations by Cheniere engineers to demonstrate how natural gas transforms into a liquid and its effects on common objects such as a rose, ping pong ball, water bottles and balloons. It also provided an opportunity for employees to discuss LNG safety and how it is will be used around the world.

Teaming Up Against Cancer

On October 15, Cheniere employees, friends and family participated in the American Cancer Society’s Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk in Corpus Christi. The 45 member team walked in honor of breast cancer survivors Iliana Padilla and Amanda Kessler, both spouses of Cheniere employees.

The Cheniere team raised over $8,000, the fourth highest total of the 409 registered teams! This money directly supports groundbreaking breast cancer research, life-saving education, and critical patient services.

Inaugural Sabine Pass Lighthouse Run

On October 15, over 35 employees and family members came out to participate in the Inaugural Sabine Pass Lighthouse Run including 10K, 5K and 1 mile races. Cheniere was a major sponsor of the run held at Holly Beach, Louisiana that featured over 200 runners. Several members of the Cheniere family brought home medals.
The event raised over $30,000 and brought attention to the historic Sabine Pass Lighthouse restoration in Johnson Bayou, near Cheniere’s Sabine Pass terminal. The proceeds are being used to stabilize and restore the notable structure, which was operational from 1857 until 1952.  
“We had a great turnout and a much larger community response than we had hoped for. Without Cheniere and the greater community, this type of event simply could not occur,” said Andy Tingler, Cameron Preservation Alliance president.

Cheniere’s 5th Annual Charitable Fishing Classic
On June 25, Cheniere’s Community Investment Council hosted the 5th Annual Charitable Fishing Classic in southwest Louisiana. Each year, the funds raised from this fishing tournament benefit the Louisiana Heroes Project and Wounded Warrior Association of East Texas and West Louisiana.
Over 100 participants, including many Cheniere employees and 25 wounded heroes, took part in the event and more than $30,000 was raised to support our veterans and current military members.

Firefighter Challenge
On April 29 and 30, Cheniere was once again the title sponsor of the Scott Safety Firefighter Combat Challenge in Lake Charles, Louisiana during the Contraband Days Festival. In addition to sponsoring the event, Cheniere employees participated in the demanding physical challenge as a team and took home first place in the competition. Cheniere understands and values the importance of firefighters and all first responders in the communities where we operate and was pleased to continue this partnership with the Firefighter Challenge.

What is LNG?
Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) is natural gas (methane) - the same clean, safe energy source used to fuel our homes and industries - that has been reduced to 1/600th its volume through a sophisticated refrigeration process that cools the gas until it liquefies (minus 260 degrees fahrenheit) into "LNG".

LNG is liquid natural gas which has been super-cooled to -260°F and changed from gas to liquid 
Liquefaction reduces volume by 600-to-1 
Stored cold in insulated containers at near atmospheric pressure 
LNG is colorless, odorless, non-corrosive, and non-toxic 
Becomes lighter than air when vaporized 

Liquefied Natural Gas is widely recognized as an environmentally friendly fuel source. Unlike other fossil fuels, it is non-carcinogenic and non-toxic. Because it is lighter than air, it dissipates quickly and has shown to pose little threat to marine life when transported. In the history of LNG oceanic transportation, there have been no incidents of containment loss. If such an incident were to occur, LNG would not mix with the water or form slicks that could harm flora or fauna. 
When liquefied, impurities such as sulfur, carbon dioxide, mercury and water are removed from natural gas and safely disposed of. This creates a product that is clean burning and safe for the environment. On average, LNG particle emissions are near zero. When compared to other fossil fuels, CO2 emissions are reduced by 70 percent. 
When in a liquid form, natural gas can be shipped long distances safely and economically in specially designed ships with insulated storage tanks. LNG has the appearance of mineral water and is neither shipped nor stored under pressure. Therefore, LNG fires are highly unlikely because of the extremely delicate fuel to oxygen balance necessary for combustion. The industry has, however, put in place extremely aggressive safety measures to ensure that fires are prevented and spills are contained.

About Cheniere Partners
Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE MKT: CQP) (Cheniere Partners) is a Delaware limited partnership formed by Cheniere Energy, Inc. Through wholly owned subsidiaries, it owns and operates the Sabine Pass LNG receiving terminal and the Creole Trail Pipeline located in western Cameron Parish, Louisiana on the Sabine-Neches Waterway. Its primary business objectives are to generate stable cash flows sufficient to pay the initial quarterly distribution to unitholders and, over time, to increase quarterly cash distributions. 
Cheniere Partners is currently developing, constructing and operating liquefaction facilities (SPL Project) situated adjacent to the regasification facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. The SPL Project currently consists of up to six natural gas liquefaction trains with expected aggregate nominal production capacity of approximately 27.0 mtpa, or roughly equivalent to over 3.5 Bcf/d. Train 1 commenced operations in May 2016, and Trains 2-5 are currently under construction. All regulatory approvals have been received to construct and operate Train 6, and FID is expected to be reached upon obtaining an EPC contract, commercial contracts and financing sufficient to support the construction.

Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. Company Profile

   News  Cheniere Energy Partners LP (CQP), Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD), Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (PAA): Do You Want These 3 “Superior” MLPs for Your Dividend Portfolio?    Published on May 24, 2013 at 9:08 am by  
                                The Motley Fool
                                  in News         Page 1 of 2Next &gt&gtSee All           Today, I’m examining the three MLPs (Master Limited Partnerships) that were listed in a recent article on InvestorPlace.com. The author, Jeff Reeves, likes these three for what he calls their “triple threat” of high yield, good share appreciation, and stability as a company. An MLP is great for an income portfolio because it pays out a large part of its income as distributions to its partners, i.e. shareholders. These distributions are then subject to a very favorable tax treatment, which makes investments in these types of partnerships very attractive. Specifically for MLP taxation purposes, there are two advantages that can benefit the investor. The first is that, as a partnership, the income is not subjected to corporate income taxes, which allows more of the income to be passed along to the partners. Secondly, the distributions of an MLP are not considered income under the current tax code. They are considered a return of capital, and thus are not taxable to the receiver; they do, however, reduce the cost basis of the investment itself. Thus, when the investor finally sells, his cost basis will be reduced by the amount of distributions that he has received, so his taxable gain will be more. Therefore, you will only pay the tax on the distributions when you actually sell your position, and it will be considered capital gains. You will still be assessed a share of the partnership’s actual net income every year, but this tends to be significantly less than the amount of distributions, and is also reduced by the partnership’s deductions for depreciation. So, in my quest to assemble what I call the Perfect Dividend Portfolio, I have looked at hundreds of companies and many MLPs, to see whether or not they merit inclusion. In my examination, I review the companies on seven different criteria: yield, number of years paying and raising dividends, five-year Dividend Growth Rate (DGR), five-year projected Earnings Growth Rate (EGR), total return for the past twelve months, PE, and payout ratio. I feel that this selection covers the past dividend-paying history, the potential future earnings growth, and the valuation of the company. I constructed a ratings system that awards points for each of the above mentioned criteria. A “perfect” score would be 28 points, with four points awarded in all seven categories. The first company on Mr. Reeves’ list is Cheniere Energy Partners LP (NYSEMKT:CQP). Like most MLPs, it is in the energy transportation business. The company is currently trading at approximately $28 and yields 6.20%. It has kept its distribution frozen since 2008, which makes its five-year DGR 0%. The partnership is projected to lose money through all of 2013 and 2014. The stock price is trading at its 52-week high, however, which is up 20% versus a year ago. Other metrics that I use when calculating a rating for a dividend company include analysts’ five-year annual growth estimate (17%) and the company’s PE (37 based on the TTM EPS of $0.77.) Cheniere Energy Partners LP (NYSEMKT:CQP) scores an 11 on my ratings system, mainly because of the fact that it has kept its distribution unchanged for so long. Pipeline companies tend to raise their distributions frequently, and that’s a big reason why I like them. The fact that Cheniere Energy Partners LP (NYSEMKT:CQP) does not follow this trend is somewhat troubling to me, as well as its projected losses for the foreseeable future. The second MLP is Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD), which was the third company that I selected for my portfolio back in December. At the time, it scored an 18 on my system, and I continue to re-score it every few months to make sure it still is performing as I want. The company is currently trading at approximately $61, up from $50 where it was trading when I chose it. It yields 4.30%, it has been raising its dividend for 15 years, and its last increase was the for current quarter, an increase of 1.5%. The distribution was raised every quarter last year and has so far been increased twice this year. Its five-year DGR is 5.7%.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.
