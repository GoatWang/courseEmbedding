A Disciplined Approach, Proven Results.





Established in 1994 and registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, we are independent money managers for institutional, intermediary and private clients.Our investment philosophy is fundamentally based and  time tested.  Derived from years of experience, our "edge" is employing an investment process that identifies high quality businesses with shareholder friendly management teams trading at a significant discount to our fair market value estimate. Risk can be defined a number of ways.  We define risk as a permanent loss of capital.  With this in mind, we take a focused approach when constructing client portfolios and invest with a long-term, partner mindset.  The investment strategies we manage are  focused in nature and conviction-weighted.  We believe value will be realized with time and patience.        
 
"We identify and invest in high quality companies trading at attractive prices. Over time, this strategy has generated superior risk-adjusted returns relative to our benchmarks and the broader market."– Kevin Bernzott, Chairman & CEO

A Disciplined Approach, Proven Results.





Established in 1994 and registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, we are independent money managers for institutional, intermediary and private clients.Our investment philosophy is fundamentally based and  time tested.  Derived from years of experience, our "edge" is employing an investment process that identifies high quality businesses with shareholder friendly management teams trading at a significant discount to our fair market value estimate. Risk can be defined a number of ways.  We define risk as a permanent loss of capital.  With this in mind, we take a focused approach when constructing client portfolios and invest with a long-term, partner mindset.  The investment strategies we manage are  focused in nature and conviction-weighted.  We believe value will be realized with time and patience.        
 
"We identify and invest in high quality companies trading at attractive prices. Over time, this strategy has generated superior risk-adjusted returns relative to our benchmarks and the broader market."– Kevin Bernzott, Chairman & CEO
