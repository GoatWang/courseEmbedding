Loton, Corp. Announces Letter of Intent to Acquire KOKO






February 25, 2014 03:11 PM Eastern Standard Time



LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Loton, Corp. (OTCBB:LTNR) (the âCompanyâ or âLotonâ) today announced 
      that it is has entered a non-binding Letter of Intent to acquire KOKO, a 
      premier multimedia and lifestyle brand and one of Londonâs iconic live 
      music venues. KOKO is internationally renowned for delivering over 250 
      live music events per year for the past ten years.
    


      KOKO delivers a premier program of digital, live shows and TV 
      entertainment to an international audience. 400,000 music fans step 
      through its doors annually to see classic artists such as Coldplay, 
      Pharrell, Christina Aguilera, Prince, and Madonna. The venue is also the 
      home of London Live, the UKâs longest running and internationally 
      syndicated live concert series, which is currently distributed into 300 
      million TV homes globally in over 70 different countries, having 
      featured Usher, Kanye West and Lady Gaga.
    

      KOKO has worked with the finest EDM talent in the world today from 
      Swedish House Mafia, David Guetta, Calvin Harris, Diplo and Skrillex to 
      underground Berlin super DJâs such as Paul Kalkbrenner and French Techno 
      artist Gesaffelstein. The company has enjoyed a ten-year partnership 
      with NME, the worldâs biggest standalone music site, with more than 7 
      million users per month. KOKO and NME have been successful breaking new 
      acts including the Gossip, Bloc Party, MGMT and Hard Fi.
    

      The acquisition will provide an opportunity for KOKO to expand the 
      delivery of high-quality content across mobile devices and digital 
      platforms globally. KOKOâs mission is to replicate the tremendous 
      success of other UK-based lifestyle brands (Virgin Records, Hard Rock, 
      The Beatles, Soho House, and Hakkasan), expanding into the US and around 
      the world. To date, the company has collaborated with several premier 
      global brands including Apple (launching iTunes Festival), Spotify, 
      Diesel, Chanel, MTV, AOL and Virgin Records (40th 
      Anniversary). KOKO will seek opportunities that leverage, license and 
      expand its brand, whether in collaboration with other global companies 
      or on its own.
    

      âWe are excited to announce this letter of intent to acquire KOKOâs 
      brand and venue. Our team will assist in the expansion of Kokoâs brand 
      across the globe and the creation of a 360-degree music platform,â 
      commented Robert Ellin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Loton, 
      Corp. âWe are elated to partner with Olly Bengough, Founder and CEO of 
      KOKO. His track record of building exceptionally profitable lifestyle 
      brands in London fits perfectly with our assembly of a world-class team 
      of executives and board members.â
    

      Loton is backed by Trinad Capital, a micro-cap and small-cap activist 
      hedge fund based in Los Angeles, California. The fund is led by Robert 
      Ellin, a seasoned portfolio manager with 25 years of investment 
      experience. Mr. Ellin spearheaded investments in several publicly traded 
      companies including ThQ, Grand Toys, Forward Industries (FORD), Majesco 
      Entertainment (COOL), Command Security (MOC), Mandalay Digital Group 
      (MNDL), iVillage (IVIL), Points International (PCOM), as well as private 
      companies including iWon.com and SS industries.
    

      Stella Capital Advisors provided advisory services to KOKOâs 
      shareholders on this transaction. Loton has a ninety-day period to enter 
      into a definitive Acquisition Agreement. Additional details of the 
      transaction will be disclosed once an agreement has been executed.
    

About Loton, Corp.


      Loton, Corp. (OTCBB:LTNR) is currently considered to be a âblank checkâ 
      company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the âSECâ) defines 
      those companies as âany development stage company that is issuing a 
      penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) and Rule 3a51-1 of 
      the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the âExchange Actâ), 
      and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that 
      its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies. 
      The Companyâs principal business objective for the next 12 months and 
      beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a 
      combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. 
      The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies 
      to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, 
      may acquire any type of business.

Loton, Corp Enters into Letter of Intent to Sell Its Interest in KOKO 
      and for LiveXLive Subsidiary to Obtain Exclusive Digital Streaming 
      Rights for KOKO Events






September 11, 2015 04:09 PM Eastern Daylight Time



LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Loton, Corp (OTC: LIVX) has entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent 
      to sell its 50% ownership interest in KOKO, Londonâs iconic live music 
      venue. As part of the proposed transaction, Lotonâs wholly-owned 
      subsidiary, LiveXLive, a new live music streaming platform, shall enter 
      into a three (3) year agreement for certain exclusive digital broadcast 
      rights of KOKO events. The proposed sale would strengthen the companyâs 
      balance sheet enabling flexibility with regards to future transactions. 
      Any sale would be subject to due diligence and definitive agreements and 
      other approvals.
    

      âWe are strategically positioning ourselves away from owning and 
      operating venues toward the focus of securing rights, owning and 
      distributing digital content, and becoming a pure play digital company. 
      LiveXLive plans to leverage the mobile device preference of millions of 
      millennial fans, creating the first independent global live music and 
      lifestyle network delivered across all digital platforms. The proposed 
      digital broadcast rights agreement for KOKO events will represent a 
      milestone in our development. We look forward to announcing many other 
      multiyear agreements with leading venues, festivals and content 
      providers,â said Robert Ellin, LiveXLive Founder and Chairman.
    

      LiveXLive is planning to launch this fall with the worldâs first live 
      music streaming platform. Currently, the company is in discussions with 
      content partners, venues and artists from around the world.
    

      KOKO is a premier multimedia and lifestyle brand and one of London's 
      iconic live music venues. KOKO is internationally renowned for 
      delivering over 250 live music events per annum for the past ten years 
      and streaming live music to more than 300 million viewers in 70 
      countries around the globe.

LOS ANGELES, May 13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --Â Loton Corp (OTC: LTNR) continues to expand into live music with the announcement of its new subsidiary LiveXLive. The company's mission is to aggregate thousands of hours of live music and content driven by live music through mutually beneficial relationships with the world's top talent, music companies, festivals, and promoters. LiveXLive showcases professionally produced, innovative, immersive and experiential live broadcasts in HD. Fans have the opportunity to see their favorite festivals, concerts and experiences on any screen they choose across all video platforms and devices from mobile to the home. These fans can view concert experiences from any connected device with exclusive access only LiveXLive brings from the stage to backstage, inside dressing rooms, and places previously off limits to anyone but VIPs and artists.
"We have assembled industry veterans and elite thought leaders in mobile, over-the-top (OTT), music, media, and technology. This world-class team of professionals has come together to deliver a new consumer experience. Similar to ESPN in sports, LiveXLive will provide consumers with the opportunity to view the most sought after live music around the globe via any distribution channel on a 24/7/365 basis," said LiveXLive founder/chairman Robert Ellin.
Live streamed music is the only remaining media genre without a dominant brand. While sports has ESPN, long-form content has HBO, and news has CNN, there is a tremendous amount of the high quality live music content available without a home. LiveXLive is partnering with rights holders and their influencers (agencies, promoters, venues, artists, and record labels) to build optimal digital strategies thereby increasing revenues for participants in the music world. LiveXLive is also developing key strategic relationships in technology, distribution, advertising, mobile, and virtual reality to augment its network delivery strategy.
The existing market is very significant, with over 3,500 festivals and 40,000+ concerts at 1,000+ venues per annum. These events are the basis for the live content provided by the LiveXLive network. The network is launching in the fall with live streaming network focus extending to desktops, mobile devices, tablets, connected televisions, gaming consoles, and virtual reality platforms.
President of LiveXLive and founder of Bulldog Digital Media, John Petrocelli, believes the expansion of the portfolio provides an opportunity to be the leader in live music. "We believe there is a true opportunity to fill the void in the current content landscape that does not feature a true leader for live streamed premium music experiences. In this nascent market, our team has a keen understanding and expertise on presenting this content in today's world of connected devices and social media platforms. We understand precisely how to execute events, series, and experiences that yield unrivaled engagement," said John Petrocelli.
Bulldog Digital Media is led by a team of ex AEG Digital Media executives who have facilitated the live streams of Coachella, Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, Outside Lands, American Express Unstaged, The Grammys, Oscars and Masters, as well as hundreds of premium live streamed experiences. Today, this team works with festivals, venues, and artists to represent their live digital content portfolios to brands and agencies.
The LiveXLive advisory board includes Andy Schuon, co-founder of REVOLT and former head of programming at MTV and VH1, Jason Flom, CEO of Lava Records, Chris McGurk, former COO of MGM and CEO of Cinedigm, Steve Bornstein, former CEO of ESPN and the NFL Network as well as other prominent media and investment professionals.
"LiveXLive is well positioned with a credible team of music, video, technology, and brand partnership executives to become the global beacon for live music fans, and a welcome business partner for the music industry," said Andy Schuon.
"The parallels to the sports industry and the acquiring, aggregating, and curating multi-year rights to content much like our work at ESPN are undeniable. In today's connected universe where there is a passionate, global interest in live music, LiveXLive offers a very compelling proposition," said Steve Bornstein.
LiveXLive will go live in the end of the third quarter of this year.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $    million (or
approximately $    million if the underwritersâ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) from the sale of the shares of common stock offered by us in
this offering, based upon an assumed public offering price of $    per share
(the midpoint of the estimated price range set forth on the cover of this
prospectus), and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to fund working capital,
capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, which may include
future acquisitions of businesses and content. We are in preliminary discussions
with a number of entities, each of which we believe would add content,
technology, subscribers or festivals and venues to our business. However, we
have no present understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any
material acquisition or investment. The amounts and timing of capital
expenditures will be determined by numerous factors, including growth of our
business and cash needs of our business. Therefore, we cannot at this time
estimate the amount of the net proceeds from this offering to be used for any of
the purposes described above.

Our expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. Our management will retain
broad discretion over the allocation of any net proceeds.

Pending use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short- and
intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.
government.


While the broader market for live entertainment remains highly competitive, the
digital distribution of live and music-related video content is still a nascent
market. We believe live streamed music video content is the only remaining media
genre without a dominant brand. We believe there is a tremendous amount of high
quality live music content available to be captured and produced but without a
singular home for distribution and access by the public at large.

We expect to compete for the time and attention of our users with other Content
Providers based on a number of factors, including: quality of experience,
relevance, acceptance and diversity of content, ease of use, price,
accessibility, perceptions of advertisement load, brand awareness and
reputation. We also expect to compete for the time and attention of users based
on the presence and/or visibility of the LiveXLive platform as compared with
other platforms and Content Providers that deliver content through
internet-connected screens.

Our competitors will include (i) broadcast radio providers, including
terrestrial radio providers such as Clear Channel and CBS and satellite radio
providers such as Sirius XM, (ii) interactive on-demand audio content and
pre-recorded entertainment, such as Appleâs iTunes Music Store and Apple Music,
Rhapsody, Spotify, Pandora, Tidal and Amazon Prime that allow listeners to
stream music or select the audio content that they stream or purchase, (iii)
other forms of entertainment, including Facebook, Instagram, Google, Twitter
(including Periscope), and Yahoo, which offer a variety of internet and mobile
device-based products, services and content and (iv) promoters and producers of
content on mobile, online and AR/VR platforms such as Redbull TV, Live Nation TV
and independent content owners. To the extent that existing or potential users
choose to watch satellite or cable television, streaming video from on demand
services such as Hulu, VEVO or YouTube, or play interactive video games on their
home-entertainment system, computer or mobile phone rather than use the
LiveXLive service, these content services pose a competitive threat.

We may also face direct competition from other large live music event
competitors with regards to online distribution of live music and music-related
video content, ticketing and sponsorship opportunities, including from Live
Nation, Anschutz Entertainment Group, and Livestyle (formerly SFX). Furthermore,
there are many smaller, regional companies that compete in the market as well.


Company Description
We are one of the worldâs only premium internet networks devoted to live music
and music-related video content. We intend to fill a market void by becoming a
central content, information and transaction hub for music consumers and
industry stakeholders around the world. We are geared for the


 digital
generation, and our mission is to bring the experience of live music and
entertainment to internet users by delivering live streamed and on demand
content to nearly any internet-connected screen. Our goal is to become a leading
destination for premium music video content on the internet by continuing to
aggregate and create our content, including through strategic acquisitions. We
are also building a proprietary engagement platform that we believe will attract
and retain users, which we believe will allow us to collect valuable user data
and monetize our growing content library through subscriptions, advertising,
sponsorships and e-commerce.

Since our launch in 2015, we have sought to become the singular online
destination for music fans to enjoy premium live performances from music venues
and leading music festivals around the world, as well as premium original
content, artist exclusives and industry interviews. We have live streamed music
festivals such as Rock in Rio, Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival and Hangout
Music Festival, and our platform has featured performances and content from over
170 of the most popular artists in various music genres, including Rihanna, Katy
Perry, Metallica, Duran Duran, Radiohead, Chance The Rapper, Bruce Springsteen,
Major Lazer and Maroon 5. We have successfully distributed such content through
our online platform and major third party distributors such as MTV
International, AOL and Complex Media.

Our content strategy includes continuing to aggregate live and on demand
performance (e.g., on stage sets) and non-performance (e.g., behind the scenes,
interviews) music-related video content from festivals, clubs, events, concerts,
artists, promoters, venues, music labels and publishers (âContent Providersâ);
acquiring and producing original music-related video content; and curating
existing online premium content. In addition to acquiring and/or partnering with
third party Content Providers, our digital studio, LXL Studios, will develop and
produce original music-related video content, including digital magazine-style
news programming and original-concept digital pilots and documentaries.

Our platform engagement strategy is to build a compelling online experience for
our users, anchored by a pioneering website and our custom mobile application,
the âLXL Appâ. The LiveXLive platform will offer access to some of the worldâs
leading music festivals and events with multi-day and simultaneous multi-stage
coverage, unique concerts, intimate performances and premium programming. It
will be fueled by our custom LXL App, which we believe will drive 24/7/365 user
engagement and data that we will be able to convert to earnings and cash flow
through multiple potential revenue streams. We intend to initially release the
first version of the LXL App during summer 2017 on the iOS operating system in
anticipation of Rock in Rio 2017. We plan to release the Android version of the
LXL App and Apple TV, Roku and Amazon Fire TV LiveXLive applications later in
2017.

By executing the above strategies, we are creating a platform that is dedicated
to live music and has the breadth and depth of content to reach and be relevant
to a global audience of all ages.
---

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 28, 2009 and prior to
the completion of this offering we plan to reincorporate in the State of
Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 269 South Beverly
Drive, Suite #1450, Beverly Hills, California 90212, and our telephone number is
(310) 601-2500. We maintain a website at www.livexlive.com.
