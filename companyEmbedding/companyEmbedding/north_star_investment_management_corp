Guiding our clients to their financial objectives

http://www.northstarinvestments.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/commercial.mp4
During the Past 35 Years, We Have Developed a Research Process and a Commitment to Service that is Helping Our Clients Achieve Their Financial Goals.
We established North Star Asset Management, Inc. (NSAM) in 1996 to provide superior investment performance by focusing on internal, proprietary research and investing in high quality, consistent growth companies. We developed a vision of the way we wished to work and how we would help our clients achieve their financial goals. The result is a cohesive, agile firm that invests opportunistically and assertively.  Our success is a product of our experience, continuity, and commitment.
Prior to the establishment of North Star Asset Management, Inc., the five founding principals of the firm had worked as a team of Trust Investment Officers at Associated Bank in Neenah, Wisconsin. With an average of 20 years of investment analysis and portfolio management experience, our group has produced an enviable record of investment performance and client service. 
North Star Asset Management was founded to ensure the continuity of our team of professionals and to improve upon an already solid track record of results and service. The creation of an investment advisory firm with a limited number of clients for each portfolio manager has allowed for an enhanced level of proprietary investment research, expanded flexibility to pursue new investment opportunities, and a greater level of client communications. We remain firmly committed to our philosophy of long-term investment in a diversified portfolio of fundamentally sound, consistent growth companies.
North Star Asset Management is incorporated in Wisconsin and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NSAM advises clients in 34 states and several foreign countries.

Our Approach
Our Equity Investment Approach:
Investing for the Long-Term in a Diversified Portfolio of Fundamentally Sound Consistent Growth Companies at a Reasonable Price. 
We focus on identifying consistent growth companies offering above-average return potential regardless of their size or geographic location.  Those companies typically possess the following characteristics:
 
Sustainable competitive advantage.  A sustainable competitive advantage is what differentiates a company from its competitors.  This includes such things as providing a superior product or service, having the leading market share, being the low-cost producer, possessing a superior distribution system, utilizing better technology, having superior research and development technology, or offering the best customer service.  Trademarks, trade names, and patents also provide compelling competitive advantages.
 
Superior management that acts in the shareholders’ interest.   Management should have a defined business objective and strategy.  It must use the company’s assets wisely and invest to generate superior levels of profit and growth.  They must be innovative and able to anticipate and act on change.  In addition, management must apply high standards of corporate governance and truly think of shareholders as owners of the business. A high level of management ownership in the company better aligns management with shareholders and is viewed positively. 
 
Long-term track record of revenue and EPS growth.  The company should have reported consistent revenue and EPS growth over the past 5-10 years or more.  To continue such a record, demand for its products or services must be growing, as cost containment and margin improvement will not last forever.  The consistency of reported EPS also demonstrates recurring and predictable demand for the company’s products or services.  A company that exhibits this consistency will most likely have below average vulnerability to a downturn in the economy. 
 
Leader in a growing industry.  The company’s end-markets should be growing faster than the overall economy.  The company should be a leader and innovator, not necessarily the largest.  The rate of internal growth (as opposed to growth from acquisitions) is important because it will provide a sustainable annual return and increase the value of the company over the long-term.  
 
Strong balance sheet.  A company with a strong balance sheet (low net debt-to-capital) should have the capacity to finance its growth. A company’s operating income should provide a very secure level of interest coverage under varied economic conditions.  A solid balance sheet will help reduce volatility in reported earnings during an economic recession, as well as reduce the risk of charges from write-downs.
 
Generation of free cash flow – The best businesses tend to be relatively less capital intensive and generate significant free cash flow.  Free cash flow can benefit shareholders in many ways, such as share repurchases, debt reduction, or strategic acquisitions. 
 
Attractive Valuation.  After finding a company that meets most, if not all, of the above criteria, it is critical to investment success to have the discipline to wait for the appropriate purchase price.  Key valuation determinants include a company’s probable long-term earnings per share growth rate, consistency and stability of estimated growth, profitability, financial condition, projected cash flow, and quality of management.  Our valuation methodology incorporates the use of a dividend discount model as well as relative price-to-earnings ratio (PE) and price-to-earnings relative to expected growth ratio (PEG) analysis.
 
Our Fixed Income Approach:
A Focus on High Quality Securities and Duration Management. 
Our bond investment approach emphasizes the generation of long-term, consistent returns within the parameters of individual client objectives.   Our staff has experience in a variety of fixed income disciplines, from emphasizing income and principal stability for conservative clients, to applying active duration management techniques for dedicated institutional portfolios.   Our strength lies in our ability to customize a fixed income portfolio to meet the specific needs of each client.  However, several aspects of our philosophy will apply to all fixed income portfolios under our management: 

Focus on investment grade securities.  

 

Avoid excessive interest rate risk.

 

Maintain adequate liquidity to ensure maximum flexibility.

Permissible investments include U.S. Treasury securities, government agency issues, corporate securities, preferred stocks, municipal bonds, mortgage and asset-backed issues, certificates of deposit, fixed income mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and high quality money market funds.

Our Philosophy
Our Investment Philosophy:
How Your Portfolio Will Be Managed.
 
North Star Asset Management tailors each portfolio to meet the specific needs and objectives of our clients primarily through a combination of high quality, consistent growth companies and investment grade fixed income securities.  Though each portfolio is unique, the majority of the investments are consistent with a model portfolio developed by our team of investment professionals.  We customize the risk of each portfolio primarily by adjusting the level of stocks and bonds rather than changing the mix of individual securities, although each portfolio manager has the flexibility to invest in securities that are appropriate for each clients risk tolerance.  By limiting the ratio of clients per portfolio manager, we ensure that our portfolio managers have the time necessary for properly assessing client objectives and developing and implementing a portfolio strategy to meet those needs.  
 
We utilize a team approach with eleven investment professionals working together to provide personalized portfolio management services by researching and investing in consistent growth companies and appropriate fixed income securities. Each portfolio is guided by a veteran manager with the resources and experience of the entire team in support. All portfolios are reviewed regularly by the entire investment team.
 
Our team of investment professionals evaluates investment opportunities through proprietary, fundamental analysis, involving company visits, input from Wall Street, and the utilization of a dividend discount valuation model.  Our equity portfolios are invested in a select number of stocks representing 15-20 industries.  Holdings of individual securities are generally limited to no more than 7% of an equity portfolio.  This provides sufficient diversification while permitting us to leverage our internal research.  By diversifying between large, medium, and small stocks along with growth, value and international stocks, NSAM provides broad diversification for its clients.  This flexibility allows us to invest in the most attractive companies regardless of their size or geographic location.
 
North Star Asset Management believes in long-term investing.  We have relatively low portfolio turnover, thereby avoiding excessive trading costs.  Our equity portfolio turnover is approximately 20% annually, resulting in an average holding period of approximately 5 years.  This turnover is significantly below industry averages.  In addition to minimizing trading expenses, the low turnover reduces potential tax liabilities.
 
While the firm utilizes a low portfolio turnover approach, it also recognizes the need to be flexible and take action when the fundamentals warrant the sale of an investment.  Other key elements of our sell discipline include disposing of investments when they materially exceed fair value, when holdings can be modified to enhance returns, or when prudence dictates portfolio diversification.
 
Although our dividend discount valuation model and fundamental research provide valuable input and our investment philosophy adds discipline, there are no substitutes for knowledge and experience when making investment decisions.  To that end, our investment professionals continuously review current holdings, security recommendations, and portfolio strategy for each account.

It’s a Profit Thing Published on July 24, 2017







Last Week:
As Navin R. Johnson so famously said in the 1979 cinematic classic “The Jerk”, “Ah…it’s a profit deal”. Whereas there are plenty of reasons to be concerned about the future of our country, stock prices are primarily a function of corporate profits and interest rates. As earnings season progresses, 77% of the companies have reported sales above estimates, which is the highest percentage of companies reporting sales above estimates for a quarter since FactSet began tracking the data in Q3 2008. The blended growth rate is now 7.2%, up from 6.8% the week earlier. Upside earnings surprises reported by companies in the Financials sector were mainly responsible for the increase in the earnings growth rate for the index during the past week. Against this backdrop of terrific earnings, the equity markets set new highs, with the S&P 500 gaining 0.54% and the Russell 2000 tacking on 0.49%. The Dollar declined over 1%, reaching a new low for the year, while the yield on the Ten- Year Treasury slipped 9 basis points to 2.23%. The Dollar weakness may be a long-term warning sign, but according to JPMorgan, S&P 500 earnings typically rise by about 1% for every 2% decline in the greenback.
This Week:
It will be the busiest week of earnings reports for the quarter, with 191 of the S&P 500 companies reporting results. On Wednesday the FOMC will be meeting, with the near certainty that rates will remain unchanged, but with the focus being on the language around economic growth and inflation. The bizarre tragicomedy in Washington will continue, but so far the market has focused on the “profit deals”. Hopefully that will continue.
Stocks in the News:
Farmland Partners, Inc. (FPI): Reported a 90% increase in revenues, and a 51% increase in AFFO (Available Funds From Operations) per share, in their fiscal second quarter. “This was a quarter marked by healthy year-over-year AFFO per share growth. Our second quarter 2017 results are more indicative of our ongoing operations as compared to the first quarter of 2017, which included the closing of the AFCO merger and related integration activities during the quarter,” said Paul Pittman, CEO of the Company.

Tech Rally Resumes Complacency Rises Published on July 17, 2017







Last Week:
It’s early in the second quarter earnings season, but so far it has been very solid with 80% of S&P 500 companies beating the mean EPS estimate and 83% of S&P 500 companies beating the mean sales estimate. Companies that generate greater than 50% of their sales outside of the U.S. are growing earnings much faster than those that are more heavily reliant on domestic sales (11.4% versus 4.5%). The strong earnings reports, combined with dovish comments about interest rates from Fed Chair Janet Yellen, led to another record close for the stock market, with the S&P 500 gaining 1.4% and the Russell 2000 tacking on 0.92%. Technology stocks were back in favor, surging 3.79%. The economic data was less impressive, with both retail sales and the consumer price index coming in lower than expected. The yield on the Ten-Year Treasury slipped 7 basis points to 2.32%, while the Dollar resumed its recent downtrend. The CBOE Volatility Index (the “Fear Index”) reached its lowest level since 1993, after sliding for six consecutive trading sessions. This sense of complacency seems odd, given the relatively high equity valuations, and all the uncertainty in the world. Then again, maybe I am watching the wrong news channels.
This Week:
Earnings might be in focus, with 68 S&P 500 companies (including nine Dow 30 components) scheduled to report results for the second quarter. It is unlikely that there will be any substantive news out of Washington, as the Senate vote on the healthcare bill has been delayed due to McCain’s surgery to remove a blood clot. Fortunately, Senators still have an excellent health plan that is not in jeopardy. The economic data out of China Monday morning was strong, with GDP growing 6.9% year over year. Mario Draghi will be holding a press conference on Thursday, which could provide greater clarity on the ECB’s stance given the recent Eurozone healthy data and rising Euro currency.
Stocks in the News:
Simulations Plus, Inc. (SLP): Net income increased by $171,000, 8.9%, $2.08 million from $1.91 million the prior year, on a 12.2% increase in revenue for their fiscal third quarter.
Health Care Services Group, Inc. (HCSG): Reported that revenues for their fiscal second quarter increased 22%, while net income per share increased 19%. The Company also increased its quarterly dividend for the 56th consecutive time.
Hawaiian Telecom Holding (HCOM): Cincinnati Bell agreed to acquire the Company at $30.75/share, representing a 26% premium to HCOM’s closing price the previous trading day.

No 4th of July Fireworks in the Markets Published on July 10, 2017







Last Week:
The economic data showed a pickup in growth, reversing the recent trend of modestly softer numbers. The most widely watched report, the employment report released on Friday morning, showed that nonfarm payrolls in June rose by a greater-than-expected 222,000, with upward revisions to April and May of 47,000. Wage growth was tepid, however, and there was a continued exodus of prime-age (25 to 54-year-old) men from the workforce, some 21,000 in June, after 92,000 in May. (The saddest thing about that statistic was learning that I am past my prime). Additionally, the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing and services indexes were both stronger than expected. Against that backdrop of a stronger economy, there was continued evidence of the end of easy money. In the minutes from the June Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the Federal Reserve members expressed their desire to begin shrinking its balance sheet before the end of the year. As expected, the markets were very quiet during the holiday-shortened trading week, with the S&P 500 ticking up 0.1% on light volume. The yield on the Ten Year-Treasury jumped 9 basis points to 2.39%, after rising 16 basis points the previous week.
This Week:
Earnings season will kick into gear, with a consensus forecast of 6.5% growth for the quarter, led by a rebound the Energy sector from a dismal level last year. Congress returns to session, with health care reform stalling out again, but perhaps some renewed chatter about tax reform anyway. Speaking of chatter, various Fed officials will be on tour, most notably Janet Yellen will be appearing before the House on Wednesday and the Senate on Thursday.
Stocks in the News:
Hawaiian Telecom Holdco (HCOM): Announced an agreement to be acquired by Cincinnati Bell (CBB) for $30.75/share, representing a 26% premium to Friday’s closing price.
Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc. (RMCF): Net income for the quarter ending May 31,2017 increased 11.2% from the year earlier period, on a 0.3% decline in revenues.
Q.E.P. Co. Inc. (QEPC): Net income for the quarter ending May 31,2017 increased to $2.3 million from 2.2 million in the year earlier period, on a 2.3% increase in revenues.
Movado Group, Inc. (MOV): Announced the acquisition of JLB Brands Ltd., the owner of the Olivia Burton brand, one of the United Kingdom’s fastest growing fashion watch and jewelry brands, for approximately £60.0 million GBP in cash, subject to working capital and other closing adjustments.

S&P Moves Higher Again Published on March 6, 2017







Last Week:
My prediction that President Trump’s speech to Congress on Tuesday night was unlikely to move the financial markets was proven off base as the S&P 500 surged 1.4% the next day on the heaviest trading volume of the year. The trading the rest of the week cut those gains in half, as that index finished up 0.70% and the Russell 2000 finished unchanged. The economic releases continued to support the case for an interest rate hike next week, and the yield on the Ten-Year Treasury jumped 17 basis points to 2.49%. The St. Louis Federal Reserve Financial Stress Index declined for the fifth straight week. An improving economic outlook has led to improving financial markets and lower volatility, despite significant uncertainties.
This Week:
The key economic release will be Friday’s U.S. Jobs report. The consensus is that nonfarm payrolls rose 190,000 in February while average earnings accelerated. Only a dramatically weaker number would derail the Fed’s plan for a rate rise next week. The global political environment remains rife with risks, which the financial markets might focus on at some point.
Stocks in the News:
A.H.Belo Corp. (AHC) reported operating income excluding certain items for the fourth quarter of 2016 (“adjusted operating income”) of $1.8 million, a decrease of $6.8 million, or 79.3 percent, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Despite the soft results for the quarter, the performance for the year showed significant progress. Jim Moroney, chairman, president and Chief Executive Officer, said, “I am proud of what we accomplished in 2016, especially in how we continued to diversify our sources of revenue to make us less dependent on print related revenues.
Detrex Corporation (DTRX) reported an increase in both sales and gross profit for the fourth quarter 2016. “We are positive about the outlook going forward as US domestic markets appear to be rebounding, and work done at Elco during the past few years is beginning to yield results as is evidenced by improved revenue and profitability in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first two months of 2017” said President, CEO and Chairman Tom Mark.
Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc. (HCCI) announced that revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $106.7 million compared to $100.4 million for the same quarter of 2015, an increase of 6.4%.Net income attributable to common shareholders for the fourth quarter was $3.4 million compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $2.5 million in the year earlier quarter. “We are pleased that we were able to achieve record net income during the year.” Mark DeVita, Chief Financial Officer stated, “Along with record profitability we were able to generate improved cash flow during 2016 which will give us the flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities to help grow our revenue.”
Barnes & Noble, Inc. (BKS) reported total sales for the third quarter were $1.3 billion, declining 8.0% as compared to the prior year. Consolidated third quarter EBITDA was $157.8 million, as compared to $169.0 million a year ago. NOOK EBITDA losses of $2.4 million improved $8.8 million over the prior year, as the Company continues to reduce NOOK expenses. Retail EBITDA of $160.2 million declined $19.9 million on the sales decline.
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. (TRK) reported fourth quarter 2016 total revenues of $82.6 million, and net income and adjusted non-GAAP net income of $271,000 or $0.01 per diluted share. The Company also announced that Starting in 2017, Monster Energy replaced Sprint as NASCAR’s premiere racing Cup Series entitlement sponsor under a multi-year agreement. “SMI’s full year 2016 results were within our expectations, notwithstanding an unusually high number of our events contending with poor weather,” stated Marcus G. Smith, Chief Executive Officer and President of Speedway Motorsports. “Eight events during our 13 NASCAR Cup race weekends in 2016 were negatively impacted, including Hurricane Matthew at Charlotte Motor Speedway in October and shortened racing at Texas Motor Speedway in November.
McGrath Rentcorp (MGRC) announced total revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 of $105.3 million, which was unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2015.  The Company reported net income of $9.7 million, or $0.40 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to net income of $11.5 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Company also increased its quarterly dividend by 2%, marking the 25th consecutive year of dividend increases.
TravelCenters of America LLC (TA) reported that Adjusted EBITDA for the 2016 fourth quarter increased by $2.9 million, or 13.9%, as compared to the 2015 fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased as a result of the increase in nonfuel gross margin due to both same sites and newly acquired locations, partially offset by increases in site level operating expenses due to newly acquired locations and a decrease in fuel gross margin.

Lower for Longer (interest rates not stock prices) Published on September 26, 2016







Last Week:
The Federal Reserve held its federal-funds target rate range unchanged, and ratcheted down the expected target rates for year ends 2017 and 2018 to 1.1% and 1.9% respectively. That forecast reinforced the philosophy of TINA (there is no alternative-to stocks), and the equity market responded with another 1.2% gain in the S&P 500. The yield on the Ten Year Treasury dropped 8 basis points to 1.62%, a level slightly lower than the yield back in May 2013 before the tapering tantrum. For those who don’t remember, the Fed announced back then that it was going to start “tapering” its purchase of bonds and the Yield on the Ten Year Treasury doubled over the next three months. It took about 18 months for rates to sink back under 2%, where they have been stuck for the last 9 months. The economic data continued to reinforce the slow and steady narrative, with housing and manufacturing reports that were slightly below expectations. Speaking of below expectations, the Chicago Bears are 0-3 after another sub-par performance last night.
This Week:
The economic calendar is fairly busy with August New Home Sales, Durable Goods, Personal Income, and Consumption as well as September Consumer Confidence, PMI, and Sentiment all expected to be…..slow and steady. Investors will probably be focusing on the Debate Monday night, which is likely to be wild and wacky. History suggests that the market performs better when the incumbent party is favored for reelection. I could say more, but I won’t.
Stocks in the News:
Gannett Company Inc. (GCI) is considering acquiring A. H. Belo Corporation (AHC), the owner of the Dallas Morning News, after talks of buying Tronc Inc. (TRNC) have slowed, according to the New York Post. Gannett, which posted 2015 revenue of $2.89 billion, owns dozens of papers throughout the country, including USA Today.
Truett-Hurst, Inc. (THST) reported break-even results for the year on 19.3% increase in revenues.
Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) looks tasty, according to Vito Racanelli who writes “The Trader” column for Barron’s. I would also highly recommend their Meyer Lemon Chicken. Grill for about 5 minutes on high heat on each side.

Stepping Over the Bar Published on May 9, 2016







Last Week:
Corporate earnings continued to modestly exceed the low bar that was set, as 71% of the S&P 500 companies have reported earnings above the mean estimate and 53% have reported sales above the mean estimate. The blended earnings decline for the first quarter is now -7.1%, which marks the first time the index has seen four consecutive quarters of year-over-year declines in earnings since Q4 2008 through Q3 2009. Seven sectors are reporting a year-over-year decline in earnings, led by the Energy, Materials, and Financials sectors. Three sectors are reporting year-over-year growth in earnings, led by the Consumer Discretionary and Telecom Services sectors. As to valuation, the forward 12-month P/E ratio on the S&P 500 is 16.5, which is above the 5-year and 10-year averages, but still seems reasonable in the context of a Ten Year Treasury rate of 1.78% (down 4 basis points last week).  The big economic release was the release of jobs data which showed that nonfarm payrolls increased less than economists expected, and that April’s job gains were the smallest since September. But the report also had some upbeat news, with both average hourly earnings and the average work week rising, and analysts said the overall slowdown in hiring may temper expectations for U.S. interest rate hikes. The equity markets were soft with the S&P 500 slipping 0.4% and the Russell 2000 sliding 1.43%.
This Week:
There will be a significant amount of Chinese economic data which might influence the commodity markets in particular. Investors might focus on April PPI and Retail Sales to get a gauge on the U.S. economy on Friday. Both indicators are expected to be noticeably higher than the last period. The White Sox will be on the road playing the Rangers and the Yankees, while the Cubs will be hosting the Padres and the Pirates.
Stocks in the News:

Post Brexit Bounce | North Star Financial Services

Post Brexit Bounce Published on July 5, 2016







Last Week:
The Brexit induced sell-off continued on Monday, taking the indices down nearly 6% since the vote, before reversing course to regain most of those losses. By the time traders headed off to the long weekend to celebrate our independence from the British, the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 had rallied 3.22% and 2.59% respectively. Perhaps most telling was the collapse of the VIX (CBOE Volatility Index), the market’s primary measure of investor fear, which registered its largest weekly percentage decline ever. The yield on the Ten Year Treasury dropped 8 basis points, settling in at a historically low level of 1.48%.
This Week:
The minutes from the 6/14-15 FOMC meeting hit Wed afternoon 7/6 (at 2pm ET) and the June jobs report comes out Fri morning 7/8.  The jobs report will likely be more important, as investors are expecting a big rebound for June vs. May, with a consensus forecast of 180K new jobs versus the paltry 38K in May.  The Second quarter earnings season will also kick-off, with particular attention on any forecast changes as a result of EU instability. Brexit fall-out will remain in the news in a variety of forms, such as renewed concerns over Italian banks.
Stocks in the News:
It was a really quiet week for company specific news. Please click on the hyperlinks or contact us for additional information on the highlighted companies.
Ford Motor Co. (F) announced that June sales rose 6.4%, as truck sales surged 24.2%.
Skullcandy, Inc. (SKUL) reported that Mill Road Capital had taken a 9.8% stake in the Company and made an unsolicited buyout offer at a $6.05/share, a price slightly higher than the previously announced transaction with Incipio Group at $5.75.

Minor Slump | North Star Financial Services

Minor Slump Published on May 16, 2016







Last week:
For the third straight week the equity markets drifted lower with the S&P 500 shedding 0.51% and the Russell 2000 1.10%. Sluggish corporate earnings helped set the somber tone, with downside earnings surprises reported by companies in the Financial and Consumer Discretionary sectors. In the Financial sector, the downside earnings surprise reported by Berkshire Hathaway was a substantial contributor to the increase in the blended earnings decline for the index during the week. As a result, the blended earnings decline for the Financials sector increased to -12.2% from -11.7% over this period. In the Consumer Discretionary sector, the downside earnings surprises reported by Walt Disney and Nordstrom were significant contributors to the increase in the blended earnings decline for the index during the week, reducing the blended earnings growth rate for the Consumer Discretionary sector to 18.6% from 19.1% over this period. The domestic economic releases, on the other hand, painted a rosier picture with better than expected April retail sales and May consumer sentiment reports. A string of figures out of China, however, showed that its economy lost momentum in April. The yield on the Ten Year Treasury drifted down 7 basis points to 1.70%. The White Sox lost 4 out of 6 games, but remained on top of their division, while the Cubs continued their dominance. I think the NBA and NHL playoffs are continuing, but we weren’t invited to either dance.
This Week:
The Empire Manufacturing survey on Monday and the Philadelphia Fed report on Thursday will provide the first look at economic activity in the month of May. The minutes from the 4/26-27 FOMC meeting will hit Wed afternoon, and NY Fed President Dudley is scheduled to given an address on Thursday. The upcoming week will be another focus week for retail earnings for the S&P 500, as 12 of the 21 companies in the index scheduled to report earnings next week are retailers.

Half Full Published on June 15, 2015







Last Week:
I was a guest on the WBBM Noon Business Hour. Listen to “Half Full” below.

http://www.nsinvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/6_9_2015-1233pm_WBBM-AM-780-NoonBusiness-Hour_Eric-Kuby-Interview-2.mp3
For most of the week the market embraced our “half full” philosophy sparked by strong retail sales and jobless data; however the “half empty” crowd showed their colors on Friday as the negotiations broke down between the IMF and Greece over the country’s bailout. Call it a draw, as the S&P 500 finished fractionally in the black for the week, and the Russell 2000 gained 0.32%. The yield on the Ten Year Treasury slipped 2 basis points, while Crude Oil gained 1.4% and Gold inched up 0.9%.
This Week:
May Industrial Production, Capacity Utilization, Housing Starts, CPI, and Leading Indicators are all forecasted to show continued slow improvement in the economy. The Fed will be issuing its monetary policy statement on Wednesday, in which no changes to Janet Yellen’s data dependency are anticipated.
Stocks in the News:
Electro Rent Corporation (ELRC) announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share, which represents a reduction from Electro Rent’s prior dividend of $0.20 per common share. “Electro Rent’s revised dividend payment will provide the company with greater financial flexibility to finance our growth initiatives, and pursue business opportunities, including new revenue streams,” said Daniel Greenberg, Chairman and CEO of Electro Rent. “As we work to build strategic relationships with the world’s best test and measurement equipment manufacturers, our team remains committed to corporate growth and to enhancing shareholder value.” On an annualized basis, the current dividend represents a 4.7% yield on the June 11, 2015 closing share price of $10.72 and is the 33rd consecutive quarterly cash dividend paid by Electro Rent.
Crown Crafts, Inc. (CRWS) announced a 5.4% increase in net income on an 8.7% gain in net sales for their fiscal fourth quarter. “Fiscal 2015 was another strong year for Crown Crafts as our adjusted EBITDA reached a milestone of 12.9% of net sales for the year. Our strong performance is a result of a number of factors, including expanded business placements which solidified our position as a market leader. Once again, we finished the year with no debt, and our cash balances increased to $1.8 million from $560,000 at the end of fiscal year 2014. We are proud of our performance, and we believe our shareholders value the long-term consistency we provide,” said E. Randall Chestnut, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
LeapFrog Enterprises Inc. (LF) reported a sharp decline in net sales and a sizeable loss for the year. “Sales and net income declined year over year and fell below expectations primarily due to high carry-forward retail inventories from the holidays, lower demand for our tablets and associated content and the later than planned shipment and promotion of LeapTV.  While we are disappointed with our fiscal 2015 results, we believe that by responding effectively to the changing needs of parents and leveraging our unique assets we can transform our business and deliver enduring growth,” said John Barbour, Chief Executive Officer.
Cherokee Inc. (CHKE) generated a 12% increase in operating income on a 3% gain in sales. Additionally, the Company announced that it had entered into a long-term license agreements with Sears Canada, Argos, and Sports Direct.
Destination Maternity Corporation (DEST) announced quarterly earnings and revenues that declined from the comparable period a year earlier. On the other hand the Company did forecast an increase in both gross margins and same store sales for the upcoming year.
Osmium Partners wrote an open letter to the shareholders of Rosetta Stone, Inc. (RST) in response to the recent takeover rumors surrounding the company. In the opening paragraph it states “Osmium Partners is the second largest shareholder of Rosetta Stone Inc. (RST) owning approximately 9.7% of the shares outstanding. We are not surprised by the current stock price of the Company given the recent changes in strategy, management and new Board leadership. However, we believe the Company is significantly undervalued given the business model shift, value of the underlying assets, and recent comparable transactions. Osmium believes Rosetta Stone’s shares could transact to a strategic buyer at a price of $16 per share or better. Therefore, Osmium encourages an evaluation of strategic alternatives.”
North Star Funds Fact:
Medifast Inc. (MED) sells weight management products directly to consumers as well as through its Take Shape For Life program, a weight loss program utilizing health coaches and Medifast products. The Company sells through about 9,300 coaches and has to constantly innovate its product selection to appeal to changing client appetites. This year the Company rolled out a whole new line of meals, snacks, energy products and sleep aids.  Products such as Gingerbread Soft Bake, Sea Salt Popcorn, Dark Chocolate Dream Bars, and sleep aids such as Melatonin and Stress Relief Gum will make sure users of their products are well fed and well rested.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.
