Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
* Denotes a required field. All required fields must be filled out for us to be able to process your form.

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.

A True Compass to Guide You Beyond the Devastation of Broken Trust. When you experience a betrayal of intimacy in your marriage--whether through your husband's struggle with pornography or through outright infidelity--you need a wise and understanding counselor to guide you safely through raging storms of guilt, anger, bitterness, and resentment. This powerful guide, a companion to "The Healing Choice," walks you step by step through the process of personal healing, leading you to grow deeper in your relationship with God and equipping you to find healthy support in the company of other women who understand your pain. You'll discover how to...- recognize your spouse's emotional cycles and patterns of behavior--and your own- sort through your emotions in healthy and effective ways- gain deeper personal insights through the Bible and prayer- engage in a support group in ways that encourage healing- establish boundaries and ascertain whether it is safe to trust again and more. Created by women who understand firsthand the devastation caused by sexual betrayal, this guidebook offers the practical help you need to move beyond your pain and find hope for genuine healing.

Publisher's Description▼▲
You Are Not AloneIn the wake of betrayed intimacy, you may feel nauseated, angry, humiliated, desperate. Why am I not enough for him? Can our marriage be saved–and do I even want to try? Will this unbearable ache ever go away? Amid the devastation that follows a spouse’s sexual disloyalty, you need to know that you are not alone. God walks alongside you, offering comfort and a promise to transform the pain of the present into hope for the future. In addition, there is a community of women who know firsthand the agony caused by a husband’s sexual compromises and who offer the compassion, strength, and biblical wisdom you need to make healthy decisions for yourself and your family.The Healing Choice reveals the hope-filled stories of two such women, authors Brenda Stoeker and Susan Allen, who draw on their own experiences and those of many others to offer step-by-step advice for rediscovering intimacy with God and finding the support you need to move toward genuine spiritual and emotional restoration.Their down-to-earth insights light the path toward help and healing for every woman who longs to move beyond the pain of broken trust and experience God’s promise of hope.


Author Bio▼▲
Brenda Stoeker is a registered nurse, mother of four, and seasoned marriage teacher with life experience in rebuilding a broken marriage. Together she and her husband, Fred, have counseled hundreds of couples struggling with issues related to sexual brokenness. Susan Allen is a counselor who specializes in helping women create and maintain effective healing groups in churches and communities across the country. With husband Clay, she is the cofounder of Avenue, a ministry centered on healing and restoration from sexual brokenness.


Editorial Reviews▼▲
“A rare, close-up view of the healing journey. Brenda’s and Susan’s parallel journeys–of wrestling with God and of finding support in the community of women–speak of hope in the midst of brokenness, acceptance in the face of unbelievable pain. Rather than allowing the devastation to crush their lives, these bold women chose to place their broken hearts and unmet dreams in God's holy hands. With amazing vulnerability, they show how wives can restore their fractured hearts, recover shattered marriages, and find help and healing regardless of their husband's choices." –Barbara Rosberg, co-host of the nationally-syndicated radio show Dr. Gary and Barb, Your Marriage Coaches and co-author of Six Secrets to a Lasting Love“What an empowering, freeing book! In The Healing Choice, Brenda and Susan open their lives and share how our choice to be whole is not dependent on the actions or choices of our husbands. Healing can begin now! Your life is not on hold until your husband is free. Freedom is yours regardless of where your husband is in his journey. Brenda and Susan, thanks for reaching beyond your pain to pour life into others.”–Lisa Bevere, speaker, cofounder of Messenger International, and author of Fight Like a Girl and Kissed the Girls and Made Them Cry“This book hits very close to home. Fred’s and Clay’s struggle with lust and pornography are very similar to mine. And just like Susan, my wife came to the realization that to heal from such a deception can only come from a deeper walk and intimacy with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Brenda reminds all of us that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ, and no matter what horrible circumstances we may end up facing, whether it be a drawn out tragic death of a dear loved one or a husband who has broken his marriage vows time and time again, Christ ultimately provides our hope of survival. Thank you, Brenda and Susan, for sharing your hearts with us so that we can see how the power of God truly transforms people here on earth.” –Michael O’Brien, singer/songwriter/musician and former lead singer of Newsong“Although it can certainly feel like an overwhelming challenge, complete forgiveness and healing isn’t an unattainable goal. Let Brenda’s and Susan’s insightful book walk you through the restoration process step-by-step. It’s a journey you’ll be forever glad you made.”–Shannon Ethridge, M.A., best-selling author of the Every Woman’s Battle series and Completely His: Loving Jesus Without Limits“The Stoekers and Allens continue to provide a message of wholeness to all who have been fortunate enough to experience their writings. Their contributions to the Body of Christ have been and continue to be immeasurable.”–Mark Gungor, author of Laugh Your Way to a Better Marriage“If a spouse has tragically betrayed you then The Healing Choice is one of the most important books you will ever pick up. What you will discover is that the authors, Brenda and Susan, will sensitively come alongside one of the darkest times of your life and then guide you through what can be a powerfully redeeming journey. Their wisdom comes not only out of their own pain, but from the grace that helped them and those they’ve supported to embrace restoration and hope.”–Randy Phillips, D.D., former President of Promise Keepers, President of Passage

            I found this book very encouraging.  I found comfort knowing that other women are going through the same thing as me.  I found encouragement to continue to trust God and not let my uncontrollable circumstance change my character for the worse.

Author/Artist Review▼▲
Author: Susan AllenLocated in: Northern CaliforniaSubmitted: April     25, 2008    Tell us a little about yourself.  My first passion has been art and residential design. My passion to write came later in life, and was a suprise more to me than anyone.
    What was your motivation behind this project?  The book is a means to share what I've experienced and learned,to offer hope for true healing.I have been teaching and overseeing peer groups for women dealing with this traumatic situation in their own life, after working through it in my life.
    What do you hope folks will gain from this project?  For women to find comfort, direction,hope and companionship to walk through a very difficult season in her life.
    Who are your influences, sources of inspiration or favorite authors / artists?  Highest inspirations are God's love, and the Bible. My close friends are a continual source of inspiration. One of my favorite authors are Ruth Bell Graham, for her frank style, and Francine Rivers for her rich stories.

Published on Dec 10, 2014Susan Allan shows us how to model your own author, speaking and coaching business on the steps that Susan took from an idea 15 years ago to the ground-breaking business as a Life Coach, Author, Speaker and Mediator. Susan Allan is the Founder of The Sales Forum and a specialist in creating successful career and business strategies for entrepreneurs and corporations. Susan is an author and a certified mediator and has created The 6 Part Conversation for Sales and numerous unique skills that allow us to create peaceful and cooperative negotiations, and motivate and inspire anyone to a Close! During Susan’s 20 year career in fashion she and her teams designed and sold over a Half Billion Dollars of her products. She has been seen on Fox News and on hundreds of television and radio shows demonstrating the results we can create when we transform the way we think, listen, speak, and act and focus on solutions instead of on problems!  She has worked with so many celebrities from one of the biggest rock stars, one of the biggest super models and a number of major Hollywood producers and CEOS.  What is the most important part of creating a business as an author, a coach or a speaker? She answers these questions: 1. Where would someone begin; which would be the 1st step, Susan?2. Susan you discovered a number of skills and then you also were able to teach people how to solve problems with those skills; what do you suggest is the next step for someone who makes their own discoveries? 3. Do you mean when they have an AHA moment that this is the time to start their business? 4. Why is an EBook the best 1st step in the business of selling your product? 5. What are the benefits of an EBook over a print book? 6. Do they need to create a print book too and if so how do they do it? 7. What’s the next step for an author to decide if they want to first become a speaker and a coach? 8. Let’s assume that someone has the AHA; they have the system, they have the EBook; and they’ve decided whether to be a speaker or a coach; how do you train them to take the next step? 9. Can you give us another story about someone becoming a coach and creating a coaching business with your help? 10. Can you give us an example of someone who was a recognized expert and you trained her so that she could be a professional level speaker in just a few short lessons?  11.  Susan, I know that you help clients write all their marketing materials and sometimes you write them for them 12. I know that marketing is one of your specialties so please tell us how people can use lead (leed) generation and email lists and joint ventures with success. http://www.heartspacesolutions.com
