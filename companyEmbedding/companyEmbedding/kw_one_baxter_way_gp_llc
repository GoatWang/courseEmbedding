Enteral & Oral Syringes


View Products


IV Preparation & Compounding

It takes spikes, syringes, and pumps to make an intravenous (IV) solution. A pharmacy workflow management system and automated compounding system can help streamline pharmacy operations. Though vastly different, these tools share a basic truth. Behind every IV dose there is a pharmacist and behind every pharmacist there is the means to not only make that dose, but also support pharmacy workflow. 
View Products


Parenteral Nutrition Solutions & Additives

One size does not fit all for nutrition therapy. Prescribing practices are as unique as patient populations, and pharmacies have varying levels of nutrition compounding capability and expertise.  Baxter's leading Parenteral Nutrition Portfolio offers pharmacy technology, premixes and a comprehensive selection of macro and micronutrients to support specific requirements.

Published on Apr 15, 2011Visit http://www.thesmallengineshop.net**Always follow the instructions in your repair manual when doing repair or maintenance work on Outdoor Power Equipment. Manuals can be found at the manufacturers website.**This video is about how to change the oil and oil filter on a 17 Kilowatt Generac Guardian Series generator. Interesting note: Generac doesn't reveal the engines horsepower online in the sales information, and it is not written anywhere on the engine, but there is a way to figure it out. A general rule of thumb for generators is the generator requires a 2 horsepower engine for every kilowatt the generator produces. Another way to calculate the horsepower required for a generator is to use the following formula:HP = KW x 1.34/.70WhereHP = HorsepowerKW = Kilowatt1.34 = horsepower to kilowatt conversion constantAnother useful fact is 1 horsepower is equal to 746 WattsTools Required:- Strap or filter wrench  (Only if you have trouble tightening or loosening the filter by hand).- Pliers (Only if you have problems loosening the drain plug).- Oil Drain PanSpecifications:- Generac recommends using 30 weight oil above 40F and 10W-30 below 40F- Oil Capacity with filter change is 1.7 Quarts- OEM Oil Filter Part #070185F

			The right outdoor power equipment makes yard work much easier and less time consuming. To power you through winter, we’ve got a huge selection of top brand snow blowers, snow plowers, and ice melt products to keep driveways and sidewalks cleared and safe for passage. For year-round maintenance, you’ll find an unbeatable selection of electric or gas powered lawn mowers to make quick work of overgrown lawns, and weed eaters, trimmers, and chainsaws to dispense with unruly grass, weeds, or limbs all around your yard. And if you garden, we’ve got tillers to turn up the soil, and augers to dig post holes for a nice fence to protect plants or property from uninvited guests. Or, rent just the power equipment you need on an hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly basis from your local Home Depot Tool Rental Center.

						Zero Turn Mowers
					





				
				 If you have a large yard, a zero-turn mower can help you cut the grass faster than ever before. Comfortable, quick and easy to use, today’s mowers can take the headache out of lawn maintenance.Mow More EfficientlyZero-turn mowers get their name from the superior control they offer with a turning radius of zero. These lawn tractors give you the ability to work easily around trees, shrubs and other obstacles. They also provide cutting paths of 48 inches and wider, so you can cover more ground quickly and reduce the amount of time you spend mowing.Most zero-turn riding mowers come with powerful engines of 20 horsepower or more, so they can run fast on open lawns. This makes them ideal for large, flat yards.Go for Comfort and UtilityWhen you’re cutting a large lawn, you’ll want to be comfortable. Look for features like high-backed, adjustable seats, as well as rubber foot pads, adjustable control levers and padded steering wheels to maximize comfort.Consider an automatic or hydrostatic transmission so you can easily adjust your speed without shifting. These models are operated by hand levers or foot pedals for precision control.Many zero-radius mowers, such as models from Toro, also include a rear hitch for pulling attachments like carts, aerators, lawn sprayers and leaf sweepers. For added convenience, a number of Cub Cadet zero-turn mowers even have Bluetooth connectivity to monitor your mower. To learn more about maintaining your mower, be sure to check out the tips in our project guide.
