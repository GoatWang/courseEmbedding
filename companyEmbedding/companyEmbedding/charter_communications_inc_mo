Hover To View Details About Individual Features




Voicemail


Think of this as your personal answering service. Whenever your line is busy or you are away from the phone, callers can simply leave a message. The phone will alert you about new voice messages by using a stutter dial tone.





Call Waiting


Don’t miss incoming calls while you are using the phone. The Call Waiting feature of Charter Spectrum Voice will indicate another incoming call with a soft beep.





Caller ID


Charter Spectrum Voice displays the caller’s name and phone number on your phone unit’s display.





Call Waiting with Caller ID


The Caller ID feature works with Call Waiting. Charter Spectrum Voice lets you check whose call is waiting on the line and lets you decide whether you will take the call or not.





All Call Forwarding


Forward all incoming calls to another number so you don’t end up missing any important calls when you are away from home.





Selective Call Forwarding

Activate call forwarding only for specific groups of contacts. 




Block Anonymous Calls

Automatically reject incoming calls from people who choose to hide Caller ID functions. The anonymous caller will receive a message informing them that your number is programmed to reject Caller ID blocked calls and they should unblock their number and try again. 




Block Unwanted Callers

Block unwelcome calls by rerouting designated numbers. The blocked caller will hear a polite short message stating that you are not receiving calls at the moment.




VIP Ringing

Assign a unique ringtone to a specific number to identify the call without needing Caller ID.




Speed Dial

Program up to eight different numbers into your phone unit and call your favorite contacts with one-touch dialing.




Accept Selected Callers

Only accept incoming calls from a pre-selected set of contacts. All other callers will hear a short message informing them that you are not receiving calls at the moment. 




3-Way Calling

Speak to two callers at the same time with the Charter Spectrum Voice crystal clear 3-Way Calling. You can also place one of the active parties on hold to speak privately and later on resume the 3-way call.




Repeat Dialing*

Automatically redial a busy number until the call gets through. You will receive a notification when the call is successfully patched through the network.
*Please note this is a pay-per-use feature. Each usage event costs 90 cents and your monthly limit for Repeat Dialing is $9/month.





Voice Online Manager

Manage your home phone on the go as well as at home with the Voice Online Manager. This feature is available to all Charter Spectrum Voice customers absolutely free.




Readable Voicemail

We also own and operate regional sports networks and local sports, news and community channels and sell security and home management services to the residential marketplace. See  "Part I. Item 1. Business - Products and Services" for further description of these services, including customer statistics for different services.  Since 2012, Legacy Charter has actively invested in its network and operations and improved the quality and value of the products and packages that Legacy Charter offered. Through the roll-out of Spectrum pricing and packaging we have simplified our offers and improved our packaging of products, delivering more value to new and existing customers. Further, through the transition of our Legacy Charter markets to our all-digital platform, we increased our offerings to more than 200 HD channels in most of the Legacy Charter markets and offered Internet speeds of at least 60 or 100 Mbps, among other benefits. We believe that this product set combined with improved customer service, as we insource our workforce in our call centers and in our field operations, has led to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes.  As a result of the Transactions, 2016 revenues increased by over $18.6 billion year over year. We also saw an increase in expenses related to our increased scale. In September 2016, we began launching SPP to Legacy TWC markets and we expect that by mid 2017, we will offer SPP in all Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets. In 2017, we intend to begin converting the remaining Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House analog markets to an all-digital platform. Our corporate organization, as well as our marketing, sales and product development departments, are now centralized. Field operations are managed through eleven regional areas, each designed to represent a combination of designated marketing areas and managed with largely the same set of field employees that were with the three legacy companies prior to completion of the Transactions. Over a multi-year period, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House customer care centers will migrate to Legacy Charter's model of using segmented, virtualized, U.S.-based in-house call centers. We will focus on deploying superior products and service with minimal service disruptions as we integrate our information technology and network operations. We expect customer and financial results to trend similar to Legacy Charter following the implementation of the Legacy Charter operating strategies across the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets. As a result of implementing our operating strategy at Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House, we cannot be certain that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates.  The Company realized revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations during the periods presented as follows (in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers. Minor differences may exist due to rounding).   Years ended December 31, Growth 2016 2015 2014 2016 over 2015 2015 over 2014 Actual Revenues $ 29,003 $ 9,754 $ 9,108 197.3 % 7.1 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 10,592 $ 3,406 $ 3,190 211.0 % 6.8 % Income from operations $ 3,355 $ 1,114 $ 971 201.3 % 14.8 % Pro Forma Revenues $ 40,023 $ 37,394 7.0 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 14,464 $ 13,004 11.2 % Income from operations $ 4,801 $ 3,396 41.4 %  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, net, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, other pension benefits, special charges and gain  On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, total revenue growth was primarily due to growth in our Internet and commercial businesses. On a pro forma basis, Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily due to an increase in residential and commercial revenues offset by increases in programming costs and other operating costs. In addition to the factors discussed above, income from operations on a pro forma basis was affected by increases in depreciation and amortization, merger and restructuring costs and stock compensation expense.  Approximately 90%, 91% and 90% of our revenues for years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video, Internet, voice and commercial services provided by our cable systems. Generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for  certain commercial customers. The remaining 10%, 9% and 10% of revenue for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then paid to local authorities), pay-per-view and VOD programming, installation, processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services.  We incurred the following transition costs in connection with the Transactions (in millions).   Years ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Operating expenses $ 156 $ 72 $ 14 Other operating expenses $ 970 $ 70 $ 38 Interest expense $ 390 $ 521 $ 75 Capital expenditures $ 460 $ 115 $ 27  Amounts included in transition operating expenses and transition capital expenditures represent incremental costs incurred to integrate the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House operations and to bring the three companies' systems and processes into a uniform operating structure. Costs are incremental and would not be incurred absent the integration. Other operating expenses associated with the Transactions represent merger and restructuring costs and include advisory, legal and accounting fees, employee retention costs, employee termination costs and other exit costs. Interest expense associated with the Transactions represents interest incurred on the CCO Safari II, CCO Safari III and CCOH Safari notes issued in advance of the closing of the Transactions, the proceeds of which were held in escrow to finance the Transactions.  We have a history of net losses. Our net losses were principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expenses, interest expenses that we incur on our debt, depreciation expenses resulting from the capital investments we have made, and continue to make, in our cable properties, amortization expenses related to our customer relationship intangibles and higher non-cash income tax expense. We will incur significant increases in interest expense and depreciation and amortization as a result of the Transactions and will incur restructuring and transition costs for at least one to two years, and as a result, absent non-recurring impacts such as the reversal of the income tax valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2016, we may incur net losses in the future.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Certain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. Management has discussed these policies with the Audit Committee of Charter's board of directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the following disclosure. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates, assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements, and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows:   Property, plant and equipment   Capitalization of labor and overhead costs   Valuation and impairment of property, plant and equipment   Useful lives of property, plant and equipment   Intangible assets   Valuation and impairment of franchises   Valuation and impairment of goodwill   Valuation and impairment and amortization of customer relationships   Income taxes   Litigation   Programming agreements   Pension plans  In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimates or judgment that are not deemed critical, such as the allowance for doubtful accounts and valuations of our financial instruments, but changes in estimates or judgment in these other items could also have a material impact on our financial statements.  Property, plant and equipment  The cable industry is capital intensive, and a large portion of our resources are spent on capital activities associated with extending, rebuilding, and upgrading our cable network. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment (consisting primarily of cable distribution systems) was approximately $33.0 billion (representing 22% of total assets) and $8.3 billion (representing 49% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. Total capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $5.3 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.  Capitalization of labor and overhead costs. Costs associated with network construction, initial placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the initial placement of outlets within a dwelling along with the costs associated with the initial deployment of customer premise equipment necessary to provide video, Internet or voices services, are capitalized. Costs capitalized include materials, direct labor, and certain indirect costs. These indirect costs are associated with the activities of personnel who assist in installation activities, and consist of compensation and overhead costs associated with these support functions. While our capitalization is based on specific activities, once capitalized, we track these costs on a composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level, and not on a specific asset basis. For assets that are sold or retired, we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation. The costs of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from a dwelling and the costs to reconnect a customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expensed as incurred. Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while plant and equipment replacement, including replacement of certain components, betterments, and replacement of cable drops and outlets, are capitalized.  We make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized. We capitalize direct labor and overhead using standards developed from actual costs and applicable operational data. We calculate standards annually (or more frequently if circumstances dictate) for items such as the labor rates, overhead rates, and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity. For example, the standard amounts of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on studies of the time required to perform such activities. Overhead rates are established based on an analysis of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable activities, and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities. The impact of changes that resulted from these studies were not material in the periods presented.  Labor costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized. Capitalizable activities performed in connection with installations include such activities as:   dispatching a "truck roll" to the customer's dwelling or business for service connection or placement of new equipment; verification of serviceability to the customer's dwelling or business (i.e., determining whether the customer's dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network and/or receiving advanced or Internet services); customer premise activities performed by in-house field technicians and third-party contractors in connection with customer installations, installation of equipment in connection with the installation of video, Internet or voice services, and equipment replacement and betterment; and verifying the integrity of the customer's network connection by initiating test signals downstream from the headend to the customer's digital set-top box, as well as testing signal levels at the pole or pedestal.  Judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead costs incurred result from specific capital activities, and therefore should be capitalized. The primary costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities,  While we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant change in the nature or extent of our system activities could affect management's judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future. We monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies, and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies. We capitalized direct labor and overhead of $991 million, $420 million and $427 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.  Valuation and impairment of property, plant and equipment. We evaluate the recoverability of our property, plant and equipment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors as the impairment of our indefinite life franchises, changes in technological advances, fluctuations in the fair value of such assets, adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities, adverse changes in market conditions, or a deterioration of current or expected future operating results. A long-lived  asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset. No impairments of long-lived assets to be held and used were recorded in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.  We utilize the cost approach as the primary method used to establish fair value for our property, plant and equipment in connection with business combinations. The cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility, then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation and functional and economic obsolescence as of the appraisal date. The cost approach relies on management's assumptions regarding current material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of our property, plant and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.  Useful lives of property, plant and equipment. We evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment, based on annual analysis of such useful lives, and revise such lives to the extent warranted by changing facts and circumstances. Any changes in estimated useful lives as a result of this analysis are reflected prospectively beginning in the period in which the study is completed. Our analysis of useful lives in 2016 did not indicate a change in useful lives. The effect of a one-year decrease in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2016 would be an increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately $1.7 billion. The effect of a one-year increase in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2016 would be a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately $863 million.  Depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment totaled $5.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing approximately 19%, 21% and 22% of costs and expenses, respectively. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line composite method over management's estimate of the useful lives of the related assets as listed below:  Cable distribution systems 7-20 years Customer premise equipment and installations 3-8 years Vehicles and equipment 3-6 years Buildings and improvements 15-40 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 6-10 years  Intangible assets  Valuation and impairment of franchises. The net carrying value of franchises as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $67.3 billion (representing 45% of total assets) and $6.0 billion (representing 35% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. For more information and a complete discussion of how we value and test franchise assets for impairment, see Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."  We perform an impairment assessment of franchise assets annually or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances. We performed a qualitative assessment in 2016. Our assessment included consideration of the fair value appraisals of Legacy Charter and the newly-acquired operations performed as of the date of acquisition for tax and acquisition accounting purposes, respectively, along with a multitude of factors that affect the fair value of our franchise assets. Examples of such factors include environmental and competitive changes within our operating footprint, actual and projected operating performance, the consistency of our operating margins, equity and debt market trends, including changes in our market capitalization, and changes in our regulatory and political landscape, among other factors. Based on our assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our franchise assets equals or exceeds their carrying values and that a quantitative impairment test is not required.  The appraisals indicated that the fair value of our franchise assets exceeded carrying value by approximately 25% in the aggregate, with the excess entirely attributable to the franchise assets of Legacy Charter to which acquisition accounting was not applied. At our unit of accounting level for franchise asset impairment testing, the amount by which fair value exceeds carrying value varies based on the extent to which the unit of accounting was comprised of newly-acquired operations. For units of accounting comprised entirely or substantially of newly-acquired operations, we believe the carrying value approximates the fair value given that there has been no significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates since the Transaction date. For units of accounting comprised of at least 25% Legacy Charter operations, the fair value exceeded carrying value by a range of 36% to 260%.  Valuation and impairment of goodwill. The net carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $29.5 billion (representing 20% of total assets) and $1.2 billion (representing 7% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. For more information and a complete discussion on how we test goodwill for impairment, see Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." We perform our impairment assessment of goodwill annually as of November 30th. As with our franchise impairment testing, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill in 2016 which included the fair value appraisals and other factors described above. Based on the appraisals, we determined that the fair value of our goodwill exceeded carrying value by approximately 28% as of the closing of the Transactions. Given the limited amount of time between the closing of the Transactions and the completion of the assessment and absence of significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our goodwill is not impaired.  Valuation, impairment and amortization of customer relationships. The net carrying value of customer relationships as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $14.6 billion (representing 10% of total assets) and $856 million (representing 5% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. Amortization expense related to customer relationships for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $1.9 billion, $249 million and $282 million, respectively. No impairment of customer relationships was recorded in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. For more information and a complete discussion on our valuation methodology and amortization method, see Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."  Income taxes  As of December 31, 2016, Charter had approximately $11.2 billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately $3.9 billion. These losses resulted from the operations of Charter Holdco and its subsidiaries and from loss carryforwards received as a result of the TWC Transaction. Federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2018 through 2035. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, Charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards, resulting in a gross deferred tax asset (net of federal tax benefit) of approximately $304 million. State tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the years 2017 through 2035. Such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset Charter's future taxable income. As of December 31, 2016, all of Charter's federal tax loss carryforwards are subject to Section 382 and other restrictions. Pursuant to these restrictions, Charter estimates that approximately $5.4 billion in 2017, $3.8 billion in 2018, $432 million in 2019 and an additional $226 million annually over each of the next five years of federal tax loss carryforwards, should become unrestricted and available for Charter's use. An additional $415 million is currently subject to a valuation allowance. Charter's state tax loss carryforwards are subject to similar but varying restrictions.  In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management takes into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. Due to Legacy Charter's history of losses, Legacy Charter was historically unable to assume future taxable income in its analysis and accordingly valuation allowances were established against the deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, from definite-lived assets for book accounting purposes. However, as a result of the TWC Transaction, deferred tax liabilities resulting from the book fair value adjustment increased significantly and future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities are recognized, is sufficient to conclude it is more likely than not that we will realize substantially all of our deferred tax assets. As a result, Charter has reversed approximately $3.3 billion of its valuation allowance and recognized a corresponding income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately $145 million of valuation allowance associated with federal tax net operating loss carryforwards and approximately $55 million of valuation allowance associated with state tax loss carryforwards and other miscellaneous deferred tax assets remains on the December 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet.  In determining our tax provision for financial reporting purposes, Charter establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be "more likely than not" of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the tax return are "more likely than not" of being sustained. Charter adjusts its uncertain tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax . . .

Terrible alternative to Satellite.  We changed from DirectTV...how stupid were we!  We have had Charter for 1 month now and they have been out 4 times already to try and fix their system.  All 4 times we had 4 different diagnosis.  One was that it was grounded wrong from installation, next was our cable in the house is old and needs to be replaced because our house is old.  Our house is 10 years old...i guess their definition of old is 10 years.  Third time back to grounding issue.  Fourth time finally had someone that had a clue.  The problem is not with our installation, wiring or age of our house.  It is their new program guide where they do not have all the bugs out yet.  Who knows when this will get fixed.

going back to DirectTV.  It's more expensive, but at least it works and has way more advantages.

If you are thinking of going to Charter/Spectum run fast...







Charter Internet works fine, but their customer service and the fact that they keep raising prices on loyal customers stinks. They will not even work with people who have been with them for 5 years. I have had two price increases and could stand no more. Their people are the worst and their constant calling trying to up-sale you is the pits. I would stay away from this company with a 10 foot pole, contact the attorney generals office and tell him you want a choice in providers and that you are tired of the monopolies created by cable/internet providers.







I went in to exchange a digital decoder box and get an M card and tuning adapter. After being told they didn't have either one the second girl pulled them out of the closet. I mentioned I need the USB cord for the tuning adapter and was promptly told they did not have one. After she disappeared in the back for 5 minutes returning with the cord, and now 5 customers deep behind me. She was unable to get the M Card or Tuning Adapter to scan into the computer so I was, of course, told they were bad and they would have to send a tech sometime next week. 

I don't live here full time so I left with nothing but a cavalier attitude of How they could care less about my cable problems. Come back next time you're down.

Charter has a reputation of crappy service here. You can not get a phone number so you can call this office location. You have to drive all the way over there, no matter where you are, so you can find out they can't help you.

Subsequent to this visit the 800# told me they have plenty of M cards on hand. I stayed an extra day only to be told once again, "we don't have any".







The boxes to rent break down a lot. It's not worth "renting" the boxes for cable so they can make more money off people at the lake.  You can't even get HD on a new tv even if you have more than just the basic cable!.   Customer service is not well either.  They either don't know how to help, very slow or just don't care.    I rather go back to dish tv than pay money to "rent" a box each month so Charter can make extra money off all of us.     The lake NEEDS better and more cable companies.







This is the worse office I have ever visited. they have monopolized cable here at the lake.... so you don't have any choices...







Worst experience ever. Went in with questions regarding my bill and the sales associate said she only does sales and can't provide any help. Cs he was the one that set up the account and the billing information that was messed up to begin with. Horrible. Switching providers

I loved having Charter internet. They don't have a data cap like all the other companies seem to now (when did they all develop the delusion that they are cell phone companies instead of wired internet companies??)

I never had any problems with the modem or the internet service from Charter (in stark contrast to when I had Centurylink at the same address - that was an absolute nightmare and I vehemently recommend to anyone who is looking for internet service Do Not Get Centurylink!). 

My only complaint about Charter is that they don't offer service in the Columbia, Mo city limits so I lost them when I moved. :(

Charter, if you're reading this, know that if you expand into the city limits you will have at least one guaranteed customer who will sing your praises to all the neighbors.







"Just works". Can't say that about the other cable provider in town. Consistent downloads speeds above 60 Mbps.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  General  Charter Communications, Inc. (together with its controlled subsidiaries, "Charter") is the second largest cable operator in the United States and a leading broadband communications services company providing video, Internet and voice services to approximately 26.6 million residential and business customers at March 31, 2017. In addition, we sell video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers and fiber-delivered communications and managed information technology ("IT") solutions to larger enterprise customers. We also own and operate regional sports networks and local sports, news and community channels and sell security and home management services to the residential marketplace.  Charter is a holding company whose principal asset is a controlling equity interest in Charter Communications Holdings, LLC ("Charter Holdings"), an indirect owner of Charter Communications Operating, LLC ("Charter Operating") under which all of the operations reside. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions among consolidated entities have been eliminated.  The Transactions  On May 18, 2016, the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Mergers dated as of May 23, 2015 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Time Warner Cable Inc. ("Legacy TWC"), Charter Communications, Inc. prior to the closing of the Merger Agreement ("Legacy Charter"), CCH I, LLC, previously a wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy Charter and certain other subsidiaries of CCH I, LLC were completed (the "TWC Transaction," and together with the Bright House Transaction described below, the "Transactions"). As a result of the TWC Transaction, CCH I, LLC became the new public parent company that holds the operations of the combined companies and was renamed Charter Communications, Inc.  Also, on May 18, 2016, Legacy Charter and Advance/Newhouse Partnership ("A/N"), the former parent of Bright House Networks, LLC ("Bright House"), completed their previously announced transaction, pursuant to a definitive Contribution Agreement (the "Contribution Agreement"), under which Charter acquired Bright House (the "Bright House Transaction"). Pursuant to the Bright House Transaction, Charter became the owner of the membership interests in Bright House and the other assets primarily related to Bright House (other than certain excluded assets and liabilities and non-operating cash).  In connection with the TWC Transaction, Legacy Charter and Liberty Broadband completed their previously announced transactions pursuant to their investment agreement, in which Liberty Broadband purchased shares of Charter Class A common stock to partially finance the cash portion of the TWC Transaction consideration, and in connection with the Bright House Transaction, Liberty Broadband purchased shares of Charter Class A common stock (the "Liberty Transaction").  Overview  Since 2012, Legacy Charter has actively invested in its network and operations and has improved the quality and value of the products and packages that it offers. Through the roll-out of Spectrum pricing and packaging across Legacy Charter, we have simplified our offers and improved our packaging of products, delivering more value to new and existing customers. Further, through the transition of our Legacy Charter markets to our all-digital platform, we increased our offerings to more than 200 HD channels in most of the Legacy Charter markets and offered Internet speeds of at least 60 or 100 Mbps, among other benefits. We believe that this product set combined with improved customer service, as we insource our workforce in our call centers and in our field operations, has led to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes.  As a result of the Transactions, quarterly revenues increased by $7.5 billion year over year. We also saw an increase in expenses related to our increased scale. In September 2016, we began launching Spectrum pricing and packaging ("SPP") to Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets and as of March 31, 2017, we offer SPP in nearly all Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets. In 2017, we intend to begin converting the remaining Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House analog markets to an all-digital platform. Our corporate organization, as well as our marketing, sales and product development departments, are now centralized. Field operations are managed through eleven regional areas, each designed to represent a combination of designated marketing areas and managed with largely the same set of field employees that were with the three legacy companies prior to completion of the Transactions. Over a multi-year period, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House customer care centers will migrate to Legacy Charter's model of using segmented, virtualized, U.S.-based in-house call centers. We are focused on deploying superior products and service with minimal service disruptions as we integrate our information technology and network operations. We expect customer and financial results to trend similarly to Legacy Charter following the implementation of Legacy Charter's operating strategies across the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets. As a result of implementing our operating strategy  across Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House, we cannot be certain that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates.  We realized revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations during the periods presented as follows (in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers. Minor differences may exist due to rounding).   Three Months Ended March 31, Actual Pro Forma 2017 2016 % Change 2016 % Change Actual Revenues $ 10,164 $ 2,530 301.7 % $ 9,742 4.3 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,654 $ 883 313.6 % $ 3,433 6.4 %  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, net, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, special charges and gain (loss) on sale or retirement of assets. See "-Use of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow" for further information on Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Growth in total revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations was primarily due to the Transactions.  We incurred the following transition costs in connection with the Transactions (in millions).   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Operating expenses $ 51 $ 21 Other operating expenses $ 95 $ 14 Interest expense $ - $ 257 Capital expenditures $ 76 $ 53  Amounts included in transition operating expenses and transition capital expenditures represent incremental costs incurred to integrate the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House operations and to bring the three companies' systems and processes into a uniform operating structure. Costs are incremental and would not be incurred absent the integration. Other operating expenses associated with the Transactions represent merger and restructuring costs and include advisory, legal and accounting fees, employee retention costs, employee termination costs and other exit costs. Interest expense associated with the Transactions represents interest incurred on the CCO Safari II, CCO Safari III and CCOH Safari notes issued in advance of the closing of the Transactions, the proceeds of which were held in escrow to finance the Transactions.  We have a history of net losses. Our net losses were principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expenses, interest expenses that we incur on our debt, depreciation expenses resulting from the capital investments we have made, and continue to make, in our cable properties, amortization expenses related to our customer relationship intangibles and higher non-cash income tax expense. Although we have incurred net income since completion of the Transactions, we will incur significant increases in interest expense and depreciation and amortization as a result of the Transactions and will incur  restructuring and transition costs for at least one to two years from acquisition date, and as a result, we may incur net losses in the future.  All customer statistics as of March 31, 2017 include the operations of Legacy TWC, Legacy Bright House and Legacy Charter, each of which is based on individual legacy company reporting methodology. These methodologies differ and their differences may be material. Statistical reporting will be conformed over time to a single reporting methodology. The following table summarizes our customer statistics for video, Internet and voice as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands except per customer data and footnotes).   Approximate as of March 31, 2017 (a) 2016 (a) Customer Relationships (b) Residential 25,131 6,388 Small and Medium Business 1,439 405 Total Customer Relationships 26,570 6,793 Residential Primary Service Units ("PSU") Video 16,736 4,332 Internet 21,802 5,368 Voice 10,364 2,633 48,902 12,333 Monthly Residential Revenue per Residential Customer (c) $ 109.11 $ 111.04 Small and Medium Business PSUs Video 411 113 Internet 1,249 359 Voice 809 231 2,469 703 Monthly Small and Medium Business Revenue per Customer (d) $ 211.21 $ 169.68 Enterprise PSUs (e) 99 31  After giving effect to the Transactions, March 31, 2016 residential and small and medium business customer relationships would have been 24,180,000 and 1,286,000, respectively, residential video, Internet and voice PSUs would have been 17,086,000, 20,431,000 and 10,172,000, respectively and small and medium business PSUs would have been 369,000, 1,107,000 and 693,000, respectively; Enterprise PSUs would have been 85,000.  (a) We calculate the aging of customer accounts based on the monthly billing cycle for each account. On that basis, as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, customers include approximately 168,400 and 27,900 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 60 days past due, approximately 13,300 and 1,100 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 90 days past due, and approximately 7,900 and 900 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 120 days past due.  (b) Customer relationships include the number of customers that receive one or more levels of service, encompassing video, Internet and voice services, without regard to which service(s) such customers receive. Customers who reside in residential multiple dwelling units ("MDUs") and that are billed under bulk contracts are counted based on the number of billed units within each bulk MDU. Total customer relationships excludes enterprise customer relationships.  (c) Monthly residential revenue per residential customer is calculated as total residential video, Internet and voice quarterly revenue divided by three divided by average residential customer relationships during the respective quarter.  (d) Monthly small and medium business revenue per customer is calculated as total small and medium business quarterly revenue divided by three divided by average small and medium business customer relationships during the respective quarter.  (e) Enterprise PSUs represent the aggregate number of fiber service offerings counting each separate service offering as an individual PSU.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  For a discussion of our critical accounting policies and the means by which we develop estimates therefore, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes from the critical accounting policies described in our Form 10-K.  Results of Operations  We completed the Transactions on May 18, 2016 and have included the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House operating results since that date. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), operating results from Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House prior to the closing of the Transactions have been excluded. For purposes of management's discussion and analysis, we have given explanations of increases and decreases in our results of operations on an actual basis, as well as on a pro forma basis assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015. Due to the size of the Transactions, we believe that providing a discussion of our results of operations on a pro forma basis provides management and investors a more meaningful perspective on our financial and operational performance and trends. The results of operations data on a pro forma basis are provided for illustrative purposes only and are based on available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable and do not purport to represent what our actual consolidated results of operations would have been had the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position.  See Exhibit 99.1 in Charter's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 filed with the SEC on November 3, 2016 for pro forma financial information for each quarter of 2015 and the first and second quarter of 2016.  The following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share data):   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Revenues $ 10,164 $ 2,530 Costs and Expenses: Operating costs and expenses (exclusive of items shown separately below) 6,579 1,671 Depreciation and amortization 2,550 539 Other operating expenses, net 94 18 9,223 2,228 Income from operations 941 302 Other Expenses: Interest expense, net (713 ) (454 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (34 ) - Gain (loss) on financial instruments, net 38 (5 ) Other income (expense), net 4 (3 ) (705 ) (462 ) Income (loss) before income taxes 236 (160 ) Income tax expense (25 ) (28 ) Consolidated net income (loss) 211 (188 ) Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (56 ) - Net income (loss) attributable to Charter shareholders $ 155 $ (188 )  EARNINGS (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHARTER SHAREHOLDERS: Basic $ 0.58 $ (1.86 ) Diluted $ 0.57 $ (1.86 ) Weighted average common shares outstanding, basic 269,004,817 101,552,093 Weighted average common shares outstanding, diluted 273,199,509 101,552,093  Revenues. Total revenues grew $7.6 billion or 302% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. Revenue growth primarily reflects the Transactions and increases in the number of residential Internet and triple play customers and in commercial business customers, growth in rates driven by higher equipment revenue and rate increases offset by a decrease in basic video customers. The Transactions increased revenues for three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the three months March 31, 2016 by approximately $7.5 billion. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, total revenue growth was 4.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding period in 2016.  Revenues by service offering were as follows (dollars in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers. Minor differences may exist due to rounding):   Three Months Ended March 31, Actual Pro forma 2017 2016 % Change 2016 % Change Video $ 4,079 $ 1,170 248.5 % $ 4,073 0.1 % Internet 3,398 804 322.7 % 3,037 11.9 % Voice 694 135 414.1 % 729 (4.8 )% Residential revenue 8,171 2,109 287.4 % 7,839 4.2 % Small and medium business 900 202 345.1 % 808 11.3 % Enterprise 539 99 443.6 % 490 10.1 % Commercial revenue 1,439 301 377.5 % 1,298 10.8 % Advertising sales 337 72 368.0 % 365 (7.7 )% Other 217 48 352.7 % 240 (9.7 )% $ 10,164 $ 2,530 301.7 % $ 9,742 4.3 %  Video revenues consist primarily of revenues from basic and digital video services provided to our residential customers, as well as franchise fees, equipment rental and video installation revenue. Excluding the impacts of the Transactions, residential video customers increased by 19,000 from March 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017.  The increase in video revenues is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):   Three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to three months ended March 31, 2016 Increase / (Decrease) Increase in average basic video customers $ 8 Bundle revenue allocation and price adjustments (11 ) TWC Transaction 2,496 Bright House Transaction 416 $ 2,909  On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, residential video customers decreased by 350,000 from March 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017 and the increase in video revenues is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):  Three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to three months ended March 31, 2016 Increase / (Decrease) Incremental video services, price adjustments and bundle revenue  allocation $ 75 Decrease in average basic video customers (69 ) $ 6  Excluding the impacts of the Transactions, residential Internet customers grew by 436,000 customers from March 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017. The increase in Internet revenues from our residential customers is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):   Three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to three months ended March 31, 2016 Increase / (Decrease) Increase in average residential Internet customers $ 69 Service level changes, price adjustments and bundle revenue allocation 15 TWC Transaction 2,134 Bright House Transaction 376 $ 2,594  On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, residential Internet customers increased by 1,371,000 from March 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017 and the increase in Internet revenues is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):   Three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to three months ended March 31, 2016 Increase / (Decrease) Increase in average residential Internet customers $ 215 Service level changes, price adjustments and bundle revenue allocation 146 $ 361  Excluding the impacts of the Transactions, residential voice customers grew by 74,000 customers from March 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017.

Charter Communications is an American telecommunications company, which offers its services to consumers and businesses under the branding of Spectrum. Providing services to over 25 million customers in 41 states,[1][4] it is the second-largest cable operator in the United States by subscribers, just behind Comcast, and third largest pay TV operator behind Comcast and AT&T U-verse/DirecTV.[5] It is the fifth largest telephone provider based upon residential subscriber line count.
In late 2012, with the naming of longtime Cablevision executive Thomas Rutledge as their CEO, the company relocated its corporate headquarters from St. Louis, Missouri, to Stamford, Connecticut, although many operations still remain based out of St. Louis.[6] On May 18, 2016, Charter acquired Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks for a combined $71.4 billion, making it the third-largest pay television service in the United States.[4][7][8]

History[edit]
1993–1998: The beginning[edit]
Charter Communications was founded in 1993 by Barry Babcock, Jerald Kent and Howard Wood, who had been former executives at Cencom Cable Television in St. Louis, Missouri. It was also incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1993.[9]
In 1995, Charter paid about $300 million for a controlling interest in Crown Media Holdings and acquired Cable South.[9]
In 1997, Charter and EarthLink joined forces to deliver high-speed Internet access through cable modems to Charter's customers in Los Angeles and Riverside, California.[9]
In 1998, Paul Allen bought a controlling interest. The company paid $2.8 billion to acquire Dallas-based cable company Marcus Cable. Charter Communications had 1 million customers in 1998.[9]
1999–2008: Listing on the NASDAQ; various acquisitions[edit]
In November 1999, the company went public, trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[10] At the time, it had 3.9 million customers.
Charter completed more than 10 major acquisitions in 1999 when it:[9]

Added 68,000 subscribers in Southern California with the purchase of four cable systems from American Cable Entertainment of Stamford, Connecticut.
Acquired 400,000 InterMedia Partners subscribers, primarily in the Southeast. As part of the deal Charter would turn over about 140,000 of its subscribers to TCI in cable system swap.
Merged with Marcus Cable
Acquired cable systems serving 460,000 subscribers from Rifkin Acquisition Partners and InterLink Communications.
Acquired 173,000 subscribers, mostly in central Massachusetts, from New Jersey–based Greater Media Inc.
Acquired Renaissance Media Group, a New York partnership serving 130,000 customers near New Orleans, western Mississippi, and Jackson, Tennessee.
Acquired New Jersey-based Helicon Cable Communications. The systems served about 171,000 customers in eight states in the Southeast and Northeast.
Acquired Avalon Cable TV, adding 260,000 subscribers primarily in Michigan and Massachusetts.
Acquired Vista Broadband Communications in Smyrna, Georgia, adding 30,000 more customers.
Acquired Falcon Cable TV of Los Angeles. Falcon was the eighth-largest cable operator in the United States with about one million subscribers in 27 states in primarily non-urban areas.
Acquired Fanch Communications Inc. of Denver. Fanch had 547,000 subscribers in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Wisconsin.

Charter also began swapping customers with other systems to improve the geographic clustering of its systems. In December 1999, it signed a letter of intent with AT&T Corporation to swap 1.3 million cable subscribers in St. Louis as well as in Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri. In 2000, Charter Communications bought select AT&T cable markets, including Reno, Nevada, and the City of St. Louis.[11]
In 2001, MSN and Charter signed an agreement to offer MSN content and services to Charter's broadband customers. In the same year, Charter received awards, including the Outstanding Corporate Growth Award from the Association for Corporate Growth, the R.E. "Ted" Turner Innovator of the Year Award from the Southern Cable Telecommunications Association,[12] and the Fast 50 Award for Growth from the St. Louis Regional Chamber and Growth Association.
In 2008, Charter stock failed to meet NASDAQ standards and was given warning to comply by October 13 or request an extension.[13]
Also in 2008, it acquired the cable-television franchise and service for the Cerritos and Ventura, California, areas from Wave Broadband.
2009: Filing and emergence from bankruptcy protection[edit]
In February 2009, Charter Communications announced that it planned to file for Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on or before April 1, 2009. The action would allow Charter to pay its debt obligations, and cancel its obligations to shareholders.[citation needed] Private equity firm Apollo Management expected to own most of Charter's shares after the bankruptcy.[14] Charter filed for a prearranged bankruptcy on March 28, 2009. The company expected the financial restructuring to reduce its debt by $8 billion, as well as adding $3 billion of new investment, and refinancing other debt.
On November 30, 2009, its bankruptcy plan was approved, which extinguished its stock and cut approximately $8 billion in debt.[15] That day, Charter emerged from bankruptcy despite many of its creditors' objections over its bankruptcy plan.[16]
2010–2012: Second listing on the NASDAQ; Paul Allen steps down[edit]
On September 14, 2010, Charter Class A common stock was re-listed on NASDAQ under the symbol "CHTR".[17]
In 2011, Paul Allen stepped down as chairman and from the board of directors' seat, but at the time remained the largest single shareholder. Also in that year, Charter signed a multi-year deal with TiVo to deliver content via its platform.[18]
Thomas M. Rutledge was appointed as a director and president and chief executive officer effective February 13, 2012.[19]
The same year, Charter prices $1.25 billion senior debt, offering to pay down short- and long-term debt.[20]
2013–2014: Purchase of former Optimum West operations; Liberty Media investment[edit]
On February 8, 2013, Charter announced an agreement to acquire some former Bresnan Communications systems from Cablevision in a transaction worth US$1.63 billion.[21] The deal brought Charter cable systems to 375,000 customers in Colorado's mountains and Western Slope, as well as in Utah, Wyoming and Montana.[22]
Approximately one month later, on March 19, 2013, Charter announced that Liberty Media, a company controlled by former TCI CEO John C. Malone, would be acquiring a 27.3% ownership interest in the company, making it the company's largest single shareholder, largely through the purchase of interests held by investment funds following Charter's 2009 restructuring.[23] In November 2014, Liberty's holdings in Charter as well as a small minority interest in Time Warner Cable were spun off as a separate holding company named Liberty Broadband Corporation,[24] which as of early 2015 was 47.1% controlled by Malone.[25]
2014–2017: Acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House[edit]
On January 13, 2014, Charter Communications said it was interested in buying its larger rival Time Warner Cable. After three previous attempts to buy and merge with the company, all of which failed, Charter's chief executive officer Thomas Rutledge wrote in an open letter to Time Warner Cable's chief executive officer Robert Marcus stating, "I believe we have a significant opportunity to put our companies together in a way that will create maximum, long-term value for shareholders and employees of both companies".[26] The $132.50 per share offer, just above TWC's closing price at $132.40 on January 13, was rejected.[27]
On February 13, 2014, Time Warner Cable accepted an offer of $158.82 per share from Comcast, avoiding a hostile takeover situation from Charter.[28][29]
On April 28, 2014, Comcast and Charter announced that, assuming Comcast's merger with Time Warner was successful, Charter would acquire 1.4 million Comcast/Time Warner Cable customers, bringing Charter's subscriber total to 30 million and making Charter, by its own count, the second-largest cable operator in the country.[30] In addition to the 1.4 million divested subscribers, Comcast also agreed to swap 1.6 million subscribers with Charter in an even, tax-efficient exchange whose intent is to improve the geographic spread of both companies. In a third part of the agreement, Comcast would spin off 2.5 million subscribers into a new publicly traded company in which Charter would hold a 33% stake — with an option to eventually own the whole company — and former Time Warner Cable shareholders would hold a 67% stake.[31]
In late March 2015, Charter announced plans to purchase Bright House Networks from Advance/Newhouse for $10.4 billion in a combination of cash and equities convertible to Charter stock. The deal was contingent on, among other approvals, the completion of Charter's transactions with Comcast, and the expiration of Time Warner Cable's right of first offer to buy Bright House itself (which was not expected to be exercised in light of the merger with Comcast).[32] However, facing potential difficulties in reaching regulatory approval, Comcast called off its merger with Time Warner Cable in April 2015.[33]
On May 26, 2015, Charter and Time Warner Cable announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement for Charter to merge with Time Warner Cable in a deal valued at $78.7 billion.[34] Charter also confirmed that it would continue with its proposed acquisition of Bright House Networks under slightly modified terms. The deal was subject to regulatory approval, although the deal was expected to face less scrutiny from the FCC than the Comcast/TWC deal, as the companies were relatively smaller, and their media holdings are not as extensive as those of Comcast. The TWC and Bright House systems were to be migrated to Charter's Spectrum brand following the conclusion of the merger.[35]
Liberty Broadband will invest a further $5 billion in Charter and will ultimately hold about 20% ownership in the combined entity. Advance/Newhouse will own about 14%, and other current Time Warner Cable shareholders are expected to hold a combined 44% stake.[35] The merger was approved by the Department of Justice and FCC on April 25, 2016; it is subject to conditions, including a requirement that Charter must not implement usage-based billing, nor use its dominant position in the market to impact the online video industry—which includes a prohibition on charging for interconnections.[36][37] Charter was also required to expand its services to 2 million new households, with at least 1 million being in markets where competing providers operate.[38]
The merger was completed on May 18, 2016.[4][7] The purchase made Charter the third-largest pay television company in the United States, behind AT&T and Comcast (the former having completed its merger with DirecTV in mid-2015).[8]
2017–present: Recent developments[edit]
On January 26, 2017, it was reported that Verizon Communications was in talks with Charter to discuss a possible buyout.[39][40] President and CEO of Liberty Media, Greg Maffei said that they were not interested in the deal.[41][42] The deal was rejected around the end of May 2017.[43] Charter claimed that the deal was too low for them to accept, and Charter's largest shareholder Liberty Media stated that they weren't ready to sell.
In March 2017 under new FCC leadership, Charter's regulatory conditions were changed to require that Charter expand its services to 2 million households that are not currently served by any broadband provider, as opposed to requiring one million of these households to be in areas served by a competitor. The decision was made under goals by new chairman Ajit Pai to increase the availability of broadband in rural areas not served by high-speed Internet, but was criticized for maintaining oligarchies rather than encouraging wider competition.[38]
In May 2017, it was reported that Charter and Comcast had entered into an agreement to "explore working together in a number of potential operational areas in the wireless space" in respect to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs); both providers have agreements with Verizon Wireless to re-sell its services, and Comcast announced that it would begin to do so under the brand Xfinity Mobile later in the year. The agreement includes a provision, lasting for one year, that requires the companies to receive consent from each other before performing wireless-related acquisitions or mergers.[44]
On June 21, 2017, it was reported that Charter was in talks to buy Cox Communications.[45]
Operations[edit]
Current operations[edit]
Coverage[edit]
Charter Communications offers service to an estimated 25 million people in 41 states with significant coverage in 48 states.[46][47]
In August 2008, Charter Communications announced an agreement to carry the Big Ten Network, applicable to all customers.[48]
In May 2009, Comcast was able to meet an agreement with the NFL Network, in which the NFL Network agreed to lower its asking price per subscriber. The higher asking price has been a problem with being carried with other cable networks. Roger Goodell was looking at resolving differences with other cable providers, to include Charter Communications, to allow carriage of this channel.[49]
On August 2011, Charter Communications and the NFL Network announced that they had reached a new long-term agreement to carry the NFL Network in time for the 2011 season.[50]




Logo of Charter's Spectrum service


In November 2013, the company announced the re-branding of its residential services to Charter Spectrum[51] which encompass an upgrade to an all-digital network for its video, voice and broadband services. The company relied heavily on a predominantly coaxial cable-based network. The newer fiber-optic service-delivery system provides higher bandwidth speeds than are available with its coaxial cable infrastructure.[52]
In August 2014, Charter Communications agreed to carry the SEC Network, a new channel from ESPN that airs football and other sports from the Southeastern Conference.[53]
Call centers[edit]
On May 2, 2006, the company announced it would restructure seven of its call centers in the United States in the following locations:


St. Louis, Missouri – Residential HSI/Phone Support, July 31, 2006; converted into a Charter Phone service call center
Bay City, Michigan – September 2006; converted into a Charter Dispatch center
Birmingham, Alabama – December 2006; converted into a Charter Dispatch center
Fort Worth, Texas – December 1, 2006; shuttered
Irwindale, California – December 2009; restructured
Newtown, Connecticut – March 2007; restructured
Kingsport, Tennessee – March 2007; converted to Dispatch Center with location change
Amherst, Nova Scotia – December 2010; third-party contract, Teletech, not renewed
Louisville, Kentucky – Residential HSI/Phone Support, Charter Business technical support, Network Operations Center


Orders completed online or through retail partners with Charter Communications are directed to a call center located in Tempe, Arizona, operated by Teletech (Direct Alliance). This call center has inbound/outbound sales agents, as well as online chat agents. Outsourced call centers were implemented in 2006 and are located in Canada, Honduras and the Philippines.

Charter-owned call centers are located in St. Louis, Missouri (telephone service support center); Billings, Montana; Greenville, South Carolina; Vancouver, Washington; Fond du Lac, Wisconsin; Walker, Michigan; Rochester, Minnesota; Worcester, Massachusetts, and Louisville, Kentucky (the largest call center across the company), with Heathrow, Florida, handling the bulk of video, high-speed data, and telephone billing and customer service contacts.
In 2016, Charter announced that it would be adding 20,000 United States-based jobs, with many of these jobs being call center jobs.[54]
Former operations[edit]
On March 27, 2006, Charter announced that it would sell cable systems serving approximately 43,000 customers in Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah to Orange Broadband Holding Company (since renamed Baja Broadband).[55]
Charter also sold cable systems in West Virginia and Virginia to Cebridge Connections (now known as Suddenlink Communications) and cable systems in Kentucky and Illinois to New Wave Communications.[56]
On October 14, 2008, an article appeared in the Fairmont Sentinel,[57] of Fairmont, Minnesota, reporting that Charter was selling parts of their system to Midcontinent Communications, including Charter's offices in Bemidji and International Falls, Minnesota. Starting February 1, 2009, Midcontinent Communications (now known as Midco) took over some Charter's cable system in Minnesota including Balaton, Bemidji, Canby, Ely, Fairmont, International Falls, Littlefork, Sherburn, and surrounding communities. Other areas in Minnesota would have sold to Comcast, but the deal fell through.[58]
On October 22, 2010, Charter announced completion of the sale of cable systems serving approximately 65,000 customers in seven states to Cobridge Communications, LLC (now known as Fidelity Communications). The 36 head ends acquired by Cobridge are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas. As a result of this sale, Charter no longer operates in Arkansas.[59]
Technology[edit]
Charter utilizes various technologies across its service area. Most customers are still served with older legacy set top boxes and video recorders (DVRs). Charter has indicated that it plans to deploy its new WorldBox across its service area. It also plans to standardize services to the new Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks customers by moving all customers to an all-digital network, and making Internet speeds standard across its service areas.
Belo Corporation dispute[edit]
In December 2008, three television stations which were owned by Belo Corporation prior to its acquisition by Gannett in 2014 (WFAA-TV, WCNC-TV, and KMOV-TV) reported that beginning January 1, 2009, Charter Communications would no longer carry these stations due to a breakdown in negotiations. Charter Communications quickly replied that a resolution to the issue was not out of the question.[60][61][62] The cable operator would have lost access to all of the stations owned by Belo. However, an agreement was reached days before the shutdown date.[63]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2011, PCWorld awarded Charter with several "fastest ISP"-type awards. Charter has upgraded its Internet speed tiers and gave most of its customers a free upgrade in speed twice during the 2011 business year.[64]
In 2009, Charter won a CableFax TopOps award for its Day of Service (DOS) team that answers calls from customers on the day that a technician is scheduled to arrive at their home.[65]
In December 2007, Charter was recognized by CableWorld Magazine as "2007 Multi-System Operator of the Year". According to the magazine, the company was selected for this award based on "rapidly expanding its telephone footprint to take advantage of the triple-play offering; developing a consistent, data-driven marketing plan; and addressing its nearest-term debt maturities".[66] During the spring of 2008, Charter was honored with third place among companies with over 2,000 employees in the annual "Best Places to Work in St. Louis" competition, sponsored by the St. Louis Business Journal, based on the response of Charter employees in the area to an online survey created and managed by the Journal.[67]
Its Fortune ranking is 331 (May 26, 2015).[68]
Criticism[edit]
In 2007, PC World ranked Charter's cable Internet service as the worst among 14 major Internet service providers.[69] In addition, Charter High-Speed is rated 19th out of 22 cable ISPs on dslreports.com,[70] and Consumer Reports indicated in its February 2008 issue that Charter's television/Internet/telephone bundle collectively is the worst of all major national carriers.[71][72]
It was reported by Tony Bradle on about.com that Charter Communications redirected error pages and Windows Live Search results to a Charter search page without notifying customers. Users may opt out of redirection by clicking a link from the Charter search page; however, the opt-out link saves a cookie on the customer's computer, so deleting cookies will require the user to opt out again.[73]
It was reported that on January 21, 2008, during a routine sweep of inactive accounts, Charter accidentally deleted the email accounts of approximately 14,000 customers; even worse, the removed data were irretrievable. The company since decided to give a $150 account credit to each affected user.[74][75] In May 2008, Charter announced that it planned to monitor Web sites visited by its high-speed Internet customers via a partnership with targeted advertising firm NebuAd.[76][77] After customers voiced their concerns, Charter changed its mind in June.[78]
Lawsuits[edit]
In 2002, the United States Department of Justice investigated the company, leading to the indictment of four former executives in 2005 for improper financial reporting related primarily to the inflation of cable subscriber numbers to improve financial figures.[79]
In 2004, Charter settled a class-action lawsuit concerning the questionable financial reporting associated with the U.S. Department of Justice's 2002 investigation and subsequent indictment of four former executives. Current and former shareholders (and their attorneys) were awarded $144 million as well as an agreement from Charter to maintain and implement proper corporate governance measures.[80]
In June 2010, Charter settled a class-action lawsuit for $18 million concerning wage and overtime claims for current and former field technicians in California, Missouri, Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, Nevada, Washington, Oregon and Nebraska.[81]
In December 2013, a complaint was filed by Steelhead Licensing LLC for patent infringement of U.S. Patent 8082318; it is described as "Controlling service requests transmitted from a client to a server".[82][83][84]
In January 2016, the National Association of African-American Owned Media and Byron Allen's Entertainment Studios filed a $10 billion civil rights lawsuit against Charter, claiming discrimination for Charter's refusal to pick up Allen's eight-channel suite of networks (which mainly carry ES content already syndicated through local television stations and paid programming); Allen and the NAAAOM (which has an Entertainment Studios executive as its head) have already filed the same type of suit against several other providers.[85][86]
On May 12, 2016, Charter reached a settlement with the FCC regarding allegations by Zoom Telephonics that, in 2012, following the introduction of new rate plans and the introduction of DOCSIS 3.0, it had begun to bar new subscribers or those switching to the new plans from utilizing customer-purchased modems. Although Charter ended this practice in 2014 and began to allow certain certified modems to be used, Zoom argued that the company was still deliberately limiting options by requiring the modems to undergo a testing protocol concerning factors beyond whether they cause interference or unauthorized receipt of service (the only two factors which providers may use to restrict allowable modems under FCC policy). Charter paid a $640,000 fine, and agreed to use a shorter testing process allowing the use of any DOCSIS 3.0-compatible modem, and send compliance reports to the FCC every six months and whenever a modem is blacklisted.[87]
On February 1, 2017, Charter was sued by the Attorney General of New York for failing to provide its advertised Internet speeds to customers in areas that Charter acquired by the purchase of Time Warner Cable.[88][89]

Charter Communications is an American telecommunications company, which offers its services to consumers and businesses under the branding of Spectrum. Providing services to over 25 million customers in 41 states,[1][4] it is the second-largest cable operator in the United States by subscribers, just behind Comcast, and third largest pay TV operator behind Comcast and AT&T U-verse/DirecTV.[5] It is the fifth largest telephone provider based upon residential subscriber line count.
In late 2012, with the naming of longtime Cablevision executive Thomas Rutledge as their CEO, the company relocated its corporate headquarters from St. Louis, Missouri, to Stamford, Connecticut, although many operations still remain based out of St. Louis.[6] On May 18, 2016, Charter acquired Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks for a combined $71.4 billion, making it the third-largest pay television service in the United States.[4][7][8]

History[edit]
1993–1998: The beginning[edit]
Charter Communications was founded in 1993 by Barry Babcock, Jerald Kent and Howard Wood, who had been former executives at Cencom Cable Television in St. Louis, Missouri. It was also incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1993.[9]
In 1995, Charter paid about $300 million for a controlling interest in Crown Media Holdings and acquired Cable South.[9]
In 1997, Charter and EarthLink joined forces to deliver high-speed Internet access through cable modems to Charter's customers in Los Angeles and Riverside, California.[9]
In 1998, Paul Allen bought a controlling interest. The company paid $2.8 billion to acquire Dallas-based cable company Marcus Cable. Charter Communications had 1 million customers in 1998.[9]
1999–2008: Listing on the NASDAQ; various acquisitions[edit]
In November 1999, the company went public, trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[10] At the time, it had 3.9 million customers.
Charter completed more than 10 major acquisitions in 1999 when it:[9]

Added 68,000 subscribers in Southern California with the purchase of four cable systems from American Cable Entertainment of Stamford, Connecticut.
Acquired 400,000 InterMedia Partners subscribers, primarily in the Southeast. As part of the deal Charter would turn over about 140,000 of its subscribers to TCI in cable system swap.
Merged with Marcus Cable
Acquired cable systems serving 460,000 subscribers from Rifkin Acquisition Partners and InterLink Communications.
Acquired 173,000 subscribers, mostly in central Massachusetts, from New Jersey–based Greater Media Inc.
Acquired Renaissance Media Group, a New York partnership serving 130,000 customers near New Orleans, western Mississippi, and Jackson, Tennessee.
Acquired New Jersey-based Helicon Cable Communications. The systems served about 171,000 customers in eight states in the Southeast and Northeast.
Acquired Avalon Cable TV, adding 260,000 subscribers primarily in Michigan and Massachusetts.
Acquired Vista Broadband Communications in Smyrna, Georgia, adding 30,000 more customers.
Acquired Falcon Cable TV of Los Angeles. Falcon was the eighth-largest cable operator in the United States with about one million subscribers in 27 states in primarily non-urban areas.
Acquired Fanch Communications Inc. of Denver. Fanch had 547,000 subscribers in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Wisconsin.

Charter also began swapping customers with other systems to improve the geographic clustering of its systems. In December 1999, it signed a letter of intent with AT&T Corporation to swap 1.3 million cable subscribers in St. Louis as well as in Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri. In 2000, Charter Communications bought select AT&T cable markets, including Reno, Nevada, and the City of St. Louis.[11]
In 2001, MSN and Charter signed an agreement to offer MSN content and services to Charter's broadband customers. In the same year, Charter received awards, including the Outstanding Corporate Growth Award from the Association for Corporate Growth, the R.E. "Ted" Turner Innovator of the Year Award from the Southern Cable Telecommunications Association,[12] and the Fast 50 Award for Growth from the St. Louis Regional Chamber and Growth Association.
In 2008, Charter stock failed to meet NASDAQ standards and was given warning to comply by October 13 or request an extension.[13]
Also in 2008, it acquired the cable-television franchise and service for the Cerritos and Ventura, California, areas from Wave Broadband.
2009: Filing and emergence from bankruptcy protection[edit]
In February 2009, Charter Communications announced that it planned to file for Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on or before April 1, 2009. The action would allow Charter to pay its debt obligations, and cancel its obligations to shareholders.[citation needed] Private equity firm Apollo Management expected to own most of Charter's shares after the bankruptcy.[14] Charter filed for a prearranged bankruptcy on March 28, 2009. The company expected the financial restructuring to reduce its debt by $8 billion, as well as adding $3 billion of new investment, and refinancing other debt.
On November 30, 2009, its bankruptcy plan was approved, which extinguished its stock and cut approximately $8 billion in debt.[15] That day, Charter emerged from bankruptcy despite many of its creditors' objections over its bankruptcy plan.[16]
2010–2012: Second listing on the NASDAQ; Paul Allen steps down[edit]
On September 14, 2010, Charter Class A common stock was re-listed on NASDAQ under the symbol "CHTR".[17]
In 2011, Paul Allen stepped down as chairman and from the board of directors' seat, but at the time remained the largest single shareholder. Also in that year, Charter signed a multi-year deal with TiVo to deliver content via its platform.[18]
Thomas M. Rutledge was appointed as a director and president and chief executive officer effective February 13, 2012.[19]
The same year, Charter prices $1.25 billion senior debt, offering to pay down short- and long-term debt.[20]
2013–2014: Purchase of former Optimum West operations; Liberty Media investment[edit]
On February 8, 2013, Charter announced an agreement to acquire some former Bresnan Communications systems from Cablevision in a transaction worth US$1.63 billion.[21] The deal brought Charter cable systems to 375,000 customers in Colorado's mountains and Western Slope, as well as in Utah, Wyoming and Montana.[22]
Approximately one month later, on March 19, 2013, Charter announced that Liberty Media, a company controlled by former TCI CEO John C. Malone, would be acquiring a 27.3% ownership interest in the company, making it the company's largest single shareholder, largely through the purchase of interests held by investment funds following Charter's 2009 restructuring.[23] In November 2014, Liberty's holdings in Charter as well as a small minority interest in Time Warner Cable were spun off as a separate holding company named Liberty Broadband Corporation,[24] which as of early 2015 was 47.1% controlled by Malone.[25]
2014–2017: Acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House[edit]
On January 13, 2014, Charter Communications said it was interested in buying its larger rival Time Warner Cable. After three previous attempts to buy and merge with the company, all of which failed, Charter's chief executive officer Thomas Rutledge wrote in an open letter to Time Warner Cable's chief executive officer Robert Marcus stating, "I believe we have a significant opportunity to put our companies together in a way that will create maximum, long-term value for shareholders and employees of both companies".[26] The $132.50 per share offer, just above TWC's closing price at $132.40 on January 13, was rejected.[27]
On February 13, 2014, Time Warner Cable accepted an offer of $158.82 per share from Comcast, avoiding a hostile takeover situation from Charter.[28][29]
On April 28, 2014, Comcast and Charter announced that, assuming Comcast's merger with Time Warner was successful, Charter would acquire 1.4 million Comcast/Time Warner Cable customers, bringing Charter's subscriber total to 30 million and making Charter, by its own count, the second-largest cable operator in the country.[30] In addition to the 1.4 million divested subscribers, Comcast also agreed to swap 1.6 million subscribers with Charter in an even, tax-efficient exchange whose intent is to improve the geographic spread of both companies. In a third part of the agreement, Comcast would spin off 2.5 million subscribers into a new publicly traded company in which Charter would hold a 33% stake — with an option to eventually own the whole company — and former Time Warner Cable shareholders would hold a 67% stake.[31]
In late March 2015, Charter announced plans to purchase Bright House Networks from Advance/Newhouse for $10.4 billion in a combination of cash and equities convertible to Charter stock. The deal was contingent on, among other approvals, the completion of Charter's transactions with Comcast, and the expiration of Time Warner Cable's right of first offer to buy Bright House itself (which was not expected to be exercised in light of the merger with Comcast).[32] However, facing potential difficulties in reaching regulatory approval, Comcast called off its merger with Time Warner Cable in April 2015.[33]
On May 26, 2015, Charter and Time Warner Cable announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement for Charter to merge with Time Warner Cable in a deal valued at $78.7 billion.[34] Charter also confirmed that it would continue with its proposed acquisition of Bright House Networks under slightly modified terms. The deal was subject to regulatory approval, although the deal was expected to face less scrutiny from the FCC than the Comcast/TWC deal, as the companies were relatively smaller, and their media holdings are not as extensive as those of Comcast. The TWC and Bright House systems were to be migrated to Charter's Spectrum brand following the conclusion of the merger.[35]
Liberty Broadband will invest a further $5 billion in Charter and will ultimately hold about 20% ownership in the combined entity. Advance/Newhouse will own about 14%, and other current Time Warner Cable shareholders are expected to hold a combined 44% stake.[35] The merger was approved by the Department of Justice and FCC on April 25, 2016; it is subject to conditions, including a requirement that Charter must not implement usage-based billing, nor use its dominant position in the market to impact the online video industry—which includes a prohibition on charging for interconnections.[36][37] Charter was also required to expand its services to 2 million new households, with at least 1 million being in markets where competing providers operate.[38]
The merger was completed on May 18, 2016.[4][7] The purchase made Charter the third-largest pay television company in the United States, behind AT&T and Comcast (the former having completed its merger with DirecTV in mid-2015).[8]
2017–present: Recent developments[edit]
On January 26, 2017, it was reported that Verizon Communications was in talks with Charter to discuss a possible buyout.[39][40] President and CEO of Liberty Media, Greg Maffei said that they were not interested in the deal.[41][42] The deal was rejected around the end of May 2017.[43] Charter claimed that the deal was too low for them to accept, and Charter's largest shareholder Liberty Media stated that they weren't ready to sell.
In March 2017 under new FCC leadership, Charter's regulatory conditions were changed to require that Charter expand its services to 2 million households that are not currently served by any broadband provider, as opposed to requiring one million of these households to be in areas served by a competitor. The decision was made under goals by new chairman Ajit Pai to increase the availability of broadband in rural areas not served by high-speed Internet, but was criticized for maintaining oligarchies rather than encouraging wider competition.[38]
In May 2017, it was reported that Charter and Comcast had entered into an agreement to "explore working together in a number of potential operational areas in the wireless space" in respect to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs); both providers have agreements with Verizon Wireless to re-sell its services, and Comcast announced that it would begin to do so under the brand Xfinity Mobile later in the year. The agreement includes a provision, lasting for one year, that requires the companies to receive consent from each other before performing wireless-related acquisitions or mergers.[44]
On June 21, 2017, it was reported that Charter was in talks to buy Cox Communications.[45]
Operations[edit]
Current operations[edit]
Coverage[edit]
Charter Communications offers service to an estimated 25 million people in 41 states with significant coverage in 48 states.[46][47]
In August 2008, Charter Communications announced an agreement to carry the Big Ten Network, applicable to all customers.[48]
In May 2009, Comcast was able to meet an agreement with the NFL Network, in which the NFL Network agreed to lower its asking price per subscriber. The higher asking price has been a problem with being carried with other cable networks. Roger Goodell was looking at resolving differences with other cable providers, to include Charter Communications, to allow carriage of this channel.[49]
On August 2011, Charter Communications and the NFL Network announced that they had reached a new long-term agreement to carry the NFL Network in time for the 2011 season.[50]

In November 2013, the company announced the re-branding of its residential services to Charter Spectrum[51] which encompass an upgrade to an all-digital network for its video, voice and broadband services. The company relied heavily on a predominantly coaxial cable-based network. The newer fiber-optic service-delivery system provides higher bandwidth speeds than are available with its coaxial cable infrastructure.[52]
In August 2014, Charter Communications agreed to carry the SEC Network, a new channel from ESPN that airs football and other sports from the Southeastern Conference.[53]
Call centers[edit]
On May 2, 2006, the company announced it would restructure seven of its call centers in the United States in the following locations:


St. Louis, Missouri – Residential HSI/Phone Support, July 31, 2006; converted into a Charter Phone service call center
Bay City, Michigan – September 2006; converted into a Charter Dispatch center
Birmingham, Alabama – December 2006; converted into a Charter Dispatch center
Fort Worth, Texas – December 1, 2006; shuttered
Irwindale, California – December 2009; restructured
Newtown, Connecticut – March 2007; restructured
Kingsport, Tennessee – March 2007; converted to Dispatch Center with location change
Amherst, Nova Scotia – December 2010; third-party contract, Teletech, not renewed

Orders completed online or through retail partners with Charter Communications are directed to a call center located in Tempe, Arizona, operated by Teletech (Direct Alliance).

Charter-owned call centers are located in St. Louis, Missouri (telephone service support center); Billings, Montana; Greenville, South Carolina; Vancouver, Washington; Fond du Lac, Wisconsin; Walker, Michigan; Rochester, Minnesota; Worcester, Massachusetts, and Louisville, Kentucky (the largest call center across the company), with Heathrow, Florida, handling the bulk of video, high-speed data, and telephone billing and customer service contacts.
In 2016, Charter announced that it would be adding 20,000 United States-based jobs, with many of these jobs being call center jobs.[54]
Former operations[edit]
On March 27, 2006, Charter announced that it would sell cable systems serving approximately 43,000 customers in Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah to Orange Broadband Holding Company (since renamed Baja Broadband).[55]
Charter also sold cable systems in West Virginia and Virginia to Cebridge Connections (now known as Suddenlink Communications) and cable systems in Kentucky and Illinois to New Wave Communications.[56]
On October 14, 2008, an article appeared in the Fairmont Sentinel,[57] of Fairmont, Minnesota, reporting that Charter was selling parts of their system to Midcontinent Communications, including Charter's offices in Bemidji and International Falls, Minnesota. Starting February 1, 2009, Midcontinent Communications (now known as Midco) took over some Charter's cable system in Minnesota including Balaton, Bemidji, Canby, Ely, Fairmont, International Falls, Littlefork, Sherburn, and surrounding communities. Other areas in Minnesota would have sold to Comcast, but the deal fell through.[58]
On October 22, 2010, Charter announced completion of the sale of cable systems serving approximately 65,000 customers in seven states to Cobridge Communications, LLC (now known as Fidelity Communications). The 36 head ends acquired by Cobridge are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas. As a result of this sale, Charter no longer operates in Arkansas.[59]
Technology[edit]
Charter utilizes various technologies across its service area. Most customers are still served with older legacy set top boxes and video recorders (DVRs). Charter has indicated that it plans to deploy its new WorldBox across its service area. It also plans to standardize services to the new Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks customers by moving all customers to an all-digital network, and making Internet speeds standard across its service areas.
Belo Corporation dispute[edit]
In December 2008, three television stations which were owned by Belo Corporation prior to its acquisition by Gannett in 2014 (WFAA-TV, WCNC-TV, and KMOV-TV) reported that beginning January 1, 2009, Charter Communications would no longer carry these stations due to a breakdown in negotiations. Charter Communications quickly replied that a resolution to the issue was not out of the question.[60][61][62] The cable operator would have lost access to all of the stations owned by Belo. However, an agreement was reached days before the shutdown date.[63]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2011, PCWorld awarded Charter with several "fastest ISP"-type awards. Charter has upgraded its Internet speed tiers and gave most of its customers a free upgrade in speed twice during the 2011 business year.[64]
In 2009, Charter won a CableFax TopOps award for its Day of Service (DOS) team that answers calls from customers on the day that a technician is scheduled to arrive at their home.[65]
In December 2007, Charter was recognized by CableWorld Magazine as "2007 Multi-System Operator of the Year". According to the magazine, the company was selected for this award based on "rapidly expanding its telephone footprint to take advantage of the triple-play offering; developing a consistent, data-driven marketing plan; and addressing its nearest-term debt maturities".[66] During the spring of 2008, Charter was honored with third place among companies with over 2,000 employees in the annual "Best Places to Work in St. Louis" competition, sponsored by the St. Louis Business Journal, based on the response of Charter employees in the area to an online survey created and managed by the Journal.[67]
Its Fortune ranking is 331 (May 26, 2015).[68]
Criticism[edit]
In 2007, PC World ranked Charter's cable Internet service as the worst among 14 major Internet service providers.[69] In addition, Charter High-Speed is rated 19th out of 22 cable ISPs on dslreports.com,[70] and Consumer Reports indicated in its February 2008 issue that Charter's television/Internet/telephone bundle collectively is the worst of all major national carriers.[71][72]
It was reported by Tony Bradle on about.com that Charter Communications redirected error pages and Windows Live Search results to a Charter search page without notifying customers. Users may opt out of redirection by clicking a link from the Charter search page; however, the opt-out link saves a cookie on the customer's computer, so deleting cookies will require the user to opt out again.[73]
It was reported that on January 21, 2008, during a routine sweep of inactive accounts, Charter accidentally deleted the email accounts of approximately 14,000 customers; even worse, the removed data were irretrievable. The company since decided to give a $150 account credit to each affected user.[74][75] In May 2008, Charter announced that it planned to monitor Web sites visited by its high-speed Internet customers via a partnership with targeted advertising firm NebuAd.[76][77] After customers voiced their concerns, Charter changed its mind in June.[78]
Lawsuits[edit]
In 2002, the United States Department of Justice investigated the company, leading to the indictment of four former executives in 2005 for improper financial reporting related primarily to the inflation of cable subscriber numbers to improve financial figures.[79]
In 2004, Charter settled a class-action lawsuit concerning the questionable financial reporting associated with the U.S. Department of Justice's 2002 investigation and subsequent indictment of four former executives. Current and former shareholders (and their attorneys) were awarded $144 million as well as an agreement from Charter to maintain and implement proper corporate governance measures.[80]
In June 2010, Charter settled a class-action lawsuit for $18 million concerning wage and overtime claims for current and former field technicians in California, Missouri, Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, Nevada, Washington, Oregon and Nebraska.[81]
In December 2013, a complaint was filed by Steelhead Licensing LLC for patent infringement of U.S. Patent 8082318; it is described as "Controlling service requests transmitted from a client to a server".[82][83][84]
In January 2016, the National Association of African-American Owned Media and Byron Allen's Entertainment Studios filed a $10 billion civil rights lawsuit against Charter, claiming discrimination for Charter's refusal to pick up Allen's eight-channel suite of networks (which mainly carry ES content already syndicated through local television stations and paid programming); Allen and the NAAAOM (which has an Entertainment Studios executive as its head) have already filed the same type of suit against several other providers.[85][86]
On May 12, 2016, Charter reached a settlement with the FCC regarding allegations by Zoom Telephonics that, in 2012, following the introduction of new rate plans and the introduction of DOCSIS 3.0, it had begun to bar new subscribers or those switching to the new plans from utilizing customer-purchased modems. Although Charter ended this practice in 2014 and began to allow certain certified modems to be used, Zoom argued that the company was still deliberately limiting options by requiring the modems to undergo a testing protocol concerning factors beyond whether they cause interference or unauthorized receipt of service (the only two factors which providers may use to restrict allowable modems under FCC policy). Charter paid a $640,000 fine, and agreed to use a shorter testing process allowing the use of any DOCSIS 3.0-compatible modem, and send compliance reports to the FCC every six months and whenever a modem is blacklisted.[87]
On February 1, 2017, Charter was sued by the Attorney General of New York for failing to provide its advertised Internet speeds to customers in areas that Charter acquired by the purchase of Time Warner Cable.[88][89]

Charter Communications is an American telecommunications company, which offers its services to consumers and businesses under the branding of Spectrum. Providing services to over 25 million customers in 41 states,[1][4] it is the second-largest cable operator in the United States by subscribers, just behind Comcast, and third largest pay TV operator behind Comcast and AT&T U-verse/DirecTV.[5] It is the fifth largest telephone provider based upon residential subscriber line count.
In late 2012, with the naming of longtime Cablevision executive Thomas Rutledge as their CEO, the company relocated its corporate headquarters from St. Louis, Missouri, to Stamford, Connecticut, although many operations still remain based out of St. Louis.[6] On May 18, 2016, Charter acquired Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks for a combined $71.4 billion, making it the third-largest pay television service in the United States.[4][7][8]

History[edit]
1993–1998: The beginning[edit]
Charter Communications was founded in 1993 by Barry Babcock, Jerald Kent and Howard Wood, who had been former executives at Cencom Cable Television in St. Louis, Missouri. It was also incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1993.[9]
In 1995, Charter paid about $300 million for a controlling interest in Crown Media Holdings and acquired Cable South.[9]
In 1997, Charter and EarthLink joined forces to deliver high-speed Internet access through cable modems to Charter's customers in Los Angeles and Riverside, California.[9]
In 1998, Paul Allen bought a controlling interest. The company paid $2.8 billion to acquire Dallas-based cable company Marcus Cable. Charter Communications had 1 million customers in 1998.[9]
1999–2008: Listing on the NASDAQ; various acquisitions[edit]
In November 1999, the company went public, trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[10] At the time, it had 3.9 million customers.
Charter completed more than 10 major acquisitions in 1999 when it:[9]

Added 68,000 subscribers in Southern California with the purchase of four cable systems from American Cable Entertainment of Stamford, Connecticut.
Acquired 400,000 InterMedia Partners subscribers, primarily in the Southeast. As part of the deal Charter would turn over about 140,000 of its subscribers to TCI in cable system swap.
Merged with Marcus Cable
Acquired cable systems serving 460,000 subscribers from Rifkin Acquisition Partners and InterLink Communications.
Acquired 173,000 subscribers, mostly in central Massachusetts, from New Jersey–based Greater Media Inc.
Acquired Renaissance Media Group, a New York partnership serving 130,000 customers near New Orleans, western Mississippi, and Jackson, Tennessee.
Acquired New Jersey-based Helicon Cable Communications. The systems served about 171,000 customers in eight states in the Southeast and Northeast.
Acquired Avalon Cable TV, adding 260,000 subscribers primarily in Michigan and Massachusetts.
Acquired Vista Broadband Communications in Smyrna, Georgia, adding 30,000 more customers.
Acquired Falcon Cable TV of Los Angeles. Falcon was the eighth-largest cable operator in the United States with about one million subscribers in 27 states in primarily non-urban areas.
Acquired Fanch Communications Inc. of Denver. Fanch had 547,000 subscribers in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Wisconsin.

Charter also began swapping customers with other systems to improve the geographic clustering of its systems. In December 1999, it signed a letter of intent with AT&T Corporation to swap 1.3 million cable subscribers in St. Louis as well as in Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri. In 2000, Charter Communications bought select AT&T cable markets, including Reno, Nevada, and the City of St. Louis.[11]
In 2001, MSN and Charter signed an agreement to offer MSN content and services to Charter's broadband customers. In the same year, Charter received awards, including the Outstanding Corporate Growth Award from the Association for Corporate Growth, the R.E. "Ted" Turner Innovator of the Year Award from the Southern Cable Telecommunications Association,[12] and the Fast 50 Award for Growth from the St. Louis Regional Chamber and Growth Association.
In 2008, Charter stock failed to meet NASDAQ standards and was given warning to comply by October 13 or request an extension.[13]
Also in 2008, it acquired the cable-television franchise and service for the Cerritos and Ventura, California, areas from Wave Broadband.
2009: Filing and emergence from bankruptcy protection[edit]
In February 2009, Charter Communications announced that it planned to file for Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on or before April 1, 2009. The action would allow Charter to pay its debt obligations, and cancel its obligations to shareholders.[citation needed] Private equity firm Apollo Management expected to own most of Charter's shares after the bankruptcy.[14] Charter filed for a prearranged bankruptcy on March 28, 2009. The company expected the financial restructuring to reduce its debt by $8 billion, as well as adding $3 billion of new investment, and refinancing other debt.
On November 30, 2009, its bankruptcy plan was approved, which extinguished its stock and cut approximately $8 billion in debt.[15] That day, Charter emerged from bankruptcy despite many of its creditors' objections over its bankruptcy plan.[16]
2010–2012: Second listing on the NASDAQ; Paul Allen steps down[edit]
On September 14, 2010, Charter Class A common stock was re-listed on NASDAQ under the symbol "CHTR".[17]
In 2011, Paul Allen stepped down as chairman and from the board of directors' seat, but at the time remained the largest single shareholder. Also in that year, Charter signed a multi-year deal with TiVo to deliver content via its platform.[18]
Thomas M. Rutledge was appointed as a director and president and chief executive officer effective February 13, 2012.[19]
The same year, Charter prices $1.25 billion senior debt, offering to pay down short- and long-term debt.[20]
2013–2014: Purchase of former Optimum West operations; Liberty Media investment[edit]
On February 8, 2013, Charter announced an agreement to acquire some former Bresnan Communications systems from Cablevision in a transaction worth US$1.63 billion.[21] The deal brought Charter cable systems to 375,000 customers in Colorado's mountains and Western Slope, as well as in Utah, Wyoming and Montana.[22]
Approximately one month later, on March 19, 2013, Charter announced that Liberty Media, a company controlled by former TCI CEO John C. Malone, would be acquiring a 27.3% ownership interest in the company, making it the company's largest single shareholder, largely through the purchase of interests held by investment funds following Charter's 2009 restructuring.[23] In November 2014, Liberty's holdings in Charter as well as a small minority interest in Time Warner Cable were spun off as a separate holding company named Liberty Broadband Corporation,[24] which as of early 2015 was 47.1% controlled by Malone.[25]
2014–2017: Acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House[edit]
On January 13, 2014, Charter Communications said it was interested in buying its larger rival Time Warner Cable. After three previous attempts to buy and merge with the company, all of which failed, Charter's chief executive officer Thomas Rutledge wrote in an open letter to Time Warner Cable's chief executive officer Robert Marcus stating, "I believe we have a significant opportunity to put our companies together in a way that will create maximum, long-term value for shareholders and employees of both companies".[26] The $132.50 per share offer, just above TWC's closing price at $132.40 on January 13, was rejected.[27]
On February 13, 2014, Time Warner Cable accepted an offer of $158.82 per share from Comcast, avoiding a hostile takeover situation from Charter.[28][29]
On April 28, 2014, Comcast and Charter announced that, assuming Comcast's merger with Time Warner was successful, Charter would acquire 1.4 million Comcast/Time Warner Cable customers, bringing Charter's subscriber total to 30 million and making Charter, by its own count, the second-largest cable operator in the country.[30] In addition to the 1.4 million divested subscribers, Comcast also agreed to swap 1.6 million subscribers with Charter in an even, tax-efficient exchange whose intent is to improve the geographic spread of both companies. In a third part of the agreement, Comcast would spin off 2.5 million subscribers into a new publicly traded company in which Charter would hold a 33% stake — with an option to eventually own the whole company — and former Time Warner Cable shareholders would hold a 67% stake.[31]
In late March 2015, Charter announced plans to purchase Bright House Networks from Advance/Newhouse for $10.4 billion in a combination of cash and equities convertible to Charter stock. The deal was contingent on, among other approvals, the completion of Charter's transactions with Comcast, and the expiration of Time Warner Cable's right of first offer to buy Bright House itself (which was not expected to be exercised in light of the merger with Comcast).[32] However, facing potential difficulties in reaching regulatory approval, Comcast called off its merger with Time Warner Cable in April 2015.[33]
On May 26, 2015, Charter and Time Warner Cable announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement for Charter to merge with Time Warner Cable in a deal valued at $78.7 billion.[34] Charter also confirmed that it would continue with its proposed acquisition of Bright House Networks under slightly modified terms. The deal was subject to regulatory approval, although the deal was expected to face less scrutiny from the FCC than the Comcast/TWC deal, as the companies were relatively smaller, and their media holdings are not as extensive as those of Comcast. The TWC and Bright House systems were to be migrated to Charter's Spectrum brand following the conclusion of the merger.[35]
Liberty Broadband will invest a further $5 billion in Charter and will ultimately hold about 20% ownership in the combined entity. Advance/Newhouse will own about 14%, and other current Time Warner Cable shareholders are expected to hold a combined 44% stake.[35] The merger was approved by the Department of Justice and FCC on April 25, 2016; it is subject to conditions, including a requirement that Charter must not implement usage-based billing, nor use its dominant position in the market to impact the online video industry—which includes a prohibition on charging for interconnections.[36][37] Charter was also required to expand its services to 2 million new households, with at least 1 million being in markets where competing providers operate.[38]
The merger was completed on May 18, 2016.[4][7] The purchase made Charter the third-largest pay television company in the United States, behind AT&T and Comcast (the former having completed its merger with DirecTV in mid-2015).[8]
2017–present: Recent developments[edit]
On January 26, 2017, it was reported that Verizon Communications was in talks with Charter to discuss a possible buyout.[39][40] President and CEO of Liberty Media, Greg Maffei said that they were not interested in the deal.[41][42] The deal was rejected around the end of May 2017.[43] Charter claimed that the deal was too low for them to accept, and Charter's largest shareholder Liberty Media stated that they weren't ready to sell.
In March 2017 under new FCC leadership, Charter's regulatory conditions were changed to require that Charter expand its services to 2 million households that are not currently served by any broadband provider, as opposed to requiring one million of these households to be in areas served by a competitor. The decision was made under goals by new chairman Ajit Pai to increase the availability of broadband in rural areas not served by high-speed Internet, but was criticized for maintaining oligarchies rather than encouraging wider competition.[38]
In May 2017, it was reported that Charter and Comcast had entered into an agreement to "explore working together in a number of potential operational areas in the wireless space" in respect to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs); both providers have agreements with Verizon Wireless to re-sell its services, and Comcast announced that it would begin to do so under the brand Xfinity Mobile later in the year. The agreement includes a provision, lasting for one year, that requires the companies to receive consent from each other before performing wireless-related acquisitions or mergers.[44]
On June 21, 2017, it was reported that Charter was in talks to buy Cox Communications.[45]
Operations[edit]
Current operations[edit]
Coverage[edit]
Charter Communications offers service to an estimated 25 million people in 41 states with significant coverage in 48 states.[46][47]
In August 2008, Charter Communications announced an agreement to carry the Big Ten Network, applicable to all customers.[48]
In May 2009, Comcast was able to meet an agreement with the NFL Network, in which the NFL Network agreed to lower its asking price per subscriber. The higher asking price has been a problem with being carried with other cable networks. Roger Goodell was looking at resolving differences with other cable providers, to include Charter Communications, to allow carriage of this channel.[49]
On August 2011, Charter Communications and the NFL Network announced that they had reached a new long-term agreement to carry the NFL Network in time for the 2011 season.[50]

In November 2013, the company announced the re-branding of its residential services to Charter Spectrum[51] which encompass an upgrade to an all-digital network for its video, voice and broadband services. The company relied heavily on a predominantly coaxial cable-based network. The newer fiber-optic service-delivery system provides higher bandwidth speeds than are available with its coaxial cable infrastructure.[52]
In August 2014, Charter Communications agreed to carry the SEC Network, a new channel from ESPN that airs football and other sports from the Southeastern Conference.[53]
Call centers[edit]
On May 2, 2006, the company announced it would restructure seven of its call centers in the United States in the following locations:


St. Louis, Missouri – Residential HSI/Phone Support, July 31, 2006; converted into a Charter Phone service call center
Bay City, Michigan – September 2006; converted into a Charter Dispatch center
Birmingham, Alabama – December 2006; converted into a Charter Dispatch center
Fort Worth, Texas – December 1, 2006; shuttered
Irwindale, California – December 2009; restructured
Newtown, Connecticut – March 2007; restructured
Kingsport, Tennessee – March 2007; converted to Dispatch Center with location change
Amherst, Nova Scotia – December 2010; third-party contract, Teletech, not renewed
Louisville, Kentucky – Residential HSI/Phone Support, Charter Business technical support, Network Operations Center


Orders completed online or through retail partners with Charter Communications are directed to a call center located in Tempe, Arizona, operated by Teletech (Direct Alliance). This call center has inbound/outbound sales agents, as well as online chat agents. Outsourced call centers were implemented in 2006 and are located in Canada, Honduras and the Philippines.

Charter-owned call centers are located in St. Louis, Missouri (telephone service support center); Billings, Montana; Greenville, South Carolina; Vancouver, Washington; Fond du Lac, Wisconsin; Walker, Michigan; Rochester, Minnesota; Worcester, Massachusetts, and Louisville, Kentucky (the largest call center across the company), with Heathrow, Florida, handling the bulk of video, high-speed data, and telephone billing and customer service contacts.
In 2016, Charter announced that it would be adding 20,000 United States-based jobs, with many of these jobs being call center jobs.[54]
Former operations[edit]
On March 27, 2006, Charter announced that it would sell cable systems serving approximately 43,000 customers in Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah to Orange Broadband Holding Company (since renamed Baja Broadband).[55]
Charter also sold cable systems in West Virginia and Virginia to Cebridge Connections (now known as Suddenlink Communications) and cable systems in Kentucky and Illinois to New Wave Communications.[56]
On October 14, 2008, an article appeared in the Fairmont Sentinel,[57] of Fairmont, Minnesota, reporting that Charter was selling parts of their system to Midcontinent Communications, including Charter's offices in Bemidji and International Falls, Minnesota. Starting February 1, 2009, Midcontinent Communications (now known as Midco) took over some Charter's cable system in Minnesota including Balaton, Bemidji, Canby, Ely, Fairmont, International Falls, Littlefork, Sherburn, and surrounding communities. Other areas in Minnesota would have sold to Comcast, but the deal fell through.[58]
On October 22, 2010, Charter announced completion of the sale of cable systems serving approximately 65,000 customers in seven states to Cobridge Communications, LLC (now known as Fidelity Communications). The 36 head ends acquired by Cobridge are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas. As a result of this sale, Charter no longer operates in Arkansas.[59]
Technology[edit]
Charter utilizes various technologies across its service area. Most customers are still served with older legacy set top boxes and video recorders (DVRs). Charter has indicated that it plans to deploy its new WorldBox across its service area. It also plans to standardize services to the new Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks customers by moving all customers to an all-digital network, and making Internet speeds standard across its service areas.
Belo Corporation dispute[edit]
In December 2008, three television stations which were owned by Belo Corporation prior to its acquisition by Gannett in 2014 (WFAA-TV, WCNC-TV, and KMOV-TV) reported that beginning January 1, 2009, Charter Communications would no longer carry these stations due to a breakdown in negotiations. Charter Communications quickly replied that a resolution to the issue was not out of the question.[60][61][62] The cable operator would have lost access to all of the stations owned by Belo. However, an agreement was reached days before the shutdown date.[63]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2011, PCWorld awarded Charter with several "fastest ISP"-type awards. Charter has upgraded its Internet speed tiers and gave most of its customers a free upgrade in speed twice during the 2011 business year.[64]
In 2009, Charter won a CableFax TopOps award for its Day of Service (DOS) team that answers calls from customers on the day that a technician is scheduled to arrive at their home.[65]
In December 2007, Charter was recognized by CableWorld Magazine as "2007 Multi-System Operator of the Year". According to the magazine, the company was selected for this award based on "rapidly expanding its telephone footprint to take advantage of the triple-play offering; developing a consistent, data-driven marketing plan; and addressing its nearest-term debt maturities".[66] During the spring of 2008, Charter was honored with third place among companies with over 2,000 employees in the annual "Best Places to Work in St. Louis" competition, sponsored by the St. Louis Business Journal, based on the response of Charter employees in the area to an online survey created and managed by the Journal.[67]
Its Fortune ranking is 331 (May 26, 2015).[68]
Criticism[edit]
In 2007, PC World ranked Charter's cable Internet service as the worst among 14 major Internet service providers.[69] In addition, Charter High-Speed is rated 19th out of 22 cable ISPs on dslreports.com,[70] and Consumer Reports indicated in its February 2008 issue that Charter's television/Internet/telephone bundle collectively is the worst of all major national carriers.[71][72]
It was reported by Tony Bradle on about.com that Charter Communications redirected error pages and Windows Live Search results to a Charter search page without notifying customers. Users may opt out of redirection by clicking a link from the Charter search page; however, the opt-out link saves a cookie on the customer's computer, so deleting cookies will require the user to opt out again.[73]
It was reported that on January 21, 2008, during a routine sweep of inactive accounts, Charter accidentally deleted the email accounts of approximately 14,000 customers; even worse, the removed data were irretrievable. The company since decided to give a $150 account credit to each affected user.[74][75] In May 2008, Charter announced that it planned to monitor Web sites visited by its high-speed Internet customers via a partnership with targeted advertising firm NebuAd.[76][77] After customers voiced their concerns, Charter changed its mind in June.[78]
Lawsuits[edit]
In 2002, the United States Department of Justice investigated the company, leading to the indictment of four former executives in 2005 for improper financial reporting related primarily to the inflation of cable subscriber numbers to improve financial figures.[79]
In 2004, Charter settled a class-action lawsuit concerning the questionable financial reporting associated with the U.S. Department of Justice's 2002 investigation and subsequent indictment of four former executives. Current and former shareholders (and their attorneys) were awarded $144 million as well as an agreement from Charter to maintain and implement proper corporate governance measures.[80]
In June 2010, Charter settled a class-action lawsuit for $18 million concerning wage and overtime claims for current and former field technicians in California, Missouri, Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, Nevada, Washington, Oregon and Nebraska.[81]
In December 2013, a complaint was filed by Steelhead Licensing LLC for patent infringement of U.S. Patent 8082318; it is described as "Controlling service requests transmitted from a client to a server".[82][83][84]
In January 2016, the National Association of African-American Owned Media and Byron Allen's Entertainment Studios filed a $10 billion civil rights lawsuit against Charter, claiming discrimination for Charter's refusal to pick up Allen's eight-channel suite of networks (which mainly carry ES content already syndicated through local television stations and paid programming); Allen and the NAAAOM (which has an Entertainment Studios executive as its head) have already filed the same type of suit against several other providers.[85][86]
On May 12, 2016, Charter reached a settlement with the FCC regarding allegations by Zoom Telephonics that, in 2012, following the introduction of new rate plans and the introduction of DOCSIS 3.0, it had begun to bar new subscribers or those switching to the new plans from utilizing customer-purchased modems. Although Charter ended this practice in 2014 and began to allow certain certified modems to be used, Zoom argued that the company was still deliberately limiting options by requiring the modems to undergo a testing protocol concerning factors beyond whether they cause interference or unauthorized receipt of service (the only two factors which providers may use to restrict allowable modems under FCC policy). Charter paid a $640,000 fine, and agreed to use a shorter testing process allowing the use of any DOCSIS 3.0-compatible modem, and send compliance reports to the FCC every six months and whenever a modem is blacklisted.[87]
On February 1, 2017, Charter was sued by the Attorney General of New York for failing to provide its advertised Internet speeds to customers in areas that Charter acquired by the purchase of Time Warner Cable.[88][89]

Charter Communications is an American telecommunications company, which offers its services to consumers and businesses under the branding of Spectrum. Providing services to over 25 million customers in 41 states,[1][4] it is the second-largest cable operator in the United States by subscribers, just behind Comcast, and third largest pay TV operator behind Comcast and AT&T U-verse/DirecTV.[5] It is the fifth largest telephone provider based upon residential subscriber line count.
In late 2012, with the naming of longtime Cablevision executive Thomas Rutledge as their CEO, the company relocated its corporate headquarters from St. Louis, Missouri, to Stamford, Connecticut, although many operations still remain based out of St. Louis.[6] On May 18, 2016, Charter acquired Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks for a combined $71.4 billion, making it the third-largest pay television service in the United States.[4][7][8]

History[edit]
1993–1998: The beginning[edit]
Charter Communications was founded in 1993 by Barry Babcock, Jerald Kent and Howard Wood, who had been former executives at Cencom Cable Television in St. Louis, Missouri. It was also incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1993.[9]
In 1995, Charter paid about $300 million for a controlling interest in Crown Media Holdings and acquired Cable South.[9]
In 1997, Charter and EarthLink joined forces to deliver high-speed Internet access through cable modems to Charter's customers in Los Angeles and Riverside, California.[9]
In 1998, Paul Allen bought a controlling interest. The company paid $2.8 billion to acquire Dallas-based cable company Marcus Cable. Charter Communications had 1 million customers in 1998.[9]
1999–2008: Listing on the NASDAQ; various acquisitions[edit]
In November 1999, the company went public, trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[10] At the time, it had 3.9 million customers.
Charter completed more than 10 major acquisitions in 1999 when it:[9]

Added 68,000 subscribers in Southern California with the purchase of four cable systems from American Cable Entertainment of Stamford, Connecticut.
Acquired 400,000 InterMedia Partners subscribers, primarily in the Southeast. As part of the deal Charter would turn over about 140,000 of its subscribers to TCI in cable system swap.
Merged with Marcus Cable
Acquired cable systems serving 460,000 subscribers from Rifkin Acquisition Partners and InterLink Communications.
Acquired 173,000 subscribers, mostly in central Massachusetts, from New Jersey–based Greater Media Inc.
Acquired Renaissance Media Group, a New York partnership serving 130,000 customers near New Orleans, western Mississippi, and Jackson, Tennessee.
Acquired New Jersey-based Helicon Cable Communications. The systems served about 171,000 customers in eight states in the Southeast and Northeast.
Acquired Avalon Cable TV, adding 260,000 subscribers primarily in Michigan and Massachusetts.
Acquired Vista Broadband Communications in Smyrna, Georgia, adding 30,000 more customers.
Acquired Falcon Cable TV of Los Angeles. Falcon was the eighth-largest cable operator in the United States with about one million subscribers in 27 states in primarily non-urban areas.
Acquired Fanch Communications Inc. of Denver. Fanch had 547,000 subscribers in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Wisconsin.

Charter also began swapping customers with other systems to improve the geographic clustering of its systems. In December 1999, it signed a letter of intent with AT&T Corporation to swap 1.3 million cable subscribers in St. Louis as well as in Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri. In 2000, Charter Communications bought select AT&T cable markets, including Reno, Nevada, and the City of St. Louis.[11]
In 2001, MSN and Charter signed an agreement to offer MSN content and services to Charter's broadband customers. In the same year, Charter received awards, including the Outstanding Corporate Growth Award from the Association for Corporate Growth, the R.E. "Ted" Turner Innovator of the Year Award from the Southern Cable Telecommunications Association,[12] and the Fast 50 Award for Growth from the St. Louis Regional Chamber and Growth Association.
In 2008, Charter stock failed to meet NASDAQ standards and was given warning to comply by October 13 or request an extension.[13]
Also in 2008, it acquired the cable-television franchise and service for the Cerritos and Ventura, California, areas from Wave Broadband.
2009: Filing and emergence from bankruptcy protection[edit]
In February 2009, Charter Communications announced that it planned to file for Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on or before April 1, 2009. The action would allow Charter to pay its debt obligations, and cancel its obligations to shareholders.[citation needed] Private equity firm Apollo Management expected to own most of Charter's shares after the bankruptcy.[14] Charter filed for a prearranged bankruptcy on March 28, 2009. The company expected the financial restructuring to reduce its debt by $8 billion, as well as adding $3 billion of new investment, and refinancing other debt.
On November 30, 2009, its bankruptcy plan was approved, which extinguished its stock and cut approximately $8 billion in debt.[15] That day, Charter emerged from bankruptcy despite many of its creditors' objections over its bankruptcy plan.[16]
2010–2012: Second listing on the NASDAQ; Paul Allen steps down[edit]
On September 14, 2010, Charter Class A common stock was re-listed on NASDAQ under the symbol "CHTR".[17]
In 2011, Paul Allen stepped down as chairman and from the board of directors' seat, but at the time remained the largest single shareholder. Also in that year, Charter signed a multi-year deal with TiVo to deliver content via its platform.[18]
Thomas M. Rutledge was appointed as a director and president and chief executive officer effective February 13, 2012.[19]
The same year, Charter prices $1.25 billion senior debt, offering to pay down short- and long-term debt.[20]
2013–2014: Purchase of former Optimum West operations; Liberty Media investment[edit]
On February 8, 2013, Charter announced an agreement to acquire some former Bresnan Communications systems from Cablevision in a transaction worth US$1.63 billion.[21] The deal brought Charter cable systems to 375,000 customers in Colorado's mountains and Western Slope, as well as in Utah, Wyoming and Montana.[22]
Approximately one month later, on March 19, 2013, Charter announced that Liberty Media, a company controlled by former TCI CEO John C. Malone, would be acquiring a 27.3% ownership interest in the company, making it the company's largest single shareholder, largely through the purchase of interests held by investment funds following Charter's 2009 restructuring.[23] In November 2014, Liberty's holdings in Charter as well as a small minority interest in Time Warner Cable were spun off as a separate holding company named Liberty Broadband Corporation,[24] which as of early 2015 was 47.1% controlled by Malone.[25]
2014–2017: Acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House[edit]
On January 13, 2014, Charter Communications said it was interested in buying its larger rival Time Warner Cable. After three previous attempts to buy and merge with the company, all of which failed, Charter's chief executive officer Thomas Rutledge wrote in an open letter to Time Warner Cable's chief executive officer Robert Marcus stating, "I believe we have a significant opportunity to put our companies together in a way that will create maximum, long-term value for shareholders and employees of both companies".[26] The $132.50 per share offer, just above TWC's closing price at $132.40 on January 13, was rejected.[27]
On February 13, 2014, Time Warner Cable accepted an offer of $158.82 per share from Comcast, avoiding a hostile takeover situation from Charter.[28][29]
On April 28, 2014, Comcast and Charter announced that, assuming Comcast's merger with Time Warner was successful, Charter would acquire 1.4 million Comcast/Time Warner Cable customers, bringing Charter's subscriber total to 30 million and making Charter, by its own count, the second-largest cable operator in the country.[30] In addition to the 1.4 million divested subscribers, Comcast also agreed to swap 1.6 million subscribers with Charter in an even, tax-efficient exchange whose intent is to improve the geographic spread of both companies. In a third part of the agreement, Comcast would spin off 2.5 million subscribers into a new publicly traded company in which Charter would hold a 33% stake — with an option to eventually own the whole company — and former Time Warner Cable shareholders would hold a 67% stake.[31]
In late March 2015, Charter announced plans to purchase Bright House Networks from Advance/Newhouse for $10.4 billion in a combination of cash and equities convertible to Charter stock. The deal was contingent on, among other approvals, the completion of Charter's transactions with Comcast, and the expiration of Time Warner Cable's right of first offer to buy Bright House itself (which was not expected to be exercised in light of the merger with Comcast).[32] However, facing potential difficulties in reaching regulatory approval, Comcast called off its merger with Time Warner Cable in April 2015.[33]
On May 26, 2015, Charter and Time Warner Cable announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement for Charter to merge with Time Warner Cable in a deal valued at $78.7 billion.[34] Charter also confirmed that it would continue with its proposed acquisition of Bright House Networks under slightly modified terms. The deal was subject to regulatory approval, although the deal was expected to face less scrutiny from the FCC than the Comcast/TWC deal, as the companies were relatively smaller, and their media holdings are not as extensive as those of Comcast. The TWC and Bright House systems were to be migrated to Charter's Spectrum brand following the conclusion of the merger.[35]
Liberty Broadband will invest a further $5 billion in Charter and will ultimately hold about 20% ownership in the combined entity. Advance/Newhouse will own about 14%, and other current Time Warner Cable shareholders are expected to hold a combined 44% stake.[35] The merger was approved by the Department of Justice and FCC on April 25, 2016; it is subject to conditions, including a requirement that Charter must not implement usage-based billing, nor use its dominant position in the market to impact the online video industry—which includes a prohibition on charging for interconnections.[36][37] Charter was also required to expand its services to 2 million new households, with at least 1 million being in markets where competing providers operate.[38]
The merger was completed on May 18, 2016.[4][7] The purchase made Charter the third-largest pay television company in the United States, behind AT&T and Comcast (the former having completed its merger with DirecTV in mid-2015).[8]
2017–present: Recent developments[edit]
On January 26, 2017, it was reported that Verizon Communications was in talks with Charter to discuss a possible buyout.[39][40] President and CEO of Liberty Media, Greg Maffei said that they were not interested in the deal.[41][42] The deal was rejected around the end of May 2017.[43] Charter claimed that the deal was too low for them to accept, and Charter's largest shareholder Liberty Media stated that they weren't ready to sell.
In March 2017 under new FCC leadership, Charter's regulatory conditions were changed to require that Charter expand its services to 2 million households that are not currently served by any broadband provider, as opposed to requiring one million of these households to be in areas served by a competitor. The decision was made under goals by new chairman Ajit Pai to increase the availability of broadband in rural areas not served by high-speed Internet, but was criticized for maintaining oligarchies rather than encouraging wider competition.[38]
In May 2017, it was reported that Charter and Comcast had entered into an agreement to "explore working together in a number of potential operational areas in the wireless space" in respect to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs); both providers have agreements with Verizon Wireless to re-sell its services, and Comcast announced that it would begin to do so under the brand Xfinity Mobile later in the year. The agreement includes a provision, lasting for one year, that requires the companies to receive consent from each other before performing wireless-related acquisitions or mergers.[44]
On June 21, 2017, it was reported that Charter was in talks to buy Cox Communications.[45]
Operations[edit]
Current operations[edit]
Coverage[edit]
Charter Communications offers service to an estimated 25 million people in 41 states with significant coverage in 48 states.[46][47]
In August 2008, Charter Communications announced an agreement to carry the Big Ten Network, applicable to all customers.[48]
In May 2009, Comcast was able to meet an agreement with the NFL Network, in which the NFL Network agreed to lower its asking price per subscriber. The higher asking price has been a problem with being carried with other cable networks. Roger Goodell was looking at resolving differences with other cable providers, to include Charter Communications, to allow carriage of this channel.[49]
On August 2011, Charter Communications and the NFL Network announced that they had reached a new long-term agreement to carry the NFL Network in time for the 2011 season.[50]




Logo of Charter's Spectrum service


In November 2013, the company announced the re-branding of its residential services to Charter Spectrum[51] which encompass an upgrade to an all-digital network for its video, voice and broadband services. The company relied heavily on a predominantly coaxial cable-based network. The newer fiber-optic service-delivery system provides higher bandwidth speeds than are available with its coaxial cable infrastructure.[52]
In August 2014, Charter Communications agreed to carry the SEC Network, a new channel from ESPN that airs football and other sports from the Southeastern Conference.[53]
Call centers[edit]
On May 2, 2006, the company announced it would restructure seven of its call centers in the United States in the following locations:


St. Louis, Missouri – Residential HSI/Phone Support, July 31, 2006; converted into a Charter Phone service call center
Bay City, Michigan – September 2006; converted into a Charter Dispatch center
Birmingham, Alabama – December 2006; converted into a Charter Dispatch center
Fort Worth, Texas – December 1, 2006; shuttered
Irwindale, California – December 2009; restructured
Newtown, Connecticut – March 2007; restructured
Kingsport, Tennessee – March 2007; converted to Dispatch Center with location change
Amherst, Nova Scotia – December 2010; third-party contract, Teletech, not renewed
Louisville, Kentucky – Residential HSI/Phone Support, Charter Business technical support, Network Operations Center


Orders completed online or through retail partners with Charter Communications are directed to a call center located in Tempe, Arizona, operated by Teletech (Direct Alliance). This call center has inbound/outbound sales agents, as well as online chat agents. Outsourced call centers were implemented in 2006 and are located in Canada, Honduras and the Philippines.

Charter-owned call centers are located in St. Louis, Missouri (telephone service support center); Billings, Montana; Greenville, South Carolina; Vancouver, Washington; Fond du Lac, Wisconsin; Walker, Michigan; Rochester, Minnesota; Worcester, Massachusetts, and Louisville, Kentucky (the largest call center across the company), with Heathrow, Florida, handling the bulk of video, high-speed data, and telephone billing and customer service contacts.
In 2016, Charter announced that it would be adding 20,000 United States-based jobs, with many of these jobs being call center jobs.[54]
Former operations[edit]
On March 27, 2006, Charter announced that it would sell cable systems serving approximately 43,000 customers in Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah to Orange Broadband Holding Company (since renamed Baja Broadband).[55]
Charter also sold cable systems in West Virginia and Virginia to Cebridge Connections (now known as Suddenlink Communications) and cable systems in Kentucky and Illinois to New Wave Communications.[56]
On October 14, 2008, an article appeared in the Fairmont Sentinel,[57] of Fairmont, Minnesota, reporting that Charter was selling parts of their system to Midcontinent Communications, including Charter's offices in Bemidji and International Falls, Minnesota. Starting February 1, 2009, Midcontinent Communications (now known as Midco) took over some Charter's cable system in Minnesota including Balaton, Bemidji, Canby, Ely, Fairmont, International Falls, Littlefork, Sherburn, and surrounding communities. Other areas in Minnesota would have sold to Comcast, but the deal fell through.[58]
On October 22, 2010, Charter announced completion of the sale of cable systems serving approximately 65,000 customers in seven states to Cobridge Communications, LLC (now known as Fidelity Communications). The 36 head ends acquired by Cobridge are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas. As a result of this sale, Charter no longer operates in Arkansas.[59]
Technology[edit]
Charter utilizes various technologies across its service area. Most customers are still served with older legacy set top boxes and video recorders (DVRs). Charter has indicated that it plans to deploy its new WorldBox across its service area. It also plans to standardize services to the new Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks customers by moving all customers to an all-digital network, and making Internet speeds standard across its service areas.
Belo Corporation dispute[edit]
In December 2008, three television stations which were owned by Belo Corporation prior to its acquisition by Gannett in 2014 (WFAA-TV, WCNC-TV, and KMOV-TV) reported that beginning January 1, 2009, Charter Communications would no longer carry these stations due to a breakdown in negotiations. Charter Communications quickly replied that a resolution to the issue was not out of the question.[60][61][62] The cable operator would have lost access to all of the stations owned by Belo. However, an agreement was reached days before the shutdown date.[63]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2011, PCWorld awarded Charter with several "fastest ISP"-type awards. Charter has upgraded its Internet speed tiers and gave most of its customers a free upgrade in speed twice during the 2011 business year.[64]
In 2009, Charter won a CableFax TopOps award for its Day of Service (DOS) team that answers calls from customers on the day that a technician is scheduled to arrive at their home.[65]
In December 2007, Charter was recognized by CableWorld Magazine as "2007 Multi-System Operator of the Year". According to the magazine, the company was selected for this award based on "rapidly expanding its telephone footprint to take advantage of the triple-play offering; developing a consistent, data-driven marketing plan; and addressing its nearest-term debt maturities".[66] During the spring of 2008, Charter was honored with third place among companies with over 2,000 employees in the annual "Best Places to Work in St. Louis" competition, sponsored by the St. Louis Business Journal, based on the response of Charter employees in the area to an online survey created and managed by the Journal.[67]
Its Fortune ranking is 331 (May 26, 2015).[68]
Criticism[edit]
In 2007, PC World ranked Charter's cable Internet service as the worst among 14 major Internet service providers.[69] In addition, Charter High-Speed is rated 19th out of 22 cable ISPs on dslreports.com,[70] and Consumer Reports indicated in its February 2008 issue that Charter's television/Internet/telephone bundle collectively is the worst of all major national carriers.[71][72]
It was reported by Tony Bradle on about.com that Charter Communications redirected error pages and Windows Live Search results to a Charter search page without notifying customers. Users may opt out of redirection by clicking a link from the Charter search page; however, the opt-out link saves a cookie on the customer's computer, so deleting cookies will require the user to opt out again.[73]
It was reported that on January 21, 2008, during a routine sweep of inactive accounts, Charter accidentally deleted the email accounts of approximately 14,000 customers; even worse, the removed data were irretrievable. The company since decided to give a $150 account credit to each affected user.[74][75] In May 2008, Charter announced that it planned to monitor Web sites visited by its high-speed Internet customers via a partnership with targeted advertising firm NebuAd.[76][77] After customers voiced their concerns, Charter changed its mind in June.[78]
Lawsuits[edit]
In 2002, the United States Department of Justice investigated the company, leading to the indictment of four former executives in 2005 for improper financial reporting related primarily to the inflation of cable subscriber numbers to improve financial figures.[79]
In 2004, Charter settled a class-action lawsuit concerning the questionable financial reporting associated with the U.S. Department of Justice's 2002 investigation and subsequent indictment of four former executives. Current and former shareholders (and their attorneys) were awarded $144 million as well as an agreement from Charter to maintain and implement proper corporate governance measures.[80]
In June 2010, Charter settled a class-action lawsuit for $18 million concerning wage and overtime claims for current and former field technicians in California, Missouri, Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, Nevada, Washington, Oregon and Nebraska.[81]
In December 2013, a complaint was filed by Steelhead Licensing LLC for patent infringement of U.S. Patent 8082318; it is described as "Controlling service requests transmitted from a client to a server".[82][83][84]
In January 2016, the National Association of African-American Owned Media and Byron Allen's Entertainment Studios filed a $10 billion civil rights lawsuit against Charter, claiming discrimination for Charter's refusal to pick up Allen's eight-channel suite of networks (which mainly carry ES content already syndicated through local television stations and paid programming); Allen and the NAAAOM (which has an Entertainment Studios executive as its head) have already filed the same type of suit against several other providers.[85][86]
On May 12, 2016, Charter reached a settlement with the FCC regarding allegations by Zoom Telephonics that, in 2012, following the introduction of new rate plans and the introduction of DOCSIS 3.0, it had begun to bar new subscribers or those switching to the new plans from utilizing customer-purchased modems. Although Charter ended this practice in 2014 and began to allow certain certified modems to be used, Zoom argued that the company was still deliberately limiting options by requiring the modems to undergo a testing protocol concerning factors beyond whether they cause interference or unauthorized receipt of service (the only two factors which providers may use to restrict allowable modems under FCC policy). Charter paid a $640,000 fine, and agreed to use a shorter testing process allowing the use of any DOCSIS 3.0-compatible modem, and send compliance reports to the FCC every six months and whenever a modem is blacklisted.[87]
On February 1, 2017, Charter was sued by the Attorney General of New York for failing to provide its advertised Internet speeds to customers in areas that Charter acquired by the purchase of Time Warner Cable.[88][89]

Charter Communications is an American telecommunications company, which offers its services to consumers and businesses under the branding of Spectrum. Providing services to over 25 million customers in 41 states,[1][4] it is the second-largest cable operator in the United States by subscribers, just behind Comcast, and third largest pay TV operator behind Comcast and AT&T U-verse/DirecTV.[5] It is the fifth largest telephone provider based upon residential subscriber line count.
In late 2012, with the naming of longtime Cablevision executive Thomas Rutledge as their CEO, the company relocated its corporate headquarters from St. Louis, Missouri, to Stamford, Connecticut, although many operations still remain based out of St. Louis.[6] On May 18, 2016, Charter acquired Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks for a combined $71.4 billion, making it the third-largest pay television service in the United States.[4][7][8]

History[edit]
1993–1998: The beginning[edit]
Charter Communications was founded in 1993 by Barry Babcock, Jerald Kent and Howard Wood, who had been former executives at Cencom Cable Television in St. Louis, Missouri. It was also incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1993.[9]
In 1995, Charter paid about $300 million for a controlling interest in Crown Media Holdings and acquired Cable South.[9]
In 1997, Charter and EarthLink joined forces to deliver high-speed Internet access through cable modems to Charter's customers in Los Angeles and Riverside, California.[9]
In 1998, Paul Allen bought a controlling interest. The company paid $2.8 billion to acquire Dallas-based cable company Marcus Cable. Charter Communications had 1 million customers in 1998.[9]
1999–2008: Listing on the NASDAQ; various acquisitions[edit]
In November 1999, the company went public, trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[10] At the time, it had 3.9 million customers.
Charter completed more than 10 major acquisitions in 1999 when it:[9]

Added 68,000 subscribers in Southern California with the purchase of four cable systems from American Cable Entertainment of Stamford, Connecticut.
Acquired 400,000 InterMedia Partners subscribers, primarily in the Southeast. As part of the deal Charter would turn over about 140,000 of its subscribers to TCI in cable system swap.
Merged with Marcus Cable
Acquired cable systems serving 460,000 subscribers from Rifkin Acquisition Partners and InterLink Communications.
Acquired 173,000 subscribers, mostly in central Massachusetts, from New Jersey–based Greater Media Inc.
Acquired Renaissance Media Group, a New York partnership serving 130,000 customers near New Orleans, western Mississippi, and Jackson, Tennessee.
Acquired New Jersey-based Helicon Cable Communications. The systems served about 171,000 customers in eight states in the Southeast and Northeast.
Acquired Avalon Cable TV, adding 260,000 subscribers primarily in Michigan and Massachusetts.
Acquired Vista Broadband Communications in Smyrna, Georgia, adding 30,000 more customers.
Acquired Falcon Cable TV of Los Angeles. Falcon was the eighth-largest cable operator in the United States with about one million subscribers in 27 states in primarily non-urban areas.
Acquired Fanch Communications Inc. of Denver. Fanch had 547,000 subscribers in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Wisconsin.

Charter also began swapping customers with other systems to improve the geographic clustering of its systems. In December 1999, it signed a letter of intent with AT&T Corporation to swap 1.3 million cable subscribers in St. Louis as well as in Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri. In 2000, Charter Communications bought select AT&T cable markets, including Reno, Nevada, and the City of St. Louis.[11]
In 2001, MSN and Charter signed an agreement to offer MSN content and services to Charter's broadband customers. In the same year, Charter received awards, including the Outstanding Corporate Growth Award from the Association for Corporate Growth, the R.E. "Ted" Turner Innovator of the Year Award from the Southern Cable Telecommunications Association,[12] and the Fast 50 Award for Growth from the St. Louis Regional Chamber and Growth Association.
In 2008, Charter stock failed to meet NASDAQ standards and was given warning to comply by October 13 or request an extension.[13]
Also in 2008, it acquired the cable-television franchise and service for the Cerritos and Ventura, California, areas from Wave Broadband.
2009: Filing and emergence from bankruptcy protection[edit]
In February 2009, Charter Communications announced that it planned to file for Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on or before April 1, 2009. The action would allow Charter to pay its debt obligations, and cancel its obligations to shareholders.[citation needed] Private equity firm Apollo Management expected to own most of Charter's shares after the bankruptcy.[14] Charter filed for a prearranged bankruptcy on March 28, 2009. The company expected the financial restructuring to reduce its debt by $8 billion, as well as adding $3 billion of new investment, and refinancing other debt.
On November 30, 2009, its bankruptcy plan was approved, which extinguished its stock and cut approximately $8 billion in debt.[15] That day, Charter emerged from bankruptcy despite many of its creditors' objections over its bankruptcy plan.[16]
2010–2012: Second listing on the NASDAQ; Paul Allen steps down[edit]
On September 14, 2010, Charter Class A common stock was re-listed on NASDAQ under the symbol "CHTR".[17]
In 2011, Paul Allen stepped down as chairman and from the board of directors' seat, but at the time remained the largest single shareholder. Also in that year, Charter signed a multi-year deal with TiVo to deliver content via its platform.[18]
Thomas M. Rutledge was appointed as a director and president and chief executive officer effective February 13, 2012.[19]
The same year, Charter prices $1.25 billion senior debt, offering to pay down short- and long-term debt.[20]
2013–2014: Purchase of former Optimum West operations; Liberty Media investment[edit]
On February 8, 2013, Charter announced an agreement to acquire some former Bresnan Communications systems from Cablevision in a transaction worth US$1.63 billion.[21] The deal brought Charter cable systems to 375,000 customers in Colorado's mountains and Western Slope, as well as in Utah, Wyoming and Montana.[22]
Approximately one month later, on March 19, 2013, Charter announced that Liberty Media, a company controlled by former TCI CEO John C. Malone, would be acquiring a 27.3% ownership interest in the company, making it the company's largest single shareholder, largely through the purchase of interests held by investment funds following Charter's 2009 restructuring.[23] In November 2014, Liberty's holdings in Charter as well as a small minority interest in Time Warner Cable were spun off as a separate holding company named Liberty Broadband Corporation,[24] which as of early 2015 was 47.1% controlled by Malone.[25]
2014–2017: Acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House[edit]
On January 13, 2014, Charter Communications said it was interested in buying its larger rival Time Warner Cable. After three previous attempts to buy and merge with the company, all of which failed, Charter's chief executive officer Thomas Rutledge wrote in an open letter to Time Warner Cable's chief executive officer Robert Marcus stating, "I believe we have a significant opportunity to put our companies together in a way that will create maximum, long-term value for shareholders and employees of both companies".[26] The $132.50 per share offer, just above TWC's closing price at $132.40 on January 13, was rejected.[27]
On February 13, 2014, Time Warner Cable accepted an offer of $158.82 per share from Comcast, avoiding a hostile takeover situation from Charter.[28][29]
On April 28, 2014, Comcast and Charter announced that, assuming Comcast's merger with Time Warner was successful, Charter would acquire 1.4 million Comcast/Time Warner Cable customers, bringing Charter's subscriber total to 30 million and making Charter, by its own count, the second-largest cable operator in the country.[30] In addition to the 1.4 million divested subscribers, Comcast also agreed to swap 1.6 million subscribers with Charter in an even, tax-efficient exchange whose intent is to improve the geographic spread of both companies. In a third part of the agreement, Comcast would spin off 2.5 million subscribers into a new publicly traded company in which Charter would hold a 33% stake — with an option to eventually own the whole company — and former Time Warner Cable shareholders would hold a 67% stake.[31]
In late March 2015, Charter announced plans to purchase Bright House Networks from Advance/Newhouse for $10.4 billion in a combination of cash and equities convertible to Charter stock. The deal was contingent on, among other approvals, the completion of Charter's transactions with Comcast, and the expiration of Time Warner Cable's right of first offer to buy Bright House itself (which was not expected to be exercised in light of the merger with Comcast).[32] However, facing potential difficulties in reaching regulatory approval, Comcast called off its merger with Time Warner Cable in April 2015.[33]
On May 26, 2015, Charter and Time Warner Cable announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement for Charter to merge with Time Warner Cable in a deal valued at $78.7 billion.[34] Charter also confirmed that it would continue with its proposed acquisition of Bright House Networks under slightly modified terms. The deal was subject to regulatory approval, although the deal was expected to face less scrutiny from the FCC than the Comcast/TWC deal, as the companies were relatively smaller, and their media holdings are not as extensive as those of Comcast. The TWC and Bright House systems were to be migrated to Charter's Spectrum brand following the conclusion of the merger.[35]
Liberty Broadband will invest a further $5 billion in Charter and will ultimately hold about 20% ownership in the combined entity. Advance/Newhouse will own about 14%, and other current Time Warner Cable shareholders are expected to hold a combined 44% stake.[35] The merger was approved by the Department of Justice and FCC on April 25, 2016; it is subject to conditions, including a requirement that Charter must not implement usage-based billing, nor use its dominant position in the market to impact the online video industry—which includes a prohibition on charging for interconnections.[36][37] Charter was also required to expand its services to 2 million new households, with at least 1 million being in markets where competing providers operate.[38]
The merger was completed on May 18, 2016.[4][7] The purchase made Charter the third-largest pay television company in the United States, behind AT&T and Comcast (the former having completed its merger with DirecTV in mid-2015).[8]
2017–present: Recent developments[edit]
On January 26, 2017, it was reported that Verizon Communications was in talks with Charter to discuss a possible buyout.[39][40] President and CEO of Liberty Media, Greg Maffei said that they were not interested in the deal.[41][42] The deal was rejected around the end of May 2017.[43] Charter claimed that the deal was too low for them to accept, and Charter's largest shareholder Liberty Media stated that they weren't ready to sell.
In March 2017 under new FCC leadership, Charter's regulatory conditions were changed to require that Charter expand its services to 2 million households that are not currently served by any broadband provider, as opposed to requiring one million of these households to be in areas served by a competitor. The decision was made under goals by new chairman Ajit Pai to increase the availability of broadband in rural areas not served by high-speed Internet, but was criticized for maintaining oligarchies rather than encouraging wider competition.[38]
In May 2017, it was reported that Charter and Comcast had entered into an agreement to "explore working together in a number of potential operational areas in the wireless space" in respect to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs); both providers have agreements with Verizon Wireless to re-sell its services, and Comcast announced that it would begin to do so under the brand Xfinity Mobile later in the year. The agreement includes a provision, lasting for one year, that requires the companies to receive consent from each other before performing wireless-related acquisitions or mergers.[44]
On June 21, 2017, it was reported that Charter was in talks to buy Cox Communications.[45]
Operations[edit]
Current operations[edit]
Coverage[edit]
Charter Communications offers service to an estimated 25 million people in 41 states with significant coverage in 48 states.[46][47]
In August 2008, Charter Communications announced an agreement to carry the Big Ten Network, applicable to all customers.[48]
In May 2009, Comcast was able to meet an agreement with the NFL Network, in which the NFL Network agreed to lower its asking price per subscriber. The higher asking price has been a problem with being carried with other cable networks. Roger Goodell was looking at resolving differences with other cable providers, to include Charter Communications, to allow carriage of this channel.[49]
On August 2011, Charter Communications and the NFL Network announced that they had reached a new long-term agreement to carry the NFL Network in time for the 2011 season.[50]

In November 2013, the company announced the re-branding of its residential services to Charter Spectrum[51] which encompass an upgrade to an all-digital network for its video, voice and broadband services. The company relied heavily on a predominantly coaxial cable-based network. The newer fiber-optic service-delivery system provides higher bandwidth speeds than are available with its coaxial cable infrastructure.[52]
In August 2014, Charter Communications agreed to carry the SEC Network, a new channel from ESPN that airs football and other sports from the Southeastern Conference.[53]
Call centers[edit]
On May 2, 2006, the company announced it would restructure seven of its call centers in the United States in the following locations:


St. Louis, Missouri – Residential HSI/Phone Support, July 31, 2006; converted into a Charter Phone service call center
Bay City, Michigan – September 2006; converted into a Charter Dispatch center
Birmingham, Alabama – December 2006; converted into a Charter Dispatch center
Fort Worth, Texas – December 1, 2006; shuttered
Irwindale, California – December 2009; restructured
Newtown, Connecticut – March 2007; restructured
Kingsport, Tennessee – March 2007; converted to Dispatch Center with location change
Amherst, Nova Scotia – December 2010; third-party contract, Teletech, not renewed
Louisville, Kentucky – Residential HSI/Phone Support, Charter Business technical support, Network Operations Center


Orders completed online or through retail partners with Charter Communications are directed to a call center located in Tempe, Arizona, operated by Teletech (Direct Alliance). This call center has inbound/outbound sales agents, as well as online chat agents. Outsourced call centers were implemented in 2006 and are located in Canada, Honduras and the Philippines.

Charter-owned call centers are located in St. Louis, Missouri (telephone service support center); Billings, Montana; Greenville, South Carolina; Vancouver, Washington; Fond du Lac, Wisconsin; Walker, Michigan; Rochester, Minnesota; Worcester, Massachusetts, and Louisville, Kentucky (the largest call center across the company), with Heathrow, Florida, handling the bulk of video, high-speed data, and telephone billing and customer service contacts.
In 2016, Charter announced that it would be adding 20,000 United States-based jobs, with many of these jobs being call center jobs.[54]
Former operations[edit]
On March 27, 2006, Charter announced that it would sell cable systems serving approximately 43,000 customers in Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah to Orange Broadband Holding Company (since renamed Baja Broadband).[55]
Charter also sold cable systems in West Virginia and Virginia to Cebridge Connections (now known as Suddenlink Communications) and cable systems in Kentucky and Illinois to New Wave Communications.[56]
On October 14, 2008, an article appeared in the Fairmont Sentinel,[57] of Fairmont, Minnesota, reporting that Charter was selling parts of their system to Midcontinent Communications, including Charter's offices in Bemidji and International Falls, Minnesota. Starting February 1, 2009, Midcontinent Communications (now known as Midco) took over some Charter's cable system in Minnesota including Balaton, Bemidji, Canby, Ely, Fairmont, International Falls, Littlefork, Sherburn, and surrounding communities. Other areas in Minnesota would have sold to Comcast, but the deal fell through.[58]
On October 22, 2010, Charter announced completion of the sale of cable systems serving approximately 65,000 customers in seven states to Cobridge Communications, LLC (now known as Fidelity Communications). The 36 head ends acquired by Cobridge are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas. As a result of this sale, Charter no longer operates in Arkansas.[59]
Technology[edit]
Charter utilizes various technologies across its service area. Most customers are still served with older legacy set top boxes and video recorders (DVRs). Charter has indicated that it plans to deploy its new WorldBox across its service area. It also plans to standardize services to the new Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks customers by moving all customers to an all-digital network, and making Internet speeds standard across its service areas.
Belo Corporation dispute[edit]
In December 2008, three television stations which were owned by Belo Corporation prior to its acquisition by Gannett in 2014 (WFAA-TV, WCNC-TV, and KMOV-TV) reported that beginning January 1, 2009, Charter Communications would no longer carry these stations due to a breakdown in negotiations. Charter Communications quickly replied that a resolution to the issue was not out of the question.[60][61][62] The cable operator would have lost access to all of the stations owned by Belo. However, an agreement was reached days before the shutdown date.[63]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2011, PCWorld awarded Charter with several "fastest ISP"-type awards. Charter has upgraded its Internet speed tiers and gave most of its customers a free upgrade in speed twice during the 2011 business year.[64]
In 2009, Charter won a CableFax TopOps award for its Day of Service (DOS) team that answers calls from customers on the day that a technician is scheduled to arrive at their home.[65]
In December 2007, Charter was recognized by CableWorld Magazine as "2007 Multi-System Operator of the Year". According to the magazine, the company was selected for this award based on "rapidly expanding its telephone footprint to take advantage of the triple-play offering; developing a consistent, data-driven marketing plan; and addressing its nearest-term debt maturities".[66] During the spring of 2008, Charter was honored with third place among companies with over 2,000 employees in the annual "Best Places to Work in St. Louis" competition, sponsored by the St. Louis Business Journal, based on the response of Charter employees in the area to an online survey created and managed by the Journal.[67]
Its Fortune ranking is 331 (May 26, 2015).[68]
Criticism[edit]
In 2007, PC World ranked Charter's cable Internet service as the worst among 14 major Internet service providers.[69] In addition, Charter High-Speed is rated 19th out of 22 cable ISPs on dslreports.com,[70] and Consumer Reports indicated in its February 2008 issue that Charter's television/Internet/telephone bundle collectively is the worst of all major national carriers.[71][72]
It was reported by Tony Bradle on about.com that Charter Communications redirected error pages and Windows Live Search results to a Charter search page without notifying customers. Users may opt out of redirection by clicking a link from the Charter search page; however, the opt-out link saves a cookie on the customer's computer, so deleting cookies will require the user to opt out again.[73]
It was reported that on January 21, 2008, during a routine sweep of inactive accounts, Charter accidentally deleted the email accounts of approximately 14,000 customers; even worse, the removed data were irretrievable. The company since decided to give a $150 account credit to each affected user.[74][75] In May 2008, Charter announced that it planned to monitor Web sites visited by its high-speed Internet customers via a partnership with targeted advertising firm NebuAd.[76][77] After customers voiced their concerns, Charter changed its mind in June.[78]
Lawsuits[edit]
In 2002, the United States Department of Justice investigated the company, leading to the indictment of four former executives in 2005 for improper financial reporting related primarily to the inflation of cable subscriber numbers to improve financial figures.[79]
In 2004, Charter settled a class-action lawsuit concerning the questionable financial reporting associated with the U.S. Department of Justice's 2002 investigation and subsequent indictment of four former executives. Current and former shareholders (and their attorneys) were awarded $144 million as well as an agreement from Charter to maintain and implement proper corporate governance measures.[80]
In June 2010, Charter settled a class-action lawsuit for $18 million concerning wage and overtime claims for current and former field technicians in California, Missouri, Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, Nevada, Washington, Oregon and Nebraska.[81]
In December 2013, a complaint was filed by Steelhead Licensing LLC for patent infringement of U.S. Patent 8082318; it is described as "Controlling service requests transmitted from a client to a server".[82][83][84]
In January 2016, the National Association of African-American Owned Media and Byron Allen's Entertainment Studios filed a $10 billion civil rights lawsuit against Charter, claiming discrimination for Charter's refusal to pick up Allen's eight-channel suite of networks (which mainly carry ES content already syndicated through local television stations and paid programming); Allen and the NAAAOM (which has an Entertainment Studios executive as its head) have already filed the same type of suit against several other providers.[85][86]
On May 12, 2016, Charter reached a settlement with the FCC regarding allegations by Zoom Telephonics that, in 2012, following the introduction of new rate plans and the introduction of DOCSIS 3.0, it had begun to bar new subscribers or those switching to the new plans from utilizing customer-purchased modems. Although Charter ended this practice in 2014 and began to allow certain certified modems to be used, Zoom argued that the company was still deliberately limiting options by requiring the modems to undergo a testing protocol concerning factors beyond whether they cause interference or unauthorized receipt of service (the only two factors which providers may use to restrict allowable modems under FCC policy). Charter paid a $640,000 fine, and agreed to use a shorter testing process allowing the use of any DOCSIS 3.0-compatible modem, and send compliance reports to the FCC every six months and whenever a modem is blacklisted.[87]
On February 1, 2017, Charter was sued by the Attorney General of New York for failing to provide its advertised Internet speeds to customers in areas that Charter acquired by the purchase of Time Warner Cable.[88][89]

Charter Communications is an American telecommunications company, which offers its services to consumers and businesses under the branding of Spectrum. Providing services to over 25 million customers in 41 states,[1][4] it is the second-largest cable operator in the United States by subscribers, just behind Comcast, and third largest pay TV operator behind Comcast and AT&T U-verse/DirecTV.[5] It is the fifth largest telephone provider based upon residential subscriber line count.
In late 2012, with the naming of longtime Cablevision executive Thomas Rutledge as their CEO, the company relocated its corporate headquarters from St. Louis, Missouri, to Stamford, Connecticut, although many operations still remain based out of St. Louis.[6] On May 18, 2016, Charter acquired Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks for a combined $71.4 billion, making it the third-largest pay television service in the United States.[4][7][8]

History[edit]
1993–1998: The beginning[edit]
Charter Communications was founded in 1993 by Barry Babcock, Jerald Kent and Howard Wood, who had been former executives at Cencom Cable Television in St. Louis, Missouri. It was also incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1993.[9]
In 1995, Charter paid about $300 million for a controlling interest in Crown Media Holdings and acquired Cable South.[9]
In 1997, Charter and EarthLink joined forces to deliver high-speed Internet access through cable modems to Charter's customers in Los Angeles and Riverside, California.[9]
In 1998, Paul Allen bought a controlling interest. The company paid $2.8 billion to acquire Dallas-based cable company Marcus Cable. Charter Communications had 1 million customers in 1998.[9]
1999–2008: Listing on the NASDAQ; various acquisitions[edit]
In November 1999, the company went public, trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[10] At the time, it had 3.9 million customers.
Charter completed more than 10 major acquisitions in 1999 when it:[9]

Added 68,000 subscribers in Southern California with the purchase of four cable systems from American Cable Entertainment of Stamford, Connecticut.
Acquired 400,000 InterMedia Partners subscribers, primarily in the Southeast. As part of the deal Charter would turn over about 140,000 of its subscribers to TCI in cable system swap.
Merged with Marcus Cable
Acquired cable systems serving 460,000 subscribers from Rifkin Acquisition Partners and InterLink Communications.
Acquired 173,000 subscribers, mostly in central Massachusetts, from New Jersey–based Greater Media Inc.
Acquired Renaissance Media Group, a New York partnership serving 130,000 customers near New Orleans, western Mississippi, and Jackson, Tennessee.
Acquired New Jersey-based Helicon Cable Communications. The systems served about 171,000 customers in eight states in the Southeast and Northeast.
Acquired Avalon Cable TV, adding 260,000 subscribers primarily in Michigan and Massachusetts.
Acquired Vista Broadband Communications in Smyrna, Georgia, adding 30,000 more customers.
Acquired Falcon Cable TV of Los Angeles. Falcon was the eighth-largest cable operator in the United States with about one million subscribers in 27 states in primarily non-urban areas.
Acquired Fanch Communications Inc. of Denver. Fanch had 547,000 subscribers in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Wisconsin.

Charter also began swapping customers with other systems to improve the geographic clustering of its systems. In December 1999, it signed a letter of intent with AT&T Corporation to swap 1.3 million cable subscribers in St. Louis as well as in Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri. In 2000, Charter Communications bought select AT&T cable markets, including Reno, Nevada, and the City of St. Louis.[11]
In 2001, MSN and Charter signed an agreement to offer MSN content and services to Charter's broadband customers. In the same year, Charter received awards, including the Outstanding Corporate Growth Award from the Association for Corporate Growth, the R.E. "Ted" Turner Innovator of the Year Award from the Southern Cable Telecommunications Association,[12] and the Fast 50 Award for Growth from the St. Louis Regional Chamber and Growth Association.
In 2008, Charter stock failed to meet NASDAQ standards and was given warning to comply by October 13 or request an extension.[13]
Also in 2008, it acquired the cable-television franchise and service for the Cerritos and Ventura, California, areas from Wave Broadband.
2009: Filing and emergence from bankruptcy protection[edit]
In February 2009, Charter Communications announced that it planned to file for Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on or before April 1, 2009. The action would allow Charter to pay its debt obligations, and cancel its obligations to shareholders.[citation needed] Private equity firm Apollo Management expected to own most of Charter's shares after the bankruptcy.[14] Charter filed for a prearranged bankruptcy on March 28, 2009. The company expected the financial restructuring to reduce its debt by $8 billion, as well as adding $3 billion of new investment, and refinancing other debt.
On November 30, 2009, its bankruptcy plan was approved, which extinguished its stock and cut approximately $8 billion in debt.[15] That day, Charter emerged from bankruptcy despite many of its creditors' objections over its bankruptcy plan.[16]
2010–2012: Second listing on the NASDAQ; Paul Allen steps down[edit]
On September 14, 2010, Charter Class A common stock was re-listed on NASDAQ under the symbol "CHTR".[17]
In 2011, Paul Allen stepped down as chairman and from the board of directors' seat, but at the time remained the largest single shareholder. Also in that year, Charter signed a multi-year deal with TiVo to deliver content via its platform.[18]
Thomas M. Rutledge was appointed as a director and president and chief executive officer effective February 13, 2012.[19]
The same year, Charter prices $1.25 billion senior debt, offering to pay down short- and long-term debt.[20]
2013–2014: Purchase of former Optimum West operations; Liberty Media investment[edit]
On February 8, 2013, Charter announced an agreement to acquire some former Bresnan Communications systems from Cablevision in a transaction worth US$1.63 billion.[21] The deal brought Charter cable systems to 375,000 customers in Colorado's mountains and Western Slope, as well as in Utah, Wyoming and Montana.[22]
Approximately one month later, on March 19, 2013, Charter announced that Liberty Media, a company controlled by former TCI CEO John C. Malone, would be acquiring a 27.3% ownership interest in the company, making it the company's largest single shareholder, largely through the purchase of interests held by investment funds following Charter's 2009 restructuring.[23] In November 2014, Liberty's holdings in Charter as well as a small minority interest in Time Warner Cable were spun off as a separate holding company named Liberty Broadband Corporation,[24] which as of early 2015 was 47.1% controlled by Malone.[25]
2014–2017: Acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House[edit]
On January 13, 2014, Charter Communications said it was interested in buying its larger rival Time Warner Cable. After three previous attempts to buy and merge with the company, all of which failed, Charter's chief executive officer Thomas Rutledge wrote in an open letter to Time Warner Cable's chief executive officer Robert Marcus stating, "I believe we have a significant opportunity to put our companies together in a way that will create maximum, long-term value for shareholders and employees of both companies".[26] The $132.50 per share offer, just above TWC's closing price at $132.40 on January 13, was rejected.[27]
On February 13, 2014, Time Warner Cable accepted an offer of $158.82 per share from Comcast, avoiding a hostile takeover situation from Charter.[28][29]
On April 28, 2014, Comcast and Charter announced that, assuming Comcast's merger with Time Warner was successful, Charter would acquire 1.4 million Comcast/Time Warner Cable customers, bringing Charter's subscriber total to 30 million and making Charter, by its own count, the second-largest cable operator in the country.[30] In addition to the 1.4 million divested subscribers, Comcast also agreed to swap 1.6 million subscribers with Charter in an even, tax-efficient exchange whose intent is to improve the geographic spread of both companies. In a third part of the agreement, Comcast would spin off 2.5 million subscribers into a new publicly traded company in which Charter would hold a 33% stake — with an option to eventually own the whole company — and former Time Warner Cable shareholders would hold a 67% stake.[31]
In late March 2015, Charter announced plans to purchase Bright House Networks from Advance/Newhouse for $10.4 billion in a combination of cash and equities convertible to Charter stock. The deal was contingent on, among other approvals, the completion of Charter's transactions with Comcast, and the expiration of Time Warner Cable's right of first offer to buy Bright House itself (which was not expected to be exercised in light of the merger with Comcast).[32] However, facing potential difficulties in reaching regulatory approval, Comcast called off its merger with Time Warner Cable in April 2015.[33]
On May 26, 2015, Charter and Time Warner Cable announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement for Charter to merge with Time Warner Cable in a deal valued at $78.7 billion.[34] Charter also confirmed that it would continue with its proposed acquisition of Bright House Networks under slightly modified terms. The deal was subject to regulatory approval, although the deal was expected to face less scrutiny from the FCC than the Comcast/TWC deal, as the companies were relatively smaller, and their media holdings are not as extensive as those of Comcast. The TWC and Bright House systems were to be migrated to Charter's Spectrum brand following the conclusion of the merger.[35]
Liberty Broadband will invest a further $5 billion in Charter and will ultimately hold about 20% ownership in the combined entity. Advance/Newhouse will own about 14%, and other current Time Warner Cable shareholders are expected to hold a combined 44% stake.[35] The merger was approved by the Department of Justice and FCC on April 25, 2016; it is subject to conditions, including a requirement that Charter must not implement usage-based billing, nor use its dominant position in the market to impact the online video industry—which includes a prohibition on charging for interconnections.[36][37] Charter was also required to expand its services to 2 million new households, with at least 1 million being in markets where competing providers operate.[38]
The merger was completed on May 18, 2016.[4][7] The purchase made Charter the third-largest pay television company in the United States, behind AT&T and Comcast (the former having completed its merger with DirecTV in mid-2015).[8]
2017–present: Recent developments[edit]
On January 26, 2017, it was reported that Verizon Communications was in talks with Charter to discuss a possible buyout.[39][40] President and CEO of Liberty Media, Greg Maffei said that they were not interested in the deal.[41][42] The deal was rejected around the end of May 2017.[43] Charter claimed that the deal was too low for them to accept, and Charter's largest shareholder Liberty Media stated that they weren't ready to sell.
In March 2017 under new FCC leadership, Charter's regulatory conditions were changed to require that Charter expand its services to 2 million households that are not currently served by any broadband provider, as opposed to requiring one million of these households to be in areas served by a competitor. The decision was made under goals by new chairman Ajit Pai to increase the availability of broadband in rural areas not served by high-speed Internet, but was criticized for maintaining oligarchies rather than encouraging wider competition.[38]
In May 2017, it was reported that Charter and Comcast had entered into an agreement to "explore working together in a number of potential operational areas in the wireless space" in respect to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs); both providers have agreements with Verizon Wireless to re-sell its services, and Comcast announced that it would begin to do so under the brand Xfinity Mobile later in the year. The agreement includes a provision, lasting for one year, that requires the companies to receive consent from each other before performing wireless-related acquisitions or mergers.[44]
On June 21, 2017, it was reported that Charter was in talks to buy Cox Communications.[45]
Operations[edit]
Current operations[edit]
Coverage[edit]
Charter Communications offers service to an estimated 25 million people in 41 states with significant coverage in 48 states.[46][47]
In August 2008, Charter Communications announced an agreement to carry the Big Ten Network, applicable to all customers.[48]
In May 2009, Comcast was able to meet an agreement with the NFL Network, in which the NFL Network agreed to lower its asking price per subscriber. The higher asking price has been a problem with being carried with other cable networks. Roger Goodell was looking at resolving differences with other cable providers, to include Charter Communications, to allow carriage of this channel.[49]
On August 2011, Charter Communications and the NFL Network announced that they had reached a new long-term agreement to carry the NFL Network in time for the 2011 season.[50]




Logo of Charter's Spectrum service


In November 2013, the company announced the re-branding of its residential services to Charter Spectrum[51] which encompass an upgrade to an all-digital network for its video, voice and broadband services. The company relied heavily on a predominantly coaxial cable-based network. The newer fiber-optic service-delivery system provides higher bandwidth speeds than are available with its coaxial cable infrastructure.[52]
In August 2014, Charter Communications agreed to carry the SEC Network, a new channel from ESPN that airs football and other sports from the Southeastern Conference.[53]
Call centers[edit]
On May 2, 2006, the company announced it would restructure seven of its call centers in the United States in the following locations:


St. Louis, Missouri – Residential HSI/Phone Support, July 31, 2006; converted into a Charter Phone service call center
Bay City, Michigan – September 2006; converted into a Charter Dispatch center
Birmingham, Alabama – December 2006; converted into a Charter Dispatch center
Fort Worth, Texas – December 1, 2006; shuttered
Irwindale, California – December 2009; restructured
Newtown, Connecticut – March 2007; restructured
Kingsport, Tennessee – March 2007; converted to Dispatch Center with location change
Amherst, Nova Scotia – December 2010; third-party contract, Teletech, not renewed
Louisville, Kentucky – Residential HSI/Phone Support, Charter Business technical support, Network Operations Center


Orders completed online or through retail partners with Charter Communications are directed to a call center located in Tempe, Arizona, operated by Teletech (Direct Alliance). This call center has inbound/outbound sales agents, as well as online chat agents. Outsourced call centers were implemented in 2006 and are located in Canada, Honduras and the Philippines.

Charter-owned call centers are located in St. Louis, Missouri (telephone service support center); Billings, Montana; Greenville, South Carolina; Vancouver, Washington; Fond du Lac, Wisconsin; Walker, Michigan; Rochester, Minnesota; Worcester, Massachusetts, and Louisville, Kentucky (the largest call center across the company), with Heathrow, Florida, handling the bulk of video, high-speed data, and telephone billing and customer service contacts.
In 2016, Charter announced that it would be adding 20,000 United States-based jobs, with many of these jobs being call center jobs.[54]
Former operations[edit]
On March 27, 2006, Charter announced that it would sell cable systems serving approximately 43,000 customers in Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah to Orange Broadband Holding Company (since renamed Baja Broadband).[55]
Charter also sold cable systems in West Virginia and Virginia to Cebridge Connections (now known as Suddenlink Communications) and cable systems in Kentucky and Illinois to New Wave Communications.[56]
On October 14, 2008, an article appeared in the Fairmont Sentinel,[57] of Fairmont, Minnesota, reporting that Charter was selling parts of their system to Midcontinent Communications, including Charter's offices in Bemidji and International Falls, Minnesota. Starting February 1, 2009, Midcontinent Communications (now known as Midco) took over some Charter's cable system in Minnesota including Balaton, Bemidji, Canby, Ely, Fairmont, International Falls, Littlefork, Sherburn, and surrounding communities. Other areas in Minnesota would have sold to Comcast, but the deal fell through.[58]
On October 22, 2010, Charter announced completion of the sale of cable systems serving approximately 65,000 customers in seven states to Cobridge Communications, LLC (now known as Fidelity Communications). The 36 head ends acquired by Cobridge are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas. As a result of this sale, Charter no longer operates in Arkansas.[59]
Technology[edit]
Charter utilizes various technologies across its service area. Most customers are still served with older legacy set top boxes and video recorders (DVRs). Charter has indicated that it plans to deploy its new WorldBox across its service area. It also plans to standardize services to the new Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks customers by moving all customers to an all-digital network, and making Internet speeds standard across its service areas.
Belo Corporation dispute[edit]
In December 2008, three television stations which were owned by Belo Corporation prior to its acquisition by Gannett in 2014 (WFAA-TV, WCNC-TV, and KMOV-TV) reported that beginning January 1, 2009, Charter Communications would no longer carry these stations due to a breakdown in negotiations. Charter Communications quickly replied that a resolution to the issue was not out of the question.[60][61][62] The cable operator would have lost access to all of the stations owned by Belo. However, an agreement was reached days before the shutdown date.[63]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2011, PCWorld awarded Charter with several "fastest ISP"-type awards. Charter has upgraded its Internet speed tiers and gave most of its customers a free upgrade in speed twice during the 2011 business year.[64]
In 2009, Charter won a CableFax TopOps award for its Day of Service (DOS) team that answers calls from customers on the day that a technician is scheduled to arrive at their home.[65]
In December 2007, Charter was recognized by CableWorld Magazine as "2007 Multi-System Operator of the Year". According to the magazine, the company was selected for this award based on "rapidly expanding its telephone footprint to take advantage of the triple-play offering; developing a consistent, data-driven marketing plan; and addressing its nearest-term debt maturities".[66] During the spring of 2008, Charter was honored with third place among companies with over 2,000 employees in the annual "Best Places to Work in St. Louis" competition, sponsored by the St. Louis Business Journal, based on the response of Charter employees in the area to an online survey created and managed by the Journal.[67]
Its Fortune ranking is 331 (May 26, 2015).[68]
Criticism[edit]
In 2007, PC World ranked Charter's cable Internet service as the worst among 14 major Internet service providers.[69] In addition, Charter High-Speed is rated 19th out of 22 cable ISPs on dslreports.com,[70] and Consumer Reports indicated in its February 2008 issue that Charter's television/Internet/telephone bundle collectively is the worst of all major national carriers.[71][72]
It was reported by Tony Bradle on about.com that Charter Communications redirected error pages and Windows Live Search results to a Charter search page without notifying customers. Users may opt out of redirection by clicking a link from the Charter search page; however, the opt-out link saves a cookie on the customer's computer, so deleting cookies will require the user to opt out again.[73]
It was reported that on January 21, 2008, during a routine sweep of inactive accounts, Charter accidentally deleted the email accounts of approximately 14,000 customers; even worse, the removed data were irretrievable. The company since decided to give a $150 account credit to each affected user.[74][75] In May 2008, Charter announced that it planned to monitor Web sites visited by its high-speed Internet customers via a partnership with targeted advertising firm NebuAd.[76][77] After customers voiced their concerns, Charter changed its mind in June.[78]
Lawsuits[edit]
In 2002, the United States Department of Justice investigated the company, leading to the indictment of four former executives in 2005 for improper financial reporting related primarily to the inflation of cable subscriber numbers to improve financial figures.[79]
In 2004, Charter settled a class-action lawsuit concerning the questionable financial reporting associated with the U.S. Department of Justice's 2002 investigation and subsequent indictment of four former executives. Current and former shareholders (and their attorneys) were awarded $144 million as well as an agreement from Charter to maintain and implement proper corporate governance measures.[80]
In June 2010, Charter settled a class-action lawsuit for $18 million concerning wage and overtime claims for current and former field technicians in California, Missouri, Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, Nevada, Washington, Oregon and Nebraska.[81]
In December 2013, a complaint was filed by Steelhead Licensing LLC for patent infringement of U.S. Patent 8082318; it is described as "Controlling service requests transmitted from a client to a server".[82][83][84]
In January 2016, the National Association of African-American Owned Media and Byron Allen's Entertainment Studios filed a $10 billion civil rights lawsuit against Charter, claiming discrimination for Charter's refusal to pick up Allen's eight-channel suite of networks (which mainly carry ES content already syndicated through local television stations and paid programming); Allen and the NAAAOM (which has an Entertainment Studios executive as its head) have already filed the same type of suit against several other providers.[85][86]
On May 12, 2016, Charter reached a settlement with the FCC regarding allegations by Zoom Telephonics that, in 2012, following the introduction of new rate plans and the introduction of DOCSIS 3.0, it had begun to bar new subscribers or those switching to the new plans from utilizing customer-purchased modems. Although Charter ended this practice in 2014 and began to allow certain certified modems to be used, Zoom argued that the company was still deliberately limiting options by requiring the modems to undergo a testing protocol concerning factors beyond whether they cause interference or unauthorized receipt of service (the only two factors which providers may use to restrict allowable modems under FCC policy). Charter paid a $640,000 fine, and agreed to use a shorter testing process allowing the use of any DOCSIS 3.0-compatible modem, and send compliance reports to the FCC every six months and whenever a modem is blacklisted.[87]
On February 1, 2017, Charter was sued by the Attorney General of New York for failing to provide its advertised Internet speeds to customers in areas that Charter acquired by the purchase of Time Warner Cable.[88][89]

Hover To View Details About Individual Features




Voicemail


Think of this as your personal answering service. Whenever your line is busy or you are away from the phone, callers can simply leave a message. The phone will alert you about new voice messages by using a stutter dial tone.





Call Waiting


Don’t miss incoming calls while you are using the phone. The Call Waiting feature of Charter Spectrum Voice will indicate another incoming call with a soft beep.





Caller ID


Charter Spectrum Voice displays the caller’s name and phone number on your phone unit’s display.





Call Waiting with Caller ID


The Caller ID feature works with Call Waiting. Charter Spectrum Voice lets you check whose call is waiting on the line and lets you decide whether you will take the call or not.





All Call Forwarding


Forward all incoming calls to another number so you don’t end up missing any important calls when you are away from home.





Selective Call Forwarding

Activate call forwarding only for specific groups of contacts. 




Block Anonymous Calls

Automatically reject incoming calls from people who choose to hide Caller ID functions. The anonymous caller will receive a message informing them that your number is programmed to reject Caller ID blocked calls and they should unblock their number and try again. 




Block Unwanted Callers

Block unwelcome calls by rerouting designated numbers. The blocked caller will hear a polite short message stating that you are not receiving calls at the moment.




VIP Ringing

Assign a unique ringtone to a specific number to identify the call without needing Caller ID.




Speed Dial

Program up to eight different numbers into your phone unit and call your favorite contacts with one-touch dialing.




Accept Selected Callers

Only accept incoming calls from a pre-selected set of contacts. All other callers will hear a short message informing them that you are not receiving calls at the moment. 




3-Way Calling

Speak to two callers at the same time with the Charter Spectrum Voice crystal clear 3-Way Calling. You can also place one of the active parties on hold to speak privately and later on resume the 3-way call.
