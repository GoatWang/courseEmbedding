(OTC PINK: INCT), in association with Mancuso Martin Productions, Leading Edge Radio.TV, and Leading Edge Radio Network, plan to produce a new TV news show entitled, "InCapta News. AKA IN". Hollywood actor Nick Mancuso will periodically host select news and entertainment programs that will include InCapta's President, Greg Martin, whose news experience dates back to the early 1990's. The news programming, slated for 2017, will feature political, law enforcement, crime, sports, and breaking news and will utilize its citizen journalists (covered in a prior release) and other experienced news journalists worldwide.Mr. Mancuso has won numerous film festivals and various awards for acting, including a Genie Award for his role in "Ticket to Heaven". He brings many other actors from Hollywood to Mancuso Martin Productions and InCapta, Inc. Mancuso Martin Productions plans on also actively doing a number of motion pictures and TV Shows in 2017 and beyond while covering the news with emphasis on breaking new, politics, sports, and entertainment.Greg Martin, President of InCapta, Inc, said, "Breaking News, Politics, Entertainment, and Law Enforcement News are all very much in high demand, and we intend to satisfy the insatiable need-to-know appetites which those who wish to stay informed care most about in the news business."About Nick MancusoDuring his four decade career, Mr. Mancuso's films have included the Apocalypse trilogy, produced by Cloud Ten Pictures (Revelation (1999), Tribulation (2000) and Judgment (2001)), and TV has him best known for his starring roles in the NBC action series Stingray (1985), which ran for two seasons, and as the title hitman who becomes a target himself in the one-season Matrix (1993). Mr. Mancuso was drawn to various Canadian theatre groups in the 1970s and became artistic director for the Vancouver Playhouse Theatre while building his classical resume at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. TV and film soon came his way in the late 1970s, and he landed roles both in Hollywood, first as TV's Dr. Scorpion (1978), and back in Canada, where he won the prestigious Genie award for the movie Ticket to Heaven (1981) as a man caught up in a religious cult. He impressed moviegoers as well with his moody, sexy presence in the US film Heartbreakers (1984), co-starring Peter Coyote, and has also provided solid support for other stars, notably for Steven Seagal in one of that star's best action thrillers, Under Siege (1992).A sturdy name as an anti-hero or heavy in modestly-budgeted independents, Mr. Mancuso has proven over the years to be a solid, durable player. More recent, post-millennium gritty films include Time of Fear (2002), Today You Die (2005), starring his "Under Siege" cohort Steven Seagal, Contract Killers (2008), Violent Blue (2011), Entity (2013), and The Big Fat Stone (2014).http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0541576/?ref_=nv_sr_1About InCapta, Inc.
