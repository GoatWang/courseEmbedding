History[edit]
David Morgenthaler founded the firm in 1968 after a career as an operating executive. From 1957 until 1968, Morgenthaler was CEO of Foseco, Inc., a manufacturer of specialty chemicals owned by early venture capital firm J.H. Whitney & Co. After selling his venture-backed business to an international company, Morgenthaler decided to pursue venture capital investing on his own.

Morgenthaler shifted from a family partnership and began raising institutional funds in the early 1980s. Since its inception, Morgenthaler has worked with entrepreneurs in approximately 300 companies.
David Morgenthaler[edit]
In addition to his role in building a nationally focused venture capital firm, Morgenthaler also took a leadership role in establishing the legitimacy and potential of the nascent venture capital industry.
He served from 1977 to 1979 as the President and then Chairman of the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA).
During Morgenthaler's tenure at NVCA, he was called to testify before Congress in support of the capital gains tax reduction enacted in 1978. He was also involved in changing the ERISA legislation in 1979, allowing for pension funds to invest in private equity for the first time. (See also: Early history of private equity: Regulatory and tax changes)
Morgenthaler was awarded the first National Venture Capital Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998 for his role in the emergence of the venture capital industry. Morgenthaler was inducted into the Private Equity Analyst's Venture Capital Hall of Fame.
Earlier in his career, Morgenthaler was a member of the management team of several young growth companies. He received both a BS and a MS degree in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1941.
Morgenthaler died in June 2016, at the age of 96. He worked up until the very end, with his son noting that he was testing an app from his hospital bed. “At age 96, almost 97, who does that?” his son said.[2]
Investment funds[edit]
Since the 1980s, when Morgenthaler began raising private equity funds from institutional investors in the early 1980s, the firm has raised over $2.8 billion of investor commitments.

1985 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners II - $ 30m
1989 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners III - $ 65m
1995 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners IV - $ 135m
1998 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners V - $ 300m
2000 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners VI - $ 575m
2001 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners VII - $ 850m
2005 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners VIII - $ 450m
2008 - Morgenthaler Ventures IX - $ 400m+

Historically, Morgenthaler funds have made both venture capital and leveraged buyout investments out of the same fund. In November 2008, Morgenthaler Ventures exceeded its fundraising goal and closed its ninth fund (Morgenthaler Venture Partners IX) at slightly more than $400 million. MVP IX is the first Morgenthaler fund to focus solely on venture capital investments. By comparison, Morgenthaler Ventures was allocated approximately $315 million to invest in the previous fund.[3]
In August 2013, General Partners Gary Little, Rebecca Lynn, and Gary Morgenthaler formed a new and separate firm called Canvas Venture Fund with an inaugural $175M early-stage IT-only fund. These three general partners continue to serve on the boards of their Morgenthaler portfolio companies, including Lending Club (the fourth largest Internet IPO since 2001 behind Facebook, Twitter and Google), MuleSoft, Evernote, Doximity, etc. They were later joined by Paul Hsiao, a 10-year partner at NEA, in May 2014. Canvas was named the No.1 "VC Firm to Watch" by Forbes on their 2015 Midas List.[4]
Investments[edit]
Over the course of more than 40 years, Morgenthaler has made investments in over 300 companies across its venture capital and buyouts businesses.
Notable past and present portfolio companies include: Siri, Evernote, Lending Club, NexTag, Practice Fusion, Ardian, Excelyx, Phillips and Temro, Avtron, OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Cortina Systems, BlueArc, JasperSoft, Nominum, Peregrine Semiconductor, and Voltage Security.

History[edit]
David Morgenthaler founded the firm in 1968 after a career as an operating executive. From 1957 until 1968, Morgenthaler was CEO of Foseco, Inc., a manufacturer of specialty chemicals owned by early venture capital firm J.H. Whitney & Co. After selling his venture-backed business to an international company, Morgenthaler decided to pursue venture capital investing on his own.

Morgenthaler shifted from a family partnership and began raising institutional funds in the early 1980s. Since its inception, Morgenthaler has worked with entrepreneurs in approximately 300 companies.
David Morgenthaler[edit]
In addition to his role in building a nationally focused venture capital firm, Morgenthaler also took a leadership role in establishing the legitimacy and potential of the nascent venture capital industry.
He served from 1977 to 1979 as the President and then Chairman of the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA).
During Morgenthaler's tenure at NVCA, he was called to testify before Congress in support of the capital gains tax reduction enacted in 1978. He was also involved in changing the ERISA legislation in 1979, allowing for pension funds to invest in private equity for the first time. (See also: Early history of private equity: Regulatory and tax changes)
Morgenthaler was awarded the first National Venture Capital Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998 for his role in the emergence of the venture capital industry. Morgenthaler was inducted into the Private Equity Analyst's Venture Capital Hall of Fame.
Earlier in his career, Morgenthaler was a member of the management team of several young growth companies. He received both a BS and a MS degree in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1941.
Morgenthaler died in June 2016, at the age of 96. He worked up until the very end, with his son noting that he was testing an app from his hospital bed. “At age 96, almost 97, who does that?” his son said.[2]
Investment funds[edit]
Since the 1980s, when Morgenthaler began raising private equity funds from institutional investors in the early 1980s, the firm has raised over $2.8 billion of investor commitments.

1985 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners II - $ 30m
1989 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners III - $ 65m
1995 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners IV - $ 135m
1998 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners V - $ 300m
2000 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners VI - $ 575m
2001 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners VII - $ 850m
2005 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners VIII - $ 450m
2008 - Morgenthaler Ventures IX - $ 400m+

Historically, Morgenthaler funds have made both venture capital and leveraged buyout investments out of the same fund. In November 2008, Morgenthaler Ventures exceeded its fundraising goal and closed its ninth fund (Morgenthaler Venture Partners IX) at slightly more than $400 million. MVP IX is the first Morgenthaler fund to focus solely on venture capital investments. By comparison, Morgenthaler Ventures was allocated approximately $315 million to invest in the previous fund.[3]
In August 2013, General Partners Gary Little, Rebecca Lynn, and Gary Morgenthaler formed a new and separate firm called Canvas Venture Fund with an inaugural $175M early-stage IT-only fund. These three general partners continue to serve on the boards of their Morgenthaler portfolio companies, including Lending Club (the fourth largest Internet IPO since 2001 behind Facebook, Twitter and Google), MuleSoft, Evernote, Doximity, etc. They were later joined by Paul Hsiao, a 10-year partner at NEA, in May 2014. Canvas was named the No.1 "VC Firm to Watch" by Forbes on their 2015 Midas List.[4]
Investments[edit]
Over the course of more than 40 years, Morgenthaler has made investments in over 300 companies across its venture capital and buyouts businesses.
Notable past and present portfolio companies include: Siri, Evernote, Lending Club, NexTag, Practice Fusion, Ardian, Excelyx, Phillips and Temro, Avtron, OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Cortina Systems, BlueArc, JasperSoft, Nominum, Peregrine Semiconductor, and Voltage Security.

and all accrued interest thereon, (iii) on February 12, 2010, MVP IX acquired from the Issuer 2,993,414 shares of the Issuer’s

In connection with the closing of the

Stock held by MVP IX automatically converted on a one-for-seven basis into 1,392,130 shares of Common Stock.
 
On February 12, 2015, MVP IX exercised
the Warrant to purchase 80,000 shares of the Issuer’s Common Stock for an exercise price of $0.01 per share, or $800.00 in
the aggregate.
 
The Issuer effected a one-for-seven reverse
stock split of its Common Stock on October 14, 2016, pursuant to which MVP IX’s 80,000 shares of the Issuer’s Common

Common Stock; general market and economic conditions; ongoing evaluation of the Issuer's business, financial condition, operations
and prospects; the relative attractiveness of alternative business and investment opportunities; and other future developments.

to dispose of shares, see Row 9 of the cover page of each Reporting Person. Regarding shared power to dispose of shares, see Row

21,449,495 shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Offering (assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option
to purchase additional shares of Common Stock), as reported in the Issuer’s Prospectus.

3. Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock converted into Common Stock on a 1-for-7 basis automatically and without additional consideration upon the closing of the Issuer's initial public offering, and had no expiration date.

History[edit]
David Morgenthaler founded the firm in 1968 after a career as an operating executive. From 1957 until 1968, Morgenthaler was CEO of Foseco, Inc., a manufacturer of specialty chemicals owned by early venture capital firm J.H. Whitney & Co. After selling his venture-backed business to an international company, Morgenthaler decided to pursue venture capital investing on his own.

Morgenthaler shifted from a family partnership and began raising institutional funds in the early 1980s. Since its inception, Morgenthaler has worked with entrepreneurs in approximately 300 companies.
David Morgenthaler[edit]
In addition to his role in building a nationally focused venture capital firm, Morgenthaler also took a leadership role in establishing the legitimacy and potential of the nascent venture capital industry.
He served from 1977 to 1979 as the President and then Chairman of the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA).
During Morgenthaler's tenure at NVCA, he was called to testify before Congress in support of the capital gains tax reduction enacted in 1978. He was also involved in changing the ERISA legislation in 1979, allowing for pension funds to invest in private equity for the first time. (See also: Early history of private equity: Regulatory and tax changes)
Morgenthaler was awarded the first National Venture Capital Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998 for his role in the emergence of the venture capital industry. Morgenthaler was inducted into the Private Equity Analyst's Venture Capital Hall of Fame.
Earlier in his career, Morgenthaler was a member of the management team of several young growth companies. He received both a BS and a MS degree in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1941.
Morgenthaler died in June 2016, at the age of 96. He worked up until the very end, with his son noting that he was testing an app from his hospital bed. “At age 96, almost 97, who does that?” his son said.[2]
Investment funds[edit]
Since the 1980s, when Morgenthaler began raising private equity funds from institutional investors in the early 1980s, the firm has raised over $2.8 billion of investor commitments.

1985 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners II - $ 30m
1989 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners III - $ 65m
1995 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners IV - $ 135m
1998 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners V - $ 300m
2000 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners VI - $ 575m
2001 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners VII - $ 850m
2005 - Morgenthaler Venture Partners VIII - $ 450m
2008 - Morgenthaler Ventures IX - $ 400m+

Historically, Morgenthaler funds have made both venture capital and leveraged buyout investments out of the same fund. In November 2008, Morgenthaler Ventures exceeded its fundraising goal and closed its ninth fund (Morgenthaler Venture Partners IX) at slightly more than $400 million. MVP IX is the first Morgenthaler fund to focus solely on venture capital investments. By comparison, Morgenthaler Ventures was allocated approximately $315 million to invest in the previous fund.[3]
In August 2013, General Partners Gary Little, Rebecca Lynn, and Gary Morgenthaler formed a new and separate firm called Canvas Venture Fund with an inaugural $175M early-stage IT-only fund. These three general partners continue to serve on the boards of their Morgenthaler portfolio companies, including Lending Club (the fourth largest Internet IPO since 2001 behind Facebook, Twitter and Google), MuleSoft, Evernote, Doximity, etc. They were later joined by Paul Hsiao, a 10-year partner at NEA, in May 2014. Canvas was named the No.1 "VC Firm to Watch" by Forbes on their 2015 Midas List.[4]
Investments[edit]
Over the course of more than 40 years, Morgenthaler has made investments in over 300 companies across its venture capital and buyouts businesses.
Notable past and present portfolio companies include: Siri, Evernote, Lending Club, NexTag, Practice Fusion, Ardian, Excelyx, Phillips and Temro, Avtron, OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Cortina Systems, BlueArc, JasperSoft, Nominum, Peregrine Semiconductor, and Voltage Security.

History[edit]
David Morgenthaler founded the firm in 1968 after a career as an operating executive. From 1957 until 1968, Morgenthaler was CEO of Foseco, Inc., a manufacturer of specialty chemicals owned by early venture capital firm J.H. Whitney & Co. After selling his venture-backed business to an international company, Morgenthaler decided to pursue venture capital investing on his own.

Morgenthaler shifted from a family partnership and began raising institutional funds in the early 1980s. Since its inception, Morgenthaler has worked with entrepreneurs in approximately 300 companies.
David Morgenthaler[edit]
In addition to his role in building a nationally focused venture capital firm, Morgenthaler also took a leadership role in establishing the legitimacy and potential of the nascent venture capital industry.
He served from 1977 to 1979 as the President and then Chairman of the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA).
During Morgenthaler's tenure at NVCA, he was called to testify before Congress in support of the capital gains tax reduction enacted in 1978. He was also involved in changing the ERISA legislation in 1979, allowing for pension funds to invest in private equity for the first time. (See also: Early history of private equity: Regulatory and tax changes)
Morgenthaler was awarded the first National Venture Capital Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998 for his role in the emergence of the venture capital industry. Morgenthaler was inducted into the Private Equity Analyst's Venture Capital Hall of Fame.
Earlier in his career, Morgenthaler was a member of the management team of several young growth companies. He received both a BS and a MS degree in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1941.
Morgenthaler died in June 2016, at the age of 96. He worked up until the very end, with his son noting that he was testing an app from his hospital bed. “At age 96, almost 97, who does that?” his son said.[2]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
