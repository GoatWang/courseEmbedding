(“Company,” “CDI,”), a Utah C corporation headquartered in Sandy, Utah, is a molecular diagnostics company that develops, manufactures and markets a new, state-of-the-art diagnostics technology. Using unique mathematical models instead of relying on costly laboratory infrastructure, the Company has created a revolutionary new DNA-based testing platform, resulting in tests that are:Faster: CDI’s system has created a new generation of real-time PCR DNA testing.  Development time is dramatically reduced, to weeks instead of months, or even years.Affordable: Much lower-priced tests – a fraction of competitors’ pricing – due to far less test development time, lower cost of goods and no 3rd party royalties paid.Flexible: The system is compatible with many vendors’ DNA diagnostic testing machines. It is particularly well-suited to a new generation of smaller, more portable analysis machinery for field, clinic, and hospital environments.Accurate: Tests are more specific and sensitive than competitors’, detect even a single virus regardless of sample size and are designed to detect multiple strains of bacterial and viral infections from all over the world.A Powerhouse Combination:  Working in tandem, both affordable tests and affordable mobile diagnostic devices will revolutionize DNA diagnostics, for the first time making accurate detection of genetic disorders and infectious diseases far less expensive and much more broadly available. This is made possible by combining proprietary software, patented reagent technologies and an array of affordable, accurate PCR tests.The Co-Diagnostics Difference – It’s in the Math:  Dr. Brent Satterfield invented the Company’s suite of intellectual properties. CDI scientists were the first to understand the complex mathematics of DNA test design, to “engineer” a DNA test and to automate algorithms that rapidly screen millions of possible options to pinpoint the optimum design. This bio-engineering approach to DNA test development is unique to Co-Diagnostics and is based on “cooperative theory,” a new generation of mathematical analytics created by Dr. Satterfield.

Co-Dx™ molecular reagents can detect the presence of even a single virus.The technology was created by Dr. Brent Satterfield, who has engineered new diagnostics for Sandia National Laboratories, US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Department of Homeland Security, National Bio-defense Analysis and Countermeasures Center, the California Dept. of Public Health and numerous others. Dr. Satterfield and his team are the first to employ highly advanced math to engineer a new generation of advanced molecular diagnostics tools and an expanding array of tests. Co-Diagnostics’ vision is to make diagnostic testing for infectious disease and common genetic disorders so cost effective and easy to use that it can be done at any doctor’s office or point of care facility, anywhere in the world, including those in developing countries.In short, Co-Diagnostics is an industry innovator, now at the forefront of molecular diagnostics technology.Co-Diagnostics – Innovating New Molecular DiagnosticsAdvanced MathematicsCo-Dx™ uses highly advanced mathematics and Co-Dx Design™ software for Windows® to predict how DNA and RNA will react under certain conditions. Its advanced algorithms take the guesswork out of test design, allowing designers to create highly sensitive/specific primers and probes that run virtually error free on many diagnostic platforms, including a new generation of highly mobile, low-cost test equipment.Faster to develop and administerThe Co-Dx™ development test platform shortens the development cycle for the creation of new tests utilizing Co-Dx Design™ software to weeks instead of months or years, rapidly screening millions of possible designs to find the optimal design for a specific disorder or disease.  In lieu of costly trial-and-error lab testing, Co-Dx™ designers let computers do the work, significantly shortening test development cycles.  Co-Dx™ specialized primer designs can recognize their targets much faster, potentially leading to abbreviated cycling times on existing PCR detection equipment.  And Co-Dx’s™ efficiencies are particularly impressive during PCR multiplexing (multiple tests run simultaneously).Highly AccurateCo-Dx™ reagents cause reactions that produce a stronger signal for PCR devices to read, detecting the presence of even a single virus. And Co-Dx™ products virtually eliminate primer dimers (common errors that occur during DNA amplification) that cause false positives and negatives.Disruptively InexpensiveCo-Dx™ represents a dramatic new approach to molecular diagnostics, producing tests that are far less expensive to develop and administer. Co-Dx™ tests can be performed on a new generation of highly mobile, low-cost PCR test equipment, one of which the company is co-developing for introduction in 2016. Working in tandem, Co-Dx’s™ state-of-the-art tests + mobile devices will make DNA-based diagnostics both affordable and more broadly available, breaking down historical cost barriers to worldwide markets for much-needed, accurate tests.Co-Dx™ ApplicationsDISEASE DETECTIONCo-Dx™ technologies were originally developed to identify infectious diseases.  Current tests include: tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis B and C, dengue, chagas and HIV.  Soon to be ready for distribution will be international-market tests for human papillomavirus (HPV) and gonorrhea/chlamydia.PERSONALIZED MEDICINEA powerhouse combination of affordable, accurate Co-Dx™ tests + a new generation of mobile, handheld devices will greatly facilitate personalized medicine for preventive care. The Co-Dx™ platform will enable healthcare companies and physicians to employ inexpensive molecular analysis to provide a healthcare roadmap for a patients based on their genetic content.COMPANION DIAGNOSTICSWith the escalating costs of drug trials, pharmaceutical companies recognize the need to create companion diagnostics tests – a  diagnostic test partnered with a therapeutic to determine a patient’s compatibility with a treatment protocol.  Co-Dx™ is an ideal partnering platform for the development of companion diagnostics strategies.GENETIC MARKERSThe power of the Co-Dx™ development platform lies in its ability to accurately and affordably identify genetic markers in DNA and RNA, detecting cancer markers, bacteria or viruses or to find common genetic disorders. Co-Dx™ is well-suited for labs developing specialized genetic tests.PROACTIVE SCREENINGCo-Dx™ technology also has many applications in screening blood and other DNA samples for potential pathogens. With low-cost, Co-Dx™-enabled equipment and reagents, water treatment plants can quickly and effectively test water supplies; and blood banks can test their blood supply and donors to make sure their inventory is uncontaminated.FAMILY & SOCIAL GENETICSCo-Dx™ technology can even be used in specialized genealogical and family history applications to determine hereditary characteristics or lineage.   The applications for Co-Dx™ technologies are virtually limitless.

Co-Diagnostics Inc.



07/25/2017 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 07/25/2017 19:25
Co-Diagnostics, Inc. Announces Joint Venture in India







      SALT LAKE CITY-(BUSINESS WIRE)-Co-Diagnostics, Inc. (NASDAQ: CODX) ('Co-Diagnostics' or the 'Company'), a molecular diagnostics company that has a unique, proprietary platform for the development of diagnostic tests, officially announced today the recent incorporation of CoSara Diagnostics, Pvt., Ltd., a Joint Venture for manufacturing with Synbiotics Limited. Synbiotics is a group company of Asence Inc, a U.S. incorporated company specializing in supplying pharmaceutical products to international markets.
    


        Co-Diagnostics and Synbiotics incorporated the CoSara entity in India in July. Co-Diagnostics paid for its commitment to CoSara from its recent initial public offering. CoSara intends to secure all applicable regulatory approvals necessary for allowing the sale and distribution of CoSara-branded diagnostics throughout India, with a manufacturing facility expected to be under construction in Q3 2017. Once completed, CoSara will have the exclusive Indian manufacturing rights for Co-Diagnostics products.
      

        Dwight Egan, Co-Diagnostics CEO, commented, 'India has been a focal point of our growth plan for several years, and partnering with an outstanding organization such as Synbiotics for in-country manufacturing moves us significantly closer to realizing those goals. Because India has an estimated 400 million cases of tuberculosis from which there are 1,000 deaths each day, it is the ideal market for launching a high-quality, affordable test that can not only have a positive impact on the affected population, but also help to build a strong customer base for our other diagnostic products already in the pipeline.'
      

About Co-Diagnostics, Inc.:


        Co-Diagnostics, Inc., a Utah corporation, is a molecular diagnostics company that has developed and intends to manufacture and sell reagents used for diagnostic tests that function via the detection and/or analysis of nucleic acid molecules (DNA or RNA), and to sell diagnostic equipment from other manufacturers as self-contained lab systems.

We estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of 1,178,532 shares
of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $6,064,073 at an
initial public offering price of $6.00 per share, after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we
estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$7,018,685.

We expect the net proceeds from this offering will allow us to fund our
operations for up to 36 months, assuming no revenues from sales of our tests,
following the closing of the offering, including the completion of our planned
expansion of the number of tests we will offer to the public. We intend to use
the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

1. $2,000,000 for development of tests, expansion of laboratory facilities and
   clinical and in-field validation for regulatory filings of diagnostic tests;

2. $1,500,000 to increase our sales and marketing capabilities;

3. $1,200,000 to expand the availability of PCR machines in developing nations
   under a reagent rental program; and                               
        
4. $500,000 to fund our share of the manufacturing facility to produce our
   reagents in India and other locations in the developing world; and

5. approximately $750,000 of the remaining proceeds, will be used for general
   corporate purposes, including working capital.                          

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the status of and results from clinical trials of and acceptance of
our full menu of diagnostic tests. As a result, our management will retain broad
discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We may
find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering for
other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of net
proceeds from this offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities.


The molecular diagnostics industry is extremely competitive. There are many
firms that provide some or all of the products we provide and provide many
diagnostic tests that we have yet to develop. Many of these competitors are
larger than us and have significantly greater financial resources. Because we
are not established, many of our competitors have a competitive advantage in the
diagnostic testing industry because they also have other lines of business in
the pharmaceutical industry from which they derive revenues and for which they
are well known and respected in the medical profession. We will need to overcome
the disadvantage of being a start up with no history of success and no respect
of the medical and testing professionals. In the diagnostic testing industry, we
compete with such companies as BioMerieux, Siemans, Qiagen, and Cephied and with
such pharmaceutical companies as Abbott Laboratories, Becton, Dickinson and
Johnson and Johnson.

Many of these competitors already have an established customer base with
industry standard technology, which we must overcome to be successful.


Company Description
Co-Diagnostics, Inc. (“CDI,”), a Utah corporation, is a molecular diagnostics
company that has developed and intends to manufacture and sell reagents used for
diagnostic tests that function via the detection and/or analysis of nucleic
acid molecules (DNA or RNA), and to sell diagnostic equipment


 from other
manufacturers as self-contained lab systems (which we refer to as the “MDx
device”).

Dr. Brent Satterfield, our Chief Technology Officer, created the Company’s suite
of intellectual properties. Our scientists were among the first to understand
the complex mathematics of DNA test design, to “engineer” a DNA test and to
automate algorithms that rapidly screen millions of possible options to pinpoint
the optimum design. Dr. Satterfield developed the Company’s intellectual
property consisting of the predictive mathematical algorithms and proprietary
reagents used in the testing process, which together represent a major advance
in Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR”) testing systems. CDI technologies are now
protected by five granted or pending US patents, as well as certain trade
secrets. Our platform allows us to avoid paying existing patent royalties
required by other PCR test systems, which has the potential of allowing CDI to
sell diagnostic labs and tests at a lower cost than competitors, while
generating a profit margin.

We will either sell or lease our portable labs to existing diagnostic centers,
through sale or lease agreements, and sell the reagents that comprise our
proprietary tests.

CDI’s low-cost system uses CDI’s tests to diagnose tuberculosis, Zika, hepatitis
B and C, Malaria, dengue and HIV, all of which tests have been designed and
verified in CDI’s laboratory.

We designed our tests by identifying the optimal locations on the target gene
for nucleic acid amplification and paired the location with the optimized primer
and probe structure to achieve outputs that meet the design input requirements
identified from market research. This is done by following planned and
documented processes, procedures and testing. In other words, the data resulting
from our tests verify that we succeeded in designing what we intended to at the
outset. Verification is a series of testing that concludes that the product is
ready to proceed to validation in a clinical performance evaluation setting
using initial production tests to confirm that the product as designed meets the
user needs.

CDI’s diagnostics systems enable very rapid, low-cost, sophisticated molecular
testing for organisms and genetic diseases by greatly automating historically
complex procedures in both the development and administration of tests. CDI’s
newest technical advance involves a novel approach to PCR test design
("Co-Primers") that eliminates one of the key vexing issues of PCR
amplification, the exponential growth of primer-dimer pairs (false positives and
false negatives) which adversely interferes with identification of the target
DNA/RNA.

Using its proprietary test design system and proprietary reagents, CDI will
design and sell PCR diagnostic tests for diseases and pathogens starting with
tests for tuberculosis, drug resistant tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, Malaria,
dengue, HIV and Zika virus, all of which tests have been designed and verified
in CDI’s laboratory.

Product Offering

We plan to manufacture molecular diagnostic kits for the following tests in the
following regions, to be sold along with the MDx device:

                                                            barriers

Caribbean and Central and South America

Our initial sales will be to entities within the Caribbean Public Health Agency
Members States (Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize,
Bermuda, BES Islands, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Curacao, Dominica,
Grenada, Haiti, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia,
St Maarten, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago,
Turks and Caicos Islands).

In some of these countries, there are no regulatory hurdles and we can start
offering our tests immediately. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
granted permission for us to export many of our products. The FDA's permission
to export was granted under Section 801 (e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act, as amended (the “FDC Act”). Section 801(e) of the FDA Act covers
certain medical devices that have not yet received an approved Premarket
Approval in the United States by the FDA, such as our products. We have not
commenced any Premarket Approval steps with the FDA. Section 801(e) applies to
medical devices that are acceptable to the importing country and that are
manufactured under the FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices.

We will first offer our Zika test in this region because of the demand for such
test, followed quickly by tests for tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, and dengue,
then our full range of tests. Products will be manufactured for sale upon
receipt of purchase orders from labs and hospitals.

India

The Company has entered into an agreement to manufacture diagnostics tests for
seven infectious diseases with a pharmaceutical manufacturing company in India.
The agreement provides for the manufacture of the tests named above and the
joint sales and marketing of those tests in India.

Since the tests will be conducted in India on Indian citizens, no FDA approval
or inspection will be required. Certain Indian regulatory approval from the
Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) must be acquired. We are
engaging the services of an experienced consultant in India to help get us
through this process. Research Use Only (RUO) reagents are able to be sold
without requiring regulatory approval as long as they are labeled and designated
as such. We are beginning to sell these products in India in 2017.

India is the country with the highest burden of tuberculosis. World Health
Organization (WHO) tuberculosis statistics for India for 2015 give an estimated
incidence figure of 2.2 million cases of tuberculosis for India out of a global
incidence of 9.6 million. The tuberculosis incidence for India is the number of
new cases of active tuberculosis disease in India during a certain time period
(usually a year).

Europe

Molecular diagnostics, such as our tests, are governed in Europe by the
framework for in vitro diagnostics (IVDs), which encompasses diagnostic products
such as reagents, instruments and systems intended for use in diagnosis of
disease. The regulatory system for IVDs is built largely on a self-certification
procedure, placing heavy responsibility on manufacturers. Non self-certified
products are subject to the same standards as self-certified products but are
subject to audit and review by a notified body prior to receiving approval to be
CE-marked. A CE-marking is a manufacturer’s declaration that a product meets the
requirements of the applicable European Commission directive. Examples of
current obligations include having in place a qualitative manufacturing process,
user instructions that are clear and fit for purpose, ensuring that the
‘physical’ features of devices and diagnostics do not pose any danger. If a
product fulfils these and other related control requirements, it may be
CE-marked as an indication that the product is compliant with EU legislation and
sold in the European Union.

We have received ISO 13485 and ISO 9001 certifications relating to the design
and manufacture of our medical device products. The ISO certification indicates
that we meet the standards required to self-certify certain of our products and
affix a CE-marking for sales of our products in countries accepting the CE
marking (not in the United States) with only minimal further governmental
approvals in each country. We expect to have our Zika and tuberculosis tests
CE-marked in 2017. We estimate the remaining costs for CE-marks to be
approximately $100,000.

United States

We do not anticipate offering our tests in the United States in the near future.
We believe, however, our tests may be able to qualify as Laboratory Developed
Tests (LDT's), diagnostic tests that are developed and manufactured by CLIA
certified laboratories. These tests are developed by the lab for use only in
that laboratory. CLIA laboratories develop the performance characteristics,
perform the analytical validation for their LDT's and obtain licenses to offer
them as diagnostic services. The FDA has publicly announced its intention to
regulate certain LDTs in a phased-in approach, but draft guidance that was
published a couple of years ago was withdrawn at the end of the Obama
administration and replaced by an informal non-enforceable discussion paper
reflecting some of the feedback that it received on LDT regulation.
