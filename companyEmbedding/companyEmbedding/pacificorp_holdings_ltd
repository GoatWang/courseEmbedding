Rocky Mountain Power Gets High National Ranking for Renewable Energy Program
Once again, thanks to Rocky Mountain Power customers, the company has received high national rankings for its voluntary Blue Sky renewable energy program.

Selah Named Pacific Power Business Partner of the Year for Energy Efficiency Leadership
SELAH, Wash. — Pacific Power has selected the City of Selah as a 2017 wattsmart Business Partner of the Year award recipient for its continued dedication to energy efficiency.

BYU-Idaho Honored for Saving Energy and Money
REXBURG, Idaho — In the last year, Brigham Young University-Idaho’s efforts to be more energy efficient yielded a savings of over 1.24 million kilowatt-hours – equivalent to the energy used by 140 homes in a year. Today Rocky Mountain Power recognized that achievement with the 2017 wattsmart Business Idaho Partner of the Year Award.

Renewing Community With Green Projects
PORTLAND, Ore. — For more than a decade, Pacific Power's Blue SkySM customers have made a big difference on the green power map by personally choosing to support renewable energy. This includes partnering with community-focused organizations to put more than 100 new renewable energy projects to work in Oregon, Washington and California – adding more than eight megawatts of renewable power capacity to the grid.

Company Overview



Company Overview
 PacifiCorp
PacifiCorp is one of the West's leading utilities, serving approximately 1.8 million customers in six states. The company was formed in 1984, when our electric utility, natural resource development and telecommunications businesses grew into full-fledged enterprises. In 1989, we merged with Utah Power & Light and continued doing business as Pacific Power and Utah Power. PacifiCorp is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy.
Today, PacifiCorp consists of two business units: Pacific Power, which delivers electricity to customers in Oregon, Washington and California, is headquartered in Portland, Oregon; and Rocky Mountain Power, which delivers electricity to customers in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho, is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.
 Fact Sheet
 Service Area Map
PacifiCorp quick facts »
Pacific Power 
Just 30 years after Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, Pacific Power & Light Company (PP&L) was born in the Pacific Northwest. Formed in 1910, PP&L started from several small electric companies and served just 7,000 customers in Astoria and Pendleton in Oregon, and Yakima and Walla Walla in Washington. Once established, PP&L acquired other companies and service areas, building new generation and an extensive transmission and distribution system to serve electric customers in Oregon and Washington, and later in Idaho, Wyoming, Montana and Northern California.
Visit Pacific Power »
Rocky Mountain Power  
Before the company's name was changed in 2006, Rocky Mountain Power served customers in Utah and Idaho as Utah Power. Wyoming customers were served by Pacific Power, though some had been served earlier under the Utah Power name.
Utah Power dates back to 1881, when Salt Lake City became the fifth city in the world to have central station electricity. Known then as Utah Power & Light (UP&L), the company itself was formed in 1912 from several small electric companies in Utah, Idaho and western Colorado. In organizing dozens of small power companies, serving 130 small cities and towns, the new company supplied about 39,700 customers in 1912. In just 10 years, UP&L grew to serve 205 communities and 83,000 customers.

	Recognizing that large numbers of visitors each year can have a negative impact on the environment, we have incorporated many features into our recreation sites, including:
	 


		Leaving day use parking areas as grass to help maintain winter forage for elk

		Reducing the size of parking lots to save the natural plant buffer, which is habitat for many different animals and birds

		Opening the parks seasonally to ensure that elk and other wildlife have a safe winter home

		Taking care to preserve the trees and natural vegetation whenever possible to preserve micro-habitats

		Installing log booms to protect shorelines from wave and boat impact

		Modifying company property land leases adjacent to waterways to include environmental protection clauses. For example, no farming to the edge of the reservoir is permitted.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered
through this prospectus by the selling shareholders.


The mineral exploration business is an extremely competitive industry. We are
competing with many other exploration companies looking for minerals. We are one
of the smallest exploration companies and a very small participant in the
mineral exploration business. Being a junior mineral exploration company, we
compete with other companies like ours for financing and joint venture partners.
Additionally, we compete for resources such as professional geologists, camp
staff, helicopters and mineral exploration supplies.


Company Description
We were incorporated on October 6, 2014 and are a startup exploration company
without mining operations and we are in the business of mineral exploration. We
have no revenues, have achieved losses since inception, have been issued a going
concern opinion by our auditors and rely upon the sale of


 our securities to fund
operations. We have not implemented our business plan to date. In order complete
Phase 1, with an estimated cost of $7,800 and Phase II, with an estimated cost
of $22,374 of our anticipated exploration program.We will need to raise
additional funds, with Phase 1 expected to commence between May 1, 2015 and July
31, 2015. To date we have not commenced our exploration program. We are having
to raise additional funds of approximately $110,000 commencing immediately, to
allow us sufficient time to raise the additional capital and to meet our
operations, exploration requirements. There is no assurance that a commercially
viable copper, lead, zinc, and tungsten mineral deposit exists on our mining
claims. Further exploration will be required before a final evaluation as to the
economic and legal feasibility of our mining claims can be determined. Even if
we complete our current exploration program and it is successful in identifying
a copper, lead, zinc, and tungsten deposit, we will have to spend substantial
funds on further drilling and engineering studies before we will know if we have
a commercially viable mineral deposit or reserve.
 
We entered into a verbal agreement with our consulting Geologist DA Bending to
act as an agent to prospect, locate, stake claims, register claims and provide a
preliminary geological report for us, and is comprised of one claim block of 12
claims or 132 acres, respectively. The claims are located in the Ruby Valley
Approximately 83km southeast of Elko Nevada.The nearest commercial airport is at
Reno, approximately 360 road miles from the property. The cost associated with
the acquisition of the property and providing us with a geological report was
the sum of $15,000, for a 100% interest in the property the claims are currently
in the name of Pacificorp Holdings, Ltd. with the State of Nevada. There is no
electrical power that can be utilized on the claim other than electrical power
that can be provided by gas or diesel generators that we would bring on site.
Immediately prior to the commencement of exploration activities we will then
seek to enter into formal agreement(s) to secure Mr.Bending's time and confirm
the budget he has recommended. In the event that Mr. Bending is not available to
carry out the exploration program, this will allow us to hire another geologist
to commence our exploration program.

We maintain our statutory registered agent's office at Nevada Agency and
Transfer Company, 50 West Liberty Street, Suite 880 Reno Nevada. Our mailing
address and business office is located at 500 N. Rainbow Road, Suite 300 Las
Vegas, Nevada. Our telephone number is702-448-8134.
