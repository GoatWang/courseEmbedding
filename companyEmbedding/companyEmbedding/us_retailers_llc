The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Retailer Policy


USFLOORS INTERNET ADVERTISING POLICY
Updated 6-1-17
USFloors grants permission to its dealers to use on the Internet certain of USFloors’ copyrighted images displayed on certain of its flooring lines, copyrighted graphics and other copyrighted written material developed by USFloors in connection with marketing programs designed for its dealers, as well as USFloors’ trademarks (collectively the “Licensed Intellectual Property”).
USFloors is pleased to license the use of the Licensed Intellectual Property to its dealers upon the terms and conditions stated below. This Policy supersedes and replaces all previous policies and requirements pertaining to the Internet Usage (as defined below) of the Licensed Intellectual Property and our dealers are released from those policies and requirements. All retailers who sell or advertise over the Internet must abide by this policy.

The license extended by, and the requirements contained in, this Policy pertain only to Internet Usage. The term “Internet Usage,” as used in this Policy, refers to advertising over a Web site.
In order for Internet sellers to use the Licensed Intellectual Property which is made available by USFloors, MAP pricing MUST be published for each product offered for sell on all transactional websites. Furthermore, Map pricing MUST be published for each product offered for sell on sites where it is directly or indirectly implied that orders can be quoted and taken via a phone call or email.
The Licensed Intellectual Property that is being licensed to each dealer under this Policy is limited to that Licensed Intellectual Property which is made available by USFloors to such dealer in connection with (i) the specific flooring and other products sold or licensed by USFloors (the “Products”) which such dealer is authorized to carry; and (ii) any marketing program made available to such dealer.
USFloors reserves the right to limit or refuse to permit the use of the Licensed Intellectual Property at any time for any reason or no reason in its sole discretion. Upon notice, the dealer will be required to immediately remove all Licensed Intellectual Property from its Web site and to cease and desist sending or causing to be sent any email advertising, which includes the Intellectual Property.
In order to protect the integrity of its Licensed Intellectual Property, the products identified in Schedule “A”, attached to this notice, (“MAP Products”) are subject to USFloors’ MinimumAdvertised Price (“MAP”) Policy. USFloors’ MAP Policy applies to all advertisements of all MAP Products in any and all media.[1] Updates to Schedule “A” shall be gained from your USFloors Territory Manager.

The MAP Policy applies to any activity that USFloors determines, at its sole discretion, is designed or intended to circumvent the intent of this MAP Policy.
USFloors reserves the right to modify the MAP Policy, at its sole discretion, in unique events, but not limited to, where USFloors offers a direct manufacturer rebate that would cause the MAP Product to fall below the MAP.


Each dealer must have programmed pricing, and a current account number with USFloors. USFloors will not set up separate accounts for Internet Usage.
The Licensed Intellectual Property will be used by the dealers only in connection with those Products produced, purchased, supplied or licensed by USFloors. All Internet Usage of the Intellectual Property will use only approved copyrighted images and trademarks and trademark graphics in connection with the advertising materials displayed through such Internet Usage. No dealer shall have any right in or to any of the Licensed Intellectual Property and shall not make any statement or take any position to the contrary. All goodwill from the use of the Licensed Intellectual Property shall inure to the sole benefit of USFloors. Each of the dealers will do nothing in its advertising or otherwise to indicate that the Licensed Intellectual Property is the property of such dealer. Upon request, each dealer will provide to USFloors examples showing all Internet Usage by such dealer of the Licensed Intellectual Property.
No dealer may engage in Internet Usage of the Licensed Intellectual Property to sell or market the Products in any way that disparages or injures USFloors or the Products, as determined by USFloors. The dealer may not engage in Internet Usage to market the Products or use the Licensed Intellectual Property in any manner involving illegal, deceptive, undesirable or improper retail practices.
No dealer may register or seek to register any domain names incorporating USFloors’ trademarks, or any variant thereof, with any Internet domain name registration service in the United States or internationally. USFloors reserves the right to choose those dealers with which to do business and the right to accept or reject any purchase order from any dealer at any time. Any violation of this Policy may result in USFloors’ refusal to accept any purchase order from a dealer in the future in its sole discretion at any time.
This Policy, which has been adopted unilaterally by USFloors, shall be effective April 1, 2017.

USFloors values your business and appreciates the efforts undertaken by each of its dealers in promoting the Products. It is believed that this Policy will ensure the integrity of the use of the Licensed Intellectual Property not only for the benefit of USFloors, but also for the benefit of its licensed dealers.
Restrictions on Proprietary Products
 The collections listed below may NOT be shown either with or without pricing or sold on any transactional websites (sites with shopping carts).  Furthermore, these products are not to be listed on sites where it is directly or indirectly implied that orders can be quoted and taken via a phone call or email. 
The proprietary Natural Oil Floors – Castle Combe Floor and Wall Grande, Castle Combe Floor and Wall Originals and Castle Combe Floor and Wall West End may NOT be shown or sold by retailers through a transactional website or any site where it is directly or indirectly implied that orders can be quoted and taken via a phone call or email.

SCHEDULE A
USFloors Industries MAP Policy Enforcement:

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
