MIGHTY MITES ® 
 

The TETON Westwood Mighty Mites Fund seeks to provide long-term capital
appreciation by investing primarily in micro-capitalization equity securities.

 

The Fund primarily invests in common stocks of smaller companies that have a market
capitalization (defined as shares outstanding times current market price) of $500
million or less at the time of the Fund's initial investment. These companies are called
micro-cap companies. The Fund focuses on micro-cap companies which appear to be
underpriced relative to their "private market value." Private market value is the value
the Adviser believes informed investors would be willing to pay to acquire a company.

 

In selecting stocks, the Adviser attempts to identify companies that have above-average
sales and earnings growth prospects; have improving balance sheet fundamentals given
the current status of economic and business cycles; are undervalued and may significantly
appreciate due to management changes, stock acquisitions, mergers, reorganizations,
tender offers, spin-offs or other significant events; and have new or unique products, new
or expanding markets, changing competitive or regulatory climates or undervalued assets
or franchises.

 

The personal information you provide and the personalized data you create and save on the site is used to provide superior service to you and to inform you of products, services, or other opportunities that may be available through us. This may include disclosure of such information to employees, representatives, officers, agents, affiliates, government and regulatory entities, third parties, and service providers. Such information and data will also be used to administer our business, the site, and our services in a manner consistent with this privacy statement, the Terms and Conditions that govern your use of this site and all applicable laws, rules, regulations, or other legal obligations. If you provide us with your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address, or have done so in the past, we may contact you by telephone, mail or e-mail.

 

The Adviser also considers the stocks' prices, the issuers' balance sheet characteristics
and the strength of issuers' managements. Micro-cap companies may also be new or
unseasoned companies that are in their very early stages of development and companies
can also be engaged in new and emerging industries. Micro-cap companies are generally
not well-known to investors and have less of an investor following than larger companies.
The Adviser will attempt to capitalize on the lack of analyst attention to micro-cap stocks
and the inefficiency of the micro-cap market.
