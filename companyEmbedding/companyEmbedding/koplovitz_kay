Advertising Hall of Fame Interview: Kay Koplovitz Equates Chaos With Opportunity

When Kay Koplovitz founded the first ad-supported cable channel, USA Network, in 1977, cable needed bundles of channels to succeed. Now, viewers are unbundling, making it "a very challenging time for advertising," Kay told me prior to her induction into the Advertising Hall of Fame.
An advertiser's message needs to be seen by "the exact person to whom it's going to matter," she said. "People don't mind the advertising, but they don't want to watch the advertising that doesn't address them. It's a chaotic time [and] a fascinating time."
Kay said she's been surprised at how quickly some of the upstart streaming channels like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have produced "high-caliber" programming. And they've fostered the growth of binge viewing, a phenomenon that the established cable networks were forced to copy.
"I've always loved chaos because in chaos there's opportunity," she said. "Today we have some of the best-written and best-produced television series of all time."
When Kay began her career, the biggest challenge was to launch enough satellite dishes to receive signals from the new cable networks. Then HBO, at the time a client of Kay's, "changed the course of television history," she said, by telecasting via satellite the "Thrilla in Manila" boxing match in 1975 between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier.
But, she said, the questions remained: "How could you start a cable business with so few subscribers, and the ones that did exist were mostly in rural areas using cable antenna systems called CATV? And how could you deliver original programming without a business plan, nobody to sell advertising to [and] nobody to watch it?"
Kay's big idea was to reverse the network model: Have the cable operators pay for the programming and, in turn, give them timeslots to sell local advertising. The first package that Kay brought to the operators consisted of 125 events from Madison Square Garden, which was why USA Network was then called Madison Square Garden Network. She then added Major League Baseball, the NBA, NHL and more. "The cable operators were happy to pay for sports because they were gaining subscribers rapidly. The whole idea was to have live sports every single night and I achieved that in the second year," Kay recalled.










But then the company's ownership reorganized and no longer wanted MSGN—which it renamed USA Network—to be in sports. "I argued so hard for [another, separate sports network]. I think it was a huge mistake not to stay in sports," she said.
One other battle Kay lost—"It really angered me," she said—was a deal to buy FNN. She realized in the late '80s that financial reporting would be simple to cover. "You don't have to send people to war zones, you just have them at desks," she said. "And it was 24-hours-a-day trading." She partnered with The Wall Street Journal and, after a year of negotiating, had the needed approval. But just when she was literally signing the contract, Kay got a call from Sid Sheinberg of Universal Studios, who said he changed his mind.
And here's a story about a deal Kay thought she'd lost but ended up winning. She went to George Steinbrenner, the legendary head of the New York Yankees, to pitch him on carrying the team's away games. The first game, Yankees vs. the Red Sox, in April of '79, "went 11 innings. It was the perfect game to start with," she said.
The next day, Kay got a call from Bowie Kuhn, then commissioner of MLB, who told Kay she didn't have the rights to carry the game—even though she had the signed contract in front of her—and who threatened to get a restraining order to stop her from cablecasting more games. Kay told him she'd trade the deal with the Yankees for a deal with MLB to televise games from all the teams. "There was silence," she said. Then Kuhn said, "I'll see you in my office tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock, Ms. Koplovitz." And that was how she traded the Yankees for MLB.
In 1999, Kay started Springboard Enterprises as a venture capital firm to help women in tech raise money to bring products to market. Some numbers she cited: Springboard has brought 662 companies through the program, and her companies have raised more than $7.5 billion in venture capital. "Women still do not raise money at par with the market," she said, "but they outperform the market."
Kay said she has been most influenced by the great science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, whom she heard lecture on geosynchronous orbiting satellites. "It had a profound effect on me," she said. It was a reason why she started the Syfy Channel (launched as Sci-Fi Channel in 1992), which combined her love of science and storytelling.
But, Kay warned, "we're in danger of people who don't believe in science influencing policies. ... I think we need to have more storytelling about the great scientists of the time and how they've actually impacted our society.
"So I think that's what I would say about who Kay Koplovitz really is."

ABOUT KAY
FOUNDER OF USA NETWORKS, THE SYFY CHANNEL, AND GAME CHANGING ENTREPRENEUR



Leadership
Kay Koplovitz is the Founder of USA Network and the visionary who created the business model for cable networks by introducing the concept of two revenue streams – licensing and advertising. When she founded USA Network under the banner of Madison Square Garden Sports in 1977 she was the first woman to head a television network.
As a visionary of what sports television would become, Ms. Koplovitz launched major professional and collegiate sports on cable television by negotiating the first contracts and creating first cable coverage for Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, the Masters from Augusta Georgia, the US Tennis Open and a collection of NCAA conference sporting events. She led USA Network to first place in cable prime time ratings and it remained there for 14 years. In 1992, she launched the Sci-Fi Channel (now The Syfy Channel) which has become a top ten rated cable network known for innovative drama and mini-series.In 1994, she launched USA Networks International, including what was then known as the Sci-Fi Channel into 60 countries worldwide.
Vision for Women
In 1998, President Clinton appointed Kay Koplovitz to chair the bipartisan National Women’s Business Council. She used this platform to launch Springboard Enterprises, in a move to get women entrepreneurs to “think big” about their growth companies and to raise venture capital to fund them. Springboard Enterprises, her shared vision with co-founder Amy Millman, selects, trains and presents women-led companies to raise venture capital. Springboard is creating a national human capital network and has become the premier platform for women entrepreneurs, investors, and industry experts meet to build great women-led businesses.
Author, Keynote Speaker
Kay Koplovitz, one of today’s leading women in business, is the author of Bold Women,Big Ideas (2002), which she wrote to inform and inspire women entrepreneurs to create wealth through equity. She is a sought after motivational speaker on subjects ranging from women’s leadership, women’s entrepreneurship, capital formation, creating a human capital ecosystem, to emerging media and management.
In February 2015, Ms. Koplovitz introduced and edited Been There, Run That, an anthology of best practices from Springboard entrepreneurs who have “been there, run that.”
An experienced public board member, Ms. Koplovitz is currently the on the Board of  CA Technologies, ION media and Time Inc. She has served on the boards of Instinet, Oracle, Nabisco, and General Re.

Koplovitz founded the USA Network in 1977 as an all sports service, Madison Square Garden Sports.[3] USA would eventually become the number one ranking cable network in primetime viewership for 13 consecutive years.[3] Under her leadership, the SyFy Channel was launched in 1992 and USA Network International was launched in 1994, operating in countries around the world.[3] Koplovitz is also credited for creating the concept for two revenue steams of licensing and advertising.[1] She served as chairman and chief executive officer until 1998, when it was sold for $4.5 billion and it became a publicly listed company.[1]
Springboard Enterprises, Koplovitz & Company[edit]
In 1998, President Bill Clinton appointed Koplovitz to chair the bipartisan National Women's Business Council.[4] This helped create a platform for her to Co-Found Springboard Enterprises in 2000. Springboard is a national organization fostering venture capital investments in women-led high growth companies and has raised over $5.5 billion and created over 10,000 jobs since its inception.[1][5]
Also in 1998, Koplovitz & Company LLC was established to provide advisory services to entertainment companies, sports organizations, advertisers and distributors. It advises companies on growth strategies and the firm makes investments in early and mid-stage companies in media and technology.[6]
In 2013, she delivered the keynote at the Women 2.0 conference in Las Vegas which caters to women in technology.[7]
Other projects and board memberships[edit]
In 2002, Koplovitz's book Bold Women, Big Ideas: Learning To Play The High-Risk Entrepreneurial Game was published. She wrote to inform and inspire women entrepreneurs to create wealth through equity.[8]
Koplovitz served as chairman of the board of Fifth & Pacific, formerly Liz Claiborne, from January 2007 until May 2013.[1] She has also served as a board member of CA Technologies, ION Media, Instinet, Oracle, Nabisco and General Re.[4]
Koplovitz served as chairman of the board for Kate Spade & Company from 2007 to 2013.[9]
In April 2014, it was announced that Kay Koplovitz would sit on the 10-member board of Time Inc., the publishing arm of Time Warner Inc. [10]
Koplovitz announced the Video4Villages project in 2014, which will attempt to create a global platform using mobile distribution, making video content available on any phone with local language subtitles. Koplovitz began the project in the hopes of bringing knowledge through video to those living in parts of the world without high-speed connections.[11]

Koplovitz holds honorary doctorate degrees from Emerson College, St. John's University, Michigan State University and Canisius College.[12] Other honors and awards she has received include the following:

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
