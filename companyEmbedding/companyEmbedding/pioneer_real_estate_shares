We have purchased over 1,700 properties in the last 10 years, but raising capital has always been one of the hardest, most time-intensive things we had to do. RealtyShares has made raising capital basically an afterthought – it is simple, streamlined, and FAST.Alex SifakisPresident, JWB Real Estate CapitalCommon QuestionsWhy should I raise money through RealtyShares?
RealtyShares makes raising capital for your investment much easier. Submitting your investment
        opportunity, receiving approval, listing and funding can all be completed in a fraction of the time
        required to deal with banks or institutional funding channels.
We’ll present your opportunity to investors across the country; investors for whom we make real estate
        investing easy. We’ll be providing you with access to a broader capital pool made up of investors that
        want to participate in projects like yours. We’ll come to you as a single investor, in a manner that is
        legally compliant. We’ll take over all the investor communications chores for our investor pool, while at
        the same time your corporate brand is being elevated through its access to this much broader group. And
        our experience will give you the comfort you want that the funding process is going to be smooth and
        efficient.
RealtyShares can become your company’s capital-raising partner. Please contact us at raise@realtyshares.com to discuss your particular project.
What kind of real estate investments can be listed on RealtyShares?
RealtyShares lists investment opportunities involving a variety of real estate property types, including
        multi-family residential, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, and hospitality facilities.
        Single-family residences being used for investment purposes (not owner-occupied) are also the subject of
        many investment opportunities. We generally prefer to finance properties in or near a significant
        metropolitan area, but it all depends on the particular situation.
RealtyShares also offers several different types of financing options. We can do secured real estate
        loans (both first- or second-lien positions); equity financing, usually for properties involving in-place
        cash flow that provide an income component to the investment; and/or “preferred equity” investments
        involving a preferential position in the equity capital structure but with only limited potential upside
        (so that sponsors retain most of the appreciation). If there is a specific property or financing type you
        might be interested in, let us know
        here.
What criteria does RealtyShares have for debt financing?
RealtyShares, through its lending subsidiary RS Lending, Inc., provides business-purposes loans (i.e., no
        owner-occupied properties) secured by both conventional residential properties (such as single-family
        residences) as well as commercial properties (e.g., larger apartment buildings, retail centers, office
        buildings, etc.). We can provide both short-term (usually, 36 months or less) 1st-lien and 2nd-lien debt
        financing on residential properties. We can also provide both bridge or permanent debt financing on
        commercial properties.
RealtyShares looks at a number of criteria in underwriting potential loan opportunities. Generally, we
        look for certain minimum loan-to-cost (LTC) or loan-to-after-repair-value (ARV) criteria. We also like to
        understand the operating plan for the project, and we verify borrower credit and background history.
Each of these criteria vary slightly by situation and loan product; please contact us here to discuss your particular project.
How do you keep my personal information secure?
We go to great lengths to ensure the security of all of our members and our data and use Secure Sockets
        Layer. SSL is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and
        a browser. We use 128-bit encryption, which is the same level of encryption used by top national banks. We
        are also regularly audited by third party security firms to ensure compliance with the most rigorous
        security standards.
For added protection, we never store your banking information on our servers and we automatically log you
        out of your account after 30 minutes of inactivity.
How do you choose which real estate companies can raise money through RealtyShares?
We’re looking for companies with a knowledgeable team and a proven strategy and track record. Among other
        diligence inquiries, we will run background and credit checks on the principals of your company, and will
        perform a more thorough review of each project that is initially thought to be a suitable fit for our
        platform. Once we are comfortable with your team and the investment, we can proceed to the details of
        getting your project listed on our platform.
Currently, we list only a relatively small percentage of all of the prospective projects that are
        brought to us.

overview/highlights.xsloverview/strategy.xsl      Fund Strategy              The Fund seeks to provide long-term growth of capital through investment in publicly traded equity securities, issued by real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other real estate or real estate related companies. Current income is a secondary objective. It invests in a number of property sectors (apartment buildings, shopping centers, malls, hotels), and provides potential for investors to receive attractive dividend* income that may be higher than that offered by equity investments and high quality bonds. *Dividends are not guaranteed.         overview/mngmt.xsl      Portfolio Management     Pioneer Real Estate Shares Management         AEW Capital Management, L.P. (AEW), a real estate investment advisory firm, is the Fund's investment sub-adviser. Day-to-day management of the Fund is the responsibility of Matthew A. Troxell, CFA (portfolio manager of the Fund since 2004). Mr. Troxell is a managing director and senior portfolio manager at AEW with responsibility for construction and management of all the firm's publicly traded real estate equities portfolios. He has been employed at AEW as part of the REIT group since 1994 and has over 30 years of experience in investment analysis and portfolio management. Mr. Troxell is supported by three portfolio managers: J. Hall Jones, Jr., CFA, director of AEW (co-portfolio manager of the Fund since 2012); Gina Szymanski, CFA, director of AEW (co-portfolio manager of the Fund since 2017) and John A. Garofalo, CFA, director of AEW (co-portfolio manager of the Fund since 2014).            Portfolio Management Perspective              "We believe that the performance of real estate securities ultimately depends upon the performance of the underlying real estate, company management and the influence of capital markets. Drawing upon the combined expertise of our securities, private market real estate and research professionals, we employ a value-oriented investment strategy designed to identify securities that we believe are underpriced relative to their peers."        overview/footnotes.xsl      A WORD ABOUT RISK              The portfolio invests in REIT securities, the value of which can fall for a variety of reasons, such as declines in rental income, fluctuating interest rates, poor property management, environmental liabilities, uninsured damage, increased competition, or changes in real estate tax laws. The Fund invests in a limited number of securities and, as a result, the fund's performance may be more volatile than the performance of other funds holding more securities. When interest rates rise, the prices of fixed-income securities in the Fund will generally fall. Conversely, when interest rates fall, the prices of fixed-income securities in the Fund will generally rise. At times, the Fund's investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are interrelated or have common risks, making it more susceptible to any economic, political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting those industries and sectors. These risks may increase share price volatility.         overview/bankbox.xslNot FDIC insuredMay lose valueNo bank guarantee						Before investing, consider the product's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Contact your advisor or Amundi Pioneer for a prospectus or summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully. To obtain a free prospectus and for information on any Pioneer fund, please download from our web site.											Neither Amundi Pioneer, nor its representatives, are legal or tax advisors.

Beta is a measure of the volatility of a fund relative to the overall market.                  R-squared represents the percentage of the portfolio's movements that can be explained by the general movements of the market.                  Turnover Ratio is the percentage of a fund's assets that have changed over a given period, usually a year. Mutual funds with higher turnover ratios tend to have higher expenses.                  Sharpe Ratio - a measure of excess return per unit of risk, as defined by standard deviation. A higher Sharpe ratio suggests better risk-adjusted performance.Source: Lipper.         perf/performance.xslFund Performance                             Chart is for illustrative purposes. These results represent the percentage change in net asset value per share. Returns would have been lower had sales charges been reflected.                   For the most recent month-end performance results click here. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.  The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All results are historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.         Performance results reflect any applicable expense waivers in effect during the periods shown.

Class C Return if Redeemed: The performance of Class C shares does not reflect the 1% front-end sales charge in effect prior to February 1, 2004. If you paid a 1% sales charge, your returns would be lower than shown above. Class C Shares held for less than one year are subject to a 1% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). Class C Shares inception 1/31/1996.                  Performance for periods prior to the inception of Class Y Shares on 4/9/98 reflects the NAV performance of the Fund's Class A Shares. The performance does not reflect differences in expenses, including the 12b-1 fees applicable to Class A Shares. Since fees for Class A Shares are generally higher than those of Class Y, the performance shown for the Class Y Shares prior to their inception would have been higher. Class Y shares are not subject to sales charges and are available for limited groups of investors, including institutional investors.                  NAV results represent the percent change in net asset value per share. Returns would have been lower had sales charges been reflected. The MSCI US REIT Index (benchmark) broadly and fairly represents the equity REIT opportunity set with proper investability screens to ensure that the index is investable and replicable. The Lipper Real Estate Funds Average represents the average annual returns for Real Estate Funds for the respective time periods. Indices are unmanaged and their returns assume reinvestment of dividends and, unlike fund returns, do not reflect any fees or expenses. You cannot invest directly in an index. Periods less than one year are actual, not annualized.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

SpaceX valuation jumps to $21 billion on new financing round
              
              SpaceX has raised up to $350 million in a new round of financing that would value the company at around $21 billion, a vote of confidence for billionaire founder Elon Musk who is seeking to prove the rocket maker can use reusable engines to speed up launches and become a major satellite operator.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Their process for evaluating our company was thorough and they completed it quickly and efficiently which I believe went a long way to making our raise successful.Chris FunkManaging Partner, Sun Coast Property ManagementRealtyShares’ secure platform makes investing quick and easy. Every investment has a wealth of financial information – on the project, the developer and its track record, etc. – to allow the investor to do as much due diligence as they wish.Jeff BullianVice President, Kessler GroupRealtyShares has absolutely revolutionized our business. We have purchased over 1,700 properties in the last 10 years, but raising capital has always been one of the hardest, most time-intensive things we had to do. RealtyShares has made raising capital basically an afterthought – it is simple, streamlined, and FAST.Alex SifakisPresident, JWB Real Estate CapitalCommon QuestionsWhy should I raise money through RealtyShares?
RealtyShares makes raising capital for your investment much easier. Submitting your investment
        opportunity, receiving approval, listing and funding can all be completed in a fraction of the time
        required to deal with banks or institutional funding channels.
We’ll present your opportunity to investors across the country; investors for whom we make real estate
        investing easy. We’ll be providing you with access to a broader capital pool made up of investors that
        want to participate in projects like yours. We’ll come to you as a single investor, in a manner that is
        legally compliant. We’ll take over all the investor communications chores for our investor pool, while at
        the same time your corporate brand is being elevated through its access to this much broader group. And
        our experience will give you the comfort you want that the funding process is going to be smooth and
        efficient.
RealtyShares can become your company’s capital-raising partner. Please contact us at raise@realtyshares.com to discuss your particular project.
What kind of real estate investments can be listed on RealtyShares?
RealtyShares lists investment opportunities involving a variety of real estate property types, including
        multi-family residential, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, and hospitality facilities.
        Single-family residences being used for investment purposes (not owner-occupied) are also the subject of
        many investment opportunities. We generally prefer to finance properties in or near a significant
        metropolitan area, but it all depends on the particular situation.
RealtyShares also offers several different types of financing options. We can do secured real estate
        loans (both first- or second-lien positions); equity financing, usually for properties involving in-place
        cash flow that provide an income component to the investment; and/or “preferred equity” investments
        involving a preferential position in the equity capital structure but with only limited potential upside
        (so that sponsors retain most of the appreciation). If there is a specific property or financing type you
        might be interested in, let us know
        here.
What criteria does RealtyShares have for debt financing?
RealtyShares, through its lending subsidiary RS Lending, Inc., provides business-purposes loans (i.e., no
        owner-occupied properties) secured by both conventional residential properties (such as single-family
        residences) as well as commercial properties (e.g., larger apartment buildings, retail centers, office
        buildings, etc.). We can provide both short-term (usually, 36 months or less) 1st-lien and 2nd-lien debt
        financing on residential properties. We can also provide both bridge or permanent debt financing on
        commercial properties.
RealtyShares looks at a number of criteria in underwriting potential loan opportunities. Generally, we
        look for certain minimum loan-to-cost (LTC) or loan-to-after-repair-value (ARV) criteria. We also like to
        understand the operating plan for the project, and we verify borrower credit and background history.
Each of these criteria vary slightly by situation and loan product; please contact us here to discuss your particular project.
How do you keep my personal information secure?
We go to great lengths to ensure the security of all of our members and our data and use Secure Sockets
        Layer. SSL is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and
        a browser. We use 128-bit encryption, which is the same level of encryption used by top national banks. We
        are also regularly audited by third party security firms to ensure compliance with the most rigorous
        security standards.
For added protection, we never store your banking information on our servers and we automatically log you
        out of your account after 30 minutes of inactivity.
How do you choose which real estate companies can raise money through RealtyShares?
We’re looking for companies with a knowledgeable team and a proven strategy and track record. Among other
        diligence inquiries, we will run background and credit checks on the principals of your company, and will
        perform a more thorough review of each project that is initially thought to be a suitable fit for our
        platform. Once we are comfortable with your team and the investment, we can proceed to the details of
        getting your project listed on our platform.
Currently, we list only a relatively small percentage of all of the prospective projects that are
        brought to us.
