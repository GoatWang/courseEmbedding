					Full Description



Vicor Corporation, incorporated on November 10, 1981, designs, develops, manufactures and markets modular power components and power systems for converting, regulating and controlling electric current. The Company's segments include Brick Business Unit (BBU), VI Chip and Picor. The BBU segment designs, develops, manufactures and markets modular direct current-direct current (DC-DC) converters and configurable products, and also includes the entities comprising Vicor Custom Power, and the BBU operations of Vicor Japan Company, Ltd. (VJCL). The VI Chip segment includes VI Chip Corporation, which designs, develops, manufactures and markets advanced power component products. The VI Chip segment also includes the VI Chip business conducted through VJCL. The Picor segment includes Picor Corporation (Picor), which designs, develops, manufactures and markets integrated circuits and related products for use in a range of power management and power system applications. Picor develops these products for use in the Company's BBU and VI Chip modules, to be sold as complements to its BBU and VI Chip products, or for sale to third parties for separate (stand-alone) applications.The Company offers a range of building blocks enabling design of a power system specific to a customer's needs. Its product focus is on DC-DC switching converters providing the transformation, regulation, isolation, filtering, and/or input protection necessary to power and protect electronic loads. The Company's product categories include legacy and advanced.Legacy ProductsThe Company's legacy products include bricks (modular DC-DC converters and complementary components), open-frame intermediate bus converters, cool-power high density zero voltage soft switching topology (ZVS) DC-DC converters, configurable products and custom power systems. The Company offers brick modules as DC-DC converters, as well as complementary components providing alternating current (AC) line rectification, input filtering, power factor correction and transient protection. The BBU offers high power density, component-level DC-DC converters, representing a range of DC-DC converter modules, which include the VI-200, VI-J00, MI-200, MI-J00 and the FasTrak module line. Ranges of input voltage (from 9 to 425 volts), output voltages (from 2 to 54 volts) and output power (up to 600 watts) were offered, allowing end users to select components appropriate to their individual applications, as of December 31, 2016. Brick DC-DC converters were offered in sizes, depending on family, ranging from 116.9 x 61.0 x 12.7 millimeter (full brick), to 57.9 x 61.0 x 12.7 millimeter (half brick), to 57.9 x 36.8 x 12.7 millimeter (quarter brick), as of December 31, 2016.Products from the Company's line of complementary components are used to condition and/or filter the input and output voltages of the brick DC-DC converter. The Company's complementary product is Harmonic Attenuator Module (HAM), a front end providing power factor correction. The HAM utilized a zero current switching boost converter, which allowed it to provide output power of up to 675 watts and DC output voltage of 365 volts, as of December 31, 2016. These products serve various market segments, which include aerospace and aviation; defense electronics; industrial automation, instrumentation and test equipment; medical diagnostics; telecommunications infrastructure, and vehicles and transportation infrastructure.The Company offers a line of open-frame intermediate bus converters (IBCs) for implementation of multi-stage power conversion. These devices are used in telecommunications and networking equipment applications. The Company offered isolated DC-DC converters, which delivered up 60 watts in a very small surface-mount package, as of December 31, 2016. These high density converter modules were offered in three input voltages, 48 volt nominal for communication applications; 28 volt nominal for rugged high temperature or military applications, and 24 volt nominal for industrial applications, as of December 31, 2016. The Company offers configurable products that provide power solutions configured to a customer's specific needs, often with multiple voltage outputs. The Company's configurable product includes FlatPAC. Its configurable products are used in a range of Centralized Power Architecture (CPA) and distributed power architecture implementations in defense electronics, industrial and transportation applications, as well as medical instrumentation.The Company designs, develops and manufactures power systems to meet performance and/or form factor requirements that cannot be met with off-the-shelf system solutions. These products are designed to function in the environments associated with aerospace, aviation and defense applications, but also are used in applications ranging from industrial equipment to medical instrumentation.Advanced ProductsThe Company's advanced products include ChiPs (Modular Power Components), Vicor integrated adapter package (VIAs), cool-power ZVS modules (system-in-package point-of-load regulators), power path management components and VI chips (modular power components). The Company offered ChiPs in five package sizes ranging from 6 by 23 millimeter to 61 by 23 millimeter, as of December 31, 2016. The Company offered over 100 specific ChiP module variants, reflecting the multiple configurations, based on dimensions, lead formats and performance specifications, enabled by the flexible module format. Cool-Power buck regulators operated from nominal input voltages of 12, 24 and 48 volts, as of December 31, 2016. Across distributed power system architectures, ChiPs are targeted at aerospace and aviation; computing; defense electronics; industrial automation, instrumentation and test equipment; telecommunications and networking infrastructure, and vehicles.The VIA platform is a rugged, double-sided, copper-alloy package for ChiP modules, integrating complementary components, circuitry, and thermal management through conductive cooling. Its VIA packages had a vertical dimension of 9.3 millimeter and a width of 35.5 millimeter, and, depending on the packaged ChiP module and its functionality, range in length from 72 to 141.4 millimeter, as of December 31, 2016. The Company's Cool-Power brand of non-isolated, point-of-load regulators consists of buck, (the device steps down voltage) and buck-boost (the device lowers or increases voltage) regulators.Picor offers a range of specialized components for circuit protection. Its products include QuietPower filters for input filtering of electro-magnetic interference and output noise; the Cool-Switch, a load-disconnect switch solution, which functions as an electronic circuit breaker; the Cool-Swap, a hot swap circuit breaker controller enabling safe system operation during circuit card insertion; and the Cool-ORing, a high-density, active ORing solution enabling detection and isolation of circuit faults. It also offers discrete components, capacitors, and electronic and mechanical accessories, all compatible with the Company's power components. The Company offered the first generation of VI Chip Pre-Regulator Module (PRM), Bus Converter Module (BCM) and Voltage Transformation Module (VTM) modules, in full (32.5 by 22.0 by 6.73 millimeter) and half (22.0 by 16.5 by 6.73 millimeter) sizes, as of December 31, 2016.

 ConverterPACs




    ConverterPACs are the family of slide-in output assemblies used in MegaPAC power supplies. There are currently 13 ConverterPACs available for use. Most ConverterPACs of the same length are interchangeable within a MegaPAC and between different AC input MegaPAC chassis. They can be added, moved, or changed as necessary. ConverterPACs incorporate VI-200 or VI-J00 and / or Maxi Vicor DC-DC converter bricks. For additional power, ConverterPACs can be paralleled. Some ConverterPACs are available for low-noise applications (VXI options, RamPACs and QPACs) and as current sources (BatPACs). All ConverterPACs can be easily removed in the field by loosening a single screw and sliding the unit out of the chassis. See below for individual fact sheets on each ConverterPAC.
