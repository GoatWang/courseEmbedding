Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

      WHEREAS,
the Vice President of Manufacturing of the Company and is
considered as an integral part of the Company’s management;
and

the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”)
considers the establishment and maintenance of a sound and vital
management to be essential in protecting and enhancing the best
interests of the Company and its Shareholders, recognizes that the
possibility of a Change in Control exists and that such
possibility, and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise
among management, may result in the departure or distraction of
management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its
Shareholders; and


      WHEREAS,
the Executive desires that in the event of any Change in Control he
will continue to have the responsibility and status he has earned;
and


      WHEREAS,
the Board has determined that it is appropriate to reinforce and
encourage the continued attention and dedication of the Executive,
as a member of the Company’s management, to his assigned
duties without distraction in potentially disturbing circumstances
arising from the possibility of a Change in Control of the Company;
and


      WHEREAS ,
the Executive and the Company have previously entered a Change in
Control Agreement which, by its own terms, expired November 1,
2008; and


      WHEREAS ,
the Executive and the Company desire to enter a new Change in
Control Agreement that complies with the provisions of section 409A
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”).


      NOW,
THEREFORE, in order to induce the Executive to remain in the
employment of the Company and in consideration of the Executive
agreeing to remain in the employment of the Company, subject to the
terms and conditions set out below, the Company agrees it will pay
such amount, as provided in Section 4 of this Agreement, to
the Executive, if the Executive’s employment with the Company
terminates under one of the circumstances described herein
following a Change in Control of the Company, as herein
defined.

except to the extent that any

1

such period;


     (b) The
termination of the Executive’s employment with the Company
for any reason prior to a Change in Control; and


     (c) Two
(2) years from the date of a Change in Control of the Company
if the Executive has not voluntarily terminated his employment for
Good Reason as of such time.


     
Section 2. Change in Control

until:


     (1) there shall

Executive’s employment by the Company thereafter shall have
been terminated in accordance with Section 3.


     (b) For
purposes of this Agreement, a Change in Control of the Company

Company in which the holders of the Company’s Common Stock
immediately prior to the merger have the same proportionate
ownership of Common Stock of the surviving company immediately
after the merger, or


     (B) any sale,
lease, exchange, or other transfer (in one transaction or a series
of related transactions) of all, or substantially all, of the
assets of the Company; or


     (2) The

or more of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock;
or


     (4) During any
period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning
of such period constitute the entire Board of Directors shall cease
for any reason to constitute a majority thereof unless the
election, or the nomination for election by the Company’s
Shareholders, of each new Director was approved by a vote of at
least two-thirds of the Directors then still in office who were
Directors at the beginning of the period.


     
Section 3. Termination Following Change in
Control


     (a) If a
Change in Control of the Company shall have occurred while the

subsequent termination of the Executive’s employment with the
Company by the Executive voluntarily for Good Reason or by the

Company’s retirement policy for its employees.


     (d)

notice to the Executive) and an opportunity for the Executive to be
heard before the Board), and the delivery to the Executive of a
resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than

Executive’s titles or offices as in effect immediately prior
to a Change in Control of the Company; or any removal of the
Executive from or any failure to reelect the Executive to any of
the positions held prior to a Change of Control of the Company,
except in connection with the termination of his employment for
death, Disability, Retirement, or Cause or by the Executive other
than for Good Reason;


     (2) A material
reduction by the Company in the Executive’s base salary as in

last increase in base salary) the Executive’s base salary
after a Change in Control of the Company in an amount that at least
equals, on a percentage basis, the average percentage increase in
base salary for all executive officers of the Company effected in
the preceding 12 months;


     (3) A failure by
the Company to continue in effect any benefit plan or arrangement
(including, without limitation, the Company’s 401(k) Plan,
group life insurance plan and medical, dental, accident, and
disability plans) in which the Executive is participating at the
time of a Change in Control of the Company (hereinafter referred to
as “Benefit Plan”) without the substitution of a plan
providing him with substantially similar benefits, or the taking of
any action by the Company which would adversely affect the
Executive’s participation in or materially reduce the
Executive’s benefits under any such Benefit Plan or deprive
the Executive of any material fringe benefit enjoyed by the
Executive at the time of a Change in Control of the Company without
the substitution of a plan or fringe benefit providing him with
substantially similar benefits;

the Company to continue in effect any plan or arrangement to
receive securities of the Company (including, without limitation,
stock option plans or any other plan or arrangement to receive and

4



 


thereof) in
which the Executive is participating at the time of a Change in
Control of the Company (a “Securities Plan”) without
the substitution of a plan or arrangement providing him with
substantially similar benefits and the taking of any action by the
Company that would adversely affect the Executive’s
participation in or materially reduce the Executive’s
benefits under any such Securities Plan without the substitution of
a plan or arrangement providing him with substantially similar
benefits;


     (5) A failure by
the Company to continue in effect any bonus plan, automobile
allowance plan, or other incentive payment plan in which the
Executive is participating at the time of a Change in Control of
the Company, or said Executive had participated in during the
previous calendar year without the substitution of a plan or
arrangement providing him with substantially similar
benefits;


     (6) A relocation
of the Company’s principal executive offices to a location
outside of North Carolina, or the Executive’s relocation to
any place other than the location at which the Executive performed
the Executive’s duties prior to a Change in Control of the
Company, except for required travel by the Executive on the
Company’s business to an extent substantially consistent with
the Executive’s business travel obligations at the time of a
Change in Control of the Company;


     (7) A failure by
the Company to provide the Executive with the number of paid
vacation days to which the Executive is entitled at the time of a
