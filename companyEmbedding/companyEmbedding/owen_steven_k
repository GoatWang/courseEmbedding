Silicones and Silicone-Modified Materials
Edited by Stephen J. Clarson, John J. Fitzgerald, Michael J. Owen, and Steven D. Smith
American Chemical Society
ACS Symposium Series


Reviews and Awards


"Gathers 37 papers presented at the Spring 1998 symposium held in Dallas. Among the topics are hydrogenated and deuterated cyclic poly(dimethylsiloxanes), advances in non-toxic silicone biofouling release coatings, NMR relaxation studies of reinforced poly(dimethylsiloxane) melts, low modulus fluorosiloxane-based hydrogels for contact lens application, and calculation of a reaction path for KOH-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization. Other topics include polycarbonate-polysiloxane-based interpenetrating networks, silicon-terminated telechelic oligomers by acyclic diene metathesis chemistry, block copolymers containing silicone and vinyl polymer segments by free radical polymerization, and oxygen gas barrier PET films formed by deposition of plasma-polymerized SiOx films."--SciTech Book News
"Wide ranges of topics including the preparation, properties and industrial applications of silicone-containing materials are the focus of these articles. While chapter 1 and 2 give an overview of the chemistry of polysiloxanes and elemental silicon, the subsequent chapters are original research findings. These articles give a comprehensive coverage of new advancements in the area of silicone-containing polymeric and dendritic materials. This book would be a valuable resource for scientists involved in the production and use of silicones and silicone-modified materials." -- Alaa S. Abd-El-Aziz, Polymer News, Department of Chemistry, The University of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada
