MARCH 31, 2006 (UNAUDITED)                                                      
1. SECURITIES VALUATION                                                         

The  securities of the Schwartz  Value Fund which are traded on stock  exchanges
are valued at the closing sales price as of the close of the regular  session of
trading  on the New York Stock  Exchange  (NYSE) on the day the  securities  are
being valued,  or, if not traded on a particular  day, at the closing bid price.
Securities  quoted by NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ  Official  Closing  Price.
Securities traded in the  over-the-counter  market,  and which are not quoted by
NASDAQ,  are valued at the average of the highest  current  independent  bid and
lowest  current  independent  offer as of the close of the  regular  session  of
trading on the NYSE on the day of valuation. Securities which are traded both in
the over-the-counter  market and on a stock exchange are valued according to the
broadest and most  representative  market.  Investments  representing  primarily
capital  stock of other  open-end  investment  companies are valued at their net
asset value as reported by such  companies.  Securities  (and other  assets) for
which market quotations are not readily available are valued at their fair value
as determined in good faith in accordance with consistently  applied  procedures
established by and under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees.      

2. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS                                                        

Security  transactions  are accounted for on the trade date.  Realized gains and
losses on security transactions are determined on the identified cost basis.    

3. FEDERAL INCOME TAX                                                           

The following  information  is computed on a tax basis for each item as of March
31, 2006:                                                                       

Cost of portfolio of investments      $59,300,361             
                         ===========

Gross unrealized appreciation         $17,429,269             
Gross unrealized depreciation          (1,612,665)            
                         -----------

Net unrealized appreciation           $15,816,604             
                         ===========

The difference between the federal income tax cost of portfolio  investments and
the  financial  statement  cost  is due to  certain  timing  differences  in the
recognition  of  capital  gains and losses  under  income  tax  regulations  and
accounting  principles generally accepted in the United States. These "book/tax"
differences are temporary in nature and are primarily due to the tax deferral of
losses on wash sales.

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESMENTS                                                 
MARCH 31, 2006 (UNAUDITED)                                                      
1. SECURITIES VALUATION                                                         

Securities of the Ave Maria Catholic Values Fund, the Ave Maria Growth Fund, the
Ave Maria Rising  Dividend  Fund and the Ave Maria Bond Fund which are traded on
stock  exchanges  are valued at the  closing  sales price as of the close of the
regular  session of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on the day the
securities  are being  valued,  or, if not traded on a  particular  day,  at the
closing  bid  price.  Securities  which are  quoted by NASDAQ  are valued at the
NASDAQ Official Closing Price. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market,
and which are not quoted by NASDAQ,  are  valued at the  average of the  highest
current  independent bid and lowest current independent offer as of the close of
the regular  session of trading on the NYSE on the day of valuation.  Securities
which are traded both in the over-the-counter market and on a stock exchange are
valued according to the broadest and most representative market. Securities (and
other assets) for which market  quotations are not readily  available are valued
at their fair value as determined in good faith in accordance with  consistently
applied procedures established by and under the general supervision of the Board
of Trustees.                                                                    

2. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS                                                        

Security  transactions  are accounted for on the trade date. Gains and losses on
security transactions are determined on the identified cost basis.              

3. FEDERAL INCOME TAX                                                           

The following  information  is computed on a tax basis for each item as of March

The difference between the federal income tax cost of portfolio  investments and
the financial  statement cost for the Ave Maria  Catholic  Values Fund is due to
certain timing  differences in the  recognition of capital gains or losses under
income tax  regulations  and  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
United States.  These "book/tax"  differences are temporary in nature and due to
the tax deferral of losses on wash sales.

reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940)
that occurred during the  registrant's  last fiscal quarter that have materially
affected,  or are  reasonably  likely to  materially  affect,  the  registrant's
internal control over financial reporting.

SCHWARTZ VALUE FUND 

Dear Fellow Shareowner:                                                         

Even though 2001 was the second down year in a row for the stock market, it was 
the second up year in a row for Schwartz Value Fund. It was the Fund's second   
best year ever -- up 28.1%, compared to the S&P 500 down 11.9%, the Dow Jones   
Industrials down 5.4% and the Russell 2000 up 2.5%. The performance of different
segments of the market varied greatly. Last year large-capitalization stocks and
growth stocks in particular did poorly. Small-cap and mid-cap value stocks,     
which we emphasize, did especially well. This is not surprising, since our      
stocks lagged when euphoria reigned in the major market averages in the late    
90s. The Schwartz Value Fund was not managed any differently in 2001 than in any
of the previous 18 years. It just happened that a lot of the seeds planted years
ago bore fruit in 2001. We plant seeds almost every day, and never know when the
harvest will come in. That's the nature of value investing. Year in and year    
out, the unglamorous stock selection process doesn't change much. We look for   
growing companies that are financially powerful, have proprietary products and  
capable managements. And importantly, we buy only when the share prices are low 
in relation to earnings. That keeps the risk low.                               

2002 will likely see the start of an economic recovery. The Federal Reserve's   
concerted effort to drive interest rates lower over the past fourteen months    
provides reason to be optimistic. Corporations and consumers are deleveraging.  
Corporate debt refinancing will reduce corporate interest expense by $30 billion
in 2002. At the same time, residential mortgage refinancing will increase       
consumer buying power by an additional $40 billion this year. Recently enacted  
tax cuts and increased government spending will also help raise consumer        
confidence. The big boost to economic activity won't come however, until capital
spending resumes, particularly tech spending, which may be a while since excess 
capacity is so widespread in that area. Even so, the combination of the Fed's   
monetary stimulation and Congress' fiscal stimulus should result in expanding   
corporate profits at a 20% plus annual rate by the fourth quarter of this year. 
With inventories getting lean and productivity strong, even minor increments in 
sales volume should result in a significantly better bottom line for much of    
corporate America.                                                              

In managing the Schwartz Value Fund portfolio, we strive to be contrarian       
investors because one can't buy stocks at bargain prices when they're popular.  
Consequently, we're always looking for companies where the consensus outlook is 
temporarily clouded, making the stock prices unduly depressed. An industry      
meeting these standards today is specialty retailers. Even                      

P-->N-30D2nd Page of 42TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 2nd
though some consumers are overextended, the macro condition for retailers is    
really quite good. Inflation is moderate, interest rates are low, and tax rates 
are coming down. In addition, aging baby boomers are hitting their peak earnings
years and inheriting unprecedented wealth, so the current problems of excess    
consumer debt are probably overblown. Also, the rapid attrition which is taking 
place within the retail industry is a plus for the survivors. Consequently,     
selected specialty retailers are well positioned. Since the best time to        
accumulate stocks is when they're unloved and underowned, Schwartz Value Fund   
has made recent purchases of Brookstone, Inc., Coach, Inc., Ethan Allen         
Interiors, Inc., Ross Stores, Inc., Ryan's Family Steak Houses Inc., The Men's  
Wearhouse, Inc., TJX Companies, Inc. and Tractor Supply Company. Operating in a 
very difficult environment, these high-quality retailers have bulletproof       
balance sheets and strong market niches. The former ensures survivability in the
short run, the latter assures profitability in the long run.                    

The year-end distribution of $2.67 per share consisted of $1.83 of long-term    
capital gains and $.84 of short-term capital gains. Reflecting the distribution,
the Fund finished the year with a net asset value of $23.74 per share.          

With best regards,

SCHWARTZ VALUE FUND

SCHWARTZ VALUE FUND 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
DECEMBER 31, 2001 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                              

Schwartz Value Fund (the Fund) is a series of Schwartz Investment Trust, a      
diversified open-end management investment company established as an Ohio       
Business Trust under a Declaration of Trust dated August 31, 1992. The Fund is  
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and commenced operations on 
July 20, 1993. The Fund determines and makes available for publication the net  
asset value of its shares on a daily basis.                                     

The investment objective of the Fund is to seek long-term capital appreciation. 
See the Prospectus for more detailed information regarding the investment       
strategies of the Fund.                                                         

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the   
Fund:                                                                           

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS -- Securities which are traded on stock  
     exchanges are valued at the last reported sale price as of the close of the
  regular session of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the day the
    securities are being valued, or, if not traded on a particular day, at the
   closing bid price. Securities that are quoted by NASDAQ are valued at the
 last reported sale price, or, if not traded on a particular day, at the
mean between the closing bid and asked prices as reported by NASDAQ.  
     Securities traded in the over-the-counter market, not quoted by NASDAQ, are
 valued at the average of the highest current independent bid and lowest
current independent offer as of the close of trading on the day of    
  valuation. Securities (and other assets) for which market quotations are
    not readily available are valued at their fair value as determined in good
     faith in accordance with consistently applied procedures established by and
under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees.               

     (b) INCOME TAXES -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements
   of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies
 and to distribute substantially all taxable income to the shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for income or excise taxes is necessary.      

    The Fund files a tax return annually using tax accounting methods required
   under provisions of the Code, which may differ from accounting principles
 generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), the basis on
which these financial statements are prepared. The differences arise  
primarily from the deferral of certain losses under Federal           

  15

P-->N-30D16th Page of 42TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 16th
     income tax regulations. Accordingly, the amount of net investment income or
loss and net realized capital gain or loss reported in the financial  
statements may differ from that reported in the Fund's tax return and,
  consequently, the character of distributions to shareholders reported in
 the statements of changes and financial highlights may differ from that
 reported to shareholders for Federal income tax purposes. Distributions
  which exceed net realized gains for financial reporting purposes but not
for tax purposes, if any, are shown as distributions in excess of net 
   realized gains in the accompanying statements. Net investment losses, for
tax purposes, are reclassified to paid-in capital.                    

  (c) SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME -- Security transactions
 are accounted for on the trade date. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. 
  Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis.                                                

     (d) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS -- Dividends from net investment income and
net capital gains, if any, are declared and paid annually in December.
     Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
date.                                                                 

    (e) REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS -- The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements
 (agreements to purchase securities subject to the seller's agreement to
repurchase them at a specified time and price) with well-established  
registered securities dealers or banks. Repurchase agreements are the 
     equivalent of loans by the Fund. The Fund's policy is to take possession of
the underlying securities and, on a daily basis, mark to market such  
securities to ensure that the value, including accrued interest, is at
 least equal to the amount to be repaid to the Fund under the agreement.

     (f) ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
 reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.                     

(g) ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE -- The Fund has adopted the  
provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment     
 Companies, effective January 1, 2001. The adoption of this Guide had no
effect in the Fund's financial statements as of December 31, 2001.    

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES          

The President of the Fund is also the President and Chief Investment Officer of 
Schwartz Investment Counsel, Inc. (the Adviser). The Chairman of the Board of   
the Fund is also the Chairman of Gregory J. Schwartz & Co., Inc. (the           
Distributor). Certain other trustees                                            

  16

P-->N-30D17th Page of 42TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 17th
and officers of the Fund are officers of the Adviser or of Ultimus Fund         
Solutions, LLC (Ultimus), the administrative, accounting and transfer agent for 
the Fund.                                                                       

Pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement between the Fund and the Adviser,  
the Adviser is responsible for the management of the Fund and provides          
investment advice along with the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and 
certain other services necessary to the operations of the Fund. For such        
services, the Fund pays the Adviser a quarterly fee equal to the annual rate of 
1.5% of the average daily net assets up to $75 million; 1.25% of such assets    
from $75 million to $100 million; and 1% of such assets in excess of $100       
million.                                                                        

The Distributor is the primary agent for the distribution of the Fund and       
receives fees from the Adviser, not the Fund or its shareholders.               

Pursuant to a Mutual Fund Services Agreement between the Fund and Ultimus,      
Ultimus supplies regulatory and compliance services, calculates the daily net   
asset value per share, maintains the financial books and records of the Fund,   
maintains the records of each shareholder's account, and processes purchases and
redemptions of the Fund's shares. For the performance of these services, the    
Fund pays Ultimus a fee, payable monthly, at an annual rate of .15% of the      
average daily net assets, subject to a minimum monthly fee of $4,000.           

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS                                                      

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments other   
than short-term investments, for the year ended December 31, 2001, were         
$39,120,741 and $38,715,520, respectively.                                      

4. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES                                                         

As of December 31, 2001, net unrealized appreciation of securities was          
$11,133,801 for federal income tax purposes of which $11,845,299 related to     
appreciated securities and $711,498 related to depreciated securities. The      
aggregate cost of investments at December 31, 2001 for federal income tax       
purposes was $39,397,891. The difference between the federal income tax cost of 
portfolio investments and the financial statement cost is due to certain timing 
differences in the recognition of capital losses under income tax regulations   
and GAAP.                                                                       

For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Fund's net investment loss of $254,637
was used to reduce the necessary short-term capital gain distribution. Such     
reclassification, the result of permanent differences between the financial     
statement and income tax reporting requirements, has no effect on the Fund's net
assets or net asset value per share.                                            

During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Fund realized $1,207,856 of net    
capital gains resulting from in-kind redemptions -- in which shareholders       
exchange fund shares for securities held by the Fund rather than for cash.      
Because such gains are not taxable to the Fund, and                             
  17

P-->N-30D18th Page of 42TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 18th
are not distributed to shareholders, they have been reclassified from           
accumulated net realized gains to paid-in capital on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities. Such reclassification has no effect on the Fund's net assets or net
asset value per share.                                                          

5. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS (UNAUDITED)                         

On December 31, 2001, the Fund declared and paid a short-term capital gain of   
$0.8384 per share and a long-term capital gain of $1.8335 per share. In January 
of 2002, shareholders will be provided with Form 1099-DIV which reports the     
amount per share and tax status of the capital gain distribution paid during the
calendar year 2001.

SCHWARTZ VALUE FUND 
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT                                                    

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Shareholders and Trustees of Schwartz Value Fund:                        

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Schwartz
Value Fund (the "Fund"), including the schedule of investments, as of December
31, 2001, and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the  
statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then
ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period    
then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are the         
responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an    
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our     
audits.                                                                         

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and       
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial    
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit 
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and        
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of December 31, 2001, by correspondence with the Fund's     
custodian and brokers. An audit also includes assessing the accounting          
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as        
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our    
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                              

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to   
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of       
Schwartz Value Fund as of December 31, 2001, the results of its operations for  
the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in 
the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years  
in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally    
accepted in the United States of America.

INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY                                                           

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Schwartz Value Fund ("SVF") seeks long-term capital appreciation through value  
investing -- purchasing shares of strong, growing companies at reasonable       
prices. Because small and medium size companies offer vast reward opportunities,
fundamental analysis is used to identify emerging companies with outstanding    
business characteristics. Sometimes the best values are issues not followed by  
Wall Street analysts.                                                           

Most value investors buy fair companies at an excellent price. SVF attempts to  
buy excellent companies at a fair price. The essence of value investing is      
finding companies with great business characteristics which by their nature,    
offer a margin of safety. A truly fine business requires few assets to provide a
consistently expanding stream of income. SVF also purchases shares which are    
temporarily out-of-favor and selling below intrinsic value.                     

A common thread in SVF investments is that the market price is below what a     
corporate or entrepreneurial buyer might be willing to pay for the entire       
business. The auction nature and the inefficiencies of the stock market are such
that SVF can often buy a minority interest in a fine company at a small fraction
of the price per share necessary to acquire the entire company.

Dear Shareholder:                                                               

At first glance, 2001 may not appear to have been an ideal time to launch a new 
mutual fund. After all, the year brought an economic recession, an unprecedented
terrorist assault on the U.S. homeland, and the greatest drop in corporate      
profits since the Great Depression. In fact, given all those impediments, it is 
somewhat surprising the stock market showed only an 11.9% decline for the year, 
as measured by the S&P 500 Stock Index. As always, however, adversity creates   
opportunity and the Ave Maria Catholic Values Fund was able to capitalize on    
enough of those opportunities to generate a positive return in a negative year  
for the market.                                                                 

The Fund closed out 2001 with a net asset value per share of $10.50, which,     
along with a year-end distribution of $.03 a share, gave shareholders a 5.3%    
return since the Fund's inception date of May 1, 2001. In contrast, the S&P 500 
Stock Index produced a 8.5% decline over the same period. The spread between the
Fund's return and the market's at year-end, 1380 basis points or 13.8%, was the 
widest since the Fund's inception.                                              

Such strong relative returns, especially over short time periods, do not come   
without a little luck, which, of course, we always welcome. But luck alone is   
never enough; the market is not a roulette wheel. There are rules prudent       
investors need to adhere to if they want to maximize their opportunities for    
sustainable long-term gains: diversification, attention to fundamental trends   
and commitment to a valuation discipline. We have dedicated ourselves to these  
rules in the management of the Ave Maria Catholic Values Fund, as well as to the
core Catholic values that underpin all our efforts, and are pleased that        
investment returns have thus far been rewarding to shareholders.                

Sincerely,

AVE MARIA CATHOLIC VALUES FUND

AVE MARIA CATHOLIC VALUES FUND                                                  
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
DECEMBER 31, 2001 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                              

Ave Maria Catholic Values Fund (the Fund) is a series of Schwartz Investment    
Trust, a diversified open-end management investment company established as an   
Ohio Business Trust under a Declaration of Trust dated August 31, 1992. The Fund
is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and commenced operations 
on May 1, 2001. The Fund determines and makes available for publication the net 
asset value of its shares on a daily basis.                                     

The investment objective of the Fund is to seek long-term capital appreciation  
from equity investments in companies that operate in a way that is consistent   
with the core values and teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. See the        
Prospectus for more detailed information regarding the investment strategies of 
the Fund.                                                                       

Shares of the Fund are sold at net asset value. To calculate the net asset      
value, the Fund's assets are valued and totaled, liabilities are subtracted, and
the balance is divided by the number of shares outstanding. The offering price  
and redemption price per share is equal to the net asset value per share, except
that shares of the Fund are subject to a 1% contingent deferred sales load if   
redeemed within one year of their purchase.                                     

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the   
Fund:                                                                           

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS -- Securities which are traded on stock  
     exchanges are valued at the last reported sale price as of the close of the
  regular session of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the day the
    securities are being valued, or, if not traded on a particular day, at the
   closing bid price. Securities that are quoted by NASDAQ are valued at the
 last reported sale price, or, if not traded on a particular day, at the
mean between the closing bid and asked prices as reported by NASDAQ.  
    Securities traded in the over-the-counter market, and which are not quoted
     by NASDAQ, are valued at the average of the highest current independent bid
    and lowest current independent offer as of the close of trading on the day
     of valuation. Securities (and other assets) for which market quotations are
    not readily available are valued at their fair value as determined in good
     faith in accordance with consistently applied procedures established by and
under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees.

     (b) INCOME TAXES -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements
   of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies
 and to distribute substantially all taxable income to the shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for income or excise taxes is necessary.      

    The Fund files a tax return annually using tax accounting methods required
   under provisions of the Code, which may differ from accounting principles
 generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), the basis on
which these financial statements are prepared. The differences arise  
primarily from the deferral of certain losses under Federal income tax
   regulations. Accordingly, the amount of net investment income or loss and
    net realized capital gain or loss reported in the financial statements may
   differ from that reported in the Fund's tax return and, consequently, the
  character of distributions to shareholders reported in the statements of
changes and financial highlights may differ from that reported to     
  shareholders for Federal income tax purposes. Distributions which exceed
net realized gains for financial reporting purposes but not for tax   
purposes, if any, are shown as distributions in excess of net realized
gains in the accompanying statements.                                 

  (c) SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME -- Security transactions
 are accounted for on the trade date. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. 
  Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis.                                                

     (d) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS -- Dividends from net investment income and
net capital gains, if any, are declared and paid annually in December.
     Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
date.                                                                 

    (e) REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS -- The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements
 (agreements to purchase securities subject to the seller's agreement to
repurchase them at a specified time and price) with well-established  
registered securities dealers or banks. Repurchase agreements are the 
     equivalent of loans by the Fund. The Fund's policy is to take possession of
the underlying securities and, on a daily basis, mark to market such  
securities to ensure that the value, including accrued interest, is at
 least equal to the amount to be repaid to the Fund under the agreement.

     (f) ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
 reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES          

The President of the Fund is also the President and Chief Investment Officer of 
Schwartz Investment Counsel, Inc. (the Adviser). The Chairman of the Board of   
the Fund is also the Chairman of Gregory J. Schwartz & Co., Inc. (the           
Distributor). Certain other trustees and officers of the Fund are officers of   
the Adviser or of Ultimus Fund Solutions, LLC (Ultimus), the administrative,    
accounting and transfer agent for the Fund.                                     

Pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement between the Fund and the Adviser,  
the Adviser is responsible for the management of the Fund and provides          
investment advice along with the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and 
certain other services necessary to the operations of the Fund. For such        
services, the Fund pays the Adviser a quarterly fee equal to the annual rate of 
1.0% of the average daily net assets. The Adviser has contractually agreed to   
waive a portion of its advisory fees or to reimburse the Fund's operating       
expenses to the extent necessary so that the Fund's ordinary operating expenses 
do not exceed an amount equal to 1.5% annually of its average net assets. For   
the period ended December 31, 2001, the total of such waivers was $57,270. Any  
fee waivers or expense reimbursements by the Adviser are subject to repayment by
the Fund for a period of three years from the end of the fiscal year during     
which such waivers or reimbursements occurred, provided the Fund is able to     
effect such repayment and remain in compliance with the undertaking by the      
Adviser to limit expenses of the Fund.                                          

The Distributor is the primary agent for the distribution of the Fund and       
receives fees from the Adviser, not the Fund or its shareholders.               

The Fund has adopted a Shareholder Servicing Plan (the Plan), which allows the  
Fund to make payments to financial organizations for providing account          
administration and personal and account maintenance services to Fund            
shareholders. The annual service fee may not exceed .25% of the Fund's daily net
assets. For the period ended December 31, 2001, the total expenses incurred     
related to this plan were $1,000.                                               

Pursuant to a Mutual Fund Services Agreement between the Fund and Ultimus,      
Ultimus supplies regulatory and compliance services, calculates the daily net   
asset value per share, maintains the financial books and records of the Fund,   
maintains the records of each shareholder's account, and processes purchases and
redemptions of the Fund's shares. For the performance of these services, the    
Fund pays Ultimus a fee, payable monthly, at an annual rate of .15% of the      
average daily net assets, subject to a minimum monthly fee of $4,000.

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS                                                      

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments other   
than short-term investments, for the period ended December 31, 2001, were       
$25,777,299 and $4,147,669, respectively.                                       

4. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES                                                         

As of December 31, 2001, net unrealized appreciation of securities was          
$1,010,034 for federal income tax purposes of which $1,605,914 related to       
appreciated securities and $595,880 related to depreciated securities. The      
aggregate cost of investments at December 31, 2001 for federal income tax       
purposes was $23,650,099. The difference between the federal income tax cost of 
portfolio investments and the financial statement cost is due to certain timing 
differences in the recognition of capital losses under income tax regulations   
and GAAP.                                                                       

5. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS (UNAUDITED)                         

On December 31, 2001, the Fund declared and paid a short-term capital gain of   
$0.0131 per share. In January 2002, shareholders will be provided with Form     
1099-DIV which reports the amount per share and tax status of the capital gain  
distribution during the calendar year 2001.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT                                                    

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Shareholders and Trustees of Ave Maria Catholic Values Fund:             

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of the Ave 
Maria Catholic Values Fund (the "Fund"), including the schedule of investments, 
as of December 31, 2001, and the related statements of operations, of changes in
net assets, and the financial highlights for the period from May 1, 2001 (Fund  
inception) through December 31, 2001. These financial statements and financial  
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility  
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights 
based on our audit.                                                             

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted 
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and       
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial    
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit 
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and        
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of December 31, 2001, by correspondence with the Fund's     
custodian and brokers. An audit also includes assessing the accounting          
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as        
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our    
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.                              

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to   
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ave   
Maria Catholic Values Fund as of December 31, 2001, the results of its          
operations, the changes in its net assets, and the financial highlights for the 
period from May 1, 2001 (Fund inception) through December 31, 2001, in          
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

Investing With Us
Through a variety of investment products we strive to help others to reach their investment objectives.  These range from mutual funds geared to individual investors to separately managed accounts aimed at institutional investors.
No matter the size of the account, we maintain a disciplined investment philosophy, with the objective of producing a positive, long-term experience for all of our shareholders.
In selecting individual stocks, special emphasis is placed on identifying companies with superior business characteristics and managerial integrity. Price alone cannot compensate for an absence of these qualities. In purchasing equities, we attempt to identify the price at which the market will value the shares three years hence. Because our firm is small, we are not limited to investing in large capitalization companies. We have deployed substantial experience in evaluating small- and mid-cap stocks with the value approach. We buy shares of financially powerful companies when they are out-of-favor and attractively priced, and sell them when they no longer meet our standards. This contrarian discipline reduces the risk of loss while enhancing returns. This approach to value investing has produced very good risk-adjusted returns for clients. We do not worship at the altar of relative performance, but instead strive for attractive absolute returns with low risk. Modest risk incurred is a very important ingredient in the formula. Some managers achieve higher returns, but subject their clients’ assets to significantly greater risks.
Fixed-income securities are often utilized for their defensive characteristics which include predictable income flow and relative principal stability. Based on low historical correlations, fixed income securities may provide a hedge in periods when the stock market performs poorly.  The Firm actively manages high-grade fixed-income portfolios with an emphasis on intermediate and shorter durations.  We also employ sector, credit, and yield curve analysis designed to benefit portfolios from rate shifts and spread changes without resorting to excessive swapping to capture tiny price fluctuations.  Quality is paramount in our selection process and we avoid junk bonds, mortgages and derivatives.
 
 
 
 
 



We offer a diverse menu of investment options including domestic and international equities as well as fixed income securities.


Demonstrated investment management expertise across market capitalizations.


“You only have to know two things about investing: Number 1 — don’t lose money.  And number 2 — don’t forget Number 1.”
— Warren Buffett

Investing With Us
Through a variety of investment products we strive to help others to reach their investment objectives.  These range from mutual funds geared to individual investors to separately managed accounts aimed at institutional investors.
No matter the size of the account, we maintain a disciplined investment philosophy, with the objective of producing a positive, long-term experience for all of our shareholders.
In selecting individual stocks, special emphasis is placed on identifying companies with superior business characteristics and managerial integrity. Price alone cannot compensate for an absence of these qualities. In purchasing equities, we attempt to identify the price at which the market will value the shares three years hence. Because our firm is small, we are not limited to investing in large capitalization companies. We have deployed substantial experience in evaluating small- and mid-cap stocks with the value approach. We buy shares of financially powerful companies when they are out-of-favor and attractively priced, and sell them when they no longer meet our standards. This contrarian discipline reduces the risk of loss while enhancing returns. This approach to value investing has produced very good risk-adjusted returns for clients. We do not worship at the altar of relative performance, but instead strive for attractive absolute returns with low risk. Modest risk incurred is a very important ingredient in the formula. Some managers achieve higher returns, but subject their clients’ assets to significantly greater risks.
Fixed-income securities are often utilized for their defensive characteristics which include predictable income flow and relative principal stability. Based on low historical correlations, fixed income securities may provide a hedge in periods when the stock market performs poorly.  The Firm actively manages high-grade fixed-income portfolios with an emphasis on intermediate and shorter durations.  We also employ sector, credit, and yield curve analysis designed to benefit portfolios from rate shifts and spread changes without resorting to excessive swapping to capture tiny price fluctuations.  Quality is paramount in our selection process and we avoid junk bonds, mortgages and derivatives.
 
 
 
 
 



We offer a diverse menu of investment options including domestic and international equities as well as fixed income securities.


Demonstrated investment management expertise across market capitalizations.


“You only have to know two things about investing: Number 1 — don’t lose money.  And number 2 — don’t forget Number 1.”

Schwartz Value Focused Fund
Schwartz Value Focused Fund (“SVF”) is a mutual fund which seeks long-term capital appreciation through value investing – purchasing shares of strong, growing companies at reasonable prices.
Because small and medium size companies offer vast reward opportunities, fundamental analysis is used to identify emerging companies with outstanding business characteristics. Sometimes the best values are issues not followed by Wall Street analysts. Most value investors attempt to buy fair companies at an excellent price. SVF attempts to buy excellent companies at a fair price. The essence of value investing is finding companies with great business characteristics which by their nature, offer a margin of safety. A truly fine business requires few assets to produce a consistently expanding stream of income. SVF also purchases shares which are temporarily out-of-favor and selling below intrinsic value.
A common thread in SVF investments is that the market price is below what a corporate or entrepreneurial buyer might be willing to pay for the entire business. The auction nature and the inefficiencies of the stock market are such that SVF can often buy a minority interest in a fine company at a small fraction of the price per share necessary to acquire the entire company.
 
Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Mutual Fund investing involves risk, principal loss is possible. The Fund’s investments in small- and mid- capitalization companies could experience greater volatility than investments in large-capitalization companies.
Prospective investors should read the prospectus carefully and consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus, which can be obtained by calling 1-800-449-9240 or online at www.schwartzvaluefocusedfund.com, contains this and other important information.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
