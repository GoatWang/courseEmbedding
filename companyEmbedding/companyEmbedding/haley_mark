Rubs me the wrong way


 Pros 

 Pretty
 Shiny patent leather
 Fits well
 Toes mostly not visible



 Cons 

Openings in front too large
Rubs foot



 Best Uses 

 To match with an outfit
 Dress up for summer



 Comments about Haley
 Pretty and usable but it rubs. I have to wear bandaids with it.  My little toe still hasn't recovered after a week.  It's because it's very stiff.  Also the spaces in front are too large and you can see part of the toes.

 I am sorry to say I am unhappy with the shoes.  I think the elastic should hold up longer than  pulling out the third time I tried to wear the shoes.
