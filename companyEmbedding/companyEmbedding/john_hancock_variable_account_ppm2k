Inside Life Insurance



Term Life Insurance
Universal Life Insurance
Variable Life Insurance





Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance provides guaranteed coverage for a specified time. John Hancock's term life insurance product and optional riders are an affordable way to prevent financial hardship should you die suddenly or be diagnosed with a terminal illness. With John Hancock's term you can take advantage of:

Guaranteed level premiums for 10, 15, or 20 years
Guaranteed conversion option to John Hancock's permanent products
Guaranteed level death benefit



Universal Life Insurance
John Hancock's universal life insurance is permanent insurance that offers customizable and flexible solutions to meet your financial objectives. 
Whether you're looking for guaranteed death benefit protection, low-cost coverage or strong cash value growth potential, our universal life products offer a wide variety of features and riders that are ideal for addressing these needs.


Variable Life Insurance
John Hancock's competitive variable universal life policies can give you the protection and guarantees you need to feel secure in uncertain times, plus the cash value growth potential and flexibility you need to meet your long-term financial goals. 
Your premiums are invested in underlying investment options that have the potential to accumulate cash value—tax-deferred. Variable universal life offers protection for your family's financial well-being as well as a potential source of supplemental retirement income for you.

Variable universal life insurance has annual fees and expenses associated with it in addition to life insurance related charges (which differ with the product chosen), including surrender charges and investment management fees. Variable universal life insurance products are long-term contracts and are sold by prospectus. They are subject to market risk due to the underlying sub-accounts, and are unsuitable as a short term savings vehicle. The primary purpose of variable universal life insurance is to provide lifetime protection against economic loss due to the death of the insured person. Cash values are not guaranteed if the client is invested in the investment accounts. There are risks associated with each investment option, and the policy may lose value.

Why Do You Need Life Insurance?



Life insurance can be one of the most important purchases you will make. You want your family or business to be financially secure, to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and even leave a legacy for your children and grandchildren. No matter what your goals are, the unique tax benefits and features of life insurance can help you to achieve them. 


Types of Life Insurance
Choosing the right type of life insurance depends on your circumstances and financial goals. Life insurance policies are designed to pay a death benefit when someone dies, but there are usually two basic categories to meet your different needs - term and permanent. 
Term life insurance in general, provides death benefit protection for a specific period of time.
Permanent life insurance offers lifetime death benefit protection with a cash value component. This can mean lifetime peace of mind for you and your family.
Different types of permanent life insurance are usually categorized as follows: Universal Life Insurance, Indexed Universal Life Insurance, and Variable Universal Life Insurance. To find out what life insurance solution best meets your needs, visit JohnHancockInsurance.com.



















We believe that life insurance should reward you for healthy living. That's why we introduced life insurance with the John Hancock Vitality Program. It's an innovative solution that gives you the protection you need, along with premium savings up to 15% and rewards from national brands for the everyday things you do to stay healthy, like exercising, walking, and eating well.
