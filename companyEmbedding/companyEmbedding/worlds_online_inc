    				Worlds is the pioneering platform in 3D virtual communities and rich immersive environments. 
                    Launching in 1994, Worlds leverages its patented proprietary technology in partnership with 
                    brand leaders in specific market segments to offer members multi-user environments that have 
                    interactive Avatars, rich media graphics, text chat, voice-to-voice chat, video and e-commerce.

    				The 3D communities allow visitors to interact with each other, teleport throughout the Worlds 
                    environment as well as participate in shared experiences. Besides partnering with existing 
                    content providers that have strong brands and an existing following, Worlds also encourages 
                    individuals to create their own virtual spaces, communities and unique Avatars with easy-to-use 
                    tools. Worlds was and remains true “social networking” well before the term became 
                    mainstream.

Serious Performance. 
Bill Mitchell Products (BMP) has manufactured top-of-the line aluminum engine blocks, cast iron engine blocks and other automotive racing products since 1982. Bill Mitchell Products engine blocks include the Chevy small block, Chevy big block, Chevy 409, Mopar big block engine and other racing products including single plane manifolds. It's worth noting that the manifolds manufactured by Bill Mitchell Products are proven to produce up to 15-25 more horsepower than the competition in larger displacement engines. The single plane manifolds are designed to operate more efficiently in the 2500-7500 RPM range, yet have the low-end throttle response and torque comparable to dual plane.
Two generations of hands-on racing experience goes into every engine block and every intake manifold designed and manufactured in Bill Mitchell Products’ Florida facility. Bill Mitchell engines meet the high performance standards that car enthusiasts and racers demand today. Quality is job one at Bill Mitchell Products.
