Education and military service[edit]
Leiter grew up in Englewood, New Jersey, where he attended Dwight-Englewood School, from which he graduated in 1987.[6] He received his B.A. from Columbia University in 1991. From 1991 until 1997, he served as a Naval Flight Officer and crewmember aboard EA-6B Prowlers in the U.S. Navy, participating in U.S., NATO, and UN operations in the former Yugoslavia and Iraq. He then earned his J.D. from Harvard Law School, where he graduated magna cum laude in 2000 and was the 113th President of the Harvard Law Review.[7] Leiter also served as a Harvard Law School human rights fellow with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
Career[edit]
After law school, Leiter served as a law clerk to Associate Justice Stephen Breyer of the Supreme Court of the United States, and to Chief Judge Michael Boudin of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.
From 2002 until 2005, he served with the Department of Justice as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. At the Justice Department, Leiter prosecuted a wide variety of federal crimes, including narcotics offenses, organized crime and racketeering, capital murder, and money laundering.
Leiter then served as the Deputy General Counsel and Assistant Director of the President's Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction (the "Robb-Silberman Commission"). While with the Robb-Silberman Commission, Leiter focused on reforms of the U.S. Intelligence Community, in particular the development of what is now the National Security Branch of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Immediately prior to joining NCTC, Leiter served as the Deputy Chief of Staff for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). In this role, Mr. Leiter assisted in the establishment of the ODNI and coordinated all internal and external operations for the ODNI, to include relationships with the White House, the Departments of Defense, State, Justice, and Homeland Security, the Central Intelligence Agency, and Congress. He was also involved in the development of national intelligence centers, including NCTC and the National Counterproliferation Center, and their integration into the larger Intelligence Community. In addition, he served as an intelligence and policy advisor to the Director of National Intelligence and his Principal Deputy.
He became director of the NCTC in 2007, and was asked to stay on by the Obama administration in 2009. On June 9, 2011, President Obama praised and thanked Mike Leiter in a statement regarding his resignation; “Serving in two Administrations since 2007, Mike led the National Counterterrorism Center with dedication and unwavering determination during challenging and demanding times and our nation is grateful for his many contributions to our safety and security. Mike has been a trusted advisor to me and to the entire national security team, providing us with an in-depth understanding of terrorist activities that affect our Nation’s security. I am confident that Mike will be leaving the National Counterterrorism Center, the counterterrorism community, and the nation in a significantly stronger position to confront the terrorist threats we face.”[3]
Following his departure from the NCTC in 2011, Leiter joined the data analysis software firm Palantir Technologies as senior counselor to CEO Alex Karp. His role was stated to be to develop and optimize market strategy, business practices and internal operations.[8] Leiter also became a counterterrorism, cybersecurity and national security analyst for NBC News shortly thereafter.[9] Since becoming a part of Palantir Leiter has continued to publicly speak and participate in forums for discussion of national security and counterterrorism.[10][11][12]
Leiter joined Leidos as executive vice president for business development and strategy in November 2014.[13] He currently serves as the Executive Vice President and Head of Integration at Leidos and reports to the Chief Executive Officer.[14] In this role, he is responsible for leading the integration management team that is responsible for all planning activities associated with the transaction to combine Leidos and Lockheed Martin’s Information Systems and Global Solutions (IS&GS) business. The merger is expected to close in late 2016.[14] Leiter rose to president of the Leidos defense group before leaving the company in January 2017.[15]
Controversy[edit]
Under Leiter's service, the NCTC was publicly criticized for failing to identify the threat posed by a known extremist, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who on Christmas Day 2009 succeeded in boarding a Delta airplane in Amsterdam rigged with an explosive device that failed to detonate over Detroit, Michigan. Abdulmutallab was wrestled down by a passenger amidst a smokey fire which put an end to the incident.
In an article printed by The New York Times on December 31, 2009,[16] the agency, which was stood up specifically to coordinate counterterrorism information, was said to have failed to accomplish its mission, even where several valid leads were available and known among multiple intelligence agencies, including information directly communicated to the CIA by the Abdulmatallab's father who feared his son had been radicalized. Though Michael Leiter was not himself mentioned, the New York Times piece described the NCTC as the weak link in the series of significant intelligence operations.[16]
On January 2, 2010, Leiter issued the following statement. "The failed attempt to destroy Northwest Flight 253 is the starkest of reminders of the insidious terrorist threats we face. While this attempt ended in failure we know with absolute certainty that Al-Qaeda and those who support its ideology continue to refine their methods to test our defenses and pursue an attack on the Homeland. Our most sacred responsibility is to be focused on our mission—detecting and preventing terrorist attacks from happening on our soil and against U.S. interests. The American people expect and deserve nothing less."
James Gordon Meek of the New York Daily News issued a story on January 7 stating that Leiter remained on a ski holiday until "several days after Christmas" quoting two U.S. Officials. The article reported that "people have been grumbling that he didn't let a little terrorism interrupt his vacation". On balance, it was stated that "Leiter has long been well-regarded" and "President Obama, himself, stayed in Hawaii [on vacation] until January 4". There was no reference to Leiter conducting investigation or evaluation from his remote, vacation site.[17]
The Daily News story by Meek was inaccurate and was updated in the Daily News the next day, ABC news Senior White House Correspondent Jake Tapper reported that Leiter was indeed at his post at the NCTC during the events of December 25, 2009. In the report, Denis McDonough, National Security Staff Chief of Staff, said that “Leiter was -- throughout the events of December 25, 2009 -- indeed at the National Counterterrorism Center in McLean, Virginia, and intimately involved in all aspects of the nation’s response to the attempted terrorist attack -- to include coordinating intelligence, examining terrorist watch-listing, and briefing Members of Congress.” He Continued, "Director Leiter engaged in regular, repeated, and extended classified discussions with the White House, the President’s National Security Staff located in Hawaii, the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of Homeland Security, various members of Congress and their staffs, and of course the National Counterterrorism Center.”[18]

On January 2, 2010, Leiter issued the following statement. "The failed attempt to destroy Northwest Flight 253 is the starkest of reminders of the insidious terrorist threats we face. While this attempt ended in failure we know with absolute certainty that Al-Qaeda and those who support its ideology continue to refine their methods to test our defenses and pursue an attack on the Homeland. Our most sacred responsibility is to be focused on our mission—detecting and preventing terrorist attacks from happening on our soil and against U.S. interests. The American people expect and deserve nothing less."
James Gordon Meek of the New York Daily News issued a story on January 7 stating that Leiter remained on a ski holiday until "several days after Christmas" quoting two U.S. Officials. The article reported that "people have been grumbling that he didn't let a little terrorism interrupt his vacation". On balance, it was stated that "Leiter has long been well-regarded" and "President Obama, himself, stayed in Hawaii [on vacation] until January 4". There was no reference to Leiter conducting investigation or evaluation from his remote, vacation site.[17]
The Daily News story by Meek was inaccurate and was updated in the Daily News the next day, ABC news Senior White House Correspondent Jake Tapper reported that Leiter was indeed at his post at the NCTC during the events of December 25, 2009. In the report, Denis McDonough, National Security Staff Chief of Staff, said that “Leiter was -- throughout the events of December 25, 2009 -- indeed at the National Counterterrorism Center in McLean, Virginia, and intimately involved in all aspects of the nation’s response to the attempted terrorist attack -- to include coordinating intelligence, examining terrorist watch-listing, and briefing Members of Congress.” He Continued, "Director Leiter engaged in regular, repeated, and extended classified discussions with the White House, the President’s National Security Staff located in Hawaii, the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of Homeland Security, various members of Congress and their staffs, and of course the National Counterterrorism Center.”[18]

Education and military service[edit]
Leiter grew up in Englewood, New Jersey, where he attended Dwight-Englewood School, from which he graduated in 1987.[6] He received his B.A. from Columbia University in 1991. From 1991 until 1997, he served as a Naval Flight Officer and crewmember aboard EA-6B Prowlers in the U.S. Navy, participating in U.S., NATO, and UN operations in the former Yugoslavia and Iraq. He then earned his J.D. from Harvard Law School, where he graduated magna cum laude in 2000 and was the 113th President of the Harvard Law Review.[7] Leiter also served as a Harvard Law School human rights fellow with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
Career[edit]
After law school, Leiter served as a law clerk to Associate Justice Stephen Breyer of the Supreme Court of the United States, and to Chief Judge Michael Boudin of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.
From 2002 until 2005, he served with the Department of Justice as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. At the Justice Department, Leiter prosecuted a wide variety of federal crimes, including narcotics offenses, organized crime and racketeering, capital murder, and money laundering.
Leiter then served as the Deputy General Counsel and Assistant Director of the President's Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction (the "Robb-Silberman Commission"). While with the Robb-Silberman Commission, Leiter focused on reforms of the U.S. Intelligence Community, in particular the development of what is now the National Security Branch of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Immediately prior to joining NCTC, Leiter served as the Deputy Chief of Staff for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). In this role, Mr. Leiter assisted in the establishment of the ODNI and coordinated all internal and external operations for the ODNI, to include relationships with the White House, the Departments of Defense, State, Justice, and Homeland Security, the Central Intelligence Agency, and Congress. He was also involved in the development of national intelligence centers, including NCTC and the National Counterproliferation Center, and their integration into the larger Intelligence Community. In addition, he served as an intelligence and policy advisor to the Director of National Intelligence and his Principal Deputy.
He became director of the NCTC in 2007, and was asked to stay on by the Obama administration in 2009. On June 9, 2011, President Obama praised and thanked Mike Leiter in a statement regarding his resignation; “Serving in two Administrations since 2007, Mike led the National Counterterrorism Center with dedication and unwavering determination during challenging and demanding times and our nation is grateful for his many contributions to our safety and security. Mike has been a trusted advisor to me and to the entire national security team, providing us with an in-depth understanding of terrorist activities that affect our Nation’s security. I am confident that Mike will be leaving the National Counterterrorism Center, the counterterrorism community, and the nation in a significantly stronger position to confront the terrorist threats we face.”[3]
Following his departure from the NCTC in 2011, Leiter joined the data analysis software firm Palantir Technologies as senior counselor to CEO Alex Karp. His role was stated to be to develop and optimize market strategy, business practices and internal operations.[8] Leiter also became a counterterrorism, cybersecurity and national security analyst for NBC News shortly thereafter.[9] Since becoming a part of Palantir Leiter has continued to publicly speak and participate in forums for discussion of national security and counterterrorism.[10][11][12]
Leiter joined Leidos as executive vice president for business development and strategy in November 2014.[13] He currently serves as the Executive Vice President and Head of Integration at Leidos and reports to the Chief Executive Officer.[14] In this role, he is responsible for leading the integration management team that is responsible for all planning activities associated with the transaction to combine Leidos and Lockheed Martin’s Information Systems and Global Solutions (IS&GS) business. The merger is expected to close in late 2016.[14] Leiter rose to president of the Leidos defense group before leaving the company in January 2017.[15]
Controversy[edit]
Under Leiter's service, the NCTC was publicly criticized for failing to identify the threat posed by a known extremist, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who on Christmas Day 2009 succeeded in boarding a Delta airplane in Amsterdam rigged with an explosive device that failed to detonate over Detroit, Michigan. Abdulmutallab was wrestled down by a passenger amidst a smokey fire which put an end to the incident.
In an article printed by The New York Times on December 31, 2009,[16] the agency, which was stood up specifically to coordinate counterterrorism information, was said to have failed to accomplish its mission, even where several valid leads were available and known among multiple intelligence agencies, including information directly communicated to the CIA by the Abdulmatallab's father who feared his son had been radicalized. Though Michael Leiter was not himself mentioned, the New York Times piece described the NCTC as the weak link in the series of significant intelligence operations.[16]
On January 2, 2010, Leiter issued the following statement. "The failed attempt to destroy Northwest Flight 253 is the starkest of reminders of the insidious terrorist threats we face. While this attempt ended in failure we know with absolute certainty that Al-Qaeda and those who support its ideology continue to refine their methods to test our defenses and pursue an attack on the Homeland. Our most sacred responsibility is to be focused on our mission—detecting and preventing terrorist attacks from happening on our soil and against U.S. interests. The American people expect and deserve nothing less."
James Gordon Meek of the New York Daily News issued a story on January 7 stating that Leiter remained on a ski holiday until "several days after Christmas" quoting two U.S. Officials. The article reported that "people have been grumbling that he didn't let a little terrorism interrupt his vacation". On balance, it was stated that "Leiter has long been well-regarded" and "President Obama, himself, stayed in Hawaii [on vacation] until January 4". There was no reference to Leiter conducting investigation or evaluation from his remote, vacation site.[17]
The Daily News story by Meek was inaccurate and was updated in the Daily News the next day, ABC news Senior White House Correspondent Jake Tapper reported that Leiter was indeed at his post at the NCTC during the events of December 25, 2009.

Director of National Counterterrorism Center Is Resigning

By ERIC SCHMITTJUNE 9, 2011

WASHINGTON — Michael E. Leiter, the head of the nation’s main counterterrorism center, is resigning after nearly four years in a job that has increasingly focused on detecting and thwarting smaller and more diverse terrorist plots.Mr. Leiter, 42, one of the few senior national security officials from the Bush administration that President Obama kept on, will leave on July 8, roughly when the White House is expected to release an updated counterterrorism strategy that Mr. Leiter contributed to, administration officials said.Friends and colleagues said Mr. Leiter’s departure was expected, as his tenure coincided with one of the most demanding periods after the Sept. 11 attacks. Even as Al Qaeda’s leadership in Pakistan came under increasing pressure, culminating in the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, Qaeda affiliates blossomed in Yemen and North Africa, and American officials warned of a threat from homegrown terrorists here.In a telephone interview on Thursday, Mr. Leiter, who is newly remarried, said he was stepping down for personal reasons and to allow his successor to “bring fresh eyes to the problems we face.” He has not yet decided on his next job, he said.

As director of the National Counterterrorism Center, which was created in 2004, Mr. Leiter oversees 1,000 specialists from more than a dozen federal agencies who form the central clearinghouse and analytical hub for intelligence on terrorist threats. Continue reading the main story

“Mike has been a trusted adviser to me and to the entire national security team, providing us with an in-depth understanding of terrorist activities that affect our nation’s security,” Mr. Obama said Thursday in a statement.

Andy Liepman, Mr. Leiter’s deputy, will serve as acting director until Mr. Obama appoints a successor, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, said in a statement.Brash and politically savvy, Mr. Leiter has broad bipartisan support in Congress, as well as in national security and intelligence circles. “He’s plain-, even blunt-spoken, well prepared and apolitical,” said Michael V. Hayden, who directed the C.I.A. in the second Bush term. “He knows his brief, and he sticks to it.”Advocates credit Mr. Leiter, a former federal prosecutor who joined the center in 2007 as the deputy and was directing it by later that year, with instilling the agency with strong leadership and organization.

But Mr. Leiter has not been immune from criticism. The center and other intelligence agencies were sharply criticized as having missed clear warning signs that a 23-year-old Nigerian man was said to be plotting to blow up a Detroit-bound commercial airliner on Dec. 25, 2009. In response to the plot, Mr. Leiter created new teams of specialists to pursue clues of emerging terrorist plots.His background positioned him well for his current job.He graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he was president of the Law Review. He spent six years in the Navy between college and law school, flying radar-jamming planes over Bosnia and Iraq. After his military stint, Mr. Leiter was a clerk at the Supreme Court for Justice Stephen Breyer.Mr. Leiter went on to become a lawyer for the International Criminal Tribunal at The Hague, playing a central role in bringing Bosnian war criminals to justice.More recently, Mr. Leiter has warned of the morphing terrorist threat, saying in December that "stopping all attacks has become that much harder.”On Thursday, he said, “We’ll do more to defeat the enemy by not overreacting to the inevitable act of terrorism.”

Leidos Names Michael E. Leiter Executive Vice President For Business Development And Strategy

Nov 04, 2014, 07:00 ET
		  		  						
						 from   Leidos Holdings, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


RESTON, Va., Nov. 4, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Leidos Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:   LDOS) today announced the appointment of Michael E. Leiter as executive vice president for business development and strategy, effective November 17, 2014. 
In his new role, Leiter is responsible for business development, strategy development and execution, communications, government affairs, and mergers and acquisition activities. He will work out of the company's headquarters in Reston, Va.
Leiter most recently worked for the data analysis software firm Palantir Technologies as counselor to the CEO. In that role he developed and optimized market strategy, business practices and internal operations, as well as managing Palantir's engagement with governments and commercial cyber clients. He previously served as director of the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). He was nominated by President George W. Bush and sworn in to this role on June 12, 2008, after serving as the acting director since November 2007. He was one of the few national security officials asked to continue in his role by President Barack Obama in 2009. He continued to serve in this capacity until July 2011. 
"We're excited to welcome Michael to the Leidos team. He brings an impressive background and strong track record of strategic, operational and industry expertise to Leidos. He will add significant leadership bench strength to our management team and will help our business development efforts build momentum moving forward," said Leidos CEO Roger Krone. "He has demonstrated his ability to develop and lead critical organizations in both the government, intelligence and commercial spaces – his in depth industry knowledge and passion for the work that we do will help us continue to increase our strategic focus, and ultimately better serve our customers."
During his time as director of the NCTC, Leiter led the primary organization in the U.S. government for analysis and integration of all terrorism intelligence—both domestically and overseas. He reported directly to the President in conducting strategic operational planning for U.S. Government-wide counterterrorism activities, to include the integration of U.S. military, intelligence, diplomatic, financial, and homeland security counterterrorism efforts. Leiter led more than 1,000 employees and managed an annual budget of more than $400 million in this role, while at the same time advising the Office of Management and Budget on the allocation of more than $100 billion annually for government-wide counterterrorism activities.
Before joining NCTC, Leiter served as the deputy chief of Staff for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). He was also involved in the development of national intelligence centers, including NCTC and the National Counterproliferation Center, and their integration into the larger Intelligence Community.
"I couldn't be happier to join the Leidos team and I look forward to working with the operating groups to develop and execute strategies to accelerate the growth of the business. Leidos offers unparalleled opportunities for business success as we tackle some of the toughest challenges facing our nation and world – from health care and energy to national security," said Leiter.   
Prior to his service with the ODNI, Leiter served as the deputy general counsel and assistant director of the President's Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction (the "Robb-Silberman Commission"). From 2002 until 2005, he served with the Department of Justice as an assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, where he prosecuted a variety of crimes, including narcotics offenses, organized crime and racketeering, capital murder and money laundering. Immediately prior to his Justice Department service, he served as a law clerk to Associate Justice Stephen G. Breyer of the Supreme Court of the United States and to Chief Judge Michael Boudin of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.
Leiter also served as a U.S. Naval Flight Officer from 1991-1997, flying EA-6B Prowlers, and participating in U.S., NATO and UN operations in the former Yugoslavia and Iraq. He received a J.D. from Harvard, where he was president of The Harvard Law Review, and a B.A. from Columbia.
