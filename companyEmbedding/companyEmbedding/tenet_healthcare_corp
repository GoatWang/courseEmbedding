Our Job Application Process



Our website uses a secure job application and tracking program used widely among major companies. When you click to apply for a job you’re interested in, you’ll be asked to input pertinent information about your career experience and qualifications.
Please be aware of ongoing, online employment scams targeting job seekers for payment and personal information. Many companies, including Tenet, have been affected by scams that use our company name and the names of real employees, along with similar email addresses or websites, to primarily promote fake remote or work-from-home opportunities. If you have been affected by such a scam, we recommend reporting it promptly to such law enforcement authorities as the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center.
As we continue to monitor for fraudulent activity, please follow the guidelines below regarding Tenet's job application process.  

All authorized job openings can be confirmed on jobs.tenethealth.com.
We never request payment from applicants during the recruitment or hiring process.
You will not receive official Tenet communications from @tenethcare.com, @gmail.com or @yahoo.com domains.
Be cautious of communications with improper grammar or misspellings.
We do not conduct interviews via online chat services such as Google Hangouts.
During the interview process, you will never be asked for confidential personal information, such as a driver's license number, credit card or banking details.

We want our candidates to have a great experience. Please note that the interview and selection process can vary based on location and position. We encourage you to learn as much as possible about the position during the interview process to ensure the right mutual fit.
Tenet participates in the E-Verify and Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) programs. 









A Company Built on Core Principles
We support our people by offering fulfilling opportunities founded on several core principles.
At Tenet Healthcare, we:

Create a cohesive culture that promotes high-quality care through teamwork
Respect, nurture and promote diversity of thought, background and experience
Encourage colleagues to speak openly without retribution to help resolve concerns
Are committed to diversity and inclusion

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Nasdaq presses two-week highs as FAANG-fueled key reversal fades
Technically speaking, the big three U.S. benchmarks are concluding a flat-to-positive week, at least thus far, against a still constructive bigger-picture backdrop. Consider that the Nasdaq’s FAANG-fueled downdraft continues to fade — the index has tagged a nearly two-week high — while the S&P 500 traverses an increasingly familiar range.

GOP health bill boosts hospital, health insurer and drug stocks
Hospital system stocks rallied as much as 8% on Thursday following the release of the Senate GOP health bill, which appears to be more favorable to hospitals than the House of Representatives bill passed in early May. Tenet Healthcare Corporation  shares jumped 8%, Community Health Systems Inc.  shares skyrocketed 8.2%, HCA Healthcare Inc.  shares rose 3.6% and Universal Health Services Inc.  shares lifted 2.6% in midday trade, compared with a 1.6% rise in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR . Health insurer stocks also rose Tuesday, with UnitedHealth Group  shares up 1.4%, Aetna Inc.  stock rising 1.1%, Humana Inc.  shares lifting 1.3% and Anthem Inc.  shares up 0.9%, compared with a 0.2% rise in the S&P 500 . The Senate health bill "tries to phase in the pain" of changes to the Affordable Care Act like Medicaid spending cuts, said Spencer Perlman, director of health-care research at Veda Partners, who described the Senate plan as having "the same architecture" but "nicer furnishings." Still, the benefit for hospitals is only in the short-term and thus probably overdone, he said. "Clearly, the Senate bill is viewed as less disruptive than the House bill to the number of people currently receiving insurance," said Stefanie Miller, senior analyst at Height Securities. But "the initial reaction may have oversimplified how different this bill is," she said, predicting that stocks that have risen on the news may be "rebalancing" in the coming days. Drug stocks also rose in Tuesday trade, with the SPDR S&P Pharmaceutical ETF  rising 1.7% and the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF  rising 1.6%, which could be happening because the health bill has given investors confidence in Republicans achieving another legislative priority, tax reform, Miller said. Shares of the Health Care Select Sector SPDR have risen 8.7% over the last three months, compared with a 3.9% rise in the S&P 500 .

Tenet Healthcare shares up more than 13% after Q1 results
Shares of Tenet Healthcare Corp.  rallied late Monday after the company swung to a smaller-than-expected adjusted loss for the first quarter and announced a deal to sell its acute-care hospitals and related facilities in Houston for $725 million to HCA Holdings Inc. . Tenet reported a net loss from continuing operations of $52 million, or 52 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $55 million in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted for one-time items, Tenet lost $27 million, or 27 cents a share, from continuing operations, versus an adjusted per-share net income of 45 cents a share a year ago, it said. Net operating revenues fell to $4.8 billion, from $5 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected an adjusted loss of 52 cents a share on sales of $4.8 billion in the period. Tenet said its transaction with HCA is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2017, subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Tenet also raised its adjusted 2017 earnings by $25 million to between $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion due to a change in accounting for pension expenses, the company said. Tenet guided for revenue between $19.7 billion to $20.1 billion for the year. Shares had ended off 2% in the regular session.

Goldman: TrumpCare Is Toast, S&P 500 Falling To Here By Year's End

UnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term Cuts
Tenet Healthcare (THC) and other hospitals led a broad advance in health care stocks on Thursday as Senate Republicans unveiled their own version of TrumpCare. The short takeaway, courtesy of Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick, is that the Senate bill is "Lots Less Worse Short-Term; Lots More Worse Long-Term," in comparison to the House version. In particular, Medicaid spending would suffer a smaller hit in the near term, but face even bigger

Tenet Healthcare Corporation is a multinational investor-owned healthcare services company based in Dallas, Texas. Through its brands, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and partnerships,[3] as of October 2016 Tenet operates nine facilities in the United Kingdom and around 470 outpatient centers[4] in 16 American states.[1][5] Also in the US, Tenet operates 20 "short-stay" surgical hospitals[6] and 79 general acute-care hospitals[6] in 14 states,[7] primarily in California, Florida, Michigan and Texas.[1][5][8] Tenet has more than 20,000 licensed beds[1] and 130,000 employees,[2] and the company’s hospitals offer acute, coronary and critical care; operating and recovery rooms; clinical laboratories and pharmacies; and radiology, respiratory, oncology, orthopedic, physical therapy and organ transplant services.[1][9] Tenet also operates six health plans and 12 accountable care networks.[1][5]
Since its founding in 1967, Tenet has launched a number of brands and acquired several large health care companies. In 2008 Tenet founded Conifer Health Solutions, which serves more than 700 clients in the healthcare industry, including nearly 300 hospitals. As of 2015, Conifer processes $25 billion in net revenue annually and operates in 42 states.[10][11] Tenet launched MedPost Urgent Care in May 2014, which is a network of urgent care centers based in the lower United States.[12] In 2013, Tenet completed its acquisition of Vanguard Health Systems, Inc., an investor-owned hospital company whose operations complemented Tenet's existing business.[13] The acquisition created the third-largest investor-owned hospital company in the U.S. in terms of revenue and the third-largest in number of hospitals owned.[14] In June 2015, Tenet acquired United Surgical Partners International (USPI), which made Tenet the largest operator of outpatient surgery centers in the United States.[15] Shortly after, Tenet moved from No. 229 to No. 170 on the Fortune 500.[16]

Tenet was founded in 1967 by attorneys Richard Eamer, Leonard Cohen and John Bedrosian as National Medical Enterprises (NME) and headquartered in Los Angeles, California.[17] By 1975, NME owned, operated, and managed 23 hospitals and a home health care business.[17][18] In the 1970s, NME expanded into hospital construction and bought five Florida hospitals. By 1981, NME owned or managed 193 hospitals and nursing homes, and became the third-largest healthcare company in the U.S.[17] In the mid-1980s, NME shifted its focus to specialty hospitals. By 1990, the company had 200 hospitals in its network and was the second-largest hospital company in the U.S.[17][18]
After some scandals in the early 1990s (see below), NME divested its specialty facilities.[17] Tenet possessed a dominant market share in Southern California at the time and envisaged the same prospects in South Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and the Philadelphia, PA area. In 1994, NME bought American Medical Holdings for $3.35 billion, which strengthened its presence in Southern California and South Florida, and extended its reach into New Orleans, LA and Texas.[19][20] Following completion of the acquisition, NME changed its name to Tenet Healthcare Corporation.[19] In 1996, Tenet CEO Jeffrey Barbakow moved Tenet's headquarters from Santa Monica, CA to Santa Barbara, CA.[21] In 1998, Tenet purchased eight Philadelphia hospitals owned by the bankrupt Allegheny Health, Education & Research Foundation for $345 million.[22]
Turn of the century (2000–13)[edit]
In 2002, one of Tenet's hospitals came under scrutiny for its surgical practices and another was investigated in a kickback scheme (see below).[23] Federal investigations into the company's billing practices, particularly those related to Medicare, began late in 2002, leading to a decline in Tenet’s stock price of about 70%.[17][21] In 2003, Trevor Fetter became CEO of Tenet and started Commitment to Quality, an initiative to improve the “quality, safety, service and outcomes of the care and services” provided by Tenet.[24][25] To rebuild its ethics and compliance programs, Tenet hired a chief compliance officer to report directly to the company’s board of directors[26][27] In 2003, Tenet sold or closed 14 hospitals and closed more than 20 facilities in 2004 to achieve its financial performance goals.[28][29] Also in 2004, Tenet moved its headquarters from Santa Barbara, CA to Dallas, TX.[21] In 2006, Tenet agreed to pay $725 million to the Justice Dept. to settle allegations of unusually high Medicare payments to Tenet hospitals in 2000 to 2002.[30][31] Tenet also entered into a 5-year corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services that required the company to provide detailed financial reports on its patient mix, collection rates and accounts receivables.[32][33] In 2007, Tenet appointed former Florida governor Jeb Bush to its board of directors to improve its reputation.[34]
In 2008, Tenet launched Conifer Health Solutions, a healthcare services company. Conifer currently serves nearly 300 hospitals throughout the U.S. and processes $25 billion in net revenue annually.[10][11] In early 2009, the price of Tenet stock briefly dipped below $4 per share after cresting above $200 per share in 2002.[35] By the end of 2009, the company rebounded to become the S&P 500’s number 2 performer, with an operating revenue and net profit of $9 billion and $181 million, respectively.[36][37][38]
In May 2011, Tenet’s board rejected a $7.3 billion takeover bid from Community Health Systems, Inc.[39] The deal would have created the largest hospital company in the U.S.[39] In April 2012, Tenet agreed to pay $42.75 million to resolve allegations that it improperly billed Medicare between 2005 and 2007.[40] An internal investigation by Tenet revealed Medicare billing irregularities, and the company reported itself to the U.S. government. In May 2012, Tenet sold Diagnostic Imaging Services, Inc., its former diagnostic imaging center business in Louisiana. In August 2012, Tenet sold its Creighton University Medical Center in Nebraska.[1] In 2013, Tenet acquired Vanguard Health Systems, based in Nashville, TN, in a deal worth $4.3 billion.[41][42] Through its acquisition of Vanguard, Tenet acquired 28 hospitals and 39 outpatient centers that serve communities in Arizona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan and Texas.[1][42][43] The acquisition created the third-largest for-profit hospital chain in the U.S. in terms of revenue and the third-largest in number of hospitals owned.[14][44] Through the end of 2013, Tenet’s stock price increased 816 percent, from $4.60 to $42.12, over the previous five years.[45] Through the acquisition of Vanguard Health Systems, Tenet also acquired Abrazo Community Health Network the associated hospitals are located in Arizona.
Acquisitions and other operations (2014)[edit]
In 2014, Tenet ranked #229 in the annual Fortune 500 list of the largest American companies.[44] In March 2014, Tenet formed a partnership with the Yale New Haven Health System to create a healthcare delivery network in Connecticut.[46] Then in May 2014, Tenet announced plans to partner with the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso to develop a new 140-bed teaching hospital on the city’s west side.[47] Tenet launched MedPost Urgent Care in May 2014, which is a national network of urgent care centers based in the lower United States.[12] In June 2014, Tenet acquired a majority interest in Texas Regional Medical Center, a 70-bed community hospital in Sunnyvale, Texas, east of downtown Dallas.[48] Also that month, Tenet opened Resolute Health Hospital in New Braunfels, Texas. The 128-bed hospital is located on a 56-acre “wellness” campus near San Antonio, Texas, and is Tenet's 79th hospital and 19th in Texas.[8][49]
In July 2014 Tenet announced that Saint Mary's Hospital in Waterbury, Connecticut would be acquired by a subsidiary of the company, with the hospital's religious directives and uncompensated care policies remaining intact. This continued a trend of Tenet allowing a model of common ownership, where each acquired hospital has its own agreement conditions.[50] This deal, and three others Tenet had planned in the state, unraveled when Tenet expressed concern with the conditions on the sale set by the state of Connecticut. The Waterbury hospital was ultimately purchased by Trinity Health [51]
In late July 2014, Tenet signed a letter of intent to form a joint venture which would acquire and operate three hospitals in southern Arizona, two in Tucson and one in Nogales. In the agreement Tenet would be the majority owner and sole operator of the hospitals.[52]
On August 1, 2014 Tenet acquired Emanuel Medical Center,[7] a 209-bed hospital operated by the Swedish Evangelical Covenant Church located in Turlock, California,[53] bringing the number of Tenet's hospitals at the time to 80 nationwide.[7] Tenet announced in December 2014 that they had signed a letter of intent with the Baptist hospital system in Birmingham, Alabama to form a joint venture to own and operate the four Baptist hospitals plus Brookwood Medical Center, already owned by Tenet. Tenet would be the joint venture's majority owner.[54]
In May 2014, Tenet rebranded its diverse urgent care centers into a wholly owned subsidiary, MedPost Urgent Care. Previously, Tenet's urgent care locations often took on the names of nearby Tenet hospitals. Alan Cason, VP of Tenet's outpatient services, was named MedPost CEO. At the time, MedPost has 23 facilities, with six in Texas, and others in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee.[12][55]
As of the fourth quarter 2014, Tenet has turned a profit, explained by higher admissions and revenue (admissions through Medicaid increased by 20.5% after the Affordable Care Act). Hospital admissions also saw an increase during the last quarter of 2014, while the company's bad debt expense ratio decreased. At the same time, its full year financial projections affirmed a price of $1.32 to $2.4 per share with revenue of $17.4 to $17.7 billion,[56] with its earnings topping $1.95 billion.[57] On May 7, 2015, the Tenet board of directors appointed Trevor Fetter, Tenet's president and CEO, as chairman of the board.[58] In 2015, the company moved from No. 229 to No. 170 on the Fortune 500.[16]
Recent developments (2015-present)[edit]
In March 2015, Tenet announced an agreement to acquire a majority interest in United Surgical Partners International (USPI), which would make Tenet the largest operator of outpatient surgery centers in the United States. Tenet also announced an agreement to acquire Aspen Healthcare in Great Britain.[15] On June 16, Tenet finalized their acquisition of Aspen Healthcare Ltd. and USPI. The USPI transaction raised the number of outpatient centers operated by Tenet to over 400, over double what they had operated prior. It also again made Tenet a multinational company, as Tenet acquired nine British healthcare facilities.[3] Bill Wilcox remained CEO of USPI, with Kyle Burtnett of Tenet joining USPI as chief integration officer, among other roles. Through the deal, USPI will retain its independent branding.[3]
Early in September 2015,[59][60] Tenet acquired a majority interest in a three-hospital system in Tucson, Arizona, when Tenet, Dignity Health and Ascension Health formed a joint venture to own and operate Carondelet Health Network.[59][60] The three hospitals' names remained unchanged, with close to 1,000 new beds added to the Tenet healthcare system as a result.[59] The acquisition of Carondelet Health Network raised the total number of Tenet's general acute care hospitals to 83, and their number of short-stay surgical hospitals to 19.[60] On May 11, 2015, it was announced that the Tenet-operated Abrazo Health, acquired in 2013, had been renamed Abrazo Community Health Network.[61]
After first announcing the deal in March 2015,[62] in January 2016 Tenet Healthcare closed a deal to form a joint venture[63] with the non-profit organization[64] Baylor Scott and White Health, with plans for the joint venture to own and operate a number of hospitals in North Texas.[63] The hospitals,[63] which were all rebranded under the Baylor name over the coming months,[65] go by Baylor Scott & White Medical Center — Centennial,[65] Baylor Scott & White Medical Center – White Rock,[66] Baylor Scott & White Medical Center – Lake Pointe,[67] and Baylor Scott & White Medical Center – Sunnyvale.[68] On October 3, 2016, it was announced that Tenet had agreed to pay a $514 million settlement in an agreement with the Department of Justice.[4] According to the lawsuit filed in 2014, four hospitals then owned by Tenet had collaborated in a "kickback" scheme with Clinica de la Mama to increase hospital referrals of Medicaid patients,[6] with two of Tenet's former subsidiaries admitting to "conspiring to defraud Medicaid."[6] According to Modern Healthcare, as part of the agreement, the "federal government acknowledged that individuals at the hospitals withheld information from Tenet about the agreements and circumvented Tenet's policies and procedures to prevent such illegal conduct."[6]
Operations[edit]
As of October 2016, Tenet Healthcare Corporate employs approximately 130,000 people.[6] As of June 2015, Tenet operates six health care plans as well as Conifer Health Solutions, LLC, which provides healthcare business process services in the areas of revenue cycle management, value-based care and patient communications.[1] Through its brands, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and partnerships with companies such as United Surgical Partners International (USPI), Tenet operates a total of nine facilities in the United Kingdom.[1][54] Tenet also operates 470 outpatient centers[6] in the United States,[3] after the June 2015 acquisition of USPI almost doubled Tenet's prior count of 210 outpatient centers.[1][54][69][70] Also in the United States, Tenet operates 20 "short-stay"[2] surgical hospitals[3] and 79[6][2] general acute care hospitals.[3][7] Tenet-operated hospitals include four academic medical centers, two children’s hospitals, three specialty hospitals (one of which is temporarily closed for repairs)[71] and a critical access hospital, with a total of 20,814 licensed beds as of early 2015, serving primarily urban and suburban communities in 14 states.[1] In addition, Tenet subsidiaries own or lease and operate a number of medical office buildings, all located on or near Tenet hospital campuses.[3] Tenet subsidiaries also operate free-standing and provider-based outpatient centers in 16 states, including diagnostic imaging centers, ambulatory surgery centers, satellite emergency departments and urgent care centers. Tenet owns over 500 physician practices as well.[1]
Major brands[edit]
MedPost Urgent Care[edit]
In May 2014, Tenet launched MedPost Urgent Care, a national network of urgent care centers.[12] The launch was the result of Tenet rebranding its diverse urgent care centers into one company. Previously, Tenet's urgent care locations often took on the names of nearby Tenet hospitals. At the time of the rebranding, MedPost equaled 23 facilities, with six in Texas, and others in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee.[55] According to Dr. Melissa Molina, the medical director of MedPost, the most common injuries the clinics see are on the arms and ankles, many through minor falls and accidents. [72]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Tenet Healthcare has received numerous honors for executive and hospital leadership, nursing excellence, clinical quality, and recognition from insurers.[73] In 2013, the American Heart Association recognized Tenet as a “Platinum Fit-Friendly Company.”[74] Tenet’s board of directors was named the Outstanding Board of Directors for a Public Company by the Dallas Business Journal[75] in September 2014.[76]
The company's CEO Trevor Fetter has appeared several times on the “100 Most Influential People in Healthcare" list compiled by Modern Healthcare,[77] ranking No. 13 in 2014.[78] In 2011, Audrey Andrews, chief compliance officer at Tenet, was recognized as one of the “Top 25 Women in Healthcare" by Modern Healthcare.[79] Likewise, in 2014 their SVP and chief clinical officer, Dr. Kelvin Baggett, was named on the magazine's list of “50 Most Influential Physician Executives & Leaders.”[80] Tenet's CFO Dan Cancelmi was named CFO of the Year by the Dallas Business Journal in October 2014.[81]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2002, the Tenet Healthcare Foundation awarded a $1 million grant to provide financial support to Latino nursing students .[82] In 2004, Tenet Healthcare Foundation, Tenet’s charitable giving arm, awarded $2.78 million to support accelerated undergraduate and graduate nursing degree programs at five nursing colleges in Southern California, South Florida, Georgia and Texas.[83] In 2012, Tenet joined GE and Verizon in supporting the launch of the Clinton Health Matters Initiative, created by the William J. Clinton Foundation to build on its work on global health and childhood obesity.[84] In Tenet’s “2013 Sustainability Report: Tenet Cares,” the company stated that its support for local communities that year totaled $545 million in uncompensated care and $158 million in charity care.[45] In 2014, Tenet Healthcare was a presenting sponsor of the third annual Clinton Foundation Health Matters Conference in La Quinta, California.[85]
Controversies[edit]
Psychiatric fraud[edit]
In the early 1990s as National Medical Enterprises, the company was accused of committing fraud by admitting thousands of psychiatric patients who did not need hospitalization and then charging these patients inflated prices.[86] In 1991, the federal government investigated the company for fraud and conspiracy.[87] In 1993, law enforcement raided company offices in an attempt to show that the company was defrauding patients and insurance companies.[88] In 1994, the company paid $2.5 million to settle lawsuits from 23 patients at its psychiatric hospitals.[89] Again in 1994, National Medical Enterprises settled fraud charges with the United States and 28 states involving payments of a record $380 million at the time and federal guilty pleas on eight criminal counts by two of its units. The company also agreed to a 5-year corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.[90]
Unnecessary heart surgeries[edit]
Further information: Unnecessary health care
In the late 1990s through the early 2000s, Redding Medical Center (at the time, a Tenet-owned hospital), was investigated for performing unnecessary heart surgeries on over 600 patients. To settle these allegations, Tenet agreed to pay a $54 million fine to the federal government and the state of California, without admitting wrongdoing. This settlement did not preclude civil or criminal charges against individuals of the company.[91] In order for the hospital to continue receiving Medicare reimbursements, Tenet was compelled by federal regulators to sell the hospital which was subsequently renamed Shasta Regional Medical Center.[92] In 2004, Tenet paid an additional $395 million to 769 patients to settle litigation for the unnecessary surgeries.[93] The scandal and subsequent federal investigation are described in the book Coronary: A True Story of Medicine Gone Awry by author Stephen Klaidman.[94][95][96]
Medicare fraud[edit]
In June 2006, Tenet agreed to pay $725 million in cash and give up $175 million of Medicare payments for a total of $900 million in fees to resolve claims it defrauded the federal government for over-billing Medicare claims during the 1990s. To finance the settlement, they sold 11 hospitals in four states including Memorial Medical Center (see below).[97][98][99] In September of that year, Tenet entered into a 5-year corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.[32][33] That agreement expired on September 27, 2011.
Hurricane Katrina[edit]
In July 2006, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, Dr. Anna Pou and nurses Lori Budo and Cheri Landry, employees at Tenet-owned Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans, LA, were arrested after being charged by Louisiana Attorney General Charles Foti of second-degree murder in the deaths of four patients.[100] In August 2007, a New Orleans grand jury declined to indict the three women and a New Orleans judge expunged their arrest records. In July 2007, Dr. Pou sued Foti for defamation and damage to her career.[101] In June 2006, Tenet announced it planned to sell Memorial Medical Center and three other hospitals in the greater New Orleans area.[102] In July 2009, Gov. Bobby Jindal approved by a bill passed by the Louisiana Legislature to reimburse Pou’s legal fees, which totaled more than $450,000.[103][104]
Tax dodging and lobbying[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Tenet Healthcare for spending $3.43 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $48 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $415 million, and increasing executive pay by 19% to $24 million in 2010 for its top 5 executives.[105]
Florida pediatric heart surgery standards[edit]
In 2015, CNN reported that Tenet had lobbied the governor of Florida Rick Scott and Republican Party Florida legislators in order to remove hospital standard rules for pediatric heart surgeries, after one of its hospitals failed to meet standards. Both the officials and Tenet denied any wrongdoing, with Tenet stating to the press that "at no time have we discussed the pediatric cardiac standards with the governor or his office, or with any elected official or anyone on their staff... our opinion was not sought on the standards nor have we expressed a position on the possible repeal of the standards or the role of the Cardiac Technical Advisory Panel."[106] Florida Health released a statement indicating that the legal basis for the removal of pediatric surgery standards had been revoked in 2001. This revocation invalidated the standards and it was an oversight that they were not formally stricken from record until 2015.[107]

Tenet Healthcare Corporation is a multinational investor-owned healthcare services company based in Dallas, Texas. Through its brands, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and partnerships,[3] as of October 2016 Tenet operates nine facilities in the United Kingdom and around 470 outpatient centers[4] in 16 American states.[1][5] Also in the US, Tenet operates 20 "short-stay" surgical hospitals[6] and 79 general acute-care hospitals[6] in 14 states,[7] primarily in California, Florida, Michigan and Texas.[1][5][8] Tenet has more than 20,000 licensed beds[1] and 130,000 employees,[2] and the company’s hospitals offer acute, coronary and critical care; operating and recovery rooms; clinical laboratories and pharmacies; and radiology, respiratory, oncology, orthopedic, physical therapy and organ transplant services.[1][9] Tenet also operates six health plans and 12 accountable care networks.[1][5]
Since its founding in 1967, Tenet has launched a number of brands and acquired several large health care companies. In 2008 Tenet founded Conifer Health Solutions, which serves more than 700 clients in the healthcare industry, including nearly 300 hospitals. As of 2015, Conifer processes $25 billion in net revenue annually and operates in 42 states.[10][11] Tenet launched MedPost Urgent Care in May 2014, which is a network of urgent care centers based in the lower United States.[12] In 2013, Tenet completed its acquisition of Vanguard Health Systems, Inc., an investor-owned hospital company whose operations complemented Tenet's existing business.[13] The acquisition created the third-largest investor-owned hospital company in the U.S. in terms of revenue and the third-largest in number of hospitals owned.[14] In June 2015, Tenet acquired United Surgical Partners International (USPI), which made Tenet the largest operator of outpatient surgery centers in the United States.[15] Shortly after, Tenet moved from No. 229 to No. 170 on the Fortune 500.[16]

History[edit]
Early years (1967–99)[edit]
Tenet was founded in 1967 by attorneys Richard Eamer, Leonard Cohen and John Bedrosian as National Medical Enterprises (NME) and headquartered in Los Angeles, California.[17] By 1975, NME owned, operated, and managed 23 hospitals and a home health care business.[17][18] In the 1970s, NME expanded into hospital construction and bought five Florida hospitals. By 1981, NME owned or managed 193 hospitals and nursing homes, and became the third-largest healthcare company in the U.S.[17] In the mid-1980s, NME shifted its focus to specialty hospitals. By 1990, the company had 200 hospitals in its network and was the second-largest hospital company in the U.S.[17][18]
After some scandals in the early 1990s (see below), NME divested its specialty facilities.[17] Tenet possessed a dominant market share in Southern California at the time and envisaged the same prospects in South Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and the Philadelphia, PA area. In 1994, NME bought American Medical Holdings for $3.35 billion, which strengthened its presence in Southern California and South Florida, and extended its reach into New Orleans, LA and Texas.[19][20] Following completion of the acquisition, NME changed its name to Tenet Healthcare Corporation.[19] In 1996, Tenet CEO Jeffrey Barbakow moved Tenet's headquarters from Santa Monica, CA to Santa Barbara, CA.[21] In 1998, Tenet purchased eight Philadelphia hospitals owned by the bankrupt Allegheny Health, Education & Research Foundation for $345 million.[22]
Turn of the century (2000–13)[edit]
In 2002, one of Tenet's hospitals came under scrutiny for its surgical practices and another was investigated in a kickback scheme (see below).[23] Federal investigations into the company's billing practices, particularly those related to Medicare, began late in 2002, leading to a decline in Tenet’s stock price of about 70%.[17][21] In 2003, Trevor Fetter became CEO of Tenet and started Commitment to Quality, an initiative to improve the “quality, safety, service and outcomes of the care and services” provided by Tenet.[24][25] To rebuild its ethics and compliance programs, Tenet hired a chief compliance officer to report directly to the company’s board of directors[26][27] In 2003, Tenet sold or closed 14 hospitals and closed more than 20 facilities in 2004 to achieve its financial performance goals.[28][29] Also in 2004, Tenet moved its headquarters from Santa Barbara, CA to Dallas, TX.[21] In 2006, Tenet agreed to pay $725 million to the Justice Dept. to settle allegations of unusually high Medicare payments to Tenet hospitals in 2000 to 2002.[30][31] Tenet also entered into a 5-year corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services that required the company to provide detailed financial reports on its patient mix, collection rates and accounts receivables.[32][33] In 2007, Tenet appointed former Florida governor Jeb Bush to its board of directors to improve its reputation.[34]
In 2008, Tenet launched Conifer Health Solutions, a healthcare services company. Conifer currently serves nearly 300 hospitals throughout the U.S. and processes $25 billion in net revenue annually.[10][11] In early 2009, the price of Tenet stock briefly dipped below $4 per share after cresting above $200 per share in 2002.[35] By the end of 2009, the company rebounded to become the S&P 500’s number 2 performer, with an operating revenue and net profit of $9 billion and $181 million, respectively.[36][37][38]
In May 2011, Tenet’s board rejected a $7.3 billion takeover bid from Community Health Systems, Inc.[39] The deal would have created the largest hospital company in the U.S.[39] In April 2012, Tenet agreed to pay $42.75 million to resolve allegations that it improperly billed Medicare between 2005 and 2007.[40] An internal investigation by Tenet revealed Medicare billing irregularities, and the company reported itself to the U.S. government. In May 2012, Tenet sold Diagnostic Imaging Services, Inc., its former diagnostic imaging center business in Louisiana. In August 2012, Tenet sold its Creighton University Medical Center in Nebraska.[1] In 2013, Tenet acquired Vanguard Health Systems, based in Nashville, TN, in a deal worth $4.3 billion.[41][42] Through its acquisition of Vanguard, Tenet acquired 28 hospitals and 39 outpatient centers that serve communities in Arizona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan and Texas.[1][42][43] The acquisition created the third-largest for-profit hospital chain in the U.S. in terms of revenue and the third-largest in number of hospitals owned.[14][44] Through the end of 2013, Tenet’s stock price increased 816 percent, from $4.60 to $42.12, over the previous five years.[45] Through the acquisition of Vanguard Health Systems, Tenet also acquired Abrazo Community Health Network the associated hospitals are located in Arizona.
Acquisitions and other operations (2014)[edit]
In 2014, Tenet ranked #229 in the annual Fortune 500 list of the largest American companies.[44] In March 2014, Tenet formed a partnership with the Yale New Haven Health System to create a healthcare delivery network in Connecticut.[46] Then in May 2014, Tenet announced plans to partner with the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso to develop a new 140-bed teaching hospital on the city’s west side.[47] Tenet launched MedPost Urgent Care in May 2014, which is a national network of urgent care centers based in the lower United States.[12] In June 2014, Tenet acquired a majority interest in Texas Regional Medical Center, a 70-bed community hospital in Sunnyvale, Texas, east of downtown Dallas.[48] Also that month, Tenet opened Resolute Health Hospital in New Braunfels, Texas. The 128-bed hospital is located on a 56-acre “wellness” campus near San Antonio, Texas, and is Tenet's 79th hospital and 19th in Texas.[8][49]
In July 2014 Tenet announced that Saint Mary's Hospital in Waterbury, Connecticut would be acquired by a subsidiary of the company, with the hospital's religious directives and uncompensated care policies remaining intact. This continued a trend of Tenet allowing a model of common ownership, where each acquired hospital has its own agreement conditions.[50] This deal, and three others Tenet had planned in the state, unraveled when Tenet expressed concern with the conditions on the sale set by the state of Connecticut. The Waterbury hospital was ultimately purchased by Trinity Health [51]
In late July 2014, Tenet signed a letter of intent to form a joint venture which would acquire and operate three hospitals in southern Arizona, two in Tucson and one in Nogales. In the agreement Tenet would be the majority owner and sole operator of the hospitals.[52]
On August 1, 2014 Tenet acquired Emanuel Medical Center,[7] a 209-bed hospital operated by the Swedish Evangelical Covenant Church located in Turlock, California,[53] bringing the number of Tenet's hospitals at the time to 80 nationwide.[7] Tenet announced in December 2014 that they had signed a letter of intent with the Baptist hospital system in Birmingham, Alabama to form a joint venture to own and operate the four Baptist hospitals plus Brookwood Medical Center, already owned by Tenet. Tenet would be the joint venture's majority owner.[54]
In May 2014, Tenet rebranded its diverse urgent care centers into a wholly owned subsidiary, MedPost Urgent Care. Previously, Tenet's urgent care locations often took on the names of nearby Tenet hospitals. Alan Cason, VP of Tenet's outpatient services, was named MedPost CEO. At the time, MedPost has 23 facilities, with six in Texas, and others in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee.[12][55]
As of the fourth quarter 2014, Tenet has turned a profit, explained by higher admissions and revenue (admissions through Medicaid increased by 20.5% after the Affordable Care Act). Hospital admissions also saw an increase during the last quarter of 2014, while the company's bad debt expense ratio decreased. At the same time, its full year financial projections affirmed a price of $1.32 to $2.4 per share with revenue of $17.4 to $17.7 billion,[56] with its earnings topping $1.95 billion.[57] On May 7, 2015, the Tenet board of directors appointed Trevor Fetter, Tenet's president and CEO, as chairman of the board.[58] In 2015, the company moved from No. 229 to No. 170 on the Fortune 500.[16]
Recent developments (2015-present)[edit]
In March 2015, Tenet announced an agreement to acquire a majority interest in United Surgical Partners International (USPI), which would make Tenet the largest operator of outpatient surgery centers in the United States. Tenet also announced an agreement to acquire Aspen Healthcare in Great Britain.[15] On June 16, Tenet finalized their acquisition of Aspen Healthcare Ltd. and USPI. The USPI transaction raised the number of outpatient centers operated by Tenet to over 400, over double what they had operated prior. It also again made Tenet a multinational company, as Tenet acquired nine British healthcare facilities.[3] Bill Wilcox remained CEO of USPI, with Kyle Burtnett of Tenet joining USPI as chief integration officer, among other roles. Through the deal, USPI will retain its independent branding.[3]
Early in September 2015,[59][60] Tenet acquired a majority interest in a three-hospital system in Tucson, Arizona, when Tenet, Dignity Health and Ascension Health formed a joint venture to own and operate Carondelet Health Network.[59][60] The three hospitals' names remained unchanged, with close to 1,000 new beds added to the Tenet healthcare system as a result.[59] The acquisition of Carondelet Health Network raised the total number of Tenet's general acute care hospitals to 83, and their number of short-stay surgical hospitals to 19.[60] On May 11, 2015, it was announced that the Tenet-operated Abrazo Health, acquired in 2013, had been renamed Abrazo Community Health Network.[61]
After first announcing the deal in March 2015,[62] in January 2016 Tenet Healthcare closed a deal to form a joint venture[63] with the non-profit organization[64] Baylor Scott and White Health, with plans for the joint venture to own and operate a number of hospitals in North Texas.[63] The hospitals,[63] which were all rebranded under the Baylor name over the coming months,[65] go by Baylor Scott & White Medical Center — Centennial,[65] Baylor Scott & White Medical Center – White Rock,[66] Baylor Scott & White Medical Center – Lake Pointe,[67] and Baylor Scott & White Medical Center – Sunnyvale.[68] On October 3, 2016, it was announced that Tenet had agreed to pay a $514 million settlement in an agreement with the Department of Justice.[4] According to the lawsuit filed in 2014, four hospitals then owned by Tenet had collaborated in a "kickback" scheme with Clinica de la Mama to increase hospital referrals of Medicaid patients,[6] with two of Tenet's former subsidiaries admitting to "conspiring to defraud Medicaid."[6] According to Modern Healthcare, as part of the agreement, the "federal government acknowledged that individuals at the hospitals withheld information from Tenet about the agreements and circumvented Tenet's policies and procedures to prevent such illegal conduct."[6]
Operations[edit]
As of October 2016, Tenet Healthcare Corporate employs approximately 130,000 people.[6] As of June 2015, Tenet operates six health care plans as well as Conifer Health Solutions, LLC, which provides healthcare business process services in the areas of revenue cycle management, value-based care and patient communications.[1] Through its brands, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and partnerships with companies such as United Surgical Partners International (USPI), Tenet operates a total of nine facilities in the United Kingdom.[1][54] Tenet also operates 470 outpatient centers[6] in the United States,[3] after the June 2015 acquisition of USPI almost doubled Tenet's prior count of 210 outpatient centers.[1][54][69][70] Also in the United States, Tenet operates 20 "short-stay"[2] surgical hospitals[3] and 79[6][2] general acute care hospitals.[3][7] Tenet-operated hospitals include four academic medical centers, two children’s hospitals, three specialty hospitals (one of which is temporarily closed for repairs)[71] and a critical access hospital, with a total of 20,814 licensed beds as of early 2015, serving primarily urban and suburban communities in 14 states.[1] In addition, Tenet subsidiaries own or lease and operate a number of medical office buildings, all located on or near Tenet hospital campuses.[3] Tenet subsidiaries also operate free-standing and provider-based outpatient centers in 16 states, including diagnostic imaging centers, ambulatory surgery centers, satellite emergency departments and urgent care centers. Tenet owns over 500 physician practices as well.[1]
Major brands[edit]
MedPost Urgent Care[edit]
In May 2014, Tenet launched MedPost Urgent Care, a national network of urgent care centers.[12] The launch was the result of Tenet rebranding its diverse urgent care centers into one company. Previously, Tenet's urgent care locations often took on the names of nearby Tenet hospitals. At the time of the rebranding, MedPost equaled 23 facilities, with six in Texas, and others in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee.[55] According to Dr. Melissa Molina, the medical director of MedPost, the most common injuries the clinics see are on the arms and ankles, many through minor falls and accidents. [72]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Tenet Healthcare has received numerous honors for executive and hospital leadership, nursing excellence, clinical quality, and recognition from insurers.[73] In 2013, the American Heart Association recognized Tenet as a “Platinum Fit-Friendly Company.”[74] Tenet’s board of directors was named the Outstanding Board of Directors for a Public Company by the Dallas Business Journal[75] in September 2014.[76]
The company's CEO Trevor Fetter has appeared several times on the “100 Most Influential People in Healthcare" list compiled by Modern Healthcare,[77] ranking No. 13 in 2014.[78] In 2011, Audrey Andrews, chief compliance officer at Tenet, was recognized as one of the “Top 25 Women in Healthcare" by Modern Healthcare.[79] Likewise, in 2014 their SVP and chief clinical officer, Dr. Kelvin Baggett, was named on the magazine's list of “50 Most Influential Physician Executives & Leaders.”[80] Tenet's CFO Dan Cancelmi was named CFO of the Year by the Dallas Business Journal in October 2014.[81]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2002, the Tenet Healthcare Foundation awarded a $1 million grant to provide financial support to Latino nursing students .[82] In 2004, Tenet Healthcare Foundation, Tenet’s charitable giving arm, awarded $2.78 million to support accelerated undergraduate and graduate nursing degree programs at five nursing colleges in Southern California, South Florida, Georgia and Texas.[83] In 2012, Tenet joined GE and Verizon in supporting the launch of the Clinton Health Matters Initiative, created by the William J. Clinton Foundation to build on its work on global health and childhood obesity.[84] In Tenet’s “2013 Sustainability Report: Tenet Cares,” the company stated that its support for local communities that year totaled $545 million in uncompensated care and $158 million in charity care.[45] In 2014, Tenet Healthcare was a presenting sponsor of the third annual Clinton Foundation Health Matters Conference in La Quinta, California.[85]
Controversies[edit]
Psychiatric fraud[edit]
In the early 1990s as National Medical Enterprises, the company was accused of committing fraud by admitting thousands of psychiatric patients who did not need hospitalization and then charging these patients inflated prices.[86] In 1991, the federal government investigated the company for fraud and conspiracy.[87] In 1993, law enforcement raided company offices in an attempt to show that the company was defrauding patients and insurance companies.[88] In 1994, the company paid $2.5 million to settle lawsuits from 23 patients at its psychiatric hospitals.[89] Again in 1994, National Medical Enterprises settled fraud charges with the United States and 28 states involving payments of a record $380 million at the time and federal guilty pleas on eight criminal counts by two of its units. The company also agreed to a 5-year corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.[90]
Unnecessary heart surgeries[edit]
Further information: Unnecessary health care
In the late 1990s through the early 2000s, Redding Medical Center (at the time, a Tenet-owned hospital), was investigated for performing unnecessary heart surgeries on over 600 patients. To settle these allegations, Tenet agreed to pay a $54 million fine to the federal government and the state of California, without admitting wrongdoing. This settlement did not preclude civil or criminal charges against individuals of the company.[91] In order for the hospital to continue receiving Medicare reimbursements, Tenet was compelled by federal regulators to sell the hospital which was subsequently renamed Shasta Regional Medical Center.[92] In 2004, Tenet paid an additional $395 million to 769 patients to settle litigation for the unnecessary surgeries.[93] The scandal and subsequent federal investigation are described in the book Coronary: A True Story of Medicine Gone Awry by author Stephen Klaidman.[94][95][96]
Medicare fraud[edit]
In June 2006, Tenet agreed to pay $725 million in cash and give up $175 million of Medicare payments for a total of $900 million in fees to resolve claims it defrauded the federal government for over-billing Medicare claims during the 1990s. To finance the settlement, they sold 11 hospitals in four states including Memorial Medical Center (see below).[97][98][99] In September of that year, Tenet entered into a 5-year corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.[32][33] That agreement expired on September 27, 2011.
Hurricane Katrina[edit]
In July 2006, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, Dr. Anna Pou and nurses Lori Budo and Cheri Landry, employees at Tenet-owned Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans, LA, were arrested after being charged by Louisiana Attorney General Charles Foti of second-degree murder in the deaths of four patients.[100] In August 2007, a New Orleans grand jury declined to indict the three women and a New Orleans judge expunged their arrest records. In July 2007, Dr. Pou sued Foti for defamation and damage to her career.[101] In June 2006, Tenet announced it planned to sell Memorial Medical Center and three other hospitals in the greater New Orleans area.[102] In July 2009, Gov. Bobby Jindal approved by a bill passed by the Louisiana Legislature to reimburse Pou’s legal fees, which totaled more than $450,000.[103][104]
Tax dodging and lobbying[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Tenet Healthcare for spending $3.43 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $48 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $415 million, and increasing executive pay by 19% to $24 million in 2010 for its top 5 executives.[105]
Florida pediatric heart surgery standards[edit]
In 2015, CNN reported that Tenet had lobbied the governor of Florida Rick Scott and Republican Party Florida legislators in order to remove hospital standard rules for pediatric heart surgeries, after one of its hospitals failed to meet standards. Both the officials and Tenet denied any wrongdoing, with Tenet stating to the press that "at no time have we discussed the pediatric cardiac standards with the governor or his office, or with any elected official or anyone on their staff... our opinion was not sought on the standards nor have we expressed a position on the possible repeal of the standards or the role of the Cardiac Technical Advisory Panel."[106] Florida Health released a statement indicating that the legal basis for the removal of pediatric surgery standards had been revoked in 2001. This revocation invalidated the standards and it was an oversight that they were not formally stricken from record until 2015.[107]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC) : Checking the Chart

By Josie Noyola -   July 27, 2017 



 





Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter














We have gathered the technical data on Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC), and witnessed some remarkable trends in the stock’s behavior of late. Analysts mostly observe and predict stock performance through the patterns on the chart. By looking at the chart of this stock, it is quite obvious which way it is heading. It is said that “everything is in the price” that all fundamental and sentiment information is best communicated by the action on the chart. For this stock, that chart has a great deal to say about what may be to come.
THC has been trading in a bearish trend, based on the relative levels of its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This suggests that the broad sum of capital flow in the stock has been generally negative over the recent period. In terms of the relative level of interest afforded this stock among active participants in the market, relative volume measures have been weak, indicating apathy for the name by traders, investors, and money managers during the past month of action. This suggests something of the significance of other current technical measures as well.
For market timers, it’s also important to take measure of the relative level of recent lift or pressure in the stock is it overbought or oversold? For that, we turn to RSI and stochastic measures. The 14-day RSI stands at 48.78%. That shows that the stock, according to a traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI indicator, is not particularly predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure If we look at the stochastic measure, the raw data over the stock’s last month of action shows a score of 60.57%. Based on a raw data interpretation, this perspective doesn’t suggest either an overbought or oversold condition.
Sometimes, there is information carried in simply the degree of movement in a stock. In recent action, THC has made a move of -0.03 over the past month. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by -53.83%, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. The stock’s recent movement has come on a historical volatility score of 43.64%, which represents the standard deviation of returns of a theoretical long position from a mean price during that period. On a daily basis over the past month, the average true range of the stock, as expressed in percentage terms, is 4.1%. That should give you a pretty good sense of the level of risk implied in a short-term trading approach in the stock with a stop-loss in place.





As it stands at present, the stock might find important action at key Fibonacci levels. Fibonacci levels are used by major Wall Street firm technical desks. The math is drawn from the Fibonacci series that defines growth systems by an interval increase characterized by steps divisible by the “golden ratio” of 61.8%. In this case, the critical 38.2% level drawn off the 52-weeklow of $14.06 sits at $20.78. THC also has additional support below at the stock’s 200-day simple moving average, which sits at $18.01.

Tenet Healthcare Corporation is a multinational investor-owned healthcare services company based in Dallas, Texas. Through its brands, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and partnerships,[3] as of October 2016 Tenet operates nine facilities in the United Kingdom and around 470 outpatient centers[4] in 16 American states.[1][5] Also in the US, Tenet operates 20 "short-stay" surgical hospitals[6] and 79 general acute-care hospitals[6] in 14 states,[7] primarily in California, Florida, Michigan and Texas.[1][5][8] Tenet has more than 20,000 licensed beds[1] and 130,000 employees,[2] and the company’s hospitals offer acute, coronary and critical care; operating and recovery rooms; clinical laboratories and pharmacies; and radiology, respiratory, oncology, orthopedic, physical therapy and organ transplant services.[1][9] Tenet also operates six health plans and 12 accountable care networks.[1][5]
Since its founding in 1967, Tenet has launched a number of brands and acquired several large health care companies. In 2008 Tenet founded Conifer Health Solutions, which serves more than 700 clients in the healthcare industry, including nearly 300 hospitals. As of 2015, Conifer processes $25 billion in net revenue annually and operates in 42 states.[10][11] Tenet launched MedPost Urgent Care in May 2014, which is a network of urgent care centers based in the lower United States.[12] In 2013, Tenet completed its acquisition of Vanguard Health Systems, Inc., an investor-owned hospital company whose operations complemented Tenet's existing business.[13] The acquisition created the third-largest investor-owned hospital company in the U.S. in terms of revenue and the third-largest in number of hospitals owned.[14] In June 2015, Tenet acquired United Surgical Partners International (USPI), which made Tenet the largest operator of outpatient surgery centers in the United States.[15] Shortly after, Tenet moved from No. 229 to No. 170 on the Fortune 500.[16]

History[edit]
Early years (1967–99)[edit]
Tenet was founded in 1967 by attorneys Richard Eamer, Leonard Cohen and John Bedrosian as National Medical Enterprises (NME) and headquartered in Los Angeles, California.[17] By 1975, NME owned, operated, and managed 23 hospitals and a home health care business.[17][18] In the 1970s, NME expanded into hospital construction and bought five Florida hospitals. By 1981, NME owned or managed 193 hospitals and nursing homes, and became the third-largest healthcare company in the U.S.[17] In the mid-1980s, NME shifted its focus to specialty hospitals. By 1990, the company had 200 hospitals in its network and was the second-largest hospital company in the U.S.[17][18]
After some scandals in the early 1990s (see below), NME divested its specialty facilities.[17] Tenet possessed a dominant market share in Southern California at the time and envisaged the same prospects in South Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and the Philadelphia, PA area. In 1994, NME bought American Medical Holdings for $3.35 billion, which strengthened its presence in Southern California and South Florida, and extended its reach into New Orleans, LA and Texas.[19][20] Following completion of the acquisition, NME changed its name to Tenet Healthcare Corporation.[19] In 1996, Tenet CEO Jeffrey Barbakow moved Tenet's headquarters from Santa Monica, CA to Santa Barbara, CA.[21] In 1998, Tenet purchased eight Philadelphia hospitals owned by the bankrupt Allegheny Health, Education & Research Foundation for $345 million.[22]
Turn of the century (2000–13)[edit]
In 2002, one of Tenet's hospitals came under scrutiny for its surgical practices and another was investigated in a kickback scheme (see below).[23] Federal investigations into the company's billing practices, particularly those related to Medicare, began late in 2002, leading to a decline in Tenet’s stock price of about 70%.[17][21] In 2003, Trevor Fetter became CEO of Tenet and started Commitment to Quality, an initiative to improve the “quality, safety, service and outcomes of the care and services” provided by Tenet.[24][25] To rebuild its ethics and compliance programs, Tenet hired a chief compliance officer to report directly to the company’s board of directors[26][27] In 2003, Tenet sold or closed 14 hospitals and closed more than 20 facilities in 2004 to achieve its financial performance goals.[28][29] Also in 2004, Tenet moved its headquarters from Santa Barbara, CA to Dallas, TX.[21] In 2006, Tenet agreed to pay $725 million to the Justice Dept. to settle allegations of unusually high Medicare payments to Tenet hospitals in 2000 to 2002.[30][31] Tenet also entered into a 5-year corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services that required the company to provide detailed financial reports on its patient mix, collection rates and accounts receivables.[32][33] In 2007, Tenet appointed former Florida governor Jeb Bush to its board of directors to improve its reputation.[34]
In 2008, Tenet launched Conifer Health Solutions, a healthcare services company. Conifer currently serves nearly 300 hospitals throughout the U.S. and processes $25 billion in net revenue annually.[10][11] In early 2009, the price of Tenet stock briefly dipped below $4 per share after cresting above $200 per share in 2002.[35] By the end of 2009, the company rebounded to become the S&P 500’s number 2 performer, with an operating revenue and net profit of $9 billion and $181 million, respectively.[36][37][38]
In May 2011, Tenet’s board rejected a $7.3 billion takeover bid from Community Health Systems, Inc.[39] The deal would have created the largest hospital company in the U.S.[39] In April 2012, Tenet agreed to pay $42.75 million to resolve allegations that it improperly billed Medicare between 2005 and 2007.[40] An internal investigation by Tenet revealed Medicare billing irregularities, and the company reported itself to the U.S. government. In May 2012, Tenet sold Diagnostic Imaging Services, Inc., its former diagnostic imaging center business in Louisiana. In August 2012, Tenet sold its Creighton University Medical Center in Nebraska.[1] In 2013, Tenet acquired Vanguard Health Systems, based in Nashville, TN, in a deal worth $4.3 billion.[41][42] Through its acquisition of Vanguard, Tenet acquired 28 hospitals and 39 outpatient centers that serve communities in Arizona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan and Texas.[1][42][43] The acquisition created the third-largest for-profit hospital chain in the U.S. in terms of revenue and the third-largest in number of hospitals owned.[14][44] Through the end of 2013, Tenet’s stock price increased 816 percent, from $4.60 to $42.12, over the previous five years.[45] Through the acquisition of Vanguard Health Systems, Tenet also acquired Abrazo Community Health Network the associated hospitals are located in Arizona.
Acquisitions and other operations (2014)[edit]
In 2014, Tenet ranked #229 in the annual Fortune 500 list of the largest American companies.[44] In March 2014, Tenet formed a partnership with the Yale New Haven Health System to create a healthcare delivery network in Connecticut.[46] Then in May 2014, Tenet announced plans to partner with the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso to develop a new 140-bed teaching hospital on the city’s west side.[47] Tenet launched MedPost Urgent Care in May 2014, which is a national network of urgent care centers based in the lower United States.[12] In June 2014, Tenet acquired a majority interest in Texas Regional Medical Center, a 70-bed community hospital in Sunnyvale, Texas, east of downtown Dallas.[48] Also that month, Tenet opened Resolute Health Hospital in New Braunfels, Texas. The 128-bed hospital is located on a 56-acre “wellness” campus near San Antonio, Texas, and is Tenet's 79th hospital and 19th in Texas.[8][49]
In July 2014 Tenet announced that Saint Mary's Hospital in Waterbury, Connecticut would be acquired by a subsidiary of the company, with the hospital's religious directives and uncompensated care policies remaining intact. This continued a trend of Tenet allowing a model of common ownership, where each acquired hospital has its own agreement conditions.[50] This deal, and three others Tenet had planned in the state, unraveled when Tenet expressed concern with the conditions on the sale set by the state of Connecticut. The Waterbury hospital was ultimately purchased by Trinity Health [51]
In late July 2014, Tenet signed a letter of intent to form a joint venture which would acquire and operate three hospitals in southern Arizona, two in Tucson and one in Nogales. In the agreement Tenet would be the majority owner and sole operator of the hospitals.[52]
On August 1, 2014 Tenet acquired Emanuel Medical Center,[7] a 209-bed hospital operated by the Swedish Evangelical Covenant Church located in Turlock, California,[53] bringing the number of Tenet's hospitals at the time to 80 nationwide.[7] Tenet announced in December 2014 that they had signed a letter of intent with the Baptist hospital system in Birmingham, Alabama to form a joint venture to own and operate the four Baptist hospitals plus Brookwood Medical Center, already owned by Tenet. Tenet would be the joint venture's majority owner.[54]
In May 2014, Tenet rebranded its diverse urgent care centers into a wholly owned subsidiary, MedPost Urgent Care. Previously, Tenet's urgent care locations often took on the names of nearby Tenet hospitals. Alan Cason, VP of Tenet's outpatient services, was named MedPost CEO. At the time, MedPost has 23 facilities, with six in Texas, and others in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee.[12][55]
As of the fourth quarter 2014, Tenet has turned a profit, explained by higher admissions and revenue (admissions through Medicaid increased by 20.5% after the Affordable Care Act). Hospital admissions also saw an increase during the last quarter of 2014, while the company's bad debt expense ratio decreased. At the same time, its full year financial projections affirmed a price of $1.32 to $2.4 per share with revenue of $17.4 to $17.7 billion,[56] with its earnings topping $1.95 billion.[57] On May 7, 2015, the Tenet board of directors appointed Trevor Fetter, Tenet's president and CEO, as chairman of the board.[58] In 2015, the company moved from No. 229 to No. 170 on the Fortune 500.[16]
Recent developments (2015-present)[edit]
In March 2015, Tenet announced an agreement to acquire a majority interest in United Surgical Partners International (USPI), which would make Tenet the largest operator of outpatient surgery centers in the United States. Tenet also announced an agreement to acquire Aspen Healthcare in Great Britain.[15] On June 16, Tenet finalized their acquisition of Aspen Healthcare Ltd. and USPI. The USPI transaction raised the number of outpatient centers operated by Tenet to over 400, over double what they had operated prior. It also again made Tenet a multinational company, as Tenet acquired nine British healthcare facilities.[3] Bill Wilcox remained CEO of USPI, with Kyle Burtnett of Tenet joining USPI as chief integration officer, among other roles. Through the deal, USPI will retain its independent branding.[3]
Early in September 2015,[59][60] Tenet acquired a majority interest in a three-hospital system in Tucson, Arizona, when Tenet, Dignity Health and Ascension Health formed a joint venture to own and operate Carondelet Health Network.[59][60] The three hospitals' names remained unchanged, with close to 1,000 new beds added to the Tenet healthcare system as a result.[59] The acquisition of Carondelet Health Network raised the total number of Tenet's general acute care hospitals to 83, and their number of short-stay surgical hospitals to 19.[60] On May 11, 2015, it was announced that the Tenet-operated Abrazo Health, acquired in 2013, had been renamed Abrazo Community Health Network.[61]
After first announcing the deal in March 2015,[62] in January 2016 Tenet Healthcare closed a deal to form a joint venture[63] with the non-profit organization[64] Baylor Scott and White Health, with plans for the joint venture to own and operate a number of hospitals in North Texas.[63] The hospitals,[63] which were all rebranded under the Baylor name over the coming months,[65] go by Baylor Scott & White Medical Center — Centennial,[65] Baylor Scott & White Medical Center – White Rock,[66] Baylor Scott & White Medical Center – Lake Pointe,[67] and Baylor Scott & White Medical Center – Sunnyvale.[68] On October 3, 2016, it was announced that Tenet had agreed to pay a $514 million settlement in an agreement with the Department of Justice.[4] According to the lawsuit filed in 2014, four hospitals then owned by Tenet had collaborated in a "kickback" scheme with Clinica de la Mama to increase hospital referrals of Medicaid patients,[6] with two of Tenet's former subsidiaries admitting to "conspiring to defraud Medicaid."[6] According to Modern Healthcare, as part of the agreement, the "federal government acknowledged that individuals at the hospitals withheld information from Tenet about the agreements and circumvented Tenet's policies and procedures to prevent such illegal conduct."[6]
Operations[edit]
As of October 2016, Tenet Healthcare Corporate employs approximately 130,000 people.[6] As of June 2015, Tenet operates six health care plans as well as Conifer Health Solutions, LLC, which provides healthcare business process services in the areas of revenue cycle management, value-based care and patient communications.[1] Through its brands, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and partnerships with companies such as United Surgical Partners International (USPI), Tenet operates a total of nine facilities in the United Kingdom.[1][54] Tenet also operates 470 outpatient centers[6] in the United States,[3] after the June 2015 acquisition of USPI almost doubled Tenet's prior count of 210 outpatient centers.[1][54][69][70] Also in the United States, Tenet operates 20 "short-stay"[2] surgical hospitals[3] and 79[6][2] general acute care hospitals.[3][7] Tenet-operated hospitals include four academic medical centers, two children’s hospitals, three specialty hospitals (one of which is temporarily closed for repairs)[71] and a critical access hospital, with a total of 20,814 licensed beds as of early 2015, serving primarily urban and suburban communities in 14 states.[1] In addition, Tenet subsidiaries own or lease and operate a number of medical office buildings, all located on or near Tenet hospital campuses.[3] Tenet subsidiaries also operate free-standing and provider-based outpatient centers in 16 states, including diagnostic imaging centers, ambulatory surgery centers, satellite emergency departments and urgent care centers. Tenet owns over 500 physician practices as well.[1]
Major brands[edit]
MedPost Urgent Care[edit]
In May 2014, Tenet launched MedPost Urgent Care, a national network of urgent care centers.[12] The launch was the result of Tenet rebranding its diverse urgent care centers into one company. Previously, Tenet's urgent care locations often took on the names of nearby Tenet hospitals. At the time of the rebranding, MedPost equaled 23 facilities, with six in Texas, and others in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee.[55] According to Dr. Melissa Molina, the medical director of MedPost, the most common injuries the clinics see are on the arms and ankles, many through minor falls and accidents. [72]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Tenet Healthcare has received numerous honors for executive and hospital leadership, nursing excellence, clinical quality, and recognition from insurers.[73] In 2013, the American Heart Association recognized Tenet as a “Platinum Fit-Friendly Company.”[74] Tenet’s board of directors was named the Outstanding Board of Directors for a Public Company by the Dallas Business Journal[75] in September 2014.[76]
The company's CEO Trevor Fetter has appeared several times on the “100 Most Influential People in Healthcare" list compiled by Modern Healthcare,[77] ranking No. 13 in 2014.[78] In 2011, Audrey Andrews, chief compliance officer at Tenet, was recognized as one of the “Top 25 Women in Healthcare" by Modern Healthcare.[79] Likewise, in 2014 their SVP and chief clinical officer, Dr. Kelvin Baggett, was named on the magazine's list of “50 Most Influential Physician Executives & Leaders.”[80] Tenet's CFO Dan Cancelmi was named CFO of the Year by the Dallas Business Journal in October 2014.[81]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2002, the Tenet Healthcare Foundation awarded a $1 million grant to provide financial support to Latino nursing students .[82] In 2004, Tenet Healthcare Foundation, Tenet’s charitable giving arm, awarded $2.78 million to support accelerated undergraduate and graduate nursing degree programs at five nursing colleges in Southern California, South Florida, Georgia and Texas.[83] In 2012, Tenet joined GE and Verizon in supporting the launch of the Clinton Health Matters Initiative, created by the William J. Clinton Foundation to build on its work on global health and childhood obesity.[84] In Tenet’s “2013 Sustainability Report: Tenet Cares,” the company stated that its support for local communities that year totaled $545 million in uncompensated care and $158 million in charity care.[45] In 2014, Tenet Healthcare was a presenting sponsor of the third annual Clinton Foundation Health Matters Conference in La Quinta, California.[85]
Controversies[edit]
Psychiatric fraud[edit]
In the early 1990s as National Medical Enterprises, the company was accused of committing fraud by admitting thousands of psychiatric patients who did not need hospitalization and then charging these patients inflated prices.[86] In 1991, the federal government investigated the company for fraud and conspiracy.[87] In 1993, law enforcement raided company offices in an attempt to show that the company was defrauding patients and insurance companies.[88] In 1994, the company paid $2.5 million to settle lawsuits from 23 patients at its psychiatric hospitals.[89] Again in 1994, National Medical Enterprises settled fraud charges with the United States and 28 states involving payments of a record $380 million at the time and federal guilty pleas on eight criminal counts by two of its units. The company also agreed to a 5-year corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.[90]
Unnecessary heart surgeries[edit]
Further information: Unnecessary health care
In the late 1990s through the early 2000s, Redding Medical Center (at the time, a Tenet-owned hospital), was investigated for performing unnecessary heart surgeries on over 600 patients. To settle these allegations, Tenet agreed to pay a $54 million fine to the federal government and the state of California, without admitting wrongdoing. This settlement did not preclude civil or criminal charges against individuals of the company.[91] In order for the hospital to continue receiving Medicare reimbursements, Tenet was compelled by federal regulators to sell the hospital which was subsequently renamed Shasta Regional Medical Center.[92] In 2004, Tenet paid an additional $395 million to 769 patients to settle litigation for the unnecessary surgeries.[93] The scandal and subsequent federal investigation are described in the book Coronary: A True Story of Medicine Gone Awry by author Stephen Klaidman.[94][95][96]
Medicare fraud[edit]
In June 2006, Tenet agreed to pay $725 million in cash and give up $175 million of Medicare payments for a total of $900 million in fees to resolve claims it defrauded the federal government for over-billing Medicare claims during the 1990s. To finance the settlement, they sold 11 hospitals in four states including Memorial Medical Center (see below).[97][98][99] In September of that year, Tenet entered into a 5-year corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.[32][33] That agreement expired on September 27, 2011.
Hurricane Katrina[edit]
In July 2006, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, Dr. Anna Pou and nurses Lori Budo and Cheri Landry, employees at Tenet-owned Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans, LA, were arrested after being charged by Louisiana Attorney General Charles Foti of second-degree murder in the deaths of four patients.[100] In August 2007, a New Orleans grand jury declined to indict the three women and a New Orleans judge expunged their arrest records. In July 2007, Dr. Pou sued Foti for defamation and damage to her career.[101] In June 2006, Tenet announced it planned to sell Memorial Medical Center and three other hospitals in the greater New Orleans area.[102] In July 2009, Gov. Bobby Jindal approved by a bill passed by the Louisiana Legislature to reimburse Pou’s legal fees, which totaled more than $450,000.[103][104]
Tax dodging and lobbying[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Tenet Healthcare for spending $3.43 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $48 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $415 million, and increasing executive pay by 19% to $24 million in 2010 for its top 5 executives.[105]
Florida pediatric heart surgery standards[edit]
In 2015, CNN reported that Tenet had lobbied the governor of Florida Rick Scott and Republican Party Florida legislators in order to remove hospital standard rules for pediatric heart surgeries, after one of its hospitals failed to meet standards. Both the officials and Tenet denied any wrongdoing, with Tenet stating to the press that "at no time have we discussed the pediatric cardiac standards with the governor or his office, or with any elected official or anyone on their staff... our opinion was not sought on the standards nor have we expressed a position on the possible repeal of the standards or the role of the Cardiac Technical Advisory Panel."[106] Florida Health released a statement indicating that the legal basis for the removal of pediatric surgery standards had been revoked in 2001. This revocation invalidated the standards and it was an oversight that they were not formally stricken from record until 2015.[107]

Meet Avicanna, The First Marijuana Company To Be Accepted Into Johnson & Johnson Innovation, JLABS @ TorontoBack to THC News

Share Story1:54PM ET 7/25/2017 BenzingaAs a cannabis-focused company, Avicanna did not know what the outcome would be when it applied to be part of JLABS @ Toronto. Yet, the company was delighted to make it, CEO Aras Azadian and LATAM Vice President Lucas Nosiglia told Benzinga in a recent interview.
A few things became clear early in our chat. First, these guys know about entrepreneurship and overcoming adversity; this is not their first (nor second) successful venture. Second, they understand the value of what CanopyBoulder’s Micah Tapman recently defined as “authentic relationships” for success. Third, big things can be accomplished with relatively little money.
Getting MJ Into JLABS
The story of how Avicanna was accepted into JLABS @ Toronto starts with Azadian and Justin Grant, PhD, MBA, a member of the former’s Scientific Advisory Board, and the research program manager of the STTARR Innovation Centre with Princess Margaret Cancer Centre at the University Health Network, the largest cancer center in Canada. The idea of approaching JLABS @ Toronto popped up during a conversation between the two; although it seemed like a long shot, they went for it. They really trusted their vision.
As background, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) Innovation, JLABS @ Toronto is a 40,000-square-foot life science innovation center located in MaRS Discovery District. The labs provide a flexible environment for startup companies pursuing new technologies and research platforms to advance medical care. Through a "no strings attached" model, Johnson & Johnson Innovation does not take an equity stake in the companies occupying JLABS, and the companies are free to develop products, either on their own or by initiating a separate external partnership with Johnson & Johnson Innovation or any other company.
“Our first approach with them was very positive,” Azadian told Benzinga. “However, we knew they had never accepted any cannabinoid companies before.”

The CEO and his team explained that Avicanna is not just a cannabinoid company but a biotech company involved in the cannabis space.
The pitch was convincing, and the company made it through to the first phase of interviews.
“They understood the business; they understood the approach; they understood the leveraging of different regulatory frameworks in the U.S. and Canada,” Azadian added. All of this got them into another interview stage and, eventually, after several filtering instances, Avicanna was accepted to be part of JLABS @ Toronto.
“Companies at JLABS are at the leading edge of their field,” Rebecca Yu, heads of JLABS Canada told Benzinga. “Avicanna is focused on innovative approaches and technologies, and was selected into JLABS based on meeting our stringent criteria for demonstrating compelling and credible science or technology that addresses a significant medical or market need.
“Selection into JLABS does not infer any special investments or rights assigned to J&J, and our no-strings attached model offers entrepreneurial companies and technologies the ability to access a network of resources and similar stage companies to help them reach their potential,” she added.
New Company, Proven Product Line
Before moving on, it’s time to properly introduce Avicanna and what they do.
Coming from a biotech background, Azadian had not only an understanding of the industry, but also what he’s called an “incredible network.” So, he decided to leverage these assets and create a biotech company that was focused on cannabinoids and cannabinoid delivery mechanisms.
“What we noticed was, there is a lot of sophistication with respect to cultivation in Canada. However, due to the legal landscape, there are limitations with respect to what licensed producers can do for R&D on advanced delivery mechanisms,” he explained. “With respect to the American landscape, even though (in specific States) producers can make the products and retail them in the medicinal and or recreational markets, there are limitations with what the federal government and the FDA will allow to be done clinically.
“There are gaps in the medical cannabis industries of the two countries that are, in my opinion, spearheading the evolution of the cannabis industry at a global level. So, we decided to leverage off of those gaps and be a multinational company that has the R&D, the product development, and the IP with market acceptance in the U.S., but bring that into a context where we can clinically develop it – and even collaborate with the top medical institutions in Canada.”

One of the early steps was a strategic partnership with Scientus Pharma, a licensed dealer that allows Avicanna to address these gaps, to manufacture and clinically develop its product line. Soon after, the biotech company went after the intellectual property for transdermal delivery mechanisms like patches and creams, and a number of other products, branding it as PURA ELEMENTS.

“We are now in the clinical development phase,” Azadian continued, pointing out the company is currently conducting animal trials to understand the actual bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of our products “We are conducting a spectrum of studies including safety, toxicology, and bioavailability to better understand each particular product.”
This is a double-sided effort. On the one hand, Avicanna wants to prove the medical effectiveness of its products. On the other hand, they want to enhance them through diverse collaborations with scientists, research facilities and institutions. Ultimately, the idea is to develop different products, with diverse cannabinoid and release profiles, aimed at specific ailments.

How The Patch Works
Intrigued by how Avicanna’s patches, creams and tinctures work, Benzinga asked for an explanation. How long to they take to act? Do they get you high or stoned?
“The transdermal technology is an effective delivery mechanism as it avoids the first pass metabolism and smoking. Because of its slow release profile, the patient is avoiding an extreme surge of cannabinoids,” Azadian answered.
“I personally have used the patches. I found with the THC in our 30 mg patch had minimal psychoactive effect, which was incredible because I had the desired medical relief.”
A Multinational Focus
A very important element to Avicanna’s business model and plan is international presence: They want to be early entrants in multiple nascent medical marijuana markets such as Colombia, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Chile, Brazil and Argentina.
“Since we first started with the venture, we’ve been noticing that companies, especially in Canada, are aiming at creating economies of scale for production, to prepare for the legalization of the recreational markets in 2018,” Nosiglia, who’s in charge of LATAM expansion, said. “Our model is lean and capex-low as we focus on strategic partnerships. We’ve managed to operate with our initial capital of C$1.6 million ($1.26 million) so far, leveraging our international networks to expand our footprint worldwide.”

So, what Nosiglia is working on right now is establishing the foundations to get into new markets as they roll out countrywide regulations beyond compassionate-use and exceptions in markets such as Argentina. Additionally, Avicanna has established a partnership in Colombia, which should allow them to cultivate and manufacture at a significant discount for local distribution and export.
“We decided to only raise what we needed and only tapped 40 strategic shareholders. The majority of them are investment bankers that are heavily invested in the industry or strategic investors, including ourselves – all of the founding partners have put in money as well. That was the first round,” Azadian concluded. “As we continue to progress and meet milestones we will be visiting future financing opportunities.”
Check back soon for part 2 of this article, where Nosiglia and Azadian will walk us through the largest opportunities in international markets. Why could Europe and Latin America prove valuable? What’s the problem with Spain? Are there opportunities left in Switzerland?
