What are analysts saying about Caterpillar stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Caterpillar stock: 
1. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "hard to imagine a robust surge" in the near term. Nevertheless, the mining and energy sector as a whole has "passed the lows," and the company is well positioned to capitalize on its status as a leader in capital equipment and engines — when an upturn eventually arrives.Meanwhile, Caterpillar's cost-cutting initiatives, headcount reductions, improved sourcing and shuttering or consolidating more than 30 factories will reduce fixed costs by nearly $2 billion, the analyst continued. Also, the company can save another $750 million from the closings of two factories in Belgium and Illinois while incentive compensation fell by more than $1 billion since peaking in 2014 at $1.3 billion.Last, Caterpillar's new CEO Jim Umpleby is likely to focus on profitability, free cash flow, and returns as opposed to the recent CEO Doug Oberhelman who focused on penetrating new markets and gaining market share. As such, the company should now be viewed as "a whole different animal." (7/24/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Caterpillar’s May sales rose 8%, an improvement from 1% growth witnessed in the last two months thanks to continual improvement in Asia Pacific. It remains to be seen whether this momentum will be sustained as even though commodity prices have improved lately, it is not sufficient to drive a relevant increase in short-term demand for new equipment. Caterpillar guides revenues in the range of $38–$41 billion and earnings of $3.75 per share for 2017, a 2% and 10% year–over-year growth, respectively. In construction, Asia Pacific is showing promise while leading indicators of U.S. construction signal robust conditions ahead. The company’s efforts to reduce costs will help boost margins. Year to date, the stock has outperformed the Zacks sub industry. Also, it has a positive record of earnings surprises." (7/14/2017)
3. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Cost cuts continue to benefit margins despite ongoing market weakness. 4Q16 earnings, ex. adjustments, were better than expected on favorable decremental margins in Construction and E&T versus modeled expectations. With FX remaining a headwind CAT lowered the mid-point of the 2017 revenue guide to $37.5bln (prior: ~$38bln) resulting in EPS of $2.90 (Consensus: $3.06). Shares continue to trade above 30x earnings, a premium to prior cycles." (1/27/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Sell Ratings, 10 Hold Ratings, 9 Buy Ratings, 1 Strong Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.41)Consensus Price Target: $103.06 (9.67% downside)

Principles





Hudock Capital’s Core Principles
Every member of our firm is guided by our core set principles.  Every decision we make, every action we take, is informed by these principles.  Hudock Capital’s core principles are the cornerstone of our relationship with you.
I. Clients’ Interests Comes First
We are committed to do what is right for the client sometimes at the expense of our own profitability.
II. Integrity
We pledge to always do the right thing even when no one is watching.
“Character is doing the right thing when no one is watching.”  – J.C. Watts
III. Respect for the Individual
We show respect for the individual whether our colleagues or our clients.  Everyone has substantial qualities.  We honor these, indeed, with awe.
“The more deeply you understand other people the more you will appreciate them, the more reverent you will feel about them.  To touch the soul of another human being is to walk on holy ground.”  – Stephen Covey
IV. Kindness
We always remember compassion and empathy in whatever we do.
“Our secret mission is that when clients, team members, and community members enter our office, they are magically transported to a world that is kinder and gentler, warmer and friendlier, and where their dreams come true.”  – Barbara Hudock
V. Teamwork
We work together as individuals within our company, on teams within our company, and with our clients for win/win solutions.
“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.”  – Margaret Meade
VI. Community Involvement
We give back to our communities both in time and treasure, because it’s the right thing to do.
“We are here not merely to make a living, but to enrich the world.”  – Woodrow Wilson
VII. Continuing Education
We continue to educate ourselves and our clients to maintain up-to-date and time-tested strategies within our industry.
“We can’t become what we need to be by remaining what we are.”  – Oprah Winfrey
VIII. Commitment to Excellence
Because we value our employees and our clients, we strive to perform at our best at all times and in all ways.
“The point of the struggle is not just to survive, but to build an enterprise that makes such a distinctive impact on the world it touches, and does so with such supreme performance, that it would leave a gaping hole—a hole that could not be easily filled by any other institution, if it ceased to exist.”  – Jim Collins
Esse Quam Videri
“To be rather than to seem.”

Zacks Investment Research lowered shares of CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research report released on Monday morning. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
Other equities research analysts have also issued reports about the company. Jefferies Group LLC  restated a buy rating and issued a $38.00 price target on shares of CA in a research report on Friday, April 28th.

Four equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have issued  a hold rating and five have issued  a buy rating to the stock. CA presently has an average rating of Hold and an average target price of $35.10.
