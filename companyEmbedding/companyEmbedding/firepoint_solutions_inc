From Our Clients
Don’t take our word for it. See what others say about Firepoint






I’ve been purchasing Pay Per Click leads for the last decade.  Firepoint’s leads are by far the least expensive and highest quality I’ve ever seen.  They matched my Commissions Inc. price per lead in the first month and I had a client under contract my second month after starting with Firepoint.  I get more good phone numbers from Firepoint leads than any other vendor I’ve worked with.  I highly recommend Firepoint for lead generation.

 
Ron Petzel




















Firepoint is taking the industry by storm. The transparency in PPC campaigns is particularly unique. I’ve used other systems and they are only willing to share the number of leads and the average cost per lead. With Firepoint, you have a say in how the ad budget is spent. You can decide if you want 100 $4 leads, 40 $10 leads or 10 $40 dollar leads. For the first time, a company is transparent and collaborative with how to run my PPC campaign. Also, with Firepoint, I can instantly see how much I’m spending on one lead source and put them in order from best to worst ROI.

 
Rob Kittle#1 Team in Fort Collins, 311 homes sold last year






















I run a large team which is driven by our Inside Sales department. Firepoint allows us to automate follow-up campaigns and tasks, and track the entire conversion process. Our Inside Sales Agents (ISA’s) can assign leads to agents, see exactly what is and isn’t being completed, and where balls might be dropping. The accountability page allows me to keep an eye on my team and see if anyone is falling behind in their work. And tracking my ROI with the reporting feature helps me sleep at night and make wise decisions about future spending.

 
Chad Madlom#1 Real Estate Agent in Colorado, 402 homes sold 






















I interviewed (demoed) all the major companies before selecting Firepoint in December of 2016. I had a set budget and because Firepoint had a slightly lower platform price, it allowed me to spend much more on my PPC campaign than had I gone with another, more expensive CRM. My results have been astounding. 16 days in and I have 61 leads in my CRM, all but 10 from my pay per click campaign. I have taken 1 active listing, and they will be buying. I am working with 4 oth er buyers. Out of the other 61, many others are responsive and we have made plans over the next few months to meet. People visit my site repeatedly, daily and it’s so fun to wake up each day and see who is online, opening my emails. It is work, and I follow up with text and calls like crazy but it works if you follow up. People love my search site! One of my leads that was NOT from my PPC was from someone who “shared” it with a family member on Facebook!



Angela Cutter




















Being the #1 producer in my market means I have to always stay on the cutting edge of technology. I paid an arm and a leg for the old systems I was using, AND I had to wait months to see any progress or new features. With Firepoint, I’m not breaking the bank, and I see improvements rolling out every week.

 
Damon Gettier#1 Team in Central and Southwest Virginia, 226 homes sold last year






















With 6 offices/teams and 800 transactions closed in a year, we needed to automate our business and see exactly what our conversion rates and ROIs were. At one point we were using 6 different platforms, but now with Firepoint, we can see everything we need in our business in just one program.

 
Thom DallmanUp to 800 homes sold per year






















I’d like to thank Firepoint for the impeccable customer service! I had an issue of a listing not appearing on my site. Within 30 mins at 9:30pm a Rep was working to resolve the problem. And on Monday my Account Rep called to follow up to make sure all was well. 5 STAR customer service is very rare these days. Firepoint Client Care goes the extra mile!



Josh Foster




















I chose Firepoint after conducting in-depth research on them and their competitors. The IDX website works seamlessly for our clients and we constantly receive compliments from new leads. In just two months, their transparent PPC practices gave us a consistent flow of leads that would normally take six months to realize.

Firepoint’s dedication to their clients is unmatched from our experience in the real estate industry. Our account manager is responsive and attentive, and functions as an extension of our team. As a company built by actual agents, their team understands our needs and consistently delivers on their promises.

 
Alex Acuff




















Firepoint helped me easily transition from another system I was using and now I can manage all of my team’s leads, tasks, and past clients in one place. Our other lead sources come into Firepoint automatically so my agents never have to log into another system. Firepoint increased my company’s productivity and systematically changed the way I manage my business.

 
Jeffrey Chubb#1 RE/MAX Agent in Boston, MA






















We run a team that produces 250+ sales per year, so we need a system that keeps us efficient, organized, and that helps us effectively communicate. With Firepoint, we love being able to assign multiple team members to a lead, including agents, loan officers, and staff, and that everyone on the team can see all communication with the lead. The feature I lean on the most though is the accountability page – If I could have one person just watch that page 24/7.. I would.

 
Homer & Rachael Tyre#1 Team in Greenville, NC






















Firepoint has revolutionized my business. Having been on two other top systems and CRM’s, I immediately saw the value in what the Firepoint team created. What I love most is that this system was created by real estate professionals, not just web developers who thought they knew the needs of agents. Every serious agent or team owner needs to be on this system.

 
Bruce Hill




















Firepoint was a game changer for us. Operating on multiple platforms made us inefficient. After switching to Firepoint, our productivity increased 25-50%. Now I can’t imagine running our team without Firepoint’s lead distribution rules – they are much more robust than a simple round robin approach. I believe that Firepoint is THE all-in-one solution for the real estate industry.

 
Saul Zenkevicius#34 Team in the U.S., 300-500 homes sold per year






















My background is with high producing teams and expensive lead generation systems. After recently going solo, I realized I couldn’t afford some of the bigger CRMs and looked for a more economical solution. I also wanted to work with a company that was started by people in the real estate industry and not just by “techy” people. After much research I stumbled upon Firepoint and decided to give it a try. I was prepared to “get what you pay for”, but my experience has been the exact opposite. I get a great amount of leads on a small budget, and the customer service is out of this world! I’m always able to get in touch with the company and they’re always excited to hear new suggestions. Firepoint has surpassed the level of service from any of the bigger systems I’ve used. I’m a very satisfied client!

 
Cassie Springer




















Firepoint is amazing! It’s a lot faster than the other system I was using and has more accountability features than any CRM out there. Now that my team is using Firepoint, we’re increasing our conversion rate on the same number of leads. I’m excited about where Firepoint is heading.

You've never seen lead gen like this

Whether you love or hate your current lead gen system – or even if you’ve never used one before – Firepoint offers what no one else does.







Highlights & Features






Customer Service

								With Firepoint, you will experience customer service like never before. From prompt responses to technical concerns, to monthly reviews of your campaigns, all the way to personalized training for you and your team, we deliver what you need.															





Honesty & Integrity

								Our competitors have at least one thing in common – when you ask them to build you something, or you have an idea of how to make the system better… they tell you no. Well not here at Firepoint… we exist for you and for you alone. We love hearing ideas on how to make your life easier or how to help make better use of your time, and even more than hearing about it – we love building it!															





Success Coaching

								We will give you access to industry leading coaching free of charge, You heard right – free of charge. So not only will you get a Success Coach that is designated to you in order to help you be successful, but you will get access to resources from some of the top coaching organizations in the nation!															







AccountabilityNever again wonder whether an agent or lender is doing their job. With real time agent tracking, you can see every e-mail sent, every call made, and even every agent’s average time to first action. We make it easy to get those agents squared away.
Fully Customizable DashboardEvery single system out there tells you what you have to look at each and every day when you log into your system. The keyword there is YOUR system. You work in it every day, so who are we to tell you what you want to see? Now YOU get to decide what goes on YOUR dashboard, and more importantly what doesn’t.
Goal TrackerTired of looking at those freakishly long call lists and wondering how many people to call every day? Well we take all the guesswork out of it with the Goal Tracker. You tell us how much money you want to make, and we tell you how much business you will need to do in order to make it happen – all based on your actual business performance.
 



 





Phase 2 is already on the way

We have surprises that nobody has thought of yet – features to make your life easier, and your bank account will like it too!






VIDEOS

								With our campaign capability, you will be able to set up entire drip campaigns with just video or simply add a video to an already existing e-mail campaign! Bottom line is that response rates are almost 50% better for video drips than for e-mail campaigns. Just don’t tell our competitors, they haven’t caught on yet.															




REPORTS

								Let’s just say that you will have more reports than you know what to do with. As a team manager, you will have access to forecasting reports, reports that tell you how much money each agent is making you, reports that tell you how each of your lead generation source are doing, and so much more… over 35 to be exact. We have taken reporting to a place that NOBODY has dared to go.															







TITLE REPS





								We select only a few title reps in each market to participate in our title rep referral program. Just think, if one of your current teams/agents or a team/agent you want to get in front of was able to gain access to industry leading software and lead generation for literally thousands less than everyone else pays… just because they know you! And the best part is there is absolutely no cost to you at all. Call us to find out if there are still spots open in your area.

Who We Are

















We listen, we care, we serve.

In 2011, CINC was founded on the encouragement of some of the nation’s top brokers and mega-team leaders in order to address a gaping hole in real estate technology. In a few short years and several thousand clients later, CINC has become the fastest growing real estate technology platform in the industry to date. 
Built on a solid foundation of strong core values, CINC has built a team of dedicated, talented and passionate individuals that are 100% bought into the mission of providing real estate agents more closings, more efficiently with the best support and technology in an all-in-one conversion engine.  



It is our goal to build a platform that can efficiently and effectively run any size real estate company: from marketing to lead generation, contract to closing. We listen to what our clients want and need. We care about their feedback, their production, and their success. We are here to help ensure their real estate goals become a reality.
CINC is not just a company serving its clients. CINC is a close-knit family built on the premise of constant innovation and impeccable service. If you would like to learn about joining our team, or experience our all-in-one conversion engine, please don’t hesitate to reach out.





We innovate & constantly improve.
Driven by the wants and needs of our clients, CINC is dedicated to building, innovating and improving our technology solution to effectively and efficiently run any size real estate company. Change is a constant and we aim to be the most up-to-date and intuitive piece of software to run every part of a real estate business from a single login.  




We do whatever it takes.
Meet ‘WIT’, the CINC mascot. Adopted during a competitive team night out at Dave & Busters, WIT took his place in the office to remind the team to always give 110% to every client, every project, every situation always giving wow-service and a memorable experience. 



We practice work life balance.
As we get caught up in our day-to-day, it’s important to remember to not only work hard, but play hard. Life is about the journey and no matter what, we all need to take time to sit back, relax and enjoy how far we’ve come.






We face challenges with optimism.
One question: If we had to make it work, how would we? It’s not about the challenge, it’s about rallying together for a possible solution. Although things don’t always go as planned, no challenge is ever impossible. 


We own the problem and solve it.
Life happens and it’s not always easy, nor smooth. Whatever obstacle may come our way, we take it head on and figure out the best way through it. It’s not about being perfect, it’s about being resourceful and coming up with the best solution.


We check our egos at the door.
We are driven to achieve results because of our purpose, not our egos. It’s a collective team effort to provide the best product, service and experience to all our clients without worrying about who get’s credit. 





We engage in open, real communication.
Open to collaboration, the CINC team is all about real and honest communication and feedback. It’s important for us to cultivate an environment of trust that builds camaraderie and sparks creativity without fear or disapproval.
    




We believe in people and their dreams.
If you believe it, you can achieve it and we are right here with you to make any dream a reality. Personal or professional goals are made public in order to push every one of our team members to be and achieve anything they deem possible.
