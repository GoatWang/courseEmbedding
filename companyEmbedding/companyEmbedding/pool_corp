Pool Financing
We helped finance over $90 Million with our LightStream Program!
"[Not only] has my business has seen a dramatic increase in our closure ratio with our new pool sales..." 
 Read More"Since implementing the LightStream Unsecured Financing Program, my business has seen a dramatic increase in our closure ratio with our new pool sales. Not only are we selling more swimming pools because of LightStream, my clients have nothing but positive feedback for me. Every time a client uses LightSteam, they tell me how great the staff was to work with, how easy they made the process & were amazed how fast the funding process was. I have and will continue to use LightSteam as my only financing option to further my business and help my clients achieve their dream of pool ownership.
I am very excited to see how LightStream will grow our industry in the coming years. Using LightStream over the past year has not only grown my business, it has helped many of my clients achieve their dream of pool ownership. LightStream is a fast and painless process for my clients; the best financing option available to our industry."
Cory J. Reeder - Genesis Pools, Inc.
"By having this type of program available, we have been able to build pools for families that might have otherwise not been able to…"
 Read More"In addition to having a link to "LightStream" on our website, we do tell each prospect we are working with about the program. The interest is always positive. Due to the past poor housing market and many homeowners losing valuable equity in their homes, the idea of an unsecured financing option is very appealing. We have found there are many people with excellent credit and income, but not a lot of home equity. By having this type of program available, we have been able to build pools for families that might have otherwise not been able to, or, at best, would have had to wait.The feedback from the customers has all been encouraging. They have shared with us that the application process was simple, the response time quick, and funding sooner than expected. One of our customers works for a local bank and had planned to use that bank for the financing. As an option, they went on our website and used the link to LightStream and applied. They said it was quick and easy. We built them a pool last summer and it was financed through the LightStream program! Thanks for having this option available. We plan to continue promoting the program!"
Mark Richgels - Atlantis Pools, Inc.

Disclaimer:


Cautionary Statement for Purposes of the "Safe Harbor" Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
________________________________________

Matters discussed in this website contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties.  Forward-looking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events, including projections of future performance, statements of management's plans and objectives, future contracts, and forecasts of trends and other matters. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "believe," "will likely result," "outlook," "project" and other words and expressions of similar meaning.  No assurance can be given that the results in any forward-looking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors, which could cause them to differ materially.  For these statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

Certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements include the following: 


the seasonality of our business and the sensitivity of the industry to weather conditions
intense competition and low barriers to entry in the industry
sensitivity of the industry to general economic and market conditions
our ability to:
penetrate new markets
identify appropriate acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms and successfully integrate acquired businesses
obtain short-term and long-term financing on satisfactory terms
generate sufficient cash flows to support expansion plans and general operating activities
maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships
identify and divest assets which do not continue to create value consistent with our objectives
changes in laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations)
changes in environmental, health and safety regulations and our ability to comply with such regulations
the risk of fire, safety and casualty losses and related liability claims inherent in the storage of the chemicals that we sell
acts of war or terrorist incidents
changes in public and consumer taste
future litigation or governmental proceedings
labor disputes


The foregoing factors are not exhaustive and new factors may emerge which impact our business.  It is impossible for us to predict all such factors.  Therefore, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual future results.  We cannot guarantee that any future event or result will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Should additional risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from those anticipated. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements. 


We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of subsequent events, new information or otherwise.

Pool Corp Tradeshow










Swimming Pool Products: Pool Corp. Trade show
CL Industries’ products are sold mainly through a network of distributors. Our largest distribution partner is Pool Corp (and its subsidiaries; SCP, Superior Pool Products, and General Pool & Spa Supply). Every year in Dallas, Texas, Pool Corp puts on its International Sales Conference, which functions essentially as an internal pool industry product trade show. This allows its vendors to showcase their latest products all at once. It also provides the Pool Corp salesforce the education necessary to successfully represent their vendors. Over 1,000 Pool Corp employees attend the show every year.
New Booth design in action at the Hilton Anatole in Dallas.
CL Industries is a VIP Vendor, and one of our benefits is dedicated booth space at the show. We decided that this year would be a good year to redesign our booth so that it reflects our new visual branding. Our goal was to create a comfortable lounge like environment within our booth. Selling our products is all about creating strong relationships, and we wanted people to feel relaxed when they visited our booth. We overhauled the entire booth; adding new couches, branded pillows, a coffee table with a stainless steel tub (to fill with water and display our product samples), high boy cocktail tables, flat screen TV, custom rug and all new banners. We are pleased with the results, and everyone who visited the booth complimented us on the redesign.
Monday Night Football on the flat screen, go Saints!
The show is filled with activities, great food, product demonstrations, sales meetings, awards ceremonies, and every evening is capped of with a cocktail ‘hour’. On Monday and Tuesday evenings Pool Corp dedicated one of the open bars to be set up at our booth. Two members of our marketing team accompanied the sales staff this year at our booth, and they were able to get the Monday Night football game (New Orleans vs. Miami) hooked up on our new TV. With Pool Corp being headquartered just outside of New Orleans we had a pretty solid crowd at our booth all night. Overall this year’s show was a big success for us at CL Industries. After undergoing a complete brand reinvention it was important for us to showcase our new messaging and image to our biggest customer.

The swimming pool and lifestyle product maker, Pool Corporation (POOL  -  Free Report)	, posted mixed second-quarter 2017 results, wherein the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the bottom line lagged the same.Notably, share price of the company plunged 9.4% in yesterday’s trading session following the release.  Quarter DiscussionPool’s second-quarter earnings of $2.21 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.24 by 1.3%. However, the figure rose 11.6% on a year-over-year basis.Net sales came in at $988.2 million, marking an increase of 8% year over year. Sales growth in certain product categories reflects the ongoing recovery in the remodel and replacement sectors of its business as well as its consistent market share gains.Continued growth in consumer discretionary spending also acted as a tailwind to the company’s top line. As a result, sales outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $982.7 million by 0.6%.Behind the Headline NumbersPool reports operations under two segments – the Base Business segment (constituting majority portion of the business) and the Excluded segment (sale centers excluded from base business).The Base business segment witnessed sales growth of 7% year over year on the back of increases in swimming pool repair and remodel activities, including major pool refurbishment and replacement of key pool equipment.Meanwhile, the company’s gross margin in the second quarter was 29.3%, down 20 basis points (bps) year over year due to changes in customer and product mix. However, gross profit increased 7% year over year to a record $289.7 million, with base business gross profit increasing 6%.Additionally, selling and administrative expenses (operating expenses) increased approximately 6% year over year to $135.5 million in the reported quarter, with base business operating expenses increasing 5%. The upside was primarily driven by seasonally higher growth-driven labor and freight expenses as well as higher employee-related insurance costs.While the operating margin increased 10 bps year over year to 15.6%, operating income jumped $154.2 million, up 8% from the year-ago quarter.Pool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Pool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pool Corporation QuoteEarnings Guidance for 2017Pool reiterated its previously issued guidance for 2017 of earnings within the range of $4.12–$4.32 per share.Zacks Rank & Peer ReleasesPool currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Among other stocks in the same industry, Polaris Industries Inc. (PII  -  Free Report)	 recently reported strong second-quarter 2017 results with both the bottom and the top line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Meanwhile, Brunswick Corporation (BC  -  Free Report)	 and West Marine, Inc. (WMAR  -  Free Report)	 are expected to release the quarterly numbers on Jul 27. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s EPS is pegged at $1.34 for Burnswick, and 89 cents for West Marine.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1 HP Hayward Pump
By William E


"I purchased this pump and it was delivered in 2 days from the time the order was placed.  It installed in just about 1 hour and runs very quiet.  It  delivers plenty of water for a 10000 gal in-ground pool.  It is a far better pump than the old one it replaced.  "

Nava 3" Chlorinating Tablets



















Nava 3" Chlorinating Tablets



 

More Views

























Nava Chlorinating 3” Tablets are EPA approved, made in the USA, and not diluted or blended. This means they have the maximum possible level of Available Chlorine, 90%. Available Chlorine is the active ingredient that makes your swimming pool water safe, clean and clear. These 3” Chlorinating tabs are stabilized against the UV in sunlight to ensure the water remains safer for longer. Each tab is individually wrapped to make handling easier.
Directions for Use:
With pump running, place one (1) tablet per 10,000 gallons pool water every week into a suitable feeder like a floating dispenser or directly into a skimmer basket or automatic chlorinator. 
Repeat additions until a residual of 1-3 ppm chlorine is established as determined by the use of a test kit. Regular use of a test kit is necessary to determine when it is necessary to add another dose of this product to maintain a residual of 1-3 ppm available chlorine in the pool water. 
After use of this product it is recommended that a preventative algae treatment be added on a weekly basis.

Pool Financing
We helped finance over $90 Million with our LightStream Program!
"[Not only] has my business has seen a dramatic increase in our closure ratio with our new pool sales..." 
 Read More"Since implementing the LightStream Unsecured Financing Program, my business has seen a dramatic increase in our closure ratio with our new pool sales. Not only are we selling more swimming pools because of LightStream, my clients have nothing but positive feedback for me. Every time a client uses LightSteam, they tell me how great the staff was to work with, how easy they made the process & were amazed how fast the funding process was. I have and will continue to use LightSteam as my only financing option to further my business and help my clients achieve their dream of pool ownership.
I am very excited to see how LightStream will grow our industry in the coming years. Using LightStream over the past year has not only grown my business, it has helped many of my clients achieve their dream of pool ownership. LightStream is a fast and painless process for my clients; the best financing option available to our industry."
Cory J. Reeder - Genesis Pools, Inc.
"By having this type of program available, we have been able to build pools for families that might have otherwise not been able to…"
 Read More"In addition to having a link to "LightStream" on our website, we do tell each prospect we are working with about the program. The interest is always positive. Due to the past poor housing market and many homeowners losing valuable equity in their homes, the idea of an unsecured financing option is very appealing. We have found there are many people with excellent credit and income, but not a lot of home equity. By having this type of program available, we have been able to build pools for families that might have otherwise not been able to, or, at best, would have had to wait.The feedback from the customers has all been encouraging. They have shared with us that the application process was simple, the response time quick, and funding sooner than expected. One of our customers works for a local bank and had planned to use that bank for the financing. As an option, they went on our website and used the link to LightStream and applied. They said it was quick and easy. We built them a pool last summer and it was financed through the LightStream program! Thanks for having this option available. We plan to continue promoting the program!"
