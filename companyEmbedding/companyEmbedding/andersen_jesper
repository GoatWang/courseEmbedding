Christiania Redesign
A Redesign for the freetown Christiania's website, made as a school exam project, a project that turned out to be quite challenging.






PDF Portfolio
A Portfolio about me, but not a web version, instead a portfolio as a .pdf. A different approach that I hope you check out!






Design Culture Now!
A Poster designer for Design Culture Now. This was a school project made individually. The outcome is truly amazing! 






Retramp
A group assignment about redesigning the art gallery Retramp's Website. The Redesign surely brought life to Retramp!

Energy Efficient Replacement Windows: Affordable Windows, Projects and Options
By Nicole Seaton

					One of the smartest and cost-effective ways to save money on your monthly bills is to replace the windows in your home. Compared to other expensive and time-consuming home improvements, window replacement is an upgrade that can help retain the heat in your home and greatly minimize your heating bill. If you live in an older residence, you might have single-pane windows that do not have today's innovative technology that keeps the cold out and the warmth inside. In the summer months, modern windows perform the opposite function: some even have special protection against ultraviolet rays, deflecting the sun on the hottest summer days.
				










Double the pane equals financial gain

					The first consideration in upgrading your windows is, "Single or double-pane?" Although single-pane windows are less expensive, double pane windows offer added protection from the heat and cold, and they also protect your home from dust, debris and pests. You might think that you're saving money by purchasing cheap windows, but if you spend a little more, you'll see an instant return on your investment: when you open your next power bill! High-quality, modern double pane windows should adhere to industry standards set by the National Fenestration Rating Council. If your windows have an NFRC label, you can be sure they are high-quality windows that can last for generations.
				

					Windows with multiple panes can be filled with gases like krypton and argon, which helps reduce heat loss and increases R-values, or resistance to heat loss. The higher the R-value, the better your new windows can protect against heat loss. Another factor to consider is the window's U-value, or its resistance to heat transfer. When researching window options, both R-value and U-value information should be available for the entire window: some manufacturers only offer this information for the middle of the window.
				

					There are many styles of modern windows to choose from, but not every option may fit your budget. Some options companies offer don't necessarily make a difference in savings. For instance, window companies might try to talk you into double pane windows with more than one inch between the windows. While this space between the windows creates better insulation, more than an inch does not make for more energy efficient windows- it's actually wasted space.
				










Window companies and installers: get multiple estimates before buying

					Now is a great time to find affordable windows that meet your budget. Many window companies will come directly to your home to show you the different kinds of replacement windows and window materials. It's a good idea to get more than one estimate: some companies have seasonal sales or special incentives for first-time customers. By shopping around, you'll be able to find energy efficient, affordable windows.
				

					Whether you are hiring a professional contractor to install your new windows or you're armed with do-it-yourself know-how, the more research you do, the better prepared you will be to choose the best windows for your location, time frame and budget. The effects of new home windows are immediate: they increase the value and aesthetic appeal of your home while efficiently maintaining a comfortable temperature. By making this simple and cost-effective improvement to your home, you will reap the visual and financial rewards for years to come.
