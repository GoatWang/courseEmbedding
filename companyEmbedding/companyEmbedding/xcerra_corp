Company Profile

About Xcerra Corporation

Enabling our customers to win with affordable and reliable products


		Handling, contacting and measurement solutions

		Innovative and cost effective products


Our mission is to create and deliver the most innovative and cost effective handling, contacting and measurements solutions to the electronics industry, enabling our customers to win with affordable and reliable products that continuously improve people‘s lives.

	Xcerra Corporation is the parent company of four powerful brands that have been supplying innovative products and services to the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industry for more than 30 years. Xcerra’s four brands are atg-Luther & Maelzer, Everett Charles Technologies, LTX-Credence, and Multitest.

	Xcerra Corporation was formed in 2014 following the LTX-Credence acquisition of Everett Charles Technologies (ECT) and Multitest from Dover Corporation in December of 2013. The strategic vision of the LTX-Credence management team in making these acquisitions was to build a company with a greater share of the semiconductor test cell market. Acquiring these assets allowed the Company to achieve this goal,as well as expand into additional vertical markets related to printed circuit board test and test fixtures. A key component of the long term growth strategy for Xcerra is to offer differentiated semiconductor test products and services that include providing customers a fully integrated test cell solution directly to their production floor. This strategy allows customers to procure key components of the test cell such as the tester, handler, contactors and interface boards, from a single supplier and to take delivery of a turnkey solution directly into their high volume manufacturing environment. This strategy reduces risk for the customer associated with doing the test cell integration themselves and has the added benefit of accelerating their ability to get new products to market faster. 

	Even as the Company offers new products and services for an entire test cell solution, each brand is still chartered with developing best-in-class products for the markets they serve. Customers have the flexibility to purchase one of Xcerra’s products, or an entire test cell solution.  Either way, our customers receive the same level of attention and support from Xcerra.

	While the semiconductor capital equipment market is the largest driver of Xcerra’s business, the acquisition of Everett Charles Technologies expanded the Company into vertical markets associated with PCB testing. Within ECT there is another business, atg- Luther & Maelzer. atg-LM has been in business for more than 30 years providing test systems for bare board PCB test.

	After a printed circuited board has been manufactured, atg-LM testers are used to verify point to point continuity. There are two different types of test technology applied to bare board PCB testing, universal grid and flying probe. atg-LM has a leadership position in the flying probe tester market.

	ECT also provides fixture design, development and fabrication services for the in-circuit and functional test of assembled PCBs. ECT provides these services on a global basis and is the market leader. ECT also markets a wide range of pins and compliant connectors used in many different types of test applications but also in market segments completely outside of test.

	 
Measured by the Customer’s Success 

	As a new company, Xcerra Corporation offers a broad range of products and services to the semiconductor and printed circuit board test markets. It has a global service and support network designed to be highly responsive to customer needs regardless of location or time. Our primary goal as a Company is simply to help our customers succeed. We accomplish that goal by developing innovative products and services and delivering them through our global sales and support network second to none.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

The Everett Charles Technologies Fixtures and Services Group is the world’s leading manufacturer and customizer of fixtures for testing loaded printed circuit boards. ECT was the first to provide a patented ESD protection process to our fixture products and many other fixture technologies that are now considered “industry standard” including Zero-Flex, Guided Probe, Receptacle Alignment plates, and Board Stress Analysis.


As circuit boards become more densely populated and designs become more complex, test facilities are under increasing pressure to develop test systems, processes and fixtures which keep production ahead of schedule. ECT developed our Smart File processing to create a virtual PCBA and automate the fixture design process for improved accuracy and reliability. Now it is possible to simplify the inherent fixturing complexities associated with the ever-increasing number of test points and specialty board designs. Test engineers who specify products from ECT’s Test Fixture Group are realizing unprecedented improvements in fixture accuracy.

Affordable and reliable products

Xcerra Corporation
Enabling our customers to win with affordable and reliable products

handling, contacting and measurement solutions
innovative and cost effective products


Our mission is to create and deliver the most innovative and cost effective handling, contacting and measurements solutions to the electronics industry, enabling our customers to win with affordable and reliable products that continuously improve people‘s lives.


Xcerra Corporation is the parent company of four powerful brands that have been supplying innovative products and services to the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industry for more than 30 years. Xcerra’s four brands are atg-Luther & Maelzer, Everett Charles Technologies, LTX-Credence, and Multitest.
Xcerra Corporation was formed in 2014 following the LTX-Credence acquisition of Everett Charles Technologies (ECT) and Multitest from Dover Corporation in December of 2013. The strategic vision of the LTX-Credence management team in making these acquisitions was to build a company with a greater share of the semiconductor test cell market. Acquiring these assets allowed the Company to achieve this goal,


as well as expand into additional vertical markets related to printed circuit board test and test fixtures. A key component of the long term growth strategy for Xcerra is to offer differentiated semiconductor test products and services that include providing customers a fully integrated test cell solution directly to their production floor. This strategy allows customers to procure key components of the test cell such as the tester, handler, contactors and interface boards, from a single supplier and to take delivery of a turnkey solution directly into their high-volume manufacturing environment. This strategy reduces risk for the customer associated with doing the test cell integration themselves and has the added benefit of accelerating their ability to get new products to market faster.


Four Powerful Brands: Joined Solutions and Dedicated Products
Even as the Company offers new products and services for an entire test cell solution, each brand is still chartered with developing best-in-class products for the markets they serve. Customers have the flexibility to purchase one of Xcerra’s products, or an entire test cell solution.  Either way, our customers receive the same level of attention and support from Xcerra.
While the semiconductor capital equipment market is the largest driver of Xcerra’s business, the acquisition of Everett Charles Technologies expanded the Company into vertical markets associated with PCB testing. Within ECT there is another business, atg- Luther & Maelzer. atg-LM has been in business for more than 30 years providing test systems for bare board PCB test.

After a printed circuited board has been manufactured, atg-LM testers are used to verify point to point continuity. There are two different types of test technology applied to bare board PCB testing, universal grid and flying probe. atg-LM has a leadership position in the flying probe tester market.
ECT also provides fixture design, development and fabrication services for the in-circuit and functional test of assembled PCBs. ECT provides these services on a global basis and is the market leader. ECT also markets a wide range of pins and compliant connectors used in many different types of test applications but also in market segments completely outside of test.


Measured by Our Customer’s Success
Xcerra Corporation offers a broad range of products and services to the semiconductor and printed circuit board test markets. It has a global service and support network designed to be highly responsive to customer needs regardless of location or time. Our primary goal as a Company is simply to help our customers succeed. We accomplish that goal by developing innovative products and services and delivering them through our global sales and support network second to none.

Expanding Capabilities for Temperature Testing





























































TwitterYoutubeLinkedin 


 









 Expanding Capabilities for Temperature Testing			 29. May 2017/in All News, Multitest /by DanielaMultitest Soak Booster for Significant Reduction of Soaking Time

Multitest recently installed the well-established tri-temp handler MT9928 with an enhanced Soak Booster option. The Soak Booster cuts down the soak time by up to 50%. Multitest is currently the only company offering this kind of advanced technology for gravity handlers.
With this development Multitest is responding to the market need for temperature testing of large devices where soak time closely correlates with throughput,  and as a result, impacts the cost of test. High-volume production test of automotive devices is one market that benefits from this enhanced Soak Booster capability.
Whereas the industry standard for gravity handling is thermal heat transfer by radiation from track to device, Soak Booster uses convection as transfer principle. The temperature controlled air is blown directly to the device.
The “Soak Booster” option is built on Multitest’s excellence in temperature test solutions and is available for SO packages down to 300 mil in size.
To learn more about the MT9928 gravity handler, please visit http://multitest.com/mt9928

Powerful Brands in the Semiconductors and Electronics



































































TwitterYoutubeLinkedinFacebook 


 







Xcerra Corporation
Xcerra is the parent company for four powerful brands in the semiconductor and PCB test industries

Most comprehensive test solutions for the semiconductor industry
State-of-the-art solutions for PCB/PCBA test
Electronic interconnects – enabling products for electronic industry



Xcerra Corporation is the parent company of four powerful brands that have been supplying innovative products and services to the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industry for more than 30 years. Xcerra’s four brands are atg-Luther & Maelzer, Everett Charles Technologies, LTX-Credence, and Multitest.
Xcerra Corporation was formed in 2014 following the LTX-Credence acquisition of Everett Charles Technologies (ECT) and Multitest from Dover Corporation in December of 2013. The strategic vision of the LTX-Credence management team in making these acquisitions was to build a company with a greater share of the semiconductor test cell market. Acquiring these assets allowed the Company to achieve this goal

as well as expand into additional vertical markets related to printed circuit board test and test fixtures. A key component of the long term growth strategy for Xcerra is to offer differentiated semiconductor test products and services that include providing customers a fully integrated test cell solution directly to their production floor. This strategy allows customers to procure key components of the test cell such as the tester, handler, contactors and interface boards, from a single supplier and to take delivery of a turnkey solution directly into their high-volume manufacturing environment. This strategy reduces risk for the customer associated with doing the test cell integration themselves and has the added benefit of accelerating their ability to get new products to market faster.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
