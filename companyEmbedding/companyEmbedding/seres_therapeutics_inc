Seres Therapeutics, Inc. Initiates SER-109 Phase 3 Study in Patients with Multiply Recurrent C. difficile Infection
Jun 12 17
Seres Therapeutics, Inc. announced the initiation of its Phase 3 SER-109 clinical study (ECOSPOR III) in patients with multiply recurrent C. difficile infection. Based on recent interactions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), ECOSPOR III will now be designated a Phase 3 trial and the company expects that this single pivotal study may support SER-109 registration and approval. The ECOSPOR III Phase 3 study design incorporates direct learnings from prior SER-109 development efforts, as well as helpful feedback obtained from the FDA and study investigators. The study is expected to enroll approximately 320 patients with multiply recurrent C. difficile infection, randomized 1:1 to either SER-109 or placebo. The study is sized to contribute to an adequate safety database that may support product licensure. ECOSPOR III will utilize more than 100 clinical sites across the U.S. and Canada. The study’s primary endpoint will compare the reduction of C. difficile recurrence rates in subjects who receive SER-109 verses placebo at up to eight weeks after dosing. The initiation of the SER-109 Phase 3 ECOSPOR III study triggers a $20 million milestone payment under the company’s previously announced development and commercialization collaboration agreement with Nestlé Health Science. In partnership with Nestlé Health Science, Seres plans to accelerate interactions with European regulatory agencies in the coming months to establish a path toward SER-109 product approval across Europe.

Seres Therapeutics Receives FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Its Lead Product Candidate, SER-109 | Business Wire
























































Seres Therapeutics Receives FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for 
      Its Lead Product Candidate, SER-109






June 12, 2015 07:32 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Seres Therapeutics, Inc., a leading microbiome therapeutics platform 
      company, today announced that SER-109 (Firmacute Eubacterial Spores, 
      Purified Suspension, Encapsulated), its lead product candidate under 
      investigation for the prevention of recurrent Clostridium difficile 
      infection (CDI) in adults, has been granted breakthrough therapy 
      designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Breakthrough 
      therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review 
      of therapeutics for serious or life-threatening conditions where 
      preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate 
      a substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more 
      clinically significant endpoints. This designation allows for more 
      intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program, an 
      organizational commitment involving senior managers, and eligibility for 
      rolling review and priority review (if supported by clinical data at the 
      time of submission).
    


      “Recurrent CDI is a life-threatening condition affecting between 85,000 
      and 110,000 people each year in the United States,” said Roger 
      Pomerantz, M.D., Chairman, President and CEO of Seres. “We are 
      encouraged by the FDA’s grant of breakthrough therapy designation for 
      SER-109 and the potential for an expedited review by the FDA of our lead 
      product candidate.”
    

      Seres is conducting a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 
      2 clinical study to assess the efficacy and safety of SER-109 in 
      prevention of recurrent CDI. The primary outcome measure is the absence 
      of CDI through eight weeks, following administration of SER-109 compared 
      to placebo. SER-109 will be administered orally as a single dose, 
      following administration of the standard of care antibiotics for CDI. 
      The trial is actively enrolling and is expected to be conducted at 
      approximately 35 centers across the U.S. The estimated study completion 
      date is mid-2016. For additional information about this trial, please 
      visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02437487.
    

About SER-109


      SER-109 is the lead Seres Ecobiotic® microbiome therapeutic in clinical 
      testing for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile 
      infection (CDI). SER-109 was developed utilizing the Seres Microbiome 
      Therapeutics™ platform that provides insight into the ecologies of 
      disease and then identifies microbial compositions that can catalyze a 
      shift to health. CDI is a rapidly growing problem associated with 
      antibiotic use. Approximately 85,000 to 110,000 CDI patients in the U.S. 
      are expected to have more than one recurrence.
    

About Seres Therapeutics, Inc.


      Seres Therapeutics, Inc. is a leading microbiome therapeutics platform 
      company developing a novel class of biological drugs that are designed 
      to treat disease by restoring the function of a dysbiotic microbiome.
    

About Breakthrough Therapy Designation


      The FDA defines a breakthrough therapy as a drug intended to treat a 
      serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary 
      clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial 
      improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically 
      significant endpoints. The FDA seeks to expedite the development and 
      review of drugs that receive breakthrough therapy designation. For more 
      information please visit: http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/FederalFoodDrugandCosmeticActFDCAct/SignificantAmendmentstotheFDCAct/FDASIA/ucm329491.htm.

					Full Description



Seres Therapeutics, Inc., incorporated on October 18, 2010, is a microbiome therapeutics platform company. The Company is engaged in developing a class of biological drugs, which is referred as Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics. The Company's drugs are designed to restore health by repairing the function of a dysbiotic microbiome. The Company is focused on implementing its microbiome therapeutics platform to develop Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutics that treats dysbiosis in the colonic microbiome. SER-109 is its lead product candidate, which is designed to prevent further recurrences of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The Company is developing additional product candidates, including SER-262 to prevent an initial recurrence of primary CDI; SER-287 and SER-301, to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis, and SER-155 to treat enteric bacterial pathogens. The Company is also conducting research on metabolic diseases, such as early-stage, non-insulin dependent diabetes; non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and obesity and metabolic syndrome.As of December 31, 2016, the Company's SER-109, a bacterial spore ecology, consisted of an average of approximately 50 bacterial species derived from healthy donors' fecal matter. SER-109 is designed to prevent further recurrences of CDI in patients suffering from recurrent CDI by restoring the dysbiotic microbiome to a state of health. The Company has completed open label Phase Ib/II clinical studies. SER-109 was generally safe in both the Phase Ib/II and Phase II clinical studies. The Company is developing SER-262 as an Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic, designed to be used following antibiotic treatment of primary CDI to prevent the initial recurrence of CDI. SER-262 consists of bacteria that are a subset of the bacterial ecology consisting of SER-109. SER-262 is in Phase I clinical stage.The Company's SER-287 is under development for the treatment of active mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis and it has commenced a Phase Ib study in the United States. The Company is designing and developing SER-155, an Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic that may have activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative enteric bacterial pathogens. It is designing and developing SER-301, a synthetic Ecobiotic microbiome therapeutic candidate for the treatment of IBD. SER-301 is in preclinical stage.

For Patients

Thank you for your interest in learning more about Seres Therapeutics’ clinical trials. Below we’ve included information on our science and technology, and on why clinical trials are important to helping us bring treatments that are safe and effective to patients.
What is the microbiome?
 The microbiome refers to the trillions of small organisms that live in or on your body. For a long time, scientists and doctors didn’t realize the important role the microbiome played in keeping humans healthy. In the last decade, the scientific community has begun to understand just how the microbiome helps to keep our bodies healthy, by fighting germs, resisting disease, and absorbing nutrients from the food we eat, to name just a few examples. Seres has been studying the gut microbiome as a way to understand the treatment of disease. We believe that certain diseases flourish in bodies that have an imbalanced or disrupted microbiome, a condition known as dysbiosis, and that by developing medicines that treat dysbiosis directly, we are able to help bodies return to a healthy state. Click here to read more about the microbiome on our website.
Our science and technology
 Seres takes a new approach to the way we develop our therapeutic medicines. Our scientists study data from healthy microbiomes and compare them with microbiomes that have dysbiosis and are associated with a disease state. By comparing these data, and combining them with a deep understanding of the functional characteristics of different microbes, we are able to empirically identify alterations in the microbiome of healthy individuals that result in the disrupted diseased microbiomes. We then use our proprietary drug development platform to design and formulate compositions of microbes that deliver the missing functions back to the gut. By reestablishing these metabolic and immunological functions, we have been able to show that we can treat disease. Click here to read more about our science and technology on our website
What are clinical trials and why should I participate?
 Clinical trials are an important step in the drug development process. They help to ensure that our medicines are safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the government organization that regulates medicines in the United States, will review the results of our clinical trials and decide whether to approve our medicines to be made available to the public. For many patients who have found the usual course of treatment ineffective, clinical trials are an opportunity to be a part of the testing process for an investigational drug. Some patients may find that the investigational drug is more effective than other treatments they have tried. By taking part in clinical trials, patients can make an important contribution to ongoing research and to better understanding of a disease.
Our current clinical disease targets
 Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) Our program SER-109, is developing a treatment to prevent recurring Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Clostridium difficile is a bacteria that can cause unpleasant and sometimes serious symptoms, including frequent loose watery bowel movements (diarrhea) and stomach pain. Approximately 29,000 Americans die from CDI each year. CDI most frequently occurs after a patient has received an antibiotic, typically within a hospital setting. Antibiotics are given to destroy harmful bacteria that cause disease, but occasionally can also destroy helpful bacteria that fight harmful bacteria such as Clostridium difficile. We are evaluating SER-109 and SER-262 in CDI. Click here to read more about our CDI programs on our website. Ulcerative colitis (UC) We are also evaluating SER-287 in patients with mild-to-moderate UC, a serious chronic condition affecting approximately 700,000 individuals in the United States. UC results in inflammation of the colon and rectum and can result in debilitating symptoms, including abdominal pain, bowel urgency and diarrhea.
Our current clinical trials
 Below is a list of the clinical trials we currently have in progress. By clicking on the link, you will be redirected to the page on our website with more information on the clinical trial and how to participate. SER-109 (ECOSPOR III): A Phase 3 study (ECOSPOR III) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SER-109 versus placebo. ECOSPOR III incorporates direct learnings from prior SER-109 development efforts. The study is expected to enroll approximately 320 patients with multiply recurrent C. difficile infection, randomized 1:1 to either SER-109 or placebo. The study is sized to contribute to an adequate safety database that may support product licensure. ECOSPOR III will utilize more than 100 clinical sites across the U.S. and Canada. The study’s primary endpoint will compare the reduction of C. difficile recurrence rates in subjects who receive SER-109 verses placebo at up to eight weeks after dosing. SER-287, SERES-101 Study: A current Phase 1b clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of SER-287 versus placebo, in adults with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) (SERES-101) SER-262, SERES-001 Study: A current Phase 1b study evaluating the safety and efficacy of SER-262 versus placebo, in adults with primary Clostridium difficile infection to prevent recurrence (SER-262) If you have any questions, please call 617.945.9626 x304.

Why Seres Therapeutics Inc. Is Being Obliterated Today
Shares plunged in reaction to important study results that missed the mark.











                Brian Feroldi
            

                (TMFTypeoh)

What: Shares of Seres Therapeutics (NASDAQ:MCRB), a clinical-stage biotech focused on developing microbiome technology, are collapsing today, down more than 71% as of noon EDT, on huge volume in response to the news that an important clinical study didn't go according to plan.
So what: Seres Therapeutics released interim results from its ECOSPOR study today, which was testing its lead product candidate, SER-109, as a potential treatment for the bacterium Clostridium difficile, or C. diff. 
The 89-patient, placebo-controlled phase 2 study was attempting to show that using SER-109 could reduce the relative risk of C. diff infection (CDI) recurrence. Unfortunately, the company's interim data that were collected at week eight of the study showed SER-109 has failed to meet its primary objective.
Specifically, CDI recurrence was observed in 44% of patients who used SER-109, compared to 53% of patients who used a placebo. Even though the result for Seres' product was slightly better, it was not high enough to be statistically significant.





Seres Therapeutics' CEO, Roger Pomerantz, offered up this commentary on the disappointing study results:

These are unexpected clinical results in view of the positive data in our prior investigator-sponsored Phase 1b trial, as well as in a wide range of supporting clinical and preclinical data. Specifically, the recurrence rates observed in the overall SER-109 treatment group, in the age stratified subgroups, and in the placebo groups are inconsistent with our expectations. Our priority is to complete a full review of the clinical results and microbiome data of the Phase 2 study and to compare it to data from the prior investigator sponsored Phase 1b. Based on this information and pending discussions with the FDA, we plan to make any necessary changes to our development plans for SER-109.

Now what: SER-109 was the company's most advanced product candidate, so it's no surprise to see Seres shares getting wiped out today. 
If you're looking for a silver lining here, the study hinted that SER-190 may still hold promise as a treatment for older adults. Specially, subjects who were older than 65 and used SER-190 experienced CDI recurrence in only 45% of cases, which compared favorably to the 80% recurrence observed in the placebo group. Still, that number was from a much smaller patient population, so it's possible that the result occurred purely by chance. In addition, SER-190 performed far worse with the younger patient population: SER-190 was associated with CDI recurrence in 43% of subjects under age 65, versus only 27% in the placebo group.
Seres Therapeutics' stock has put investors on a rough ride since first hitting the public markets in June 2015. Even prior to today's collapse, shares trailed the poorly performing biotech index in general, as measured by the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSEMKT:XBI).

With huge questions in the air regarding this company's future, it's hard to find a reason to be bullish on the company's shares. Even though shares are much cheaper today than they were yesterday, I'd advise risk-loving investors to look elsewhere for more promising opportunities.

For Clinicians

Thank you for your interest in learning more about our ongoing clinical trials. Below we’ve included information on our technology as well as details about how you can learn more about clinician and patient participation in clinical trials.
What is the microbiome’s role in human health?
 Discoveries made over the past decade have radically reshaped clinical understanding of the role that the human microbiome plays in regulating human health. Once seen only in adversarial terms, today the trillions of bacteria that inhabit or live on our bodies are known to play important, beneficial roles in a wide range of biological processes, including resistance to pathogens, regulation of immune function, and energy metabolism. Seres is leading a paradigm shift in the understanding and treatment of human diseases that result from functional deficiencies of the human microbiome, a condition known as dysbiosis. We believe the microbiome holds great promise for patients whose conditions are not served by current approaches. Click here to read more about the microbiome
How does this new approach to treating disease work?
 Rather than take aim at traditional disease targets, our microbiome therapeutics platform is designed to find and fix functional deficiencies that derive from a disrupted microbiome and that that give rise to a given disease. Early data from our lead clinical program in recurrent C. difficile infection suggests that this approach can lead to unprecedented clinical efficacy. Our proprietary discovery and design platform enables us to elucidate how changes in the composition of microbes in a disrupted dysbiotic microbiome relate to alterations in the metabolic and immunological function of the microbiome, and to design and empirically optimize Ecobiotic® drugs that disrupt the diseased microbiome and catalyze the repair of the microbiome, improving health. Click here to learn more about our microbiome therapeutics platform
Our current clinical disease targets
 Clostridium difficile infection (CDI)  Clostridium difficile is a bacteria that can cause unpleasant and sometimes serious symptoms, including diarrhea and stomach pain. CDI is the most common cause of hospital acquired infection in the U.S. and is responsible for the death of approximately 29,000 Americans each year. The risk of recurrence is approximately 25 percent after the primary occurrence, 40 percent after a first recurrence, and more than 60 percent for those who have experienced two or more recurrences. Ulcerative colitis (UC) We are currently evaluating SER-287 in patients with mild-to-moderate UC, a serious chronic condition affecting approximately 700,000 individuals in the United States. The disease results in inflammation of the colon and rectum and can result in debilitating symptoms, including abdominal pain, bowel urgency and diarrhea.
Our current clinical trials
 Below is a list of the clinical trials we currently have in progress. By clicking on the link, you will be redirected to the page on our website with more information on the clinical trial and how your patients may be able to participate. SER-109 (ECOSPOR III): A Phase 3 study (ECOSPOR III) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SER-109 versus placebo. ECOSPOR III incorporates direct learnings from prior SER-109 development efforts. The study is expected to enroll approximately 320 patients with multiply recurrent C. difficile infection, randomized 1:1 to either SER-109 or placebo. The study is sized to contribute to an adequate safety database that may support product licensure. ECOSPOR III will utilize more than 100 clinical sites across the U.S. and Canada. The study’s primary endpoint will compare the reduction of C. difficile recurrence rates in subjects who receive SER-109 verses placebo at up to eight weeks after dosing. SER-287, SERES-101 Study: A current Phase 1b clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of SER-287 versus placebo, in adults with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) (SERES-101) SER-262, SERES-001 Study: A current Phase 1b study evaluating the safety and efficacy of SER-262 versus placebo, in adults with primary Clostridium difficile infection to prevent recurrence (SER-262)  If you have patients you think may qualify for this clinical trial or if you would like to be involved as a clinical trial site, please contact us at 617.945.9626 x304.
