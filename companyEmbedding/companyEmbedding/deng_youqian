 Research Summary (I) My Postdoc research is focused on palladium-catalyzed oxidative carbocyclization.1. Palladium-Catalyzed Oxidative Arylating Carbocyclization of Allenynes The Pd(II)-catalyzed oxidative arylative carbocyclization of allenynes has been realized and allows the synthesis of either vinylallenes or cross conjugated trienes selectively under mild conditions. Two possible mechanisms were suggested to rationalize the formation of the different types of products. Control experiments indicate that p-benzoquinone (BQ) plays an important role as a ligand in addition to its role as an oxidant for the reaction. 2. Control of Selectivity in Palladium-Catalyzed Oxidative Borylationg Carbocyclization of Allenynes A highly selective carbocyclization/borylation of allenynes with B2pin2 under palladium catalysis employing BQ as the oxidant was realized, where the subtle application of LiOAc·2H2O with 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) as the solvent and BF3·Et2O together with THF are crucial for the selective formation of borylated trienes and vinylallenes, respectively. 3. Palladium-Catalyzed Oxidative Acyloxylation/Carbocyclization of Allenynes A novel palladium(II)-catalyzed oxidative acyloxylation/carbocyclization of allenynes was developed to provide access to synthetically useful acyloxylated vinylallenes where a new C-C bond, a new C-O bond, and a new allene structure are formed. Furthermore, a biomimetic version of this transformation using catalytic amount of BQ was also realized to enhance the utility of this method.(II) My Ph.D. research program is focused on transition metal-catalyzed reactions of functionalized allenes and bisallenes.1. PdCl2/NaI-Catalyzed Homodimeric Coupling-Cyclization of 2,3-AllenolsTransition metal-catalyzed cyclizative dimerization reaction of two functionalized allenes is attractive for synthetic organic chemists due to the issues of chirality transfer, diversity, and substituent-loading capability of allenes. We have developed a homodimeric coupling-cyclization reaction of 2,3-allenols using PdCl2/NaI as the catalyst, which provides an efficient route to 4-(1’,3’-dien-2’-yl)-2,5-dihydrofuran derivatives. When optically active 2,3-allenols was used under the same reaction conditions, no racemization was observed. It was found that the catalytically active specie was PdI2, which might be produced in situ from PdCl2 and NaI. The reaction may via cyclic oxypalladation, regioselective carbopalladation, subsequent trans-b-hydroxide elimination afford productand IPd+[OH-]. Finally, IPd+[OH-] was converted to PdI2 by its reaction with HI generated in the first step.2. PdI2-Catalyzed Cross Coupling Cyclization Involving Two Different 2,3-AllenolsThe cyclization involving two molecules of same class of allenes yet with different structures has never been realized probably due to the difficulty encountered in the molecular recognition. After realization of homodimerization of two same 2,3-allenols, we have developed the first example of dimeric coupling-cyclization reaction of two different 2,3-allenols using the PdI2 as the catalyst in the presence of BF3·Et2O providing an efficient route to 4-(1’,3’-dien-2’-yl)-2,5-dihydrofuran derivatives, in which the 2-substituted 2,3-allenols construct the 2,5-dihydrofuran ring while the 2-nonsubstituted 2,3-allenols provide the 1,3-diene unit at the 4-position by applying deliberate control of electronic and steric effects. The b-elimination process is believed to be mediated by the presence of Lewis acid. 3.  The Pd(II)-Catalyzed Tandem-Cyclization of 1,ω-BisallenolsAfter the realization of intermolecular coupling-cyclization of 2,3-allenols, we turned our attention to intramolecular cyclization of 1,ω-bisallenols. In the presence of Pd(II)-catalyst, the reaction of 1,ω-bisallenols can form 2,5-dihydrofuran- fused bicyclic skeletons. With “unsymmetric” substrates, the reaction may be realized by converting one hydroxyl group to acetate. Optically active bicyclic products may be easily prepared by applying the Novozym-435 catalyzed kinetic resolution and the tandem double cyclization of these optically active substrates. 4.  Selectivity Manipulation of Bicyclization of 1,5-Bis(1,2-allenylketone)s: Pd versus Rh and Electronic EffectThe Rh(I)-catalyzed double cyclization of 1,5-bis(1,2-allenylketone)s was realized to synthesize TNF-a inhibitor-type skeletons at rt in acetone or DCE. As compared with PdCl2(MeCN)2, [RhCl(CO)2]2 shows an excellent selectivity referred to the non-aromatic C=C bond due to the different bonding nature of palladium and rhodium towards the carbon or oxygen in the involved organometallic intermediatesThe selectivity of unsymmetrical substrates has been controlled by the electronic effect. 5.  Studies on Highly Stereoselective Addition-Elimination Reactions of 2-(Methoxycarbonyl)-2,3-allenols with MXStereoselective synthesis of conjugated 1,3-dienes is of current interest since they are very important intermediates in organic synthesis. It was observed that the reactions of functional allenes may afford 1,3-dienes but usually with poor stereoselectivity. 3-(Methoxycarbonyl)-2-halo-1,3(Z)-dienes can be prepared highly stereoselectively via SN2’-type addition-elimination reactions of 2-(methoxycarbonyl)-2,3-allenols with MX (NaI, LiBr·H2O, or LiCl·H2O). These products may easily undergo Negishi or Sonogashira coupling reactions to yield a series of stereodefined polysubstituted 1,3(E)-dienes. 6.  Highly Selective Synthesis of Methyl 2-(Ethynyl)alk-2(E)-enoates and 2-(1’-Chlorovinyl)alk-2(Z)-enoates from 2-(Methoxycarbonyl)-2,3-allenolsHighly regio- and stereoselective reactions of readily available 2-(methoxycarbonyl)-2,3-allenols with oxalyl chloride in the presence of Et3N or DMSO can afford methyl 2-(ethynyl)alk-2(E)-enoates and 2-(1’-chlorovinyl)alk-2(Z)-enoates, respectively, in moderate to good yields.

WIPO Domain Name Decision: D2009-0113




















 WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center ADMINISTRATIVE PANEL DECISION The Gap, Inc. v. Deng Youqian Case No. D2009-0113 1. The Parties
Complainant is The Gap, Inc., San Francisco, California, United States of America, represented by Cooley Godward Kronish LLP, United States.
Respondent is Deng Youqian, Shanghai, People Republic of China. 2. The Domain Names and Registrar
The disputed domain names <babygapclothing.com>, <biggap.com>, <gapcoupon.com>, <gapfashion.com>, <bananarebulic.com>, and <oldnavyreidsystems.com> are registered with Rebel.com Corp. 3. Procedural History
The Complaint was filed with the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center (the “Center”) on January 29, 2009. On January 29, 2009, the Center transmitted by email to Rebel.com Corp. a request for registrar verification in connection with the disputed domain names. On February 2, 2009, Rebel.com Corp. transmitted by email to the Center its verification response confirming that Respondent is listed as the registrant and providing the contact details. In response to a notification by the Center that the Complaint was administratively deficient concerning the word limit, Complainant filed an amended Complaint on February 6, 2009. The Center verified that the amended Complaint satisfied the formal requirements of the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the “Policy” or “UDRP”), the Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the “Rules”), and the WIPO Supplemental Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the “Supplemental Rules”).
In accordance with the Rules, paragraphs 2(a) and 4(a), the Center formally notified Respondent of the Complaint, and the proceedings commenced on February 11, 2009. In accordance with the Rules, paragraph 5(a), the due date for Response was March 3, 2009. Respondent did not submit a Response. Accordingly, the Center notified Respondent's default on March 4, 2009.
The Center appointed Manoel J. Pereira dos Santos as the sole panelist in this matter on March 9, 2009. The Panel finds that it was properly constituted. The Panel has submitted the Statement of Acceptance and Declaration of Impartiality and Independence, as required by the Center to ensure compliance with the Rules, paragraph 7. 4. Factual Background
The trademarks upon which the Complaint is based are GAP, BANANA REPUBLIC, and OLD NAVY.
According to the documentary evidence and contentions submitted, Complainant owns a number of trademark registrations for the GAP and GAP-formative marks around the world, and particularly in the United States and China. The GAP trademark was registered in the United States, inter alia, under Nos. 1,129,295 on January 15, 1980 (GAP), 1,675,154 on February 11, 1992 (BABY GAP), 1,808,207 on November 30, 1993 (GAP as service mark), 2,176,659 on July 28, 1998 (GAPKIDS.COM), 2,540,610 on February 19, 2002 (GAP.COM), and 2,675,048 on January 14, 2003 (BABYGAP.COM). Similar trademarks were registered in China since 1992.
According to the documentary evidence and contentions submitted, the GAP brand was first divulged in 1969 when the first GAP store was created in San Francisco, California, to sell jeans and records. Complainant also operates websites under the domains <gap.com>, <gapkids.com> and <babygap.com>, which were registered in the period of 1993 to 1997.
According to the documentary evidence and contentions submitted, Complainant owns a number of trademark registrations for the BANANA REPUBLIC and BANANA REPUBLIC-formative marks around the world, and particularly in the United States and China. The BANANA REPUBLIC trademark was registered in the United States, inter alia, under Nos. 1,347,849 on July 9, 1985 (BANANA REPUBLIC), 2,079,325 on July 15, 1997 (BANANA REPUBLIC as service mark), and 2,534,585 on January 29, 2002 (BANANAREPUBLIC.COM). Similar trademarks were registered in China since 1992.
According to the documentary evidence and contentions submitted, the BANANA REPUBLIC brand was first divulged in 1978 when the first BANANA REPUBLIC store was created in Mill Valley, California, to sell military surplus clothing. Complainant acquired Banana Republic in 1983, and also operates a website under the domain <bananarepublic.com>, which was registered in 1995.
According to the documentary evidence and contentions submitted, Complainant owns a number of trademark registrations for the OLD NAVY and OLD NAVY-formative marks around the world, and particularly in the United States and China. The OLD NAVY trademark was registered in the United States, inter alia, under Nos. 1,928,001 on October 17, 1995 (OLD NAVY), and 2,418,340 on January 2, 2001 (OLDNAVY.COM). Similar trademarks were registered in China since 1998.
According to the documentary evidence and contentions submitted, the OLD NAVY brand was first divulged in 1994 when the first OLD NAVY store was created in California, to sell casual apparel and related products. Complainant operates a website under the domain <oldnavy.com>, which was registered in 1995.
According to the documentary evidence and contentions submitted, Respondent registered the domain names <babygapclothing.com>, <biggap.com>, <gapcoupon.com>, and <gapfashion.com> on October 4, 2005, October 6, 2006, March 29, 2004, and October 10, 2005, respectively; the domain name <bananarebulic.com> on November 27, 2005, and the domain name <oldnavyreidsystems.com> on October 2, 2005. On December 23, 2008, Complainant sent a cease and desist letter to Respondent. Complainant states that Respondent never replied. 5. Parties' Contentions A. Complainant
Complainant contends that (i) the disputed domain names <babygapclothing.com>, <biggap.com>, <gapcoupon.com>, and <gapfashion.com> are identical or confusingly similar to Complainant's trademarks because they incorporate the GAP and BABY GAP trademarks with the addition of generic words such as “clothing”, “fashion”, “coupon” and “big”, thus suggesting an association with Complainant, (ii) the domain name <bananarebulic.com> is confusingly similar to Complainant's registered trademark because it only differs from BANANA REPUBLIC trademark by a minor typographical error, and (iii) the domain name <oldnavyreidsystems.com> is confusingly similar to Complainant's registered trademarks because it combines Complainant's OLD NAVY trademark with the REID SYSTEMS trademark.
Complainant further contends that Respondent does not have rights or legitimate interests regarding the disputed domain names because (i) Respondent does not hold any trademark registrations which are identical, similar, or related to Complainant's marks; (ii) Respondent is not an authorized dealer, distributor, or licensee of Complainant; (iii) the disputed domain names are not the ones that Respondent would choose in the context of providing goods or services other than to create an association with Complainant's marks, and (ii) Respondent has not used the disputed domain names in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services, since they are used in connection with click-through advertisements.
Finally, Complainant contends that Respondent registered and is using the disputed domain names in bad faith because (i) Respondent was certainly aware the GAP, BANANA REPUBLIC and OLD NAVY trademarks since they are well known, and registration of domain names containing well-known trademarks constitute bad faith per se; (ii) Respondent aims to capitalize and free-ride on the fame and reputation of Complainant's marks, and (iii) Respondent has shown a pattern of bad faith conduct because of Respondent's registration of over 1,000 domains that are substantially identical to third party trademarks. B. Respondent
Upon receipt of the Center's Notification of Complaint and Commencement of Administrative Proceeding, Respondent sent an email to the Center stating that “Respondent never heard of complainant therefore those domains could not have been registered in bad faith”. The Center advised Respondent that the Response due date was March 3, 2009. However, Respondent did not file a Response to Complainant's contentions. It is clear, therefore, that Respondent chose not to file a Response. 6. Discussion and Findings A. Laches
The Panel notes that the disputed domain names were registered in the period of October 2004 to November 2005, and that the Complaint was filed on January 29, 2009. The question which arises is whether the elapse of around 4 years from the domain name registration date prevents Complainant from commencing an administrative proceeding against Respondent under the Policy.
The Panel recognizes that the issue has been addressed in previous WIPO decisions and that the doctrine of laches or estoppel has not been applied to the Policy proceedings. “Estoppel has rarely been raised as a defense in a proceeding under the Policy, and to this panel's knowledge has never been the basis for denying a complaint when all elements of the Policy were established”, Justice for Children v. Rneetso / Robert W. O'Steen,
WIPO Case No. D2004-0175. See also Tax Analysts v. eCorp,
WIPO Case No. D2007-0040.
As decided in Tom Cruise v. Network Operations Center / Alberta Hot Rods,
WIPO Case No. D2006-0560, “[w]ithout some substantial evidence to indicate that Complainant approved of or condoned Respondent's use of his mark in the disputed domain name, the Panel is not prepared to import a bar against his cause of action.” B. Effect of the Default
The consensus view is that the respondent's default does not automatically result in a decision in favor of the complainant and that the complainant must establish each of the three elements required by paragraph 4(a) of the UDRP (WIPO Overview of WIPO Panel Views on Selected UDRP Questions, para. 2.2). However, paragraph 14(b) of the Rules provides that, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, a panel shall draw such inferences as it considers appropriate from a failure of a party to comply with a provision or requirement of the Rules.
This Panel finds that there are no exceptional circumstances for the failure of Respondent to reply to all of Complainant's contentions by submitting a complete Response. Therefore, asserted facts that are not unreasonable will be taken as true and Respondent will be subject to the inferences that flow naturally from the information provided by Complainant. Reuters Limited v. Global Net 2000, Inc,
WIPO Case No. D2000-0441. RX America, LLC v. Matthew Smith, 
WIPO Case No. D2005-0540.
The Panel will now review each of the three cumulative elements set forth in paragraph 4(a) of the Policy to determine whether Complainant has complied with such requirements. C. Identical or Confusingly Similar
The Panel concurs with the opinion of several prior WIPO UDRP panels which have held that, when a domain name wholly incorporates a complainant's registered trademark that may be sufficient to establish confusing similarity for purposes of the Policy. See, e.g., EAuto, L.L.C. v. Triple S. Auto Parts d/b/a Kung Fu Yea Enterprises, Inc.,
WIPO Case No. D2000-0047; Magnum Piering, Inc. v. The Mudjackers and Garwood S. Wilson, Sr.,
WIPO Case No. D2000-1525;  Kabushiki Kaisha Hitachi Seisakusho (d/b/a Hitachi Ltd) v. Arthur Wrangle,
WIPO Case No. D2005-1105; Oki Data Americas, Inc. v. ASD, Inc.,
WIPO Case No. D2001-0903; Bayerische Motoren Werke AG v. bmwcar.com,
WIPO Case No. D2002-0615; Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG v. Vasiliy Terkin,
WIPO Case No. D2003-0888; adidas-Salomon AG v. Mti Networks Ltd,
WIPO Case No. D2005-0258; AT&T Corp. v. William Gormally,
WIPO Case No. D2005-0758.
That is particularly true where the trademark is highly recognizable and famous, as in the instant case. In fact, Complainant has provided sufficient evidence that the trademarks GAP and OLD NAVY are famous. Each of the domain names <biggap.com>, <babygapclothing.com>, <gapcoupon.com>, <gapfashion.com>, and <oldnavyreidsystems.com> incorporates the whole of the famous GAP or OLD NAVY trademarks, as the case may be, and therefore may lead the public to think that the disputed domain names are somehow connected to the owner of the registered trademarks. Utensilerie Associate S.p.A. v. C & M,
WIPO Case No. D2003-0159.
In addition, it has been decided that the addition of generic or descriptive terms to an otherwise distinctive trademark name does not elimminate confusing similarity to the registered trademark. V&S Vin&Sprit AhB v. Giovanni Pastore,
WIPO Case No. D2002-0926; Thomson Broadcast and Media Solution Inc., Thomson v. Alvaro Collazo,
WIPO Case No. D2004-0746; Sanofi-Aventis v. US-Meds.com, 
WIPO Case No. D2004-0809; F. Hoffman-La Roche AG v. Pinetree Development, Ltd., 
WIPO Case No. D2006-0049.
The words “clothing”, “fashion”, “coupon” and “big” are in the context of Complainant's goods generic, and do not generally affect a finding of similarity where a registered trademark is incorporated into a domain name. As a matter of fact, the combination of “gap” or “baby gap” with “clothing”, “fashion”, “coupon” or “big” creates an immediate potential for false association with the GAP trademark and brand name, and a high degree of initial confusion. See adidas-Salomon AG v. Digi Real Estate Foundation, Patrick Williamson,
WIPO Case No. D2006-0748.
As decided in Yahoo! Inc. and Overture Services, Inc. v. Registrant (187640), a/k/a Gary Lam, a/k/a Birgit Klosterman, a/k/a XC2, a/k/a Robert Chua, a/k/a Registrant,
WIPO Case No. D2004-0896, “the addition of other marks does not create a distinct mark/domain name, capable of overcoming a claim of confusingly similarity, it merely adds to the potential confusion of Internet users as to the source, sponsorship and affiliation of the domain name”. See also Pfizer, Inc. v. Martin Marketing,
WIPO Case No. D2002-0793. Therefore, <oldnavyreidsystems.com> is confusingly similar to Complainant's OLD NAVY trademark even with the addition of “reid systems”.
The domain name <bananarebulic.com> is confusingly similar to the BANANA REPUBLIC trademark because only some letters have been interchanged. The practice of misspelling an element of the mark, generally called “typosquatting”, has consistently been regarded as creating domain names confusingly similar to the relevant mark. See, e.g., Reuters Limited v. Global Net 2000 Inc.,
WIPO Case No. D2000-0441; Playboy Enterprises v. Movie Name Company,
WIPO Case No. D2001-1201; Deutsche Bank Aktiengesells v. New York TV Tickets Inc.,
WIPO Case No. D2001-1314; Hobsons, Inc. v. Peter Carrington a/k/a Party Night Inc.,
WIPO Case No. D2003-0317; Ross-Simons, Inc. v. Domain.Contact, 
WIPO Case No. D2003-0994; Sharman License Holdings, Limited v. IcedIt.com, 
WIPO Case No. D2004-0713; ACCOR v. Brigit Klostermann, 
WIPO Case No. D2005-0627.
Finally, the addition of the suffix “.com” is non-distinctive because it is required for the registration of the domain name. RX America, LLC v. Mattew Smith,
WIPO Case No. D2005-0540; Sanofi-Aventis v. US Online Pharmacies,
WIPO Case No. D2006-0582.
Therefore, the Panel finds that the requirement of paragraph 4(a)(i) of the Policy is met. D. Rights or Legitimate Interests
Respondent is using the disputed domain names to resolve to websites with click-through advertisements pointing to Complainant as well as to other websites, including those competing with Complainant and those offering services unrelated to Complainant's products. The websites to which the disputed domain names resolve are entirely in English.
The issue as to whether use of a domain name for purposes of offering “sponsored links” creates a legitimate right to a domain name has been addressed in previous WIPO UDRP decisions. There is a consensus view that except in certain limited circumstances such use cannot be considered a bona fide offering of goods or services, or a noncommercial or fair use. See Bridgestone Corporation v. Horoshiy, Inc., 
WIPO Case No. D2004-0795; Deutsche Telekom AG v. Dong Wong,
WIPO Case No. D2005-0819; PRL USA Holdings, Inc. v. LucasCobb, 
WIPO Case No. D2006-0162.
In fact, the Panel sees no plausible explanation for Respondent's adoption and use of the terms “gap”, “old navy” and “bananarebulic” in the disputed domain names and, accordingly, concludes that the disputed domain names were selected and used by Respondent to take advantage of the notoriety associated with the GAP, BANANA REPUBLIC, and OLD NAVY names, with the intent to attract for commercial gain Internet users. See Madonna Ciccone, p/k/a Madonna v. Dan Parisi and "Madonna.com",
WIPO Case No. D2000-0847.
In short, Complainant has satisfied its burden of providing sufficient evidence to make a prima facie case showing that Respondent lacks rights to or legitimate interests in the disputed domain names, and Respondent has failed to provide the Panel with any of the types of evidence set forth in paragraph 4(c) of the Policy from which the Panel might conclude that Respondent has any rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain names. Berlitz Investment Corp. v. Stefan Tinculescu, 
WIPO Case No. D2003-0465.
In light of the foregoing, the Panel finds that the requirement of paragraph 4(a)(ii) of the Policy is met. E. Registered and Used in Bad Faith (i) Bad faith because of the fame of the GAP, BANANA REPUBLIC and OLD NAVY trademarks
Complainant's first contention of bad faith is based on the argument that at the time of registration of the disputed domain names Respondent knew, or at least should have known, the existence of Complainant's trademarks, and that registration of a domain name containing well-known trademarks constitutes bad faith per se.
The Panel finds that, in addition to GAP and OLD NAVY, the BANANA REPUBLIC trademark has also acquired extensive and worldwide reputation and is to be regarded as a well-known trademark.
As one panel held before, “the Complainant's worldwide reputation, and presence on the Internet, indicates that Respondent was or should have been aware of the marks prior to registering the disputed Domain Name”. Caesar World, Inc. v. Forum LLC, 
WIPO Case No. D2005-0517. In light of the reputation of the GAP, BANANA REPUBLIC and OLD NAVY trademarks, it is clear that Respondent in all likelihood knew of the existence of Complainant's trademarks.
In addition, the Panel concurs with previous WIPO UDRP decisions holding that registration of a well-known trademark as a domain name is a clear indication of bad faith in itself, even without considering other elements. See Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin, Maison Fond ée en 1772 v. The Polygenix Group Co.,
WIPO Case No. D2000-0163; PepsiCo, Inc. v. “null”, aka Alexander Zhavoronkov,
WIPO Case No. D2002-0562; Pepsico, Inc. v. Domain Admin,
WIPO Case No. D2006-0435. (ii) Attempt to capitalize and free-ride on the reputation of Complainant's marks
Complainant's second contention of bad faith is based on the argument that Respondent is using the disputed domain names to benefit from the reputation of Complainant's marks by redirecting Internet users to sponsored listings of commercial websites of third parties, some of which compete directly with Complainant.
The Panel has already found that that the disputed domain names were selected and used by Respondents with the intent to attract for commercial gain Internet users. The Panel concurs with the understanding of several other WIPO UDRP panels that the use of a domain name to point to a website that offers sponsored links to other websites is evidence of bad faith, particularly if, as in the instant case, complainant had registered and used before famous trademarks. Mudd(USA), LLC v. Unasi, Inc.(MUDDPRODUCTS-COM-DOM),
WIPO Case No. D2005-0591; Volvo Trademark Holding AB v. Unais, Inc.,
WIPO Case No. D2005-0556. (iii) Pattern of bad faith conduct
Complainant's last contention of bad faith is based on the argument that Respondent has shown a pattern of bad faith conduct by having registered over 1,000 domain names that are substantially identical to third party trademarks.
Respondent has lost at least two UDRP disputes before WIPO, in which bad faith has been found in each instance, one of which involves the same parties to this case. The Gap Inc. v. Denq Youqian,
WIPO Case No. D2008-1187; Earth Products Inc. v. Deng Youqian,
WIPO Case No. D2008-0256. Complainant also ordered a “Reverse WHOIS” search through MarkMonitor on December 22, 2008 containing the term “Deng Youqian”. The search revealed that Respondent has registered over 1,000 domain names, many of which infringe third party trademark rights.

AbstractNeue Bindungen: Die Titelreaktion führt zu präparativ nützlichen acyloxylierten Vinylallenen, wobei eine C-C-Bindung, eine C-O-Bindung und eine Allenstruktur neu gebildet werden. In einer aeroben Variante dieser Transformation werden katalytische Mengen an p-Benzochinon (BQ) und Cobaltsalophen eingesetzt.Enhanced PDFStandard PDF                                         (651.5 KB)                                     Palladium(II)-catalyzed oxidative carbocyclizations represent an important class of reactions, which have provided powerful and atom-economical approaches to carbo- and heterocycles.1–5 In particular, oxidative carbocyclization strategies have been efficiently applied to total synthesis.3 As a continuation of our research on the palladium-catalyzed oxidative carbocyclizations of dienallenes4 and enallenes,5 we recently developed palladium-catalyzed arylating or borylating oxidative carbocyclizations of allenynes6 by using the corresponding arylboronic acid or B2pin2.7In connection with our previous studies on acetoxylation(hydroxylation)/carbocyclizations of dienallenes (Scheme 1 a),4 we envisioned an oxidative acetoxylation/carbocyclization of allenynes 1 in the presence of HOAc/LiOAc, with a simple PdII salt as the catalyst (Scheme 1 b). Based on the previously proposed mechanism,4, 5 the reaction was expected to be initiated by allene attack on PdII through allylic CH bond cleavage followed by alkyne insertion to give acetoxylated triene product 2. However, the reaction took an unexpected path, and herein we report on a palladium-catalyzed oxidative acyloxylation/carbocyclization of allenynes 1 to give acyloxylated vinylallenes 3 (Scheme 1 b). An aerobic version of this transformation was also realized by using catalytic amounts of p-benzoquinone together with cobalt salophen.Scheme 1. Open FigureDownload Powerpoint slidePalladium-catalyzed oxidative acetoxylation/carbocyclization of dienallenes and allenynes (E=CO2Me).In our preliminary study, we chose allenyne 1 a with a pentyl group on the triple bond as the model substrate to study the oxidative carbocyclization in the presence of HOAc/LiOAc. To our surprise, treatment of 1 a with Pd(OAc)2 (5 mol %), LiOAc⋅2 H2O (2 equiv), and p-benzoquinone (BQ; 1.2 equiv) at 60 °C in HOAc gave an acetoxylated vinylallene product 3 aa in 61 % yield along with dimer 4 a in 10 % yield (Table 1, entry 1). The reaction in the absence of LiOAc⋅2 H2O also proceeded smoothly to give 3 aa in 63 % yield and 4 a in 10 % yield (Table 1, entry 2, defined as method A), whereas the replacement of acetic acid with acetone as the solvent resulted in a complicated mixture (entry 3). In a solvent study, acetone was found to work as solvent in the presence of acetic acid (5 equiv) for this transformation (Table 1, entry 4, defined as method B). Compared with 60 °C, room temperature or a higher temperature (e.g. 80 °C) were found to give inferior yields of 3 aa (compare entries 2, 5 and 6 in Table 1). When Pd(OAc)2 was replaced with Pd(OOCCF3)2 or [Pd(acac)2], the yield of carbocyclized product 3 aa decreased (Table 1, entries 7 and 8). No conversion was observed with PdCl2 or [PdCl2(MeCN)2] as the catalyst, and all the starting material 1 a was recovered in these cases (Table 1, entries 9 and 10). A control experiment without palladium under otherwise the same reaction conditions showed no conversion of 1 a according to 1H NMR spectroscopy. The effect of palladium catalyst loading was also investigated. A lower loading (2 mol %) of Pd(OAc)2 gave only 86 % conversion of 1 a with a yield of 3 aa of only 50 % (Table 1, entry 11). A higher catalyst loading (10 mol %) also resulted in a lower yield of 3 aa (Table 1, entry 12).Table 1. Screening of reaction conditions in the palladium-catalyzed oxidative carbocyclization of allenyne 1 a with acetic acid.

When both methyl groups on the terminal carbon atom of the allene moiety of 1 a were replaced by pentamethylene (forming the cyclohexylidene group) (1 b), the reaction with acetic acid gave the cyclized vinylallene product 3 ba in 66 % yield with method A. By altering one methyl group on the allene to an ethyl group, the unsymmetrical allenyne 1 c displayed a similar reactivity. The reaction of allenyne having an ethyl group (1 d) on the triple bond also reacted smoothly to afford product 3 da in 52 % yield by employing method B. Methyl-substituted allenyne 1 e gave terminal allene product 3 ea in 39 % yield. Moreover, the reactions of allenynes bearing two hydroxy or ether groups (1 g and 1 h) instead of the carbomethoxy groups provided the corresponding products 3 ga and 3 ha in good yields. Even the allenynes (1 i and 1 j) with the ether as the tether group also worked well and afforded six-membered ring products 3 ia and 3 ja in moderate yields, respectively.Table 2. Allenyne scope.[a]  Entry  Allenyne  Product  Yield [%]  [a] Reaction method A: Pd(OAc)2 (5 mol %), BQ (1.2 equiv), allenyne (1.0 equiv), HOAc, 60 °C, 17 h; method B: Pd(OAc)2 (5 mol %), BQ (1.2 equiv), HOAc (5.0 equiv), allenyne (1.0 equiv), acetone, 60 °C, 17 h; method C: Pd(OAc)2 (5 mol %), [Co(salophen)] (5 mol %), BQ (20 mol %), HOAc (5.0 equiv), allenyne (1.0 equiv), acetone, 1 atm O2, 60 °C, 18 h.

Open FigureDownload Powerpoint slideThe reaction of phenyl-substituted allenyne 1 f.Furthermore, the scope of the reaction with respect to the carboxylic acid coupling partner was also studied by using allenyne 1 b (Scheme 3). In addition to acetic acid, aliphatic carboxylic acids such as propionic acid or butyric acid reacted smoothly by employing method A to give the cyclized vinylallene products 3 bb (65 %) and 3 bc (74 %), respectively. Moreover, benzoic acid and other functionalized aromatic carboxylic acids bearing methoxy, fluorine, or chlorine groups were also tolerated under the oxidative procedure giving the corresponding carbocyclization products in good yields (64–84 %). Interestingly, only trace amounts (<1 %) of dimerization product 4 b (formed by dimerization of 1 b through the mechanism shown in Scheme 6) were observed in the reactions in Scheme 3.Scheme 3. Open FigureDownload Powerpoint slideCarboxylic acid scope. [a] Method A was used.Oxidation processes utilizing molecular oxygen have attracted considerable attention in recent years,8 and therefore the oxidative carbocyclization in Table 2 and Scheme 3 was studied under various aerobic conditions. It was found that the combination of cocatalyst [Co(salophen)]9 with molecular oxygen (balloon) in the presence of catalytic amounts of BQ (20 mol %) permits the efficient reoxidation of Pd0 to PdII and makes it possible to use O2 as the oxidant in the acetoxylation/carbocyclization of allenynes (Table 2, entries 1–3 with method C. For details, please see Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information).The synthetic potential of the acyloxylated allene products was demonstrated by a few transformations of the representative product 3 aa. Acetoxyallene 3 aa was first converted to 3,4-allenol 8 through hydrolysis10 (Scheme 4). Under different cyclization conditions,11 the prepared 3,4-allenol 8 was subsequently cyclized to various dihydropyran-fused bicyclic skeletons such as 9 (81 %),11a 10 (82 %),11b and 11 (85 %),11c respectively.Scheme 4. Open FigureDownload Powerpoint slideApplication of the acyloxylated allene product 3 aa.To gain some insight into the reaction mechanism, the deuterium kinetic isotope effect (KIE) was determined from the experiment where a 1:1 mixture of 1 a and [D2]-1 a was allowed to react in acetic acid under the reaction conditions used in Table 2 [Eq. (1)]. The product ratio 3 aa/[D1]-3 aa at 13 % yield (ca. 35 % conv.) was 4.8:1, and from this ratio the KIE was determined to kH/kD=5.5.12 Furthermore, the intrinsic KIE from intramolecular competition was determined by the use of [D1]-1 a as the allenyne substrate. In this case kH/kD=6.1 [Eq. (2)]. Parallel kinetic experiments using 1 a and [D2]-1 a provided an intermolecular KIE (kH/kD, from initial rate) value of 5.1 [Eqs. (3) and (4)]. These results indicate that the propargylic CH bond cleavage is the rate-determining step in the reaction.13(1)Two control experiments with the deuterium-labeled allenynes [D6]-1 a and [D2]-1 a were carried out under the standard conditions. Allenyne [D6]-1 a gave an increased yield (80 %) of acetoxylated vinylallene ([D6]-3 aa) compared to the undeuterated allene, whereas the yield of the corresponding dimer products decreased to 2 % (Scheme 5 a). In contrast, the allenyne [D2]-1 a gave only 20 % yield of acetoxylated vinylallene along with an increased yield (16 %) of the corresponding dimers (Scheme 5 b).Scheme 5. Open FigureDownload Powerpoint slideThe control reactions of allenynes [D6]-1 a (a) and [D2]-1 a (b).A control experiment replacing the allenyne by an enyne, dimethyl-2-(3′-methylbut-2′-enyl)-2-(pent-2′-ynyl)malonate, was also carried out under the standard conditions of Table 2 using method A. No formation of the corresponding cyclized allene products was observed, which shows that the allene moiety in the substrate is crucial for the oxidative transformation (Scheme S2 in the Supporting Information).On the basis of these experimental findings, we propose the mechanism shown in Scheme 6. π-Complex formation of 1 with Pd(OAc)2 to give chelate A and subsequent rearrangement involving a propargylic CH bond cleavage would produce vinylpalladium intermediate B. Intramolecular vinylpalladation of the allene moiety would generate (π-allyl)palladium intermediate D, which is attacked by an acetate nucleophile (coordinated or external)14 to give 3. Competing allene attack in A through allylic CH bond cleavage4d and subsequent alkyne insertion would generate intermediate E. Reaction of E with another molecule of allenyne 1 through insertion of the vinyl–Pd bond of E into the allene moiety of 1 would give the π-allyl species F, which would yield dimers (4, 6, and 7; for details, see the Supporting Information). Also, a mechanism involving a pallada(IV)cyclopentene7 intermediate C could be possible, which would generate intermediates D and E through β-H elimination and subsequent loss of HOAc leading to product 3 and dimeric by-products, respectively. Although β-H elimination in electron-deficient PdIV intermediates is considered to be less likely,15 β-H elimination from less electron-deficient PdIV intermediate C may occur.Scheme 6. Open FigureDownload Powerpoint slidePlausible mechanisms for the palladium-catalyzed oxidative acetoxylation/carbocyclization of allenyne 1.One could also consider a mechanism through acetoxypalladation of the terminal CC double bond of the allene, followed by insertion of the alkyne into the newly generated vinyl–Pd bond and subsequent β-H elimination to give acetoxyallene 3 (for a detailed mechanism, see the Supporting Information). However, with this mechanism one would not obtain any significant change of the ratio between vinylallene 3 and dimers with dideuterated species [D2]-1 a compared to nondeuterated 1 a, since with this mechanism the ratio between the competing pathways leading to 3 and dimers would be determined in the first step without any possible isotope effect (see the Supporting Information). The low ratio of 1.3:1 between [D1]-3 aa and dimers from [D2]-1 a (Scheme 5 b) therefore rules out this mechanism. In contrast, the two mechanisms proposed in Scheme 6 (via intermediates B and C, respectively) are in agreement with the results observed in Equations (1)–(4) and Scheme 5.In summary, we have developed a novel palladium-catalyzed oxidative carbocyclization of allenynes in the presence of various carboxylic acids, providing access to potentially synthetically useful acyloxylated vinylallenes. During this carbocyclization a new CC bond, a new CO bond, and a new allene structure are formed. Furthermore, an aerobic version of this transformation using a catalytic amount of BQ was developed to enhance the utility of this method. According to the results of deuterium labeling experiments, we propose that the reaction of the allenynes proceeds through competing propargylic and allylic CH bond cleavage pathways or via a pallada(IV)cyclopentene intermediate with competing β-eliminations. Further studies on the mechanism and synthetic application of this reaction are ongoing.Experimental SectionTypical experimental procedure for palladium-catalyzed oxidative acyloxylation/carbocyclization of allenyne 1: To a mixture of BQ (26.2 mg, 0.24 mmol) and Pd(OAc)2 (2.4 mg, 0.01 mmol) were added 1 b (69.5 mg, 0.20 mmol) and HOAc (0.4 mL) at room temperature. The reaction was stirred at 60 °C for 17 h. After full consumption of starting material 1 b, as monitored by TLC, the reaction was cooled to room temperature, diluted with Et2O (20 mL), and quenched with H2O (5 mL). The organic phase was separated and the aqueous phase was extracted with Et2O (2×20 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with H2O and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4.

Abstract [en]Palladium catalysis has emerged as an outstanding tool in synthetic organic chemistry for the mild and selective formation of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds. This thesis has been directed towards the extension of palladium(II)-catalyzed carbocyclization chemistry under oxidative conditions. An oxidative carbocyclization/functionalization methodology utilizing boron-containing transmetalation reagents was exploited to convert 1,5-allenynes into either arylated or borylated carbocycles. Two protocols were developed that use minimal amounts of Pd(OAc)2, stoichiometric para-benzoquinone as the oxidant and either bis(pinacolato)diboron or different arylboronic acids under mild conditions. A wide substrate scope is applicable to both methods. When the allenyne substrate bears a propargylic hydrogen, two isomeric functionalized carbocycles can be formed. By controlling the reaction conditions the reaction can be directed towards either of these two isomeric products. Kinetic isotope effect studies suggest that the mechanism leading to the different products proceeds through allylic or propargylic C-H bond cleavage, respectively. Moreover, it was observed that water has an interesting effect on the product selectivity when arylboronic acids are used in the oxidative carbocyclization of allenynes.

Abstract [en]The selective formation of carbon-carbon bonds constitutes a key transformation in organic synthesis with useful applications in pharmaceutical or material industry. A particularly versatile tool for carbon-carbon as well as carbon-heteroatom bond formation is palladium catalysis, which allows for mild and selective routes even towards complex structures.The work in this thesis describes the development and the mechanistic investigation of a palladium(II)-catalyzed oxidative carbocyclization/functionalization methodology, which converts 1,5-allenynes into either arylated or borylated carbocycles. To this end, either boronic acids or B2pin2 are employed and 1,4-benzoquinone serves as the stoichiometric oxidant. These protocols provide access to two products, a cyclic triene and a cyclic vinylallene. Their formation is dependent on the substrate structure as the latter product requires a propargylic C–H bond to be present in the substrate. Based on kinetic isotope effects, mechanisms involving either an initial allenic or propargylic C–H abstraction, respectively, were proposed. Full control of product selectivity to give either trienes or vinylallenes was achieved by modifying the reaction conditions with additives. Using substoichiometric amounts of BF3·OEt2 leads selectively to borylated or arylated vinylallenes. Under arylating conditions the reaction is zero order in allenyne and oxidant, and first order in phenylboronic acid. Transmetalation and, to some extent, propargylic C–H cleavage were found to be turnover-limiting. The selective reaction towards functionalized trienes was achieved by addition of either substoichiometric LiOAc·2H2O (borylation) or excess amounts of H2O (arylation). For the latter case, a kinetic study revealed an unusually slow catalyst activation. Lower concentrations of H2O gave product mixtures, and it was shown that vinylallenes are formed with either boronic acid or boroxine, whereas the formation of trienes requires boronic acid.

Abstract [en]
                In control: A highly selective carbocyclization/borylation of allenynes with bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) under palladium catalysis and with p-benzoquinone (BQ) as the oxidant was developed. The use of either LiOAc⋅2 H2O with 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) as the solvent or BF3⋅Et2O together with THF is crucial for the selective formation of borylated trienes and vinylallenes, respectively.

Abstract [en]Palladium catalysis has emerged as an outstanding tool in synthetic organic chemistry for the mild and selective formation of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds. This thesis has been directed towards the extension of palladium(II)-catalyzed carbocyclization chemistry under oxidative conditions. An oxidative carbocyclization/functionalization methodology utilizing boron-containing transmetalation reagents was exploited to convert 1,5-allenynes into either arylated or borylated carbocycles. Two protocols were developed that use minimal amounts of Pd(OAc)2, stoichiometric para-benzoquinone as the oxidant and either bis(pinacolato)diboron or different arylboronic acids under mild conditions. A wide substrate scope is applicable to both methods. When the allenyne substrate bears a propargylic hydrogen, two isomeric functionalized carbocycles can be formed. By controlling the reaction conditions the reaction can be directed towards either of these two isomeric products. Kinetic isotope effect studies suggest that the mechanism leading to the different products proceeds through allylic or propargylic C-H bond cleavage, respectively. Moreover, it was observed that water has an interesting effect on the product selectivity when arylboronic acids are used in the oxidative carbocyclization of allenynes.

Palladium(II)-Catalyzed Oxidative Carbocyclization/Functionalization of AllenynesOpen this publication in new window or tab >>Palladium(II)-Catalyzed Oxidative Carbocyclization/Functionalization of AllenynesBartholomeyzik, TeresaStockholm University, Faculty of Science, Department of Organic Chemistry.2014 (English)Doctoral thesis, comprehensive summary (Other academic)
Abstract [en]The selective formation of carbon-carbon bonds constitutes a key transformation in organic synthesis with useful applications in pharmaceutical or material industry. A particularly versatile tool for carbon-carbon as well as carbon-heteroatom bond formation is palladium catalysis, which allows for mild and selective routes even towards complex structures.The work in this thesis describes the development and the mechanistic investigation of a palladium(II)-catalyzed oxidative carbocyclization/functionalization methodology, which converts 1,5-allenynes into either arylated or borylated carbocycles. To this end, either boronic acids or B2pin2 are employed and 1,4-benzoquinone serves as the stoichiometric oxidant. These protocols provide access to two products, a cyclic triene and a cyclic vinylallene. Their formation is dependent on the substrate structure as the latter product requires a propargylic C–H bond to be present in the substrate. Based on kinetic isotope effects, mechanisms involving either an initial allenic or propargylic C–H abstraction, respectively, were proposed. Full control of product selectivity to give either trienes or vinylallenes was achieved by modifying the reaction conditions with additives. Using substoichiometric amounts of BF3·OEt2 leads selectively to borylated or arylated vinylallenes. Under arylating conditions the reaction is zero order in allenyne and oxidant, and first order in phenylboronic acid. Transmetalation and, to some extent, propargylic C–H cleavage were found to be turnover-limiting. The selective reaction towards functionalized trienes was achieved by addition of either substoichiometric LiOAc·2H2O (borylation) or excess amounts of H2O (arylation). For the latter case, a kinetic study revealed an unusually slow catalyst activation. Lower concentrations of H2O gave product mixtures, and it was shown that vinylallenes are formed with either boronic acid or boroxine, whereas the formation of trienes requires boronic acid.
