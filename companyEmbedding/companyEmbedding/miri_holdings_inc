As one of the leading general insurance companies in Malaysia with a network of 22 offices nationwide that serves over a million customers, Berjaya Sompo strives to provide the best insurance solutions and services to our customers. With our strong financial background and consistent comparative global insights, we have increased our paid-up capital to over RM100 million way before the enforcement of the regulatory requirement for all insurance companies in Malaysia.
Our culture of prioritizing world-class services dates back to 1974, when the Company started as an overseas branch office for one of the international insurance companies. As the Company continues to progress towards the new millennium, things began picking up in 1991, when the Company officially changed its name to Berjaya General Insurance Sdn. Bhd. and converted to a public company in 1997. And by 1999, Berjaya General Insurance Berhad becomes 100% owned by Berjaya Capital Berhad.
In 2006, Sompo Holdings, Inc. purchased 30% equity stake in the Company from Berjaya Capital Berhad. Subsequently, we changed our name to Berjaya Sompo Insurance Berhad to reflect the strategic alliance between Berjaya Capital Berhad and Sompo Holdings, Inc. In 2011, Sompo Holdings, Inc. acquired a further 40% equity interest in the Company, thus making Berjaya Sompo Insurance Berhad a 70% owned subsidiary of Sompo Holdings, Inc.

As one of the leading general insurance companies in Malaysia with a network of 22 offices nationwide that serves over a million customers, Berjaya Sompo strives to provide the best insurance solutions and services to our customers. With our strong financial background and consistent comparative global insights, we have increased our paid-up capital to over RM100 million way before the enforcement of the regulatory requirement for all insurance companies in Malaysia.
Our culture of prioritizing world-class services dates back to 1974, when the Company started as an overseas branch office for one of the international insurance companies. As the Company continues to progress towards the new millennium, things began picking up in 1991, when the Company officially changed its name to Berjaya General Insurance Sdn. Bhd. and converted to a public company in 1997. And by 1999, Berjaya General Insurance Berhad becomes 100% owned by Berjaya Capital Berhad.
In 2006, Sompo Holdings, Inc. purchased 30% equity stake in the Company from Berjaya Capital Berhad. Subsequently, we changed our name to Berjaya Sompo Insurance Berhad to reflect the strategic alliance between Berjaya Capital Berhad and Sompo Holdings, Inc. In 2011, Sompo Holdings, Inc. acquired a further 40% equity interest in the Company, thus making Berjaya Sompo Insurance Berhad a 70% owned subsidiary of Sompo Holdings, Inc.
