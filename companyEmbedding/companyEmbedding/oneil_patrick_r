List Price: 
								$120.00							  



Quantity: 





Genre: Creative nonfiction, memoir

	For writers working on a memoir, a book on a non-fiction subject, or collection of essays—or on individual, shorter works. Book coaches read and respond to twenty pages of work. Responses include a written overall critique (email attachment), line edits and recommendations for revision. When appropriate, recommendations will include advice about publication. May be repeated.

4-Week Module

Patrick's Book Coaching Statement: 

	Writing has to grab you, command your attention, and make you want to read it. I approach ALL writing with this in mind. It doesn’t matter what the subject is. I have read books on falconry, horticulture, and fencing—all of which are areas that didn’t immediately interest me—and ended up fascinated because of the author’s ability to write compellingly on their subject matter. I have also read detective novels, literary fiction, short stories, and plot driven narratives I thought would just be light reading, and came away in awe. Because what it all comes down to is the author’s choices in language, syntax, and structure, and this is where a book coach comes in. You’ve written a final, or at least a good working draft, and the idea is there, but there’s something missing. You haven’t gotten the response that you want when others have read it, or when you have submitted to agents and presses.

	Having another writer with editorial experience take a look and offer suggestions is incredibly helpful. Another set of eyes, whose only invested interest is to help make your writing better, and can suggest the needed revisions to make your writing do what you want it to do. This is not to change your voice or make your writing like someone else’s. This is to define what is yours, and to improve it. As your book coach that is exactly what I’ll do when we work together. It will be an interaction between the two of us to assess and revise your writing.

	I work with a very diverse group of writers and students. I edit and revise narrative nonfiction and memoir, as well as fiction. I lead nonfiction workshops, and teach college level English classes (online and in the classroom). So when I say “diverse group” I mean that I have experience working with writers at all levels, different backgrounds, and abilities. I have an understanding of where a writer is, and what they need to do in order for their writing to grab you, command your attention, and make you want to read.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
