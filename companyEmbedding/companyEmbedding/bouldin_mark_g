Pretreated aggregate for hotmix asphalt concrete applications and other related applications



Patent number:  7662226
                                            

Abstract:  A process of producing an asphalt concrete with enhanced performance is provided by utilizing a primer comprising uintahite and an augmenter. The primer is added to a hot aggregate with a surface temperature of at least 250 deg. F. prior to addition of an asphalt-derived base binder. The primer forms a primer interlayer between the hot aggregate and the base binder. As a result, the asphalt concrete has enhanced performance when compared with other asphalt concretes produced without a primer being added.
