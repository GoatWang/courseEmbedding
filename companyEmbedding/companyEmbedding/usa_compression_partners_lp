Company History |  USA Compression Partners LLC | People, Culture, Equipment, Service
























































































Company History
















Founded in 1998, USA Compression has grown to serve a diverse customer base in many key producing oil & gas regions.
USA Compression was co-founded by current CEO Eric D. Long in 1998 as a “start-up” compression services provider, with a strategic vision to operate with a differentiated business model – one focused on deploying standardized, new-build, large horsepower compressor packages for utilization in infrastructure applications. With private financial backing, USAC grew from a business plan to over 600,000 HP by the end of 2010, primarily focused on large horsepower units. In that time period, the Company’s geographic footprint, initially focused in the Fayetteville shale, grew to encompass a broader Mid-Continent presence, the Barnett shale, eastern Texas and the Haynesville shale, the Eagle Ford shale as well as entry into the Northeast by way of the Marcellus shale. The Company continues to grow its geographic reach, following existing customers and gaining new customers in regions including the Permian and Delaware Basins and the Utica shale.

In December of 2010, New York-based energy private equity firm Riverstone Holdings, LLC purchased a controlling stake in the company. In January 2013, USAC completed its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange and began trading as a publicly-listed master limited partnership (NYSE: USAC). In August 2013, USAC completed the $182 million acquisition of certain assets of Tulsa, OK-based S&R Compression, adding the capability to provide gas lift compression services for crude oil production. These assets are primarily located in western Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle. As a result of the transaction, Argonaut Private Equity and its controlling owner, George B. Kaiser, became significant owners of common LP units of USAC.
USAC continues to execute it organic growth plan and remains committed to its original business model – providing large horsepower compression services serving infrastructure applications.

Where We Operate |  USA Compression Partners LLC | People, Culture, Equipment, Service
























































































Where We Operate
















USA Compression provides its compression services throughout many of the prolific producing areas in the U.S., and over the past decade or so has focused its operations and capital in a number of unconventional resource plays throughout the country, including shales and other tight crude oil and natural gas plays. In particular, USA Compression has a large operating presence in the following areas: Utica and Marcellus, Permian and Delaware basins, Eagle Ford, Fayetteville, Woodford, Mississippi Lime, Granite Wash, Barnett and Haynesville shales. Collectively, these areas account for much of the growth in natural gas and oil production over the last decade. Given that the demand for our compression services is driven by domestic production of natural gas and oil, we will continue to focus our operations and activities in the areas of attractive production growth, which are generally found in these unconventional resource plays.
While our business focuses largely on compression services serving infrastructure installations, including centralized natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities, which utilize large horsepower compression units, typically in shale plays, we also provide compression services in more mature conventional basins, including gas lift applications on crude oil wells targeted by horizontal drilling techniques. We are currently focused on our existing service areas; however our customers have compression demands in other areas of the U.S. in conjunction with their field development projects, and we continually consider expansion of our areas of operation in the U.S. based upon the level of customer demand.

What is an Experience Mod Rating?



The Mod Rating is one of the two most important factors that effect a carrier's premium for workers comp insurance.  Each business in a state is provided a mod rating by the state's rating bureau which is a reflection of the amount of workers comp claims they have had.  If someone has an accident at work, your mod rating will increase and so will your premium.

What is an LCM?



A Loss Cost Multiplier, or LCM, is a rating for an insurance carrier that reflects their overhead in providing coverage for workers comp insurance.  It is one of the two main ratings that effect an insurance premium.  You are more likely to get a better premium from a carrier with a lower LCM, so it is important to know what your carrier's LCM is.  While a premium is generally the result of a formula, carriers are able to deviate plus or minus 25% from that formula.
