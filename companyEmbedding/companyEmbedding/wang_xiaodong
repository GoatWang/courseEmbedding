Our knowledge of China is being transformed with each passing day. Five years ago, virtually the only subject on people's minds was Tiananmen Square. Now nearly everyone knows that the country has undergone a huge economic transformation, and that the future belongs to it in a way that was previously inconceivable. But knowledge about China still remains of the broadest brush. There is little or no perception, for example, of the political and intellectual debates that shape the attitudes of either the Chinese elite or the population at large. Indeed, there is still an underlying assumption that this is an autocracy in which there are no real debates, just fiats handed down from on high.
This is a misconception or, at best, a half-truth. The extraordinary success of China over the past quarter of a century is the product of a sophisticated political leadership, highly attuned to the problems and possibilities that it faces and informed by a plethora of debates and arguments. Those arguments, however, take place within strict parameters, are largely confined to elite circles and are often highly coded. The most important recent such debate has concerned nationalism, and one of its key figures is Wang Xiaodong, a Chinese intellectual in his late 40s. Largely as a result of his book Chinese Nationalism Under the Shadow of Globalisation, which was published in 1999 (just after the Nato bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which led to angry demonstrations in Beijing), Wang is now widely seen as a leading thinker of the nationalist movement.
His main target has been what he calls "reverse racism", or the widespread attitude among Chinese intellectuals that denigrates China and looks to the west for the country's future and salvation. In fact, this kind of attitude is far from unusual in the Asian tiger countries: as they have exploded into economic growth, they have invariably looked to the west, at least initially, as their model and their vision. 
The venom of Wang's assault on this mentality, during a recent visit to London, says a lot about the Chinese psyche. "In my opinion, this is not very different from Hitler's racism. The only difference between them and Hitler is that they direct this theory against their own race." There is, of course, every difference between self-denigration and the extermination of another race. It is an utterly inappropriate use of the term "racism": indeed, it suggests an ignorance of what racism is, an ignorance that typifies Han Chinese attitudes more generally. China - and the Han Chinese who make up the vast majority of the population - is characterised by a deep Sino-centrism. When I suggest that terms such as self-hatred or self-loathing might be more accurate, Wang counters: "I insist on using the term racism because foreigners don't believe it can happen in China, the idea that the Chinese are an inferior race. We have never had this experience in Chinese history before." 
This sense of inferiority is hardly surprising, especially after the Cultural Revolution, during which the country took leave of its collective senses. Wang agrees, arguing that "reverse racism" is strongest among those in their 30s and 40s who lived through the revolution; those in their 20s, whose attitudes have been shaped by a very different set of circumstances, have a very different mentality. "They have a sense of pride in their nation. They care more about national interests. They are not unconditional supporters of the United States." In short, they are products of China's successful economic growth. Wang, now a pollster, has polls to show these generational differences, but alas, these are still only for restricted circulation. 
For a century and a half, China has lived in the shadow of the west, and indeed Japan as well. An intensely proud country, which for centuries boasted one of the most advanced civilisations in the world, it felt humiliated by its backwardness and, above all, by its defeats at the hands of the west and Japan. The extraordinary economic transformation of the past two decades has lent the country a new sense of pride and self-confidence. For the first time for two centuries, China is beginning to feel good about itself and, as a consequence, flex its psychological muscles. 
Wang came to prominence in the late 90s when he was an editor of Strategy and Management, the most important and interesting literary and intellectual journal in China at the time. The so-called nationalist debate could hardly have been more central - or sensitive - to China's future: it concerned the most important issue facing the country, namely which economic strategy the country should pursue. It was an argument that Wang lost, leading to his sacking from his job as an economics professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. 
According to Wang, there were three main positions: the first, which was ultimately to triumph and become indelibly associated with the leadership of Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji, proposed that the country should embrace globalisation, join the World Trade Organisation and open itself to foreign capital, even though it was recognised that this would inevitably cast China, at least initially, in the role of a low-technology manufacturer, in the nether reaches of the global economic food chain. The second position, which was associated with the left, emphasised, in the face of economic growth, the importance of maintaining social equity. The third, Wang's own position, argued that the Chinese state should pursue a more selective and protectionist approach towards globalisation, borrowing from the Japanese and South Korean experiences, in order to prevent China becoming permanently trapped at the lower ends of the global division of labour. 
So what does he feel a decade on? Has the gamble of high growth and foreign capital worked? Was he wrong? "I am an optimist," he says. "I do not think we can yet say that China has already won this bet, but the chances of victory are very large because China is already showing signs of moving towards hi-technology under market forces." 
In one sense, the argument is far from over. Wang's real target is what he calls the "liberal faction", which he describes as "pro-American, pro-wealth and pro-democracy - providing that it does not harm their wealth". When asked to define what he means by the liberal faction he suggests those members of the elite outside the Communist party who occupy the dominant positions in the universities and the media. As Christopher Hughes, who is writing a book on Chinese nationalism at the London School of Economics, points out, Wang is an astute political operator who knows whom to attack and whom not to - he leaves the party well alone. 
At the core of his argument lies the attitude of this group towards the US: "When it comes to the problem of the national interest, China's liberal faction stands unconditionally on the side of other countries, mainly the United States. They submit unceasingly favourable reports about the United States: that we don't need vigilance towards the Americans, nor should we develop our national industries. We should place our full confidence in the United States for recovering Taiwan. This is nonsense." The fact that America "is the pillar of the world situation at present proves that our international order has the structure of a dictatorship. At present ... China is benefiting ... but American foreign policy could change". 
Wang believes in globalisation as a way of fulfilling the nationalist ideal of a wealthy country and strong army: "China is a beneficiary of the present international order. We want to preserve the international order." In so saying, he distances himself from much of the developing world and from the anti-globalisation movement. But he constantly warns that American policy may change, that China must depend on its own strength. His clear message: do not trust the United States. 
Despite his relative isolation, Wang is a popular figure in China. In Chinese terms, he says what he thinks. He is combative, displaying a toughness that has no doubt helped him to survive defeat. He is also confident of his own position - and probably with very good reason. Although he complains that the nationalist position has been largely suppressed by establishment intellectuals and the state-run media - "my channels for publishing articles have been very few, and often publication has only been possible due to the use of personal relationships" - he points to the internet, and sites such as BBS (Bulletin Board Service), to suggest that there is considerable latent support for his position. As China takes its place on the world stage, it is not difficult to imagine growing support for the kind of arguments presented by Wang. 
Until now, the Chinese position has been sotto voce. Given the country's abject poverty and underdevelopment, Deng Xiaoping recognised the need to concentrate all China's efforts and resources on economic development - everything else would depend on its success in this enterprise. With extraordinary self-discipline, this is exactly what China has done for the past 27 years. But it would be wrong to mistake the single-mindedness that China has displayed for its longer-term ambition. China is an extraordinarily old and proud culture, with a very powerful sense of its own identity. Successful economic growth is the pre-condition for the exercise of a wider political, cultural and military influence. 
Wang Xiaodong is unusual in that he asserts this broader perspective with unusual candour. But the views he expresses will surely become far more familiar to western ears as China becomes increasingly powerful economically.

Introduction to Apoptosis: Xiaodong Wang          iBiologyFree Biology Videos Bringing the World's Best Biology to You iBiology > iBioSeminars > Cell Biology > Xiaodong Wang Part 1Xiaodong Wang: ApoptosisI. Introduction to Apoptosis II. Factors Involved in the Intrinsic Pathway of Apoptosis III. Extrinsic Pathway and Regulation of ApoptosisPart I: Introduction to ApoptosisDownload:This Video Subtitled Videos: EnglishResources:Related ArticlesTranscript (.txt) (.xls)Trouble Viewing? Try it on iTunes.Report a problem.Lecture Overview Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that plays important roles during animal development, immune response, elimination of damaged cells, and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Apoptosis is executed by intracellular proteases named caspases that are activated during the onset of apoptosis by extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.The intrinsic pathway is triggered by the release of proteins such as cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol and the extrinsic pathway is activated by the binding of death-inducing cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis Factor to its receptor at the cell surface. Both pathways are regulated at multiple steps to ensure proper apoptosis.Speaker Bio Xiaodong Wang is the Director and an Investigator of the National Institute for Biological Sciences, Beijing.  Previously, Dr. Wang was a professor of biochemistry at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas and an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute from 1997-2010.Wang received a bachelor’s degree in biology from Beijing Normal University in Beijing, China, in 1984 and a doctorate degree in biochemistry from UT Southwestern in 1991. Among the honors he has received are the Richard Lounsbery Award and the Molecular Biology Award from the National Academy of Sciences, USA; the Hackerman Award from the Welch Foundation in Houston; the Paul Marks Prize from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; the Eli Lilly Award from the American Chemical Society; the Schering-Plough Award from the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Shaw Prize in Life Science and Medicine in 2006.Wang’s laboratory’s research focuses on the cellular mechanisms that controls the life and death of animal cells.Related TalksRobert Horvitz iBioEducation Discovery Talk:  Discovering Programmed Cell Death Related ArticlesAlberts, B. et al.

Projects





Vision and Language Intelligence



					Established: June 28, 2017				

				This project aims at driving disruptive advances in vision and language intelligence. We believe future breakthroughs in multimodal intelligence will empower smart communications between humans and the world and enable next-generation scenarios such as a universal chatbot and intelligent augmented reality. To these ends, we are focusing on understanding, reasoning, and generation across language and vision, and creation of intelligent services, including vision-to-text captioning, text-to-vision generation, and question answering/dialog about images and videos.			






Deep Learning for Machine Reading Comprehension



					Established: September 1, 2016				

				The goal of this project is to teach a computer to read and answer general questions pertaining to a document. We recently released a large scale MRC dataset, MS MARCO.  We developed a ReasoNet model to mimic the inference process of human readers. With a question in mind, ReasoNets read a document repeatedly, each time focusing on different parts of the document until a satisfying answer is found or formed. The extension of ReasoNet (ReasoNet-Memory)…			






Any2Vec



					Established: August 1, 2016				

				Embed objects of any modality (e.g. images, queries, sentences, etc.) to the same semantic vector space.

From Captions to Visual Concepts and Back



					Established: April 9, 2015				

				We introduce a novel approach for automatically generating image descriptions. Visual detectors, language models, and deep multimodal similarity models are learned directly from a dataset of image captions. Our system is state-of-the-art on the official Microsoft COCO benchmark, producing a BLEU-4 score of 29.1%. Human judges consider the captions to be as good as or better than humans 34% of the time.			






DSSM



					Established: January 30, 2015				

				The goal of this project is to develop a class of deep representation learning models. DSSM stands for Deep Structured Semantic Model, or more general, Deep Semantic Similarity Model. DSSM, developed by the MSR Deep Learning Technology Center(DLTC), is a deep neural network (DNN) modeling technique for representing text strings (sentences, queries, predicates, entity mentions, etc.) in a continuous semantic space and modeling semantic similarity between two text strings (e.g., Sent2Vec). DSSM has wide applications including information retrieval…			






Spoken Language Understanding



					Established: May 1, 2013				

				Spoken language understanding (SLU) is an emerging field in between the areas of speech processing and natural language processing. The term spoken language understanding has largely been coined for targeted understanding of human speech directed at machines. This project covers our research on SLU tasks such as domain detection, intent determination, and slot filling, using data-driven methods. Projects Deeper Understanding: Moving beyond shallow targeted understanding towards building domain independent SLU models. Scaling SLU: Quickly bootstrapping SLU…			






Recurrent Neural Networks for Language Processing



					Established: November 23, 2012				

				This project focuses on advancing the state-of-the-art in language processing with recurrent neural networks. We are currently applying these to language modeling, machine translation, speech recognition, language understanding and meaning representation. A special interest in is adding side-channels of information as input, to model phenomena which are not easily handled in other frameworks. A toolkit for doing RNN language modeling with side-information is in the associated download. Sample word vectors for use with this toolkit…
