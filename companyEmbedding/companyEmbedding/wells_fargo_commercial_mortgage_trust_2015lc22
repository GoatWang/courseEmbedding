      --$22,888,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$9,637,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (c) Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEX

      Since Fitch issued its presale on Sept. 9, 2015, the balance of the 
      class A-3 certificates has increased from $175,000,000 to $220,000,000 
      and the balance of the class A-4 certificates has decreased from 
      $347,267,000 to $302,267,000. Additionally, the $56,619,000 class X-B 
      certificates, the $347,267,000 class A-4FL and $0 class A-4FX 
      certificates have been removed from the capital structure by the issuer. 
      Fitch has withdrawn its ratings on the class A-4FL and A-4FX 
      certificates. Fitch does not rate the $43,368,520 class G and 
      $43,368,520 interest-only class X-G certificates.
    

      The classes above reflect the final ratings and deal structure. The 
      certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 100 loans secured by 106 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $963.7 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Ladder Capital Finance LLC, Rialto Mortgage Finance, LLC, Wells Fargo 
      Bank, N.A., and National Cooperative Bank, N.A.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 67.1% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 69.1%, and asset summary reviews on 69.1% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Leverage in line with Recent Transactions: The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV 
      are 1.41x and 103.9%, respectively. However, excluding co-op collateral, 
      the pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.14x and 107.0%, respectively. This 
      is in line with other recent Fitch-rated transactions. The 2014 and YTD 
      2015 average Fitch LTVs were 106.2% and 109.2%, respectively. The 2014 
      and YTD 2015 average Fitch DSCRs were 1.19x and 1.20x, respectively.
    

      Multifamily Concentration and Co-Op Collateral: Multifamily properties, 
      including co-ops, comprise 29.2% of the pool, which is greater than the 
      2014 and YTD 2015 average multifamily concentration of 15.8% and 15.4%, 
      respectively. Multifamily has a below average probability of default in 
      Fitch's analysis. Additionally, the pool contains 10 loans (4.2% of the 
      pool) secured by multifamily co-ops within the New York City metro area. 
      The weighted average Fitch DSCR and LTV of the co-op collateral in this 
      transaction as rentals are 7.37x and 33.1%, respectively.
    

      Esoteric Property Types: Two loans in the top 20 largest in the pool are 
      secured by non-traditional property types. San Diego Park 'N Fly (2.3% 
      of the pool) is secured by the interests in an airport parking garage 
      and surface lot located in close proximity to the San Diego 
      International Airport. Jellystone Park (1.5% of the pool) is secured by 
      a campground and waterpark located in Burleson, TX.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 12.1% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent 
      NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to WFCM 
      2015-LC22 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 10 - 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence information was 
      provided on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 
      100 mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis 
      and the findings did not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the 
      ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary (RAC).

      (c) Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEX 
      certificates, and class PEX certificates may be exchanged for class A-S, 
      B, and C certificates.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Sept. 2, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $43,368,520 class G, 
      the $56,619,000 interest-only class X-B, or the $43,368,520 
      interest-only class X-G certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 100 loans secured by 106 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $963.7 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Ladder Capital Finance, LLC, Rialto Mortgage Finance, LLC, Wells

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 67.1% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 69.1%, and asset summary reviews on 69.1% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Leverage in Line With Recent Transactions: The pool's Fitch debt service 
      coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) are 1.41x and 103.9%, 
      respectively. However, excluding co-op collateral, the pool's Fitch DSCR 
      and LTV are 1.14x and 107.0%, respectively. This is in line with other 
      recent Fitch-rated transactions. The 2014 and year-to-date (YTD) 2015 
      average Fitch LTVs were 106.2% and 109.2%, respectively. The 2014 and 
      YTD 2015 average Fitch DSCRs were 1.19x and 1.20x, respectively.
    

      Multifamily Concentration and Co-Op Collateral: Multifamily properties, 
      including co-ops, comprise 29.2% of the pool, which is greater than the 
      2014 and YTD 2015 average multifamily concentration of 15.8% and 15.4%, 
      respectively. Multifamily has a below average probability of default in 
      Fitch's analysis. Additionally, the pool contains 10 loans (4.2% of the 
      pool) secured by multifamily co-ops within the New York City metro area. 
      The weighted average Fitch DSCR and LTV of the co-op collateral in this 
      transaction as rentals are 7.37x and 33.1%, respectively.
    

      Esoteric Property Types: Two loans in the top 20 largest in the pool are 
      secured by non-traditional property types. San Diego Park 'N Fly (2.3% 
      of the pool) is secured by the interests in an airport parking garage

      pool) is secured by a campground and waterpark located in Burleson, TX.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 12.1% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
