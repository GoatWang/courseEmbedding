Mathematical Modeling in Science and Engineering: An Axiomatic Approach

Description
A powerful, unified approach to mathematical and computational
modeling in science and engineering
Mathematical and computational modeling makes it possible to
predict the behavior of a broad range of systems across a broad
range of disciplines. This text guides students and professionals
through the axiomatic approach, a powerful method that will enable
them to easily master the principle types of mathematical and
computational models used in engineering and science. Readers will
discover that this axiomatic approach not only enables them to
systematically construct effective models, it also enables them to
apply these models to any macroscopic physical system.
Mathematical Modeling in Science and Engineering focuses
on models in which the processes to be modeled are expressed as
systems of partial differential equations. It begins with an
introductory discussion of the axiomatic formulation of basic
models, setting the foundation for further topics such as:


Mechanics of classical and non-classical continuous systems


Solute transport by a free fluid


Flow of a fluid in a porous medium


Multiphase systems


Enhanced oil recovery


Fluid mechanics


Throughout the text, diagrams are provided to help readers
visualize and better understand complex mathematical concepts. A
set of exercises at the end of each chapter enables readers to put
their new modeling skills into practice. There is also a
bibliography in each chapter to facilitate further investigation of
individual topics.
Mathematical Modeling in Science and Engineering is ideal
for both students and professionals across the many disciplines of
science and engineering that depend on mathematical and
computational modeling to predict and understand complex
systems.

Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"

"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."

The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.
