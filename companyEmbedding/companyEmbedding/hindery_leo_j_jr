Leo Hindery, Jr. is an American businessman, author, political activist and philanthropist.
Hindery is Managing Partner of InterMedia Partners, a New York-based media industry private equity fund. Until 2004, he was chairman and chief executive officer of The YES Network, the nation’s largest regional sports network which he founded in 2001 as the television home of the New York Yankees.
He headed Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) before it was merged into AT&T Corporation in 1999, when he became CEO of AT&T Broadband. Later, he was briefly interim CEO of GlobalCenter, a dot.com company purchased by Global Crossing. He exited Global Crossing after only seven months and was replaced by then board member and Vice Chairman Thomas Casey. At the time Hindery said, "I have done what I set out to do at Global Crossing -- improve operating management and rationalize operating assets, realize the value of GlobalCenter, and meet or ex ceed quarterly financial goals.".[1] He was the 3rd CEO of Global Crossing in less than three years.
Drawing on his time as CEO of AT&T, Hindery was interviewed by David Garrity in 2016 on the Time Warner / AT&T merger, which showed that Hindery is doubtful that regulators would permit AT&T to funnel Time Warner’s vast content through its extensive distribution network, which includes Direct TV satellite service.[2]
He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and from 2003 through December 2007 was Senate-appointed Vice Chair of the HELP Commission formed by an Act of Congress to improve U.S. foreign assistance. He is a Trustee of The New School University, a director of the Library of Congress Trust Fund, the Minority Media & Telecommunications Council, The Paley Center for Media and Teach for America, a member of the Board of Visitors of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, and a member of the New America Foundation Leadership Council. In April 2015 he was appointed to the board of Moko Social Media (NASDAQ: MOKO ASX: MKB), the premier multi-media platform for people bonded by common interests like politics, sports, and active lifestyle.[3]
Hindery has written two books: It Takes a CEO: It’s Time to Lead with Integrity [4] and The Biggest Game of All.[5]
Hindery now lives in New York City. He is an Seattle University Alum.

Politics[edit]

In 2004, his name was floated as a possible successor to Terry McAuliffe as head of the Democratic National Committee.
Hindery served as Senior Economic Policy Advisor for presidential candidate John Edwards from December 2006 until February 2008. He is currently acting as an economic advisor to Barack Obama. On the withdrawal of Bill Richardson as nominee for Secretary of Commerce on January 4, 2009 it was suggested that he might be a suitable replacement.[6]
On January 30, 2009, it was reported that Hindery's friendship and business partnership with former senator Tom Daschle might cause problems for the latter's Senate confirmation for the position of Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. Daschle has been a consultant and advisor to Hindery's InterMedia Partners since 2005, during which time he received from Hindery access to a car and chauffeur. Daschle did not declare this service on his annual tax forms as required by law. (He reportedly paid the three years of owed taxes and interest in January 2009.) According to a Daschle spokeswoman, the former Senator "simply and probably naively considered its use a generous offer" from Hindery, "a longtime friend. On February 3, 2009 Daschle withdrew his nomination."[7][8]

Chicago Cubs[edit]
Hindery was named as one of the finalists in the bidding for the Chicago Cubs in a partnership with private equity investor Marc Utay.[9] The team was eventually sold to a family trust of TD Ameritrade founder J. Joseph Ricketts, with his son Tom operating the team on a daily basis.
Motorsport[edit]
He is a keen amateur racing driver, taking part in the 24 Hours of Le Mans 4 times and winning his class in a Porsche 911 GT3-RSR in 2005.
He was also the race promoter for the Grand Prix of America Formula 1 race, which was scheduled to be held at the Port Imperial Street Circuit. The 2013 and 2014 races were cancelled and the future of the event remains unclear. Hindery still believes, however, that the 2014 race will be on the official Formula One calendar although the New Jersey race that had been included on the provisional F1 schedule for 2014 was left off the final 2014 F1 race calendar along with the provisional races in Korea and Mexico.[10][11]

At the time Hindery said, "I have done what I set out to do at Global Crossing -- improve operating management and rationalize operating assets, realize the value of GlobalCenter, and meet or ex ceed quarterly financial goals.".[1] He was the 3rd CEO of Global Crossing in less than three years.
Drawing on his time as CEO of AT&T, Hindery was interviewed by David Garrity in 2016 on the Time Warner / AT&T merger, which showed that Hindery is doubtful that regulators would permit AT&T to funnel Time Warner’s vast content through its extensive distribution network, which includes Direct TV satellite service.[2]
He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and from 2003 through December 2007 was Senate-appointed Vice Chair of the HELP Commission formed by an Act of Congress to improve U.S. foreign assistance. He is a Trustee of The New School University, a director of the Library of Congress Trust Fund, the Minority Media & Telecommunications Council, The Paley Center for Media and Teach for America, a member of the Board of Visitors of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, and a member of the New America Foundation Leadership Council. In April 2015 he was appointed to the board of Moko Social Media (NASDAQ: MOKO ASX: MKB), the premier multi-media platform for people bonded by common interests like politics, sports, and active lifestyle.[3]
Hindery has written two books: It Takes a CEO: It’s Time to Lead with Integrity [4] and The Biggest Game of All.[5]
Hindery now lives in New York City. He is an Seattle University Alum.

Politics[edit]

In 2004, his name was floated as a possible successor to Terry McAuliffe as head of the Democratic National Committee.
Hindery served as Senior Economic Policy Advisor for presidential candidate John Edwards from December 2006 until February 2008. He is currently acting as an economic advisor to Barack Obama. On the withdrawal of Bill Richardson as nominee for Secretary of Commerce on January 4, 2009 it was suggested that he might be a suitable replacement.[6]
On January 30, 2009, it was reported that Hindery's friendship and business partnership with former senator Tom Daschle might cause problems for the latter's Senate confirmation for the position of Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. Daschle has been a consultant and advisor to Hindery's InterMedia Partners since 2005, during which time he received from Hindery access to a car and chauffeur. Daschle did not declare this service on his annual tax forms as required by law. (He reportedly paid the three years of owed taxes and interest in January 2009.) According to a Daschle spokeswoman, the former Senator "simply and probably naively considered its use a generous offer" from Hindery, "a longtime friend. On February 3, 2009 Daschle withdrew his nomination."[7][8]

Chicago Cubs[edit]
Hindery was named as one of the finalists in the bidding for the Chicago Cubs in a partnership with private equity investor Marc Utay.[9] The team was eventually sold to a family trust of TD Ameritrade founder J. Joseph Ricketts, with his son Tom operating the team on a daily basis.
Motorsport[edit]
He is a keen amateur racing driver, taking part in the 24 Hours of Le Mans 4 times and winning his class in a Porsche 911 GT3-RSR in 2005.
He was also the race promoter for the Grand Prix of America Formula 1 race, which was scheduled to be held at the Port Imperial Street Circuit. The 2013 and 2014 races were cancelled and the future of the event remains unclear. Hindery still believes, however, that the 2014 race will be on the official Formula One calendar although the New Jersey race that had been included on the provisional F1 schedule for 2014 was left off the final 2014 F1 race calendar along with the provisional races in Korea and Mexico.[10][11]

Politics[edit]

In 2004, his name was floated as a possible successor to Terry McAuliffe as head of the Democratic National Committee.
Hindery served as Senior Economic Policy Advisor for presidential candidate John Edwards from December 2006 until February 2008. He is currently acting as an economic advisor to Barack Obama. On the withdrawal of Bill Richardson as nominee for Secretary of Commerce on January 4, 2009 it was suggested that he might be a suitable replacement.[6]
On January 30, 2009, it was reported that Hindery's friendship and business partnership with former senator Tom Daschle might cause problems for the latter's Senate confirmation for the position of Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. Daschle has been a consultant and advisor to Hindery's InterMedia Partners since 2005, during which time he received from Hindery access to a car and chauffeur. Daschle did not declare this service on his annual tax forms as required by law. (He reportedly paid the three years of owed taxes and interest in January 2009.) According to a Daschle spokeswoman, the former Senator "simply and probably naively considered its use a generous offer" from Hindery, "a longtime friend. On February 3, 2009 Daschle withdrew his nomination."[7][8]

Chicago Cubs[edit]
Hindery was named as one of the finalists in the bidding for the Chicago Cubs in a partnership with private equity investor Marc Utay.[9] The team was eventually sold to a family trust of TD Ameritrade founder J. Joseph Ricketts, with his son Tom operating the team on a daily basis.
Motorsport[edit]
He is a keen amateur racing driver, taking part in the 24 Hours of Le Mans 4 times and winning his class in a Porsche 911 GT3-RSR in 2005.
He was also the race promoter for the Grand Prix of America Formula 1 race, which was scheduled to be held at the Port Imperial Street Circuit. The 2013 and 2014 races were cancelled and the future of the event remains unclear. Hindery still believes, however, that the 2014 race will be on the official Formula One calendar although the New Jersey race that had been included on the provisional F1 schedule for 2014 was left off the final 2014 F1 race calendar along with the provisional races in Korea and Mexico.[10][11]
