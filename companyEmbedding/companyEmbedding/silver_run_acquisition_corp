E&P IPO: Will Silver Run II Be Able To 'Hackett' In The E&P Industry? - Silver Run Acquisition Corporation II (NASDAQ:SRUNU) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»E&P IPO: Will Silver Run II Be Able To 'Hackett' In The E&P Industry?Mar.27.17 | About: Silver Run (SRUNU) Raw Energy Oil & gas, master limited partnerships, energy, natural resourcesSummarySilver Run Acquisition Corp., a Special Purpose Acquisition Corp. ("SPAC") completed its IPO, raising $900 million in the process.SRUN priced 90 million units and 30 million warrants at $10/share and closed at $10.44 in its first day of trading on March 24.SRUN, backed by Riverstone Partners, features management including James Hackett, former CEO of Anadarko Petroleum and other E&P cos. spanning a 35-year career.Similar to Centennial Resource Development, a 2016 IPO, units offer investors a "nearly free look" at the initial transaction to be proposed by the company.Particularly in a "lower for longer" environment, the units are a good speculation on management's ability to perform and a worthy competitor in the E&P industry to follow.As Yogi Berra once said, "It's like déjà vu all over again." Readers may recognize something familiar about the name Silver Run Acquisition Corp. from an IPO last year and my article summarizing its terms and business prospects. The original Silver Run, after a business combination, morphed the company into what is now known as Centennial Resource Development (NASDAQ:CDEV). This company, Silver Run Acquisition Corp. II (SRUN), is an entirely different company, as observant readers (slightly facetiously) will notice by the 'II' designation. Like CDEV, SRUN is a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, sponsored by Riverstone Partners, an E&P asset manager with over $30 billion invested. Riverstone was founded in 2000 by David Lueschen and Pierre Lapeyre, both former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) investment bankers. Most of their funds are private equity investments on behalf of institutional clients, and SRUN is no exception; Riverstone's contribution, discussed below, will be made on behalf of their Fund VI. Besides the scope and experience of Riverstone, the SRUN offering relies on an experienced E&P executive, James Hackett. Mr. Hackett's bio is set forth below: James T. Hackett will serve as our Chief Executive Officer and a director upon completion of this offering. Mr. Hackett is a Partner at Riverstone. Prior to joining Riverstone in 2013, Mr. Hackett served as the Chairman of the Board from 2006 to 2013 and the Chief Executive Officer from 2003 to 2012 of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation. Before joining Anadarko, Mr. Hackett served as President and Chief Operating Officer of Devon Energy Corporation, following its merger with Ocean Energy, where he had served as Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hackett has held senior positions at Seagull, Duke Energy, and Pan Energy. He also held positions in engineering, finance and marketing in the midstream, oil field services, and power sectors of the energy industry. Mr. Hackett serves on the Board of Directors of Enterprise Products Holdings, LLC, Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR), National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NYSE: NOV), Sierra Oil and Gas and Talen Energy Corporation. Mr. Hackett is a former Chairman of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Mr. Hackett received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Illinois in 1975 and an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1979. Mr. Hackett was selected to serve on the board of directors due to his significant leadership experience and his extensive experience in the energy industry.
 While other officers and directors are specified in the prospectus, those individuals all also served in similar capacities in the initial Silver Run company until the combination that created CDEV. SRUN's business strategy objective is very flexible and broad, but I would expect any transactions to be primarily for the purpose of securing E&P assets. While CDEV's CEO, Mark Papa, had broad experience in onshore oil and gas, it should be noted that Mr. Hackett's expertise also included companies with significant offshore assets, including Anadarko, Devon, Ocean and Seagull. That is not to say that the offshore arena would be an area of focus, but it is one possibility. Also, although it is possible that SRUN could acquire assets or companies from other Riverstone funds, that is not the expectation. I would note in that regard that one of Riverstone's other portfolio companies, Fieldwood Energy, is the largest operator of shallow Gulf of Mexico properties, acquiring assets from Apache Corp. (NYSE:APA) and SandRidge (NYSE:SD) for over $4 billion. Fieldwood debt has recently been restructured by Riverstone. Again, I do not expect that the specific strategy of SRUN is to acquire Fieldwood; even if it were, Riverstone would have to obtain a fairness opinion to proceed. Such a transaction would also give rise to an investor "put" as described below, which would allow investors to require SRUN to buy back their shares. The offering itself was for 90 MM SRUN units at $10 per share, comprised of one share and a warrant to purchase 1/3 share at $11.50 per share. The warrants can be exercised beginning at the earlier of the date of the initial business combination or 12 months from the date of the offering, and the units can be redeemed by SRUN at such time as the share price exceeds $18 per share for 30 days (this redemption is occurring now with respect to CDEV). The units, traded under the symbol SRUNU, will become separately tradeable 52 days after the offering, under the symbols SRUN and SRUNW, respectively.
 The net proceeds from the offering will be deposited in a trust account for the benefit of shareholders, other than $5 million attributable to equity that is not returnable to investors in the event that no acceptable business combination is completed within 24 months. Until an initial business combination is proposed, those funds will be considered as part of Redeemable securities that investors may choose to require SRUN to repurchase at the time the initial transaction is proposed. So, in effect, investors will get a "nearly free look" at the proposed combination transaction, the only deduction being the common equity component above. Riverstone will own 20% of SRUN's shares, giving them an incentive to make sure the transaction it proposes passes muster with investors. It will acquire those shares for only nominal consideration, in essence similar to a private equity hedge fund deal where a percentage goes to the sponsor for its efforts. In addition, in a significant additional consideration, Riverstone's Fund VI has issued a forward commitment to purchase $400 million in common shares and warrants (40 million shares plus 13.3 million warrants) at $10 per share at the time of the initial transaction, in effect giving them a benefit if the share price rises and delaying their actual outlay of cash. With the $900 million raised in the IPO and a $400 million additional commitment, however, SRUN will have substantial equity capital and no debt, an enviable negotiating position going forward. In summary, SRUN's offering allows investors to potentially profit from advantageous business transactions in the future while not exposing much of their initial investment as risk capital until a potential transaction is identified and a combination proposed, at which time, investors have the option to either leave their shares untouched or tender them back to SRUN. In this market, where a "lower for longer" mantra seems to be gaining credence as far as oil and gas pricing goes, such an approach might be very attractive for investors to consider.
 Although this is a short article, the investment characteristics are fairly straightforward and comparable to the CDEV transaction(s), which has performed very well and which I have previously owned. As such, SRUN seems to me to be a worthwhile speculation and a company I would expect to follow closely in the future.

Silver Run Acquisition Shares Rise 7%; Buys Controlling Stake in Centennial Resource Production

Silver Run Acquisition (
SRAQU

) shares were higher 7% on Friday after the company said it has
agreed to acquire a controlling interest in Centennial Resource
Production, an independent oil and natural gas company located in
the core of the Southern Delaware Basin.
The company said that earlier this month, an affiliate of
Riverstone Holdings agreed to buy an approximately 89% stake in
Centennial from funds controlled by, and affiliates of NGP Energy
Capital Management.
In connection with Silver Run's acquisition of Riverstone's
rights in Centennial, Riverstone and certain Riverstone controlled
investment funds will purchase an estimated $810 million of Silver
Run class A common stock at $10.00 per share, including up to $175
million from Riverstone Energy Limited. In addition, certain funds
managed by Capital World Investors and certain funds managed by
Fidelity Management and Research Company will purchase $200 million
of Silver Run class A common stock at $10.00 per share.
The proceeds of both stock sales will be used to fund a portion
of the cash consideration required to effect the Centennial
acquisition.
Following the closing of the Centennial acquisition and related
transactions, Riverstone and affiliates will be the single largest
stockholder of Silver Run, with an approximate 51% ownership
interest. NGP is expected to retain a significant equity stake in
Centennial, approximating 11% of the outstanding interests, and
will have a representative on the Silver Run board.
The expected initial enterprise value of the combined company is
approximately $1.74 billion, implying a multiple of 12.6x and 6.6x
projected calendar 2017 and 2018 adjusted EBITDA, respectively, and
post-closing equity value of $1.84 billion at $10.00 per share.
Silver Run said it expects to be debt-free at the closing of the
transaction and have $100 million of cash-on-hand and an undrawn
revolving credit facility to fund future drilling and
acquisitions.
Silver Run meanwhile will be renamed Centennial Resource
Development Corp. and trade on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the
ticker symbol CDEV.
The deal is subject to shareholder approval and is expected to
close in September.

HOUSTON, March 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Silver Run Acquisition Corporation II (the "Company"), an energy-focused special purpose acquisition entity sponsored by an affiliate of Riverstone Holdings LLC and formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, today announced the pricing of its initial public offering of 90,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit. The units will be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and trade under the ticker symbol "SRANU" beginning March 24, 2017. Each unit consists of one share of the Company's Class A common stock and one-third of one warrant, each whole warrant enabling the holder thereof to purchase one whole share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the Class A common stock and warrants are expected to be listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbols "SRUN" and "SRUNW," respectively. 








Citigroup, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are serving as the underwriters for the offering. The Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 13,500,000 units at the initial public offering price to cover over-allotments, if any. 
The offering is being made only by means of a prospectus. When available, copies of the prospectus related to this offering may be obtained from Citigroup, c/o Broadridge Financial Solutions, 1155 Long Island Avenue, Edgewood, NY 11717, tel: (800) 831-9146; Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Attn: Prospectus Department, One Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10010, email: newyork.prospectus@credit-suisse.com, tel: (800) 221-1037; Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Attn.: Prospectus Group, 60 Wall Street, New York, NY 10005-2836, email:   prospectus.CPDG@db.com, tel: (800) 503-4611; and Goldman, Sachs & Co., Attn: Prospectus Department, 200 West Street, New York, NY 10282, tel: (866) 471-2526, fax: (212) 902-9316, e-mail: prospectus-ny@ny.email.gs.com.
A registration statement relating to the securities has been declared effective by the SEC on March 23, 2017. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. 
This press release contains statements that constitute "forward-looking statements," including with respect to the proposed initial public offering and the anticipated use of the net proceeds. No assurance can be given that the offering discussed above will be completed on the terms described, or at all, or that the net proceeds of the offering will be used as indicated. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous conditions, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of the Company's registration statement and preliminary prospectus for the Company's offering filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Copies are available on the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements for revisions or changes after the date of this release, except as required by law.

The shares of many energy companies have been battered in the last 18 months as an oil supply glut has weighed on their prospects. Silver Run's IPO shows that some investors believe the sector's corporate valuations have reached bottom.  In the largest IPO so far this year in the United States, Silver Run said it had priced 45 million shares at $10 each, selling 5 million more shares than it originally planned. Silver Run is a blank-check acquisition company sponsored by energy-focused private equity firm Riverstone Holdings LLC. Such so-called special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) fund the equity portion of their acquisitions through stock issuance.  Silver Run will look for companies that are "fundamentally sound" but underperforming due to current commodity prices, according to its IPO prospectus.  So-called secondary market investors are already placing bets that mergers and acquisitions will pick up in the oil patch by snapping up shares sold by publicly listed energy companies that could use the money to acquire assets at a discount. Silver Run's offering illustrates that SPACs can successfully make a similar pitch to IPO investors. "(Secondary market) investors are participating in follow-on financings that make already strong companies stronger, enabling them to withstand even lower commodity prices or potentially even allowing them to play offense," said Americas equity capital markets head at Bank of Montreal Michael Cippoletti. Silver Run's chief executive officer, Mark Papa, is an oil and gas veteran and Riverstone partner. He has worked for 45 years in the space, 15 of which were as CEO of EOG Resources Inc, once a division of Enron. Papa shifted EOG's focus from gas to oil, and is credited with transforming EOG into one of America's biggest oil companies. Shares in Silver Run are expected to start trading on Wednesday and list on NASDAQ under the symbol "SRAQU".  Deutsche Bank Securities, Citigroup and Goldman, Sachs & Co were underwriters on the offering.

Silver Run Acquisition Corp. to acquire controlling stake in Centennial Resource Production 








July 22, 2016



































Silver Run Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: SRAQ, SRAQU, SRAQW) has agreed to acquire a controlling interest in Centennial Resource Production LLC, an independent oil and natural gas company located in the Southern Delaware Basin. The deal is subject to certain conditions, including approval of the Silver Run stockholders.  On July 6, 2016, an affiliate of Riverstone Holdings LLC entered into a definitive agreement to purchase an approximate 89% interest in Centennial from funds controlled by, and affiliates of, NGP Energy Capital Management LLC. In accordance with the definitive agreement, Riverstone has agreed to assign, and Silver Run has agreed to assume, its right to purchase the interest in Centennial to Silver Run and will participate in the transaction as an equity holder directly in Silver Run.
In connection with the assignment of Riverstone's rights under the definitive agreement and the acquisition of the Centennial interest by Silver Run, Riverstone and certain Riverstone controlled investment funds will purchase an estimated $810 million of Silver Run Class A Common Stock at $10.00 per share, including up to $175 million from Riverstone Energy Limited. In addition, certain funds managed by Capital World Investors and certain funds managed by Fidelity Management and Research Company will purchase $200 million of Silver Run Class A Common Stock at $10.00 per share. The proceeds of both stock sales will be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration required to effect the Centennial acquisition. Following the closing of the Centennial acquisition and related transactions, Riverstone and such affiliates will be the single largest stockholder of Silver Run, with an approximate 51% ownership interest. NGP is expected to retain a significant equity stake in Centennial, approximating 11% of the outstanding interests, and will have a representative on the Silver Run Board of Directors.
Mark Papa, chairman and CEO of Silver Run, will lead Centennial following the consummation of the transaction. Centennial's existing senior management team led by CEO Ward Polzin, will provide transition services for a period of time as Papa looks to permanently fill key management positions. Papa commented, "Since our IPO, we have been searching to acquire a meaningful position in one of North America's premier oil shale basins. There has been a lot of recent excitement about the Delaware Basin, but we believe its potential is still significantly underappreciated. Centennial has an enviable position in the Delaware's southern oil-rich core. I want to commend Ward and his team for assembling such a top-notch set of assets and organization. I look forward to replicating the culture and philosophy that made EOG Resources such a success during my time there and using the Centennial assets as a platform to build something truly special."
The anticipated initial enterprise value of the combined company is approximately $1,735 million, implying a multiple of 12.6x and 6.6x projected calendar 2017 and 2018 adjusted EBITDA, respectively, and post-closing equity value of $1,835 million at $10.00 per share. Silver Run expects to be debt-free at the closing of the transaction and have $100 million of cash-on-hand and an undrawn revolving credit facility to fund future drilling and acquisitions. At consummation of the transaction, Silver Run is expected to be renamed Centennial Resource Development Corp. and trade on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol "CDEV".
Centennial highlights

    Pure-play core Delaware Basin company
    ­42,500 net acres primarily in Reeves and Ward counties
    ­Approximately 7,200 boe/d of net production
    ­48.6 MMboe of net proved reserves as of June 2016 based on internal estimates
    ­Stacked pay consisting of 5 currently producing shale zones with upside for 7 more
    ­1,357 gross identified potential horizontal drilling locations
    ­Among the best performers in the Southern Delaware Basin based on production per lateral foot

In connection with the transaction, Silver Run intends to obtain equity financing through the private placement of 81 million newly issued shares of Class A Common Stock to Riverstone and its affiliates and 20 million newly issued shares of Class A Common Stock to certain funds managed by Capital World Investors and certain funds managed by Fidelity Management and Research Company. Silver Run expects to receive approximately $1 billion in net proceeds from these sales. NGP is expected to retain an approximate 11% interest in Centennial, which interest may be exchanged for 20 million shares of Silver Run Class A Common Stock. Silver Run will not use debt financing to fund any portion of the cash consideration for the transaction.  In connection with the transaction, Silver Run and Centennial expect to repay all existing outstanding indebtedness and either replace or amend Centennial's revolving credit facility to permit the transaction. As of March 31, 2016, a maximum of $140 million was available for borrowing under Centennial's revolving credit facility.
Prior to closing the transaction, Silver Run's existing Class A stockholders will have the opportunity to vote on the transaction, and to redeem their shares of Class A common stock, if the transaction is approved and consummated. In the event any stockholders choose to have their shares redeemed, Riverstone and its affiliates expect to purchase an equivalent number of additional shares of Silver Run Class A Common Stock at $10.00 per share to fund such redemptions.
The transaction is subject to approval of Silver Run stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary conditions. The transaction is expected to close in September 2016.
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. acted as capital markets advisor and sole private placement agent to Silver Run, and financial advisor to Riverstone. Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. acted as capital markets advisors to Silver Run; and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP acted as legal counsel to Silver Run. Evercore Group L.L.C. acted as financial advisor to Silver Run's Board of Directors. Latham & Watkins LLP acted as legal counsel to Riverstone. Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. acted as financial advisor to Centennial in connection with the transaction; Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. acted as capital markets advisors to Centennial; and Vinson & Elkins LLP acted as legal advisor to Centennial.

Forward-Looking Statements
This communication includes certain statements that may constitute "forward-looking statements" for purposes of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions. The words "anticipate," "believe," "continue," "could," "estimate," "expect," "intends," "may," "might," "plan," "possible," "potential," "predict," "project," "should," "would" and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may include, for example, statements about: Silver Run's ability to consummate the business combination; the benefits of the business combination; the future financial performance of Silver Run following the business combination; changes in Centennial's reserves and future operating results; and expansion plans and opportunities. These forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this communication, and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Silver Run's views as of any subsequent date, and Silver Run does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.  You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. As a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, Silver Run's actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include: (i) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could delay the business combination or give rise to the termination of the contribution agreement; (ii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Silver Run following announcement of the proposed business combination and transactions contemplated thereby; (iii) the inability to complete the business combination due to the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of  Silver Run, or other conditions to closing in the contribution agreement; (iv) the risk that the proposed business combination disrupts current plans and operations of Silver Run or Centennial as a result of the announcement and consummation of the transactions described herein; (v) Silver Run's ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition and the ability of Silver Run to grow and manage growth profitably following the business combination; (vi) costs related to the business combination; (vii) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (viii) the possibility that Silver Run or Centennial may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (ix) other risks and uncertainties indicated in the preliminary proxy statement, including those under the section entitled "Risk Factors."
No Offer or Solicitation
This communication is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities pursuant to the proposed transactions or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

We are offering 90,000,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit. We

receive from the sale of the private placement warrants will be used as set
forth in the following table.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of a loan
    from our sponsor of $300,000 as described in this prospectus. This amount
    will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $2,000,000 of
    offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering
    expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held in
    the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than set
    forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working
    capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more than as
    set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the
    trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $31,500,000, which constitutes the underwriters'
    deferred commissions (or $36,225,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to
    the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The 
    underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred
    underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a "no shop" provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $900,000,000 (or $1,035,000,000 if the underwriters'
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $31,500,000 (or
$36,225,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $180,000 per year, assuming an
interest rate of 0.02% per year; however, we can provide no assurance regarding
this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income tax
obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months
from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on current interest
rates, we do not expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of
income taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Our sponsor has loaned us $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of
this offering. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the
earlier of March 31, 2017 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be
repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering
proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to
seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as
we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

We have entered into a forward purchase agreement with Fund VI Holdings pursuant
to which it has agreed to purchase an aggregate of up to 40,000,000 shares of
our Class A common stock, plus an aggregate of up to 13,333,333 warrants, for a
purchase price of $10.00 per forward purchase unit, or an aggregate purchase
price of up to $400,000,000 in a private placement that will close
simultaneously with the closing of our initial business combination. Fund VI
Holdings will purchase a number of forward purchase units that will result in
gross proceeds to us necessary to enable us to consummate our initial business
combination and pay related fees and expenses, after first applying amounts
available to us from the trust account (after paying the deferred underwriting
discount and giving effect to any redemptions of public shares) and any other
financing source obtained by us for such purpose at or prior to the consummation
of our initial business combination, plus any additional amounts mutually agreed
by us and Fund VI Holdings to be retained by the post-business combination
company for working capital or other purposes. These purchases will be required
to be made regardless of whether any shares of Class A common stock are redeemed
by our public stockholders in connection with our initial business combination
and are intended to provide us with a minimum funding level for our initial
business combination.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC's "penny stock" rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within
24 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and
as further described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to
cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of
any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating 
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability
to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in
connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may
reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and
our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these
factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating
an initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Delaware
corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business
combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout


 this
prospectus as our initial business combination. We are an acquisition vehicle of
Fund VI, an energy-focused private investment fund managed by Riverstone. We
have not identified any potential business combination target and we have not,
nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or
indirectly, with any potential business combination target. Although we may
pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business or industry, we intend to
capitalize on the ability of our management team and the broader Riverstone
platform to identify, acquire and operate a business in the energy industry that
may provide opportunities for attractive risk-adjusted returns.

We intend to identify and acquire a business that could benefit from a hands-on
owner with extensive operational experience in the energy sector and that
presents potential for an attractive risk-adjusted return profile under our
stewardship. Even fundamentally sound companies can often under-perform their
potential due to a temporary period of dislocation in the markets in which they
operate, inefficient capital allocation, over-levered capital structures,
excessive cost structures, incomplete management teams and/or inappropriate
business strategies. Our management team has extensive experience in identifying
and executing such full-potential acquisitions across the upstream, midstream,
refining, power, services and renewable energy sectors. In addition, our team
has significant hands-on experience working with private companies in preparing
for and executing an initial public offering and serving as active owners and
directors by working closely with these companies to continue their
transformations and help create value in the public markets.

We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive
risk-adjusted returns in the marketplace and that their contacts and transaction
sources, ranging from industry executives, private owners, private equity funds,
and investment bankers, in addition to the extensive global industry and
geographical reach of the Riverstone platform, will enable us to pursue a broad
range of opportunities. Our management believes that its ability to identify and
implement value creation initiatives will remain central to its differentiated
acquisition strategy.

Our management team's objective is to generate attractive returns and create
value for our shareholders by applying a disciplined strategy of underwriting
intrinsic worth and affecting changes after making an acquisition to unlock
value. We favor opportunities with certain elements of downside protection, for
example, opportunities where we can hedge proven reserves to reduce commodity
risk, while improving the risk-reward return by driving change and often
accelerating the target's growth initiatives. Our management team has
successfully applied this approach at Riverstone in both North America and
Europe and has deployed capital successfully in all market cycles. We do not
intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction
with our initial business combination.

In November 2015, Riverstone formed Silver Run Acquisition Corporation ("Silver
Run I"), a blank check company formed for substantially the same purposes as our
company. Silver Run I aimed to capitalize on the 45 years of experience in the
oil and gas industry of its Chief Executive Officer, Mark Papa. Prior to Silver
Run I and his time with Riverstone, Mr. Papa was Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of EOG Resources, an exploration and production company. Through its
initial public offering in February 2016, Silver Run I raised $500 million from
the sale of 50 million units to public investors, with each unit consisting of
one share of Class A common stock and one-third of one warrant. On July 6, 2016,
an affiliate of Riverstone entered into a definitive agreement to purchase an
approximate 89% interest in Centennial Resource Production, LLC ("Centennial"),
an independent oil and natural gas company with assets located in the core of
the Southern Delaware Basin, from funds controlled by, and affiliates of, NGP
Energy Capital Management, L.L.C. In accordance with the definitive agreement,
the Riverstone affiliate agreed to assign, and Silver Run I agreed to assume,
its right to purchase the interest in Centennial. On October 11, 2016, Silver
Run I consummated the acquisition of approximately 89% of the outstanding
membership interests in Centennial. In connection with the acquisition, Silver
Run I raised an additional approximately $1.0 billion through a private
placement of shares of its Class A Common Stock at $10.00 per share. Upon the
closing of the transaction, Silver Run I was renamed Centennial Resource
Development, Inc

Our sponsor is an investment vehicle of Fund VI, which is managed by Riverstone.
Riverstone has considerable experience investing in the energy industry. Since
the firm's founding in 2000 by David Leuschen and Pierre Lapeyre, Riverstone has
committed over $30 billion to more than 120 transactions, and has raised
approximately $33 billion since its inception across nine private funds and two
listed vehicles. Riverstone has experience investing across a variety of
commodity price cycles and a track record of identifying high-quality assets,
businesses and management teams with significant resources, capital and
optimization potential.

With respect to the foregoing examples, past performance of Riverstone, 
including by our management team, is not a guarantee either (i) of success with
respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be
able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. You
should not rely on the historical record of Riverstone's or our management's
performance as indicative of our future performance.

In addition, we believe our ability to complete an initial business combination
will be enhanced by our having entered into the forward purchase agreement
pursuant to which Fund VI Holdings has agreed to purchase an aggregate of up to
40,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock, plus an aggregate of up to
13,333,333 warrants, for an aggregate purchase price of up to $400,000,000 in a
private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of our initial
business combination. Fund VI Holdings will purchase a number of forward
purchase units that will result in gross proceeds to us necessary to enable us
to consummate our initial business combination and pay related fees and
expenses, after first applying amounts available to us from the trust account
(after paying the deferred underwriting discount and giving effect to any
redemptions of public shares) and any other financing source obtained by us for
such purpose at or prior to the consummation of our initial business
combination, plus any additional amounts mutually agreed by us and Fund VI 
Holdings to be retained by the post-business combination company for working
capital or other purposes. These purchases will be made regardless of whether
any shares of Class A common stock are redeemed by our public stockholders in
connection with our initial business combination and are intended to provide us
with a minimum funding level for our initial business combination.
