Total assets

Website

Sapphire Ventures is a Silicon Valley-based venture capital company that primarily invests in growth-stage enterprise technology companies globally.[1]
Company[edit]
Originally started in 1996 as the venture capital arm of SAP SE, it was known as SAP Ventures.[2][3][4] It split from its parent in 2011 and was rebranded to Sapphire Ventures in 2014.[5] SAP SE is now a limited partner in the company, and their ties are used in investing in companies working in the Enterprise Software ecosystem.[6] As of September 2016, the company manages more than US$2.4B assets,[7] and are active in the United States, Europe, Israel and India.[6]
On March 24, 2015, the company, along with industry giants Cisco Systems, Inc. and Siemens, co-hosted the first industry summit on the Internet of Things, named "IoT: Empowering The Enterprise" in San Jose, California.[8][9] The video of the event is available online. The event was advertised as "connecting investors, startups, technologists and Fortune 1000 executives to explore IoT in the enterprise."
In an independent study released on July 29, 2015, CB Insights, recognized Sapphire Ventures as Top 5 VC based on participation in major tech exits. Specifically, the CB Insights Report compiled a list of VCs with at least five of the top 100 exits in the period beginning Q1 2013 and ending Q2 2015, and ranked each VC according to how many of these exits they were involved in. Sapphire Ventures made the list at #4, with 10 such exits to its credit, behind Accel Partners, New Enterprise Associates and Sequoia Capital.[10]
Investments[edit]
Since 1996, Sapphire Ventures has invested in more than 130 companies across 5 continents.[citation needed]

Driving Customer Acquisition
Corporate compliance continues to make waves in the news, and companies need help mitigating risk. That’s where Convercent comes in. Convercent builds compliance software, and to grow the business the company needs exposure to top enterprise customers seeking a compliance solution.
So in 2015, we co-hosted Compliance Tech Talks. The goal: drive customer acquisition by showcasing Convercent’s expertise and software to compliance executives from corporate powerhouses, such as Cisco, Facebook, Oracle, Visa and VMWare. Convercent has since taken Compliance Tech Talks global, bringing its solution to enterprises worldwide.
“We continue to be highly impressed by the knowledge, expertise, and commitment that Sapphire Ventures brings to the table. The team’s holistic market development offering has the potential to be game-changing for Convercent’s ongoing growth and success.”
— Patrick Quinlan, CEO, Convercent
 


Navigating A Global Giant
Few companies enable salespeople to perform with the success of Spring Mobile Solutions. Spring provides mobile sales applications that work out of the box in areas around the globe. Instead of relying on costly systems integrators to build custom applications on top of legacy systems, Spring creates rapid improvements in a company’s sales software.
But when you’re transforming an enterprise’s path to market, it’s rarely something one software vendor does alone. And that’s where Sapphire’s help became so critical. To win a deal with a Fortune 25 company, Spring and Sapphire worked together to navigate the complexity of a convoluted sales process. Sapphire’s market development team, staffed with decades of combined experience in enterprise business development, was able to help Spring understand the critical influencers and partners to win a transformative deal and set the business on an even higher course.
“No one knows enterprise like Sapphire. If you’re going to sell enterprise software, it’s best if you know what the big players are doing and where they are going. Sapphire offers us realistic, tactical advice on how to navigate the ecosystem. Rami and the market development team have been instrumental in helping close a deal with one of the top consumer brands in the world.”
— Conor Keane, President and CEO, Spring Mobile Solutions
 


 


Enabling Access To A Global Market
Enterprise IT organizations face challenges everyday as they are asked to do more, faster and at lower cost. Portfolio company Nutanix’s hyperconverged infrastructure solves these challenges, allowing IT organizations to focus on what really matters.
To continue its rapid growth and ability to scale globally, Nutanix needed to reach a new ecosystem of enterprise customers. Our team tapped our corporate connections and expertise to help Nutanix navigate the complexities of partnering with large enterprise corporations to successfully enter a new multi-billion dollar global market.
“Because of Sapphire Ventures’ vast enterprise relationships and ongoing strategic advice, Nutanix is now positioned to penetrate a new multi-billion dollar global market. It’s a powerful testament to their ability to scale companies to the power of enterprise.”
— Dheeraj Pandey, CEO, Nutanix
 


Accelerating Global Expansion
DocuSign’s cloud-based platform has become the global standard for Digital Transaction Management (DTM) and eSignature by empowering anyone to transact anything, anytime, anywhere, on any device. Securely. With more than 225,000 companies and more than 85 million users in 188 countries, and an average of 85,000 new unique users joining the DocuSign Global Trust Network every day, the company has achieved escape velocity as it helps enterprises, small to mid size businesses, individual professionals and consumers go fully digital all around the world.
For DocuSign Chairman and CEO Keith Krach, the goal for the company’s future is as bold as it is simple: “We want ‘DocuSign’ to become a verb in the same way that ‘Google’ and ‘FedEx’ have. If you need to transact business quickly, easily and securely, Just DocuSign It!”
And the company is well on its way to achieving that goal, helping individuals and organizations make every decision, approval, workflow and signature 100% digital to keep life and business moving forward.
The Sapphire Ventures team has helped accelerate DocuSign’s progress by:

Assisting in business development strategy
Connecting DocuSign with customers and go-to-market partners
Facilitating dialogue with strategic investors in the Unites States and abroad

“The Sapphire Ventures team helped us calibrate our business strategy to target the right vertical industries first. They demonstrated exceptional pattern recognition in this regard, sharing critical insights to help us accelerate our global momentum and growth.”
— Keith Krach, CEO, Docusign

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
