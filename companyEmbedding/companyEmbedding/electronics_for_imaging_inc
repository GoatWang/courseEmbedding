News about Electronics for Imaging Inc., including commentary and archival articles published in The New York Times.                    











Latest Articles







                    Technology Briefing | Internet: Printing Service Introduced                
Yesterday, a group of technology companies introduced PrintMe Networks, an Internet-based service that would permit remote printing without cables or any special setup. Created by Electronics for Imaging, a Foster City, Calif., company that makes printing products, PrintMe Networks will permit people like business travelers or mobile workers to print documents while away from their desks. Under the plan, customers will send their print job through a laptop computer, a hand-held device or a mobile phone to a network of printers -- housed in hotels, airports, print shops and coffeehouses around the world. In a conference call, Guy Gecht, the chief executive of Electronics for Imaging, described PrintMe as ''a whole new way to think about printing'' and said the system would have the speed of a fax machine with the quality and security of traditional printed documents. Jonathan Rosenzweig, a research analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said that there was ample opportunity in the market, but that PrintMe would need to get enough compatible devices into the marketplace to be viable.

MANAGEMENT

                    Cyclical School of Hard Knocks                
Roger Siboni had never experienced anything like it. One day, investors were rewarding a sevenfold annual increase in sales at his company, E.piphany Inc., by pushing its stock price above $200 a share. Then, seemingly without warning, they began to worry about costs and a slowdown in sales, and the stock started a descent that reached as low as $7. ''I don't recall ever seeing such a rapid drop-off from exuberance to despair,'' said Mr. Siboni, the 46-year-old chief executive of E.piphany, a San Mateo, Calif., software company that went public less than two years ago. ''It's almost like someone's flipped a switch.''










COMPANY NEWS

                    ELECTRONICS FOR IMAGING IS BUYING SPLASH TECHNOLOGY                
Electronics for Imaging Inc., a maker of networked publishing equipment and software, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Splash Technology Holdings for $146 million to enhance its position in color imaging. Electronics for Imaging, based in Foster City, Calif., will pay Splash shareholders $10 a share, 11 percent higher than yesterday's closing price. Splash, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., makes computer color-printing products. The acquisition is expected to be complete in 10 business days. Shares of Electronics for Imaging fell $3.06, to $26, while Splash Technology rose $1.97, to $9.03.











                    Vinik Is Again Selling Stakes In Technology                
Jeffrey N. Vinik made a famous market call in November 1995 while still the manager of Fidelity Magellan, the world's biggest mutual fund: He bailed out of $10 billion worth of technology stocks. Unfortunately, he put much of that money into cash and bonds, and Magellan's value barely budged over the next six months while the broad market soared. Mr. Vinik left Fidelity, an FMR Corporation unit, soon after, set up a hedge fund for rich investors and has since turned in a striking performance, tripling his investors' money in less than three years.










COMPANY NEWS

                    ELECTRONICS FOR IMAGING'S STOCK SURGES 11.5%                
Electronics for Imaging Inc.'s stock surged 11.5 percent yesterday on news the graphics technology company would supply a key part for color copiers to Canon Inc., the largest supplier of color copiers. The agreement will give Electronics for Imaging, based in San Mateo, Calif., a formidable lead in the market for color servers, analysts said. The servers drive the color laser copiers. Under the proposed multiyear agreement, Canon would have exclusive worldwide sales rights to Electronics for Imaging's Fiery XJ Color Servers and would market, sell and service the products under the Canon name. Electronics for Imaging's stock jumped $5.50, to $53.50 a share, in Nasdaq trading.
