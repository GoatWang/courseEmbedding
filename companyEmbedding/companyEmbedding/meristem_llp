Our Story











OUR STORY
 
 
 











mer·i·stem

pron. (mer’ istem) n: the cell in nature essential for growth in all plants and trees.

 
 
 











How Meristem Came to Be - Our “What”
The wealth management industry has changed dramatically over the past three decades. Independence and objectivity have been at the forefront of this changing landscape.  Both professionals and consumers alike have sought out the independent Registered Investment Advisory (RIA) model.
The partners of Meristem were early adopters of the independent advisory movement, creating their first firm, Advisors Financial Services, in 1999.  A merger in 2003 created the Sage Partnership which later successfully acquired the Sargent Management Company, a 40 year old family office, forming what is today, Meristem.
 
 
 











What Meristem Means to Us - Our “Why”
 
 
 






We created Meristem as the firm we’d want to represent our families.


Meristem is a boutique firm with the scale and structure to serve multi-generational families in the management of their wealth and the development of their legacy.  We are intentional about offering an alternative to working with large institutions.  We place a high value on our independence.


We focus on people first.  As a service business, our people are our assets.  Engaging our clients and employees is our highest priority.


We define our growth by the numbers of satisfied families we serve.  One of our greatest compliments is having our client’s children join their parents as our clients.


 
 
 




We grow with our client’s needs.


 We expanded our offices to locations in Arizona and Florida to service our clients where convenient to them.


We continuously invest in our people and technology to better serve our clients’ needs.


We created the Meristem Trust Company in South Dakota in 2015 to meet the expressed desires of our clients for fresh alternatives.

Understanding Your Unique Needs
Our client families are affluent, yes, but there are almost as many definitions for affluence as there are varied needs of the families we serve.

Your family’s needs are at the heart of how and why we do business.
 
 
 




Many families come to us for the following reasons:

To reduce financial complexity allowing for focus on your family and your goals.
To manage a liquidity event that signals your need for deeper advice and service.
To safeguard your family’s wealth for future generations.

Let’s Talk
 





What is a Family Office?


Historically, the term Family Office described a dedicated staff of employees serving a singular affluent family in managing all aspects of their wealth. At Meristem, we aspire to provide a Family Office experience to all of our client families. We believe families benefit greatly from a holistic and thoughtful process of ongoing advice, education and service. In our approach, all clients collectively become the families we serve. The scale we have developed allows us to serve them with over 35 dedicated employees, multiple locations and an expansive service offering.
We think you deserve this level of service and would benefit greatly across the family with Meristem as your Family Financial Officer (FFO). We are confident we can help you consume and value the appropriate level of service for your family. Customizing our approach makes the service personal to you.




What is Meristem’s Investment philosophy?


Broadly, the Meristem Investment Committee believes in building portfolios that provide for adequate diversification to reduce volatility while providing both income and growth characteristics.  Our primary goal is to create a customized investment plan for each family’s unique circumstance. We begin with a study of the client balance sheet, liquidity and cash flow needs. A vigorous dialogue around risk and returns shapes the asset allocation decision process. Underlying asset strategies may take the form of active and passive strategies. In the asset class selection process, we apply rigorous due diligence and sensitivity to expenses and taxation.  On an on-going basis we provide for tactical rebalancing, manager review, performance and tax reporting.




How do I initiate a dialogue about wealth with my family?


It is never too early to begin discussing money with your children as they will grow up receiving thousands of messages around wealth and money. It is important that you participate in the formation of their financial belief system. It can begin in grade school-aged children who have the capability of understanding the value of a dollar. As your children grow older it will shift to an understanding of creating their own financial independence. As they become adults it should shift to your family’s wealth vision and values. What do you want your family’s financial legacy to be? It is best to not keep this answer from your family, communicate this early and often.




How do I better understand what Meristem can do for me?


We would invite you to start by confidentially sharing your story with us. We realize the best way for you to get to know us and our value is for us to demonstrate the model in your terms.
Simply contact us and we will arrange for an initial conversation.




Why Meristem?



Meristem's three core principles are to advise, educate and serve individuals, their families and their varying entities.
Meristem is independent, owned by principals who manage both the business and client relationships. We think and respond like owners.
Meristem is a unique alternative to large financial institutions who offer wealth management as a business line. Family wealth is our only business.
Meristem has shown a desire to grow our presence to meet the needs of our clients with offices in Minnesota, Arizona and Florida.
Meristem established a wholly owned South Dakota Trust company in response to client demand and interest for fiduciary services for future generations.
Meristem strongly believes in the future of family wealth and continuously seeks to invest in people, technology and service offerings.
Meristem is fiercely protective of its client families and their interests because we believe family and wealth are personal and private.
Meristem is the right fit for you and your family because, after spending time together, you believe our people, process and advice will make a difference in your financial lives.

					About Meristem
				

					The real world is our classroom.
				

					The three-year day and residential program uses a contemporary
					apprenticeship model to develop contextualized, transferable skills
					to transition young adults into work life.  Students learn in highly
					personalized ways. Learning is individualized, structured, and self-directed.
				

					Inquire About Enrollment
				








					"When I started I could never have imagined I would have changed so much.
					I cannot find the words to describe what this program has done for me and
					I advise people to come and see it for themselves."
				

					— Marcy, Meristem Student
				









					Approach
				

					A proven method.
				

					The MERISTEM method is inspired by the work of the Ruskin Mill Trust in
					England. Ruskin Mill has a 35 year history serving generations of
					students with autism across the United Kingdom. More than 70% of
					graduates transition into higher education, vocational training, or
					employment.
				









					Learning through doing.
				

					Our students learn to create - jewelry, clothing, a film, or a harvest
					of food. They learn resiliency, to embrace failure, to feel a sense of
					accomplishment. That sense of purpose, meaning, and value translates to
					growth, life long learning, and work.
				








					Increasing social capacity.
				

					The program develops social skills that ultimately lead to a stronger
					sense of self, healthy relationships with others and a recognition of
					one's place in the world.
				








					Developing life skills.
				

					Our program is personalized for each student
					with the aim of fostering self-reliance.
				

					The program includes:
				



Transformative movement
Digital media
Culinary arts and nutrition
Equine therapy
Sustainable agriculture


Carpentry and woodwork
Independent living skills
Farm and animal care
Textiles, jewelry, and metal work
Filmmaking & photography









					Transition to work and independence.
				

					A central aspect of the MERISTEM method involves preparing students for
					life after graduation. Throughout the three-year program, students build
					skills to enter the workplace or higher education. Many will work
					independently, others with assistance, but each graduate leaves with a
					greater sense of self-reliance.
				

					Entering the workforce is a hallmark of the program. Our transition-to-work
					program develops vocational skills through work experience. Students grow
					and sell food from the campus farm, work in the culinary arts center, the
					campus café, or bookstore. With MERISTEM's emphasis on community life, we
					seek opportunities to partner with local businesses for work placements
					and internships. We help graduates find work in the community or enter
					college.
				









					Campus
				

					A place to live, learn and grow.
				

					Our flagship campus is located on 13 beautiful acres in Sacramento,
					California near the American River.  MERISTEM consists of visual and
					practical arts classrooms, a working farm, a performing arts auditorium,
					outdoor fields, academic classrooms, an equine center, student café,
					bookstore, and residential living areas.
				

					The Independent Living Center is the home to our residential students.
					Each suite contains4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a full kitchen, living room,
					and an outdoor patio or balcony.

					Community
				

					An inclusive and integrated community.
				

					Our community is integrated with a teacher training college, farm
					apprenticeship program, community supported agriculture (CSA), and
					community workshops and events. Students develop skills through community
					integration and social inclusion.
				












					Leadership
				

					Guiding our future.
				

					Our board of directors and leadership team provide guidance, governance
					and oversight for Meristem's mission, operations and program
					effectiveness.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

PenFed Credit Union


                                            Applied for a credit card and was denied based on what they said was a loss from a personal loan in 1978. I have never had an account with PenFed, so I questioned the accuracy of this denial. Considering, as a business owner, my scores are well north of 700, I thought this...show more
