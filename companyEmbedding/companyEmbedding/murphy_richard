Buy Morphy Richards Electric Tea Maker Online at Best Price in India The choice of the ‘tea-ming’ millions There’s nothing like a good cup of tea to awaken the senses, refresh the mood, stimulate the mind, and relax the spirit. It has been one of man’s primordial needs, which according to a legend, almost dates back to 2737 BC, when dried tea leaves were believed to have blown and landed by chance from a tree in close proximity into a cup of boiling hot water prepared for a Chinese emperor. Curious by the change in colour of the water, the emperor adventured to take a sip, and the rest, as they say, is history. The golden-red elixir of life Tea is believed to have medicinal and therapeutic properties, and regarded by some as being the elixir of life. Tea drinkers in ancient China were adjudged as being sophisticated, and academically and culturally advanced. The dynamics of brewing tea is as complex as its flavours are. Right from the quality of tea leaves, and the type of water used, to the temperature of the brew, the steeping time and even the material of the kettle – all can either make or mar the end result. With so many variables playing a crucial role, it becomes rather convenient to get all this done in the Morphy Richards tea maker. Brewing the perfect cup of tea With the Morphy Richards tea maker, controlling the variables becomes so much easier. Besides, it is simple, convenient, quick, and non-messy, allowing you to prepare your favourite infusion right in the office pantry, next to your workstation, or even in your living room if you so choose. Its dual, flat concealed heating element allows tea, milk, sugar and the spices of your choice to be added in the jar of the tea maker, and makes the job of cleaning and descaling easier. It houses a Strix thermostat, imported from the United Kingdom for better temperature control. It offers 360ocordless operation, allowing you to detach the pirouette base with the cord from the jar and carry the jar around conveniently without lugging the power cord. A name synonymous with trust Morphy Richards carries with it 80 years of unwavering trust reposed by millions of delighted customers across the world. Enjoy uninterrupted performance with thoughtful and safety features that are unrivalled in its category.

Buy Morphy Richards Pop-Up Toasters Online at Best Price in India ‘Good mornings’ begin with Morphy Richards Pop-up toasters  Breakfasts are incomplete without biting into a crisp golden toast that is slathered with butter or jam or both. As that satisfying noise of you biting into perfectly toasted bread makes you close your eyes with gratitude, find yourself transported to a breakfast table in the land of the British – the very homeland of Morphy Richards. Toasts lend themselves to a variety of breakfast options. Drizzle some honey over them, or add a dollop of orange marmalade, or slap on some mouth-watering spreads, or even use them as base for your favourite macerated fruits to make them completely irresistible. What’s behind the art of browning There’s more thought and intelligence than meets the eye in all of Morphy Richards automatic pop-up toasters. To begin with, each model is housed inside a special outer body that keeps it cool at all times, preventing your fingers from burning. The inside gets hot and harsh to give you that perfect crisp toast,. We know for a fact that  individuals even within the family have different preferences. That’s why all of our toasters come with a Variable Browning and a Cancel function. This gives you the absolute liberty to fulfil the whim and fancy of all your family members and their toasty preferences for achieving the perfect colour and crispiness. Its Hi-lift allows you to retrieve smaller slices easily without the need of dipping your fingers inside the high temperature slots. Cleaning your toaster and ridding it of the inevitable crumbs is easy with an removable crumb tray. A dust cover keeps it dust-free when not in use. We understand the need of optimizing space and our clever cord winder allows you to store away the cord while occupying minimum space. Morphy Richards bread toasters come with anti-skid feet for the appliance to stay firmly rooted in its place. Defrost. Reheat. Smile. Advanced functions include Defrosting and toasting in a single step, and Reheating unbuttered toasted slices without having to repeat the toasting cycle. Advanced models boast of having a bread-centering guide that holds the bread slices in the centre of the toasting slot to ensure uniform browning on both sides of the bread so that you don’t have to change sides, and the toasts are ready quicker. A name synonymous with trust Morphy Richards carries with it 80 years of unwavering trust reposed by millions of delighted customers across the world. Enjoy uninterrupted performance with thoughtful and safety features that are unrivalled in its category.

Buy Morphy Richards Juicer Online at Best Price in India Capture the goodness of nature in a jug Whip up a mouth-watering storm of flavours and colours, packed with mountains of nutrients, vitamins and minerals with the Morphy Richards juicer. The benefits of fruit and vegetable juices are undeniable, replete with known anti-ageing, anti-oxidizing, anti-inflammatory, detoxifying, immunity-building, and energy-boosting properties. Concoct, conserve, consume With nature’s bounty easily available at your nearest supermarket, the combinations that you can concoct in your juicer are only limited by imagination. Depending on the fruits and vegetables of your choice, your glass of juice can provide you a potent blend of a profusion of vitamins, minerals and natural antioxidants such as beta-carotene for improving eyesight, vitamin C for improving immunity, and flavonoids for boosting brain power, to name a few. Antioxidants also help maintain healthy skin, are anti-inflammatory in nature, and are also considered to prevent certain cancers. All in all, your glass of juice serves almost as an elixir of life, bursting with energy and natural healing properties. Create a medley of explosive flavours while conserving all the health benefits. Say hello to good health. Tap the nutrients till the last trickle Your Morphy Richards juicer doesn’t believe in undue wastage.

Product range[edit]
It specialises in toasters, hair dryers, bread makers, kettles and sandwich toasters and other appliances. In its early stage it also made refrigerators and washer-dryers, but these would be later made by Hotpoint. It is owned by the Irish Glen Dimplex electronics group. They also make Digital Radio Mondiale-compatible digital radios, one of very few companies to do so.[citation needed]
History[edit]




A 1950s Morphy-Richards iron with original box


Donal Morphy of Chislehurst and Charles Richards of Farnborough, London formed Morphy-Richards Ltd on 8 July 1936 at an oast house in St Mary Cray in Kent. Morphy and Richards were joint managing directors, and had raised £1,000. It began making electric fires and from March 1938 it made electric irons. During the war its factories made components for the aircraft industry.
A. Reyrolle & Company took 30% of the company in June 1944 and their General Manager was on the board of directors. Exports accounted for around 15% of turnover, helped by subsidiary companies in Australia and South Africa. It later opened a Canadian subsidiary. The company was producing around 2,000 irons per day.
On 1 May 1947, it became a public company and merged with Astral Equipment Ltd, a company in Dundee, Scotland that made spin dryers and refrigerators. Astral became a wholly owned subsidiary. George Wansbrough was the company chairman from 1944-54. In 1949, it produced its first automatic toaster which used a bi-metallic strip. It also produced the Simon electric floor scrubber. In 1953, it produced its first hairdryer and claimed to have 90% of the market six years later, as it sold very well. In 1954 it introduced a steam iron; these were still comparatively revolutionary twenty years later. At the same time it introduced electrical convector heaters and panel heaters (ceramic heaters). By 1957, it was the UK's leading provider of electric blankets, had produced its 10 millionth electric iron, and was producing 60% of the toasters made in the UK. It had bought Yelsen Ltd, a manufacturer of electric blankets at Ruxley in Kent, on 16 June 1957 for £112,000, which became a subsidiary. Also in June, new factories opened at the main site and Dundee. 40% of products were exported and overseas subsidiaries had been established. Morphy did not like the huge expansion of the company, but Richards thought it was too slow. Sir Patrick Bishop became chairman in 1957.
EMI[edit]
Morphy sold his share of the company to EMI (Electric and Musical Industries) in August 1960, who then tried to take-over the company, as did Philips Electrical Industries. On the board of directors, Morphy supported the EMI offer, but Richards did not. EMI took over the company in September 1960. In the late 1950s the company had developed the Silavent ventilation system.,[1] manufactured for them by Robert McArd & Co.
In December 1960, the Chairman, Sir Patrick Bishop, resigned and Richards left the board. Morphy also left as managing director, but stayed on the board. Graham Hurst became managing director. By March 1961, Richards had joined GEC as joint managing director of their electrical appliance division. On 12 May 1961, a new £500,000 factory at Dundee built by Holland, Hannen & Cubitts was opened by Richard Wood, Baron Holderness, then the Minister of Power. The Dundee site was managed by Willis Roxburgh until July 1966, and produced around a quarter of all fridges in the UK. By 1962 it was exporting to over 120 countries. In August 1962 the company appointed Faber Birren to give advice on colours of products. On 7 December 1962, Richards joined the board of directors of GEC. In October 1963, it took over the record-player division of EMI. On 15 November 1964, Charles Richards died aged 64 at his house in Buckinghamshire.
In February 1965 there were discussions with English Electric to merge their large appliance divisions. In April 1965 Norman Tomlinson became managing director.
GEC[edit]
On 26 May 1966, EMI and AEI, owners of Hotpoint, decided to merge their domestic appliance divisions to form British Domestic Appliances (BDA) from 1 July 1966. Morphy Richards was employing about 4,000 people. The headquarters of BDA was at Peterborough, the site of the main Hotpoint factory. In September 1967, GEC announced it wanted to take over AEI, and on 24 May 1968 GEC agreed to merge its domestic appliance division with BDA. EMI would own a third, and GEC two thirds. The managing director of BDA from September 1966, Laurence Peterken, was the new managing director, but he left two weeks later.
The domestic appliance manufacture was moved to the Swinton Works at Mexborough, and in 1970 the original factory in St Mary Cray, which employed around 1,200 people, was closed. The nearby Ruxley factory manufactured kettles and coffee percolators. In January 1970 it was decided to remove the Morphy Richards brand from the fridges. It was argued that GEC had little interest in Morphy Richards. On 25 May 1975 Donal Morphy died, aged 74.
In the 1970s, BDA was the UK's largest manufacturer of domestic appliances. BDA changed its name to Hotpoint in 1975, with small domestic appliances marketed under the Morphy Richards name.
Glen Dimplex[edit]
On 10 May 1985, Morphy Richards was acquired by Glen Dimplex of Northern Ireland. From the late 1980s, the company was once again very successful with advances in electronics making their way into domestic appliances. In the 1990s, the product range grew much larger.[citation needed]
