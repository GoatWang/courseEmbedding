CROSSOVER TO THE CLOUD


On-premises business communications are an endangered species. They don't serve today’s cloud-connected world. Avaya’s chapter 11 bankruptcy is just another proof point. 
The cloud is now. Business leaders like you are choosing cloud communications to keep your workforce connected from anywhere, on all your devices, for full access to content and people.
BroadSoft was born in the cloud, and after 19 years of non-stop innovation we are, hands down, the global market share leader for cloud business communications.
Only BroadSoft offers the financial strength, proven reliability, security and breadth of fully integrated solutions - including unified communications (UC), team collaboration and contact centers.
Discover how BroadSoft Business can help Avaya and other business customers move at their own pace as they transition to the cloud.

One number. Across devices. Powerful applications.

















 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
















Supercharge your team
Do your teams juggle overwhelming amounts of projects, tasks, emails and information - often using multiple different apps?
Put all your work in once place using organized, searchable and persistent workspaces where you can jump in at any time and from any device to fully conference and collaborate with today’s fluid project teams.

Founded in 1998, BroadSoft is a leading technology innovator in cloud PBX, unified communications, team collaboration and contact center solutions, designed for our service provider customers across the globe.      


 






























Company
Corporate Info
About Us























Our Culture

We are a multi-national company, multi-cultural and multi-lingual. 
We speak English, French, German, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Mandarin, Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Turkish, Greek, Flemish, Hindi, Romanian, Bulgarian, Finnish, Italian, Russian, Polish, Japanese, Czech, and many others with all their beautiful dialects and flavors. 
We are natives, we are immigrants. Our diversity is our strength. And our corporate culture is grounded on common values as responsible global citizens.
Our passion is to innovate; to enable the human touch via communications and collaboration; empowering people, teams, and companies to remove borders, barriers, walls and silos. 
We are one family. BroadSoft. 






















Our Missionand Vision


 
As a trusted cloud innovator and market leader, we have continuously innovated in cloud unified communication software and services for the last 17 years — and we can’t stop.
Committed to redefining the future of work by inspiring teams to create, collaborate and perform in ways never before imagined, our mission is to bring best-in-class productivity and collaboration tools to businesses.
BroadSoft Business provides a comprehensive, mobile-integrated and completely open communication suite for businesses, with carrier-class reliability and security. By using our technology inspired by users and teams, you can collaborate and communicate more effectively to make your work — simple.

























Our Market Leadership
With 41% market share, we are the industry leader for cloud unified communications with a secure and trusted platform chosen by 25 of the world’s top 30 service providers across 80 countries.














































Our Proven Portfolio
The strength of our innovative technology and robust award-winning portfolio has been recognized by industry pundits from all across the Unified Communications ecosystem.
















BroadSoft’s 41% share of the global hosted IP telephony and UCC services market confirms their leadership position.
Elka Popova, Industry Director, Unified Communications and Collaboration Frost & Sullivan





BroadSoft presently has a clear edge over Microsoft when it comes to cloud voice capabilities, third-party integration, mobility, and contact center capabilities. When considering voice capability, it is clear that BroadSoft’s long history of providing carrier-grade voice functionality provides a service that is far more robust than Microsoft’s Cloud PBX with PSTN connectivity.
E. Brent Kelly, President/Principal Analyst Kelcor Inc.





It gives me great pleasure to honor BroadSoft as a 2016 recipient of TMC’s Unified Communications Product of the Year Award for their innovative product, BroadCloud UC-One. Our judges were very impressed with the ingenuity and excellence displayed by BroadSoft in their groundbreaking work on BroadCloud UC-One.
Rich Tehrani, CEO, TMC





BroadSoft Team-One continues to demonstrate product excellence with its comprehensive solution, updated with integrations with different best-in-class business apps, popular cloud-based file storage services, and a powerful real-time video/audio/messaging function.
2015 Excellence in Technology Award winner - BroadSoft Team-One (formerly Intellinote) Frost & Sullivan





BroadSoft CC-One has a strong ability to analyze and leverage structured and unstructured enterprise data to support business-intelligence-driven contact routing decisions in real time. A simple example is its ability to prioritize calls from customers who previously abandoned a call while waiting in queues.
2015 Magic Quadrant “Visionary” placement for CCaaS, North America - Broadsoft CC-One (formerly Transera) Gartner





The BroadSoft UCaaS consolidation play, as practiced by Vonage, is beneficial to the industry as it builds brand awareness and scaling.

About Us























Our Culture

We are a multi-national company, multi-cultural and multi-lingual. 
We speak English, French, German, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Mandarin, Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Turkish, Greek, Flemish, Hindi, Romanian, Bulgarian, Finnish, Italian, Russian, Polish, Japanese, Czech, and many others with all their beautiful dialects and flavors. 
We are natives, we are immigrants. Our diversity is our strength. And our corporate culture is grounded on common values as responsible global citizens.
Our passion is to innovate; to enable the human touch via communications and collaboration; empowering people, teams, and companies to remove borders, barriers, walls and silos. 
We are one family. BroadSoft. 






















Our Missionand Vision


 
As a trusted cloud innovator and market leader, we have continuously innovated in cloud unified communication software and services for the last 17 years — and we can’t stop.
Committed to redefining the future of work by inspiring teams to create, collaborate and perform in ways never before imagined, our mission is to bring best-in-class productivity and collaboration tools to businesses.
BroadSoft Business provides a comprehensive, mobile-integrated and completely open communication suite for businesses, with carrier-class reliability and security. By using our technology inspired by users and teams, you can collaborate and communicate more effectively to make your work — simple.

























Our Market Leadership
With 41% market share, we are the industry leader for cloud unified communications with a secure and trusted platform chosen by 25 of the world’s top 30 service providers across 80 countries.














































Our Proven Portfolio
The strength of our innovative technology and robust award-winning portfolio has been recognized by industry pundits from all across the Unified Communications ecosystem.
















BroadSoft’s 41% share of the global hosted IP telephony and UCC services market confirms their leadership position.
Elka Popova, Industry Director, Unified Communications and Collaboration Frost & Sullivan





BroadSoft presently has a clear edge over Microsoft when it comes to cloud voice capabilities, third-party integration, mobility, and contact center capabilities. When considering voice capability, it is clear that BroadSoft’s long history of providing carrier-grade voice functionality provides a service that is far more robust than Microsoft’s Cloud PBX with PSTN connectivity.
E. Brent Kelly, President/Principal Analyst Kelcor Inc.





It gives me great pleasure to honor BroadSoft as a 2016 recipient of TMC’s Unified Communications Product of the Year Award for their innovative product, BroadCloud UC-One. Our judges were very impressed with the ingenuity and excellence displayed by BroadSoft in their groundbreaking work on BroadCloud UC-One.
Rich Tehrani, CEO, TMC





BroadSoft Team-One continues to demonstrate product excellence with its comprehensive solution, updated with integrations with different best-in-class business apps, popular cloud-based file storage services, and a powerful real-time video/audio/messaging function.
2015 Excellence in Technology Award winner - BroadSoft Team-One (formerly Intellinote) Frost & Sullivan





BroadSoft CC-One has a strong ability to analyze and leverage structured and unstructured enterprise data to support business-intelligence-driven contact routing decisions in real time. A simple example is its ability to prioritize calls from customers who previously abandoned a call while waiting in queues.

that enables service providers to offer customizable communications and collaboration services. The platform-as-a-service product is a managed cloud infrastructure residing in BroadSoft data centers.   








BroadSoft, based in Gaithersburg, Md., provides software to telecommunications service providers that deliver the hosted, cloud-based unified communications to enterprise customers.
The BroadCloud platform as a service, or PaaS, is part of the BroadCloud platform that powers BroadSoft Business, an integrated portfolio of cloud, unified communications, team collaboration and contact-center applications. The PaaS product delivers cloud communications based on the BroadSoft Business suite, which includes three core apps: UC-One, Team-One and CC-One, with BroadSoft Hub providing contextual intelligence across the platform.
According to BroadSoft, the BroadCloud PaaS product enables service providers to develop differentiated, on-demand cloud unified communications and collaboration services, accelerate delivery of services and minimize nonstrategic expenditures.
According to a report from Frost & Sullivan, a research firm based in San Antonio, a global transformation to cloud-based services is underway with 45% of telecom providers planning to deploy a turnkey service hosted and operated by a third-party company.
In other BroadSoft news, the company reported a net loss last week of $10.5 million in its first quarter. BroadSoft stock tumbled last week after it missed revenue expectations and cut its revenue guidance.   

Amium collaboration platform targets external users
Collaboration software provider AeroFS, based in Palo Alto, Calif., unveiled a new release of its Amium cloud-based collaboration platform that offers users the ability to collaborate with people outside their organizations. Amium's external collaboration capability -- a free service -- allows individuals and teams to work with outside users, such as customers, partners and contractors.
Amium gives external users and work teams the same internal collaboration features with real-time updates, communication and project management. Users can collaborate with others outside a team by inviting them to a project.
Amium also offers group and direct messaging with automated file syncing and updating while maintaining an audit trail of interactions and feedback from every internal and external user. The new app offers a centralized repository for all files and conversations and the ability to manage workflows, conversations and activity feeds.
The lack of external collaboration has been a problem for many collaboration apps, such as Slack, Cisco Spark and Microsoft Teams. Often, employees can't use the apps to communicate with people outside their organizations. In March 2017, cloud communications provider 8x8 Inc. acquired Sameroom, an interoperability platform that lets employees, customers and partners collaborate across disparate team messaging services.
The latest release of Amium is available on Mac, Windows and Linux, as well as iOS and Android. Amium is free and includes up to two projects and 2 GB of file storage. Users can upgrade for unlimited projects and 100 GB of file storage per user for $9 per user per month.


Mobile messaging app targets large groups
Mobilize, a messaging platform for large groups, has launched a mobile application that aims to fill an industry gap for scalable and structured mobile messaging communication to reach groups and network partners. The app, now available for download at the app store, is built to enable communications for tens of thousands of contacts.

Mobile messaging services -- such as Slack, Google Groups and Yammer -- can't scale effectively to facilitate conversations between thousands of people, Mobilize said in statement. The new app allows users to send group and targeted messages, organize topic-based threads and manage multichannel communications.
San Francisco-based Mobilize created the app in partnership with MetaLab, the app design firm behind Slack. Available on iOS, Mobilize is free for up to 100 members with nonprofit, business and enterprise plans for larger groups. The app includes:


Member management and organization: Store member and contact data in one network directory with synced and customizable profiles that can be organized into subgroups. Users can also publish an external registration form to sign up new members.
Multichannel communications: Enables organizations to message their entire network or send targeted messages via SMS and email. Companies can also organize communications among large groups by topic. 
Events and polls: The app posts events to users' calendars. Users can reply from their email, calendar or on Mobilize. Organizations can increase engagement and measure sentiment with member polls.
Group-level analytics and network dashboard: Track member growth, post activity and engagement rates. Managers can conduct follow-up actions. 



Next Steps
Choose the right PaaS product for application development.
Evaluate the market for communications platform as a service.
Consider these features when selecting collaboration tools.
