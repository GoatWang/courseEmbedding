Non-Carbonated beverages 
Brand 
: 
“Warped” 
Specifics 
: 
Volume 
750mL (total) 
Dimensions 
Bottle - 10in x 3in x 3in. Height is 12 inches total including cap. 
Shot Glass Cap - 2in height, 1.5” diameter opening, 2” diameter top. 

Who can say no when it comes to a two for one deal? With the Warped bottle, the 
competition is blown out of the water, offering up a combination of beverages fit for 
anyone! The bottle itself, designed by Lucky 13 Inc., consists of two individual bottles 
nesting together to produce a single bottle. If that isn’t exciting enough, those two bottles 
will be twisted a quarter turn to give the bottle a “Warped” effect. The glass has a glossy 
finish consisting of two colors for each bottle to make the product really pop. These 
colors can be chosen to mirror a college sports team, holiday season, or just to combine 
your two favorite colors. Along with the finish, the bottle will have stippling around the 
edge of the bottom with a ¼ inch push-up. The logo is written down the bottle on 
opposing sides, while the PDP for each liquid completes the other two sides. 
The cap is shallow threaded and screws on over the top of a dual-closure on the 
mouth of the bottle. When the cap is unscrewed from the bottle, there is an opening on 
each half of the mouth, allowing you to choose what kind of liquor you want. Each semi-
circle on the mouth of the bottle will have a small, plastic snap that will allow you to

“pick your poison,” leaving the non-chosen side closed. A shot glass cap completes the 
bottle with a metallic finish that will snap right on top of the threaded cap. The shot glass 
is a cylinder with a 2” diameter top, 1.5” diameter bottom cap that can hold 1.5 ounces of 
beverage. 
The “Warped” bottle also saves storage space in liquor cabinets or counter-top 
space by having two different liquors in one unique, classy package. 
Process of manufacturing 
Made with a narrow necked press and blow process, this bottle is unique in the 
case that the two halves of the bottle will be made independently, then nested together, 
and adhered to create a single bottle. First, the main ingredients are added to the hopper 
in specific increments, and gobs are formed to produce clear transparent glass. Then, each 
half of the bottle will be shaped into a curved triangular parison made with a “warped” 
mold, in the sense that the sides will be twisted. The logo is written down the side of the 
individual bottle in relief, making the lettering pop. The finish inside the mold is a semi 
circle, which, when put together with its counterpart, will form a complete circle. Since 
the bottles are too thin and unstable to stand on their own after they are molded, a
