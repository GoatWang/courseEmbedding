Stalking snakes: Days (and nights) in the life of a Brown Treesnake rapid responderProduct Type: Science FeatureYear: 2008Author(s): Stanford, J. and J. WilsonSuggested Citation: Stanford, J. and J. Wilson. 2008. Stalking snakes: Days (and nights) in the life of a Brown Treesnake rapid responder. 02/19/2008It has been more than 27 years since Dr. Julie Savidge (now of Colorado State University) and other biologists first took notice of the invasive Brown Treesnake on Guam and its impacts on the island’s native bird life. Today, we are well aware of at least three major impacts of the snake’s invasion legacy on Guam. First, this nocturnal, tree-dwelling snake has caused the extirpation of nearly every species of forest bird and has played a major role in reducing or eliminating several species of native lizards and at least one mammalian species. Second, Brown Treesnake bites are mildly venomous and often require medical attention, especially bites to infants and small children. Third, the snake causes frequent power outages when climbing along utility lines or coming into contact with exposed structure wiring. The annual cost associated with snake-induced power outages on Guam was recently estimated to be $4.5 million. On a populous island with many at-risk ecosystems such as Oahu, Hawaii, an established population of Brown Treesnakes would be even more ecologically and economically damaging, with costs possibly exceeding $400 million per year...
