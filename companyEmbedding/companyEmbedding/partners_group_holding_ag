The service industry is today not only a one point function but have multiple tasks included in it. It gives you access to various other utility functionaries as most of the services are interconnected today i.e.: Just by calling your cell phone operator you can also access your movie tickets, travel planners and online shopping portals. Therefore it won�t be wrong to say that the service sector has today become a prominent feature for the smooth flowing of the economy of a nation as huge volumes of business just depend on this sector.
