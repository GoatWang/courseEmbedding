Biography[edit]
Stephenson earned a B.S. from the University of Central Oklahoma and a Master of Accountancy from the University of Oklahoma.[1]
Stephenson began his career in 1982 with Southwestern Bell Telephone in the information-technology organization in Oklahoma. Late in the 1980s through 1990s, he progressed through a series of leadership positions in finance, including an international assignment in Mexico City. In July 2001, he was appointed Chief Financial Officer for SBC, helping the company reduce its net debt from $30 billion to near zero by early 2004. From 2003 to 2004, Stephenson served as Chairman of the Board of Directors for Cingular Wireless. In 2004, he was named Chief Operating Officer of SBC and also appointed by President Bush as National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee.
Stephenson continued as COO following SBC's acquisition of AT&T in 2005, responsible for all wireless and wireline operations at AT&T. In April 2007, AT&T announced Stephenson would succeed retiring Edward Whitacre as CEO.[2]
On July 26, 2009, Stephenson was falsely reported as having died after falling into a coma following a massive cocaine binge during a party at his mansion.[3] The report originated from CNN's iReport website, although it was later taken down. Although the hackers who created the false report have never been identified, it is suspected that they were 4chan users who did the hack in retaliation for AT&T's decision to block the site for its broadband customers, a decision which had been provoked by an earlier denial-of-service attack against one of AT&T's customers that originated from a 4chan user. Access to 4chan on AT&T broadband services has since been restored. In 2013, Stephenson received $23,247,167 in total compensation, with a base salary of $1,633,333.[4] In April 2015, Stephenson was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by Knoyme King, an assistant at AT&T. According to King, Stephenson was complicit in covering up racist texts sent by then-President Aaron Slator.[5]
Stephenson was named the 2016 CEO of the Year by Chief Executive magazine.[6]
Scouting[edit]
Stephenson joined the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Executive Board in 2005 and became a member of the executive committee in 2008. In 2016, he succeeded Robert Gates as the 36th National President of the BSA.[7]
He, as well as fellow boardmember James Turley, CEO of Ernst & Young, publicly opposed the BSA's former policy banning openly gay Scouts and stated their intention "to work from within the BSA Board to actively encourage dialogue and sustainable progress" in changing the policy.[8][9]
Personal[edit]
Stephenson is a current member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[10]

On July 26, 2009, Stephenson was falsely reported as having died after falling into a coma following a massive cocaine binge during a party at his mansion.[3] The report originated from CNN's iReport website, although it was later taken down. Although the hackers who created the false report have never been identified, it is suspected that they were 4chan users who did the hack in retaliation for AT&T's decision to block the site for its broadband customers, a decision which had been provoked by an earlier denial-of-service attack against one of AT&T's customers that originated from a 4chan user. Access to 4chan on AT&T broadband services has since been restored. In 2013, Stephenson received $23,247,167 in total compensation, with a base salary of $1,633,333.[4] In April 2015, Stephenson was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by Knoyme King, an assistant at AT&T. According to King, Stephenson was complicit in covering up racist texts sent by then-President Aaron Slator.[5]
Stephenson was named the 2016 CEO of the Year by Chief Executive magazine.[6]
Scouting[edit]
Stephenson joined the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Executive Board in 2005 and became a member of the executive committee in 2008. In 2016, he succeeded Robert Gates as the 36th National President of the BSA.[7]
He, as well as fellow boardmember James Turley, CEO of Ernst & Young, publicly opposed the BSA's former policy banning openly gay Scouts and stated their intention "to work from within the BSA Board to actively encourage dialogue and sustainable progress" in changing the policy.[8][9]
Personal[edit]
Stephenson is a current member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[10]

Randall L. Stephenson


The AT&T Network


An Interview with Randall L. Stephenson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, AT&T Inc.


Editor’s Note
Randall Stephenson assumed his current post in 2007. He began his career with Southwestern Bell Telephone in 1982. From 2001 to 2004, he was the company’s Chief Financial Officer, and from 2004 to 2007, he served as the company’s Chief Operating Officer. He was appointed to AT&T’s board of directors in 2005. Stephenson is a member of the board of directors of Emerson Electric Co., a member of the PGA TOUR Policy Board, and a National Executive Board member of the Boy Scouts of America. Stephenson received his B.S. in accounting from the University of Central Oklahoma and his Master of Accountancy from the University of Oklahoma.
Company Brief
AT&T (www.att.com) is one of the world’s largest telecom companies with $127 billion in 2012 revenues. It continues to spearhead the mobile Internet revolution, driving innovation and investing more capital into the U.S. economy over the past several years than any other public company. AT&T customers enjoy the nation’s fastest and most reliable 4G LTE network. By bringing together fast mobile networks and cloud-based services, AT&T is helping customers mobilize everything from business solutions to cars to education. In addition to providing sophisticated communications services for businesses of every size, AT&T offers high-speed broadband connectivity and advanced TV services to millions of consumers and businesses across the United States.
What factors have contributed to the enduring success of AT&T?
You must have the right leadership talent at the top that is committed to constant innovation, constant reinvigoration of the business, and constant and persistent investment through good and bad times. In fact, the investments we’ve made through the down cycles have always been when we have taken competitive leaps forward.
Is it more challenging to maintain a culture of innovation as you get to a certain size and scale?
Size is a detractor from innovation, but so is the nature of our revenues. We’re a service company and we tend to have large recurring revenue streams. So, in our industry, innovation oftentimes means replacement and substitution of existing revenue streams.
If you don’t have a culture that drives relentlessly on innovation, here’s what happens: You hold onto embedded recurring revenue streams and legacy products and never move to the next place. Then someone else will come and take the market from you.
These are the inherent gravitational pulls away from innovation. You need a mindset that says we will innovate and not be afraid of cannibalizing our own revenue streams in order to bring customers the latest technology. It can be painful in the short run, but it’s critical to do. 
The classic example is wireless. The more you invest in wireless voice and data quality, the more you put at risk your fixed-line voice and data revenue streams. But you need to recognize where the market is going, commit to it, and make the necessary investments – and then deal with the cannibalization, because that is what your customers want. 
Do today’s job candidates understand how AT&T has evolved and the type of career this organization can offer?
We’ve done well in attracting good, high quality technical talent over the years. A lot of this talent has come through acquisitions, but we’ve also done a good job bringing in talent at the grassroots level and growing it.
We have also been very aggressive and successful at bringing in talent at a senior level. Convincing people of the dynamism, excitement, and innovation in this industry is not difficult.
How critical is it that your workforce mirrors the diversity of your clientele?
A lot of people call diversity a sustainability effort and something we have to do. I maintain that if you don’t commit to diversity, you cannot succeed.
So we are disciplined and focused to ensure that our leadership team reflects our markets. If you don’t grow up and live and breathe in different cultures, it’s much more difficult to know how to serve them in the marketplace.
Will future growth be throughout the organization or driven by specific parts of your operations? 
It’s across our business. In our industry, it seems that every time somebody predicts the death of a particular set of services, that area reinvigorates itself. For instance, consumer home solutions is a fixed-line business for us that hadn’t seen growth in four or five years. But in just a few years’ time, we have built AT&T U-verse TV and high-speed Internet into a business with nearly $11 billion in annualized revenues.
Now we’re making further investments through an initiative we call Project VIP, which will provide significant bandwidth to millions of homes. Bandwidth to the home is going to be a major driver in this industry for a long time.
The other area that will drive all parts of the market over the next five or six years is the convergence of high-speed mobile networks – think 4G LTE – with cloud technology. In fact, this convergence is playing out right now.
As we begin to combine these technologies, new services and opportunities are appearing all over the place. The connected car can only become a reality when you combine fourth-generation high-speed mobile networks and the cloud. We’re changing the home-security monitoring industry – which hasn’t changed in 20 or 30 years – by virtue of this same dynamic. Businesses and industries across the board over the next five years are going to be reinvented. 
One of the most exciting places you will see this is in education, which includes our recent announcement involving Georgia Tech, AT&T, and Udacity. 
Education is an industry that has largely escaped the productivity revolution over the past 20 years; costs have gone up and quality has gone sideways.
Next year, together with Georgia Tech and Udacity, we are introducing a fully accredited online Master of Science degree in Computer Science at a fraction of the cost of a traditional on-campus program. This is radical. Only the technological innovation of high-speed connectivity and the cloud can make this happen.
How tough is it to get the message across about what makes a company unique in this space?
You have to invest in branding your capabilities and your business. Branding is critical. In fact, we spend more on advertising and brand positioning than maybe any other industry.
It starts, though, with having a differentiated experience. We believe – and time has proven this – that a high-quality network experience will always be a differentiator in this industry. It sounds easy, but it’s not.
So we have invested aggressively in wireless spectrum, which is the critical resource in our business. You cannot have a quality experience that is differentiated without the spectrum and technological innovation that rides on top of it – this is how you get to the future first.We believe that what 
  we’re about is human progress.Once you achieve that, positioning yourself in the marketplace – through aggressive branding – does produce significant returns. In the U.S., we have differentiated ourselves in virtually every segment of the market – consumer as well as high-end business and small business.
AT&T is associated with the phrase, “Rethink Possible.” What does this messaging convey?
You have to ask: What is your enduring proposition? What do you do that goes beyond making a buck?
We believe that what we’re about is human progress. To the extent that we invest and bring new capabilities to market, it results in human progress. At its most core level, it’s about increasing productivity and broadly improving prosperity through fixed and mobile broadband. The way we facilitate innovation and productivity is by opening up our capabilities to innovators and challenging them to rethink how we change customers’ lives.
A lot of people were apprehensive about our doing a deal with Apple for the iPhone. It looked like a wonderful opportunity to us – it caused us to rethink our business model and allowed us to rethink possible. It also allowed Apple to do the same, so they opened their platform to application developers.
To the extent that you invest and open your capabilities, you have created a new opportunity for layered innovation.
What is the value of corporate responsibility for AT&T? Is it important that the areas you support align with the business?
I have always believed that when we reach out to our communities, we need to do it in places that make sense not just for the communities but for the business.
This is why we have made education a huge focus with our philanthropic dollars as well as why we ask our people to volunteer their time – particularly focusing on the high school drop-out epidemic. It’s important to us because we hired 26,000 people last year alone, and the type of people we hire need to have technical skills. We don’t necessarily need a lot of Ph.D.s in engineering, but we do need people who can do technical support work for customers, including installation of technical services for large-scale businesses.
So when we have high drop-out rates, it’s not only detrimental to society, it also impacts our business. We obviously need a good, well-educated workforce, so we made this commitment. You don’t have to sell a lot of people on investing in education when it serves the needs of the business as well as the community. 
How tough is it to keep up with the advances in technology and how far out do you need to be looking? 
We are making network design decisions today in light of a world that we believe will be very different five years from now.
Five years out, we believe the lion’s share of the traffic on our network will be driven by video. Specific services that will drive video consumption will include some that we bring to market, but the lion’s share will come from letting innovators create on top of our network infrastructure. We believe the best way to participate in innovation cycles is to open up our networks and turn the innovators loose, although we have an industry that has traditionally been averse to that.
AT&T used to sell the telephone that was hardwired into the wall and that was the service you got. Then we opened up these networks and began to see innovation evolve and develop. 
We are strong believers in this model – you build aggressively and invest aggressively in core capabilities and let the innovators create on top of it.
Has there been an understanding from your people of the need to continually evolve? How important is it to reinforce the need for change when you have a company with such a successful history?
When I assumed this role, Ed Whitacre (former Chairman and CEO) had already assembled some great assets – in business services and wireless, plus the traditional local exchange businesses.
Six years ago, when he handed me this business, we determined that we had to become a wireless company. We weren’t that at the time, though we had wireless assets.
Most of the people in our company had grown up in the fixed-line or wireline side of the business. But we realized that we were going to have to make a hard pivot.
To accomplish this, we said there would have to be cultural change and that would require resetting the mindset of everyone in this business.
One of the first things I did was go to my HR guy and say, we’re going to create AT&T University, a place where we’ll bring the leadership of this company in and make them invest considerable time in where we want to go as a company – where the industry is headed and what our role will be in it – all building from this idea of being wireless driven. At that time, we were launching an iPhone and it helped drive this concept home.
Within a short period of time, we got our employee team fully in sync. We also had to get our owners aligned because they weren’t completely sold at first.
Mobility soon became the focus of the business. Capital allocation, our approach to the marketplace, and how we branded the company – everything was wireless driven. Today, we are regarded largely as a mobility company. It wasn’t easy, and it required a lot of painstaking diligence, and investing in culture, but the payoff has been worth it.
Are you concerned about the competitiveness of U.S. companies globally, and are we still an innovation leader?
When you consider the key global drivers over the past six years, I would say there have been two great innovations that have changed the complexion of business and economies around the world: energy and the mobile Internet. Look at what has happened with hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling; it’s driving a revolution around the globe in terms of energy extraction and availability, and even bringing the United States closer to energy independence.Today, we are regarded 
  largely as a mobility company.The other place that has been just as revolutionary is the mobile Internet, and all of the ecosystems surrounding it and what that’s doing to productivity in every area, from health care to retail. There is not an industry that hasn’t already been affected or that will not be even more radically affected over the next five years, by virtue of the mobile Internet.
The mobile Internet and the total ecosystem surrounding it – including the applications community and the new services community in Silicon Valley – have come into existence over just the past five or six years and they’ve all largely been driven by the United States. So, yes, we are doing a terrific job in this area.•

Stephenson spoke at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Southwest Washington on Tuesday. (The Economic Club of Washington, DC/Sam Kittner)   By Steven Overly  By Steven Overly   June 17, 2014  Follow @stevenoverly     Washington, you’re bringing Randall L. Stephenson down. The chairman and chief executive of AT&T told the Economic Club of Washington Tuesday that the biggest disadvantage to his role atop the nation’s second-largest telecommunications company is that the company’s investment strategy and growth depends so heavily on lawmakers and regulators here.  But Stephenson isn’t still smarting from the bungled $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile that federal regulators blocked in 2011 out of concern the deal would eliminate a major wireless provider and drive up costs for consumers. Instead, Stephenson told the audience of business executives that Congress’s unwillingness to enact corporate tax reform is inhibiting the expansion of the U.S. economy and dissuading businesses from investing money in growth.  That’s particularly true after a series of tax benefits for corporations expired on Jan. 1. Only after changes are made, Stephenson added, will jobs be created at a suitable rate and revenue be generated to sustain health care and entitlement programs. “Investment has slowed across corporate America and it’s illogical to think it happened for any reason other than these tax benefits going away. [Congress should] extend these provisions as a bridge to tax reform,” said Stephenson, who became chairman of the Business Roundtable in January.  But Washington gridlock due to deep political divisions makes it unlikely Congress will pass tax reform legislation this session, Stephenson lamented, despite what he sees as a bipartisan understanding that changes need to be made. “The ability to work on core issues where there is general agreement is the part that frustrates me,” Stephenson said. On tax reform, “there is just general agreement on the big issues, what needs to be done. Get rid of the preferences and the special deductions and the loopholes ... and invest in getting the tax rate to a competitive level so we stop seeing companies move off shore.” “And it comes to ‘start passing legislation,’ and you can’t get past square one.”  Immigration reform, on the other hand, stands a narrow chance of clearing the House and Senate, Stephenson said, urging President Obama to make a concerted push over the next two months for comprehensive legislation. “It’s a first-rate crisis that needs to be dealt with, and to keep punting this and pushing this off, it feels irresponsible,” he said.  Immigration reform has become increasingly important to the business community, particularly technology companies, because they would like to hire foreign-born students earning degrees in high-demand areas of science and engineering.  Stephenson spoke at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Southwest Washington. The lunchtime engagement drew a full ballroom of attendees to hear both Stephenson’s remarks and his interview with Economic Club of Washington President David M. Rubenstein.  The hour-long talk did circle back to Washington’s regulatory climate (Canada’s is better, Stephenson said.) as AT&T finds itself asking once again for approval of a big-ticket purchase, this time the company’s proposed merger with television provider DirecTV.  Stephenson told the audience that consumers are streaming more video on their portable devices than ever before . Thus, buying a TV provider with 20 million U.S. subscribers will give AT&T access to extensive video content — not to mention the ability to bundle wireless and TV services à la Verizon.  “The shift has happened, and mobile Internet and mobile data isn’t what’s going to drive this industry and your industries, it’s mobile video,” he told the audience. “Well over half of the traffic that flows over our networks is coming from video. As you think about a business that is going to be video centric and video focused, you want to have scale on the video programming side to be able to take advantage of this.”  Ultimately, Stephenson told the crowd, telecommunications companies cannot afford to miss out on any new wave of innovation or they risk going out of business entirely. Just take a look at BlackBerry.  “This is an industry where if you’re not investing you’re going to die,” Stephenson said. “The obsolescence cycles in this industry are stunning.”          business capitalbusiness      false after3th true          Please provide a valid email address.

Biography[edit]
Stephenson earned a B.S. from the University of Central Oklahoma and a Master of Accountancy from the University of Oklahoma.[1]
Stephenson began his career in 1982 with Southwestern Bell Telephone in the information-technology organization in Oklahoma. Late in the 1980s through 1990s, he progressed through a series of leadership positions in finance, including an international assignment in Mexico City. In July 2001, he was appointed Chief Financial Officer for SBC, helping the company reduce its net debt from $30 billion to near zero by early 2004. From 2003 to 2004, Stephenson served as Chairman of the Board of Directors for Cingular Wireless. In 2004, he was named Chief Operating Officer of SBC and also appointed by President Bush as National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee.
Stephenson continued as COO following SBC's acquisition of AT&T in 2005, responsible for all wireless and wireline operations at AT&T. In April 2007, AT&T announced Stephenson would succeed retiring Edward Whitacre as CEO.[2]
On July 26, 2009, Stephenson was falsely reported as having died after falling into a coma following a massive cocaine binge during a party at his mansion.[3] The report originated from CNN's iReport website, although it was later taken down. Although the hackers who created the false report have never been identified, it is suspected that they were 4chan users who did the hack in retaliation for AT&T's decision to block the site for its broadband customers, a decision which had been provoked by an earlier denial-of-service attack against one of AT&T's customers that originated from a 4chan user. Access to 4chan on AT&T broadband services has since been restored. In 2013, Stephenson received $23,247,167 in total compensation, with a base salary of $1,633,333.[4] In April 2015, Stephenson was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by Knoyme King, an assistant at AT&T. According to King, Stephenson was complicit in covering up racist texts sent by then-President Aaron Slator.[5]
Stephenson was named the 2016 CEO of the Year by Chief Executive magazine.[6]
Scouting[edit]
Stephenson joined the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Executive Board in 2005 and became a member of the executive committee in 2008. In 2016, he succeeded Robert Gates as the 36th National President of the BSA.[7]
He, as well as fellow boardmember James Turley, CEO of Ernst & Young, publicly opposed the BSA's former policy banning openly gay Scouts and stated their intention "to work from within the BSA Board to actively encourage dialogue and sustainable progress" in changing the policy.[8][9]
Personal[edit]
Stephenson is a current member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[10]

Biography[edit]
Stephenson earned a B.S. from the University of Central Oklahoma and a Master of Accountancy from the University of Oklahoma.[1]
Stephenson began his career in 1982 with Southwestern Bell Telephone in the information-technology organization in Oklahoma. Late in the 1980s through 1990s, he progressed through a series of leadership positions in finance, including an international assignment in Mexico City. In July 2001, he was appointed Chief Financial Officer for SBC, helping the company reduce its net debt from $30 billion to near zero by early 2004. From 2003 to 2004, Stephenson served as Chairman of the Board of Directors for Cingular Wireless. In 2004, he was named Chief Operating Officer of SBC and also appointed by President Bush as National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee.
Stephenson continued as COO following SBC's acquisition of AT&T in 2005, responsible for all wireless and wireline operations at AT&T. In April 2007, AT&T announced Stephenson would succeed retiring Edward Whitacre as CEO.[2]
On July 26, 2009, Stephenson was falsely reported as having died after falling into a coma following a massive cocaine binge during a party at his mansion.[3] The report originated from CNN's iReport website, although it was later taken down. Although the hackers who created the false report have never been identified, it is suspected that they were 4chan users who did the hack in retaliation for AT&T's decision to block the site for its broadband customers, a decision which had been provoked by an earlier denial-of-service attack against one of AT&T's customers that originated from a 4chan user. Access to 4chan on AT&T broadband services has since been restored. In 2013, Stephenson received $23,247,167 in total compensation, with a base salary of $1,633,333.[4] In April 2015, Stephenson was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by Knoyme King, an assistant at AT&T. According to King, Stephenson was complicit in covering up racist texts sent by then-President Aaron Slator.[5]
Stephenson was named the 2016 CEO of the Year by Chief Executive magazine.[6]
Scouting[edit]
Stephenson joined the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Executive Board in 2005 and became a member of the executive committee in 2008. In 2016, he succeeded Robert Gates as the 36th National President of the BSA.[7]
He, as well as fellow boardmember James Turley, CEO of Ernst & Young, publicly opposed the BSA's former policy banning openly gay Scouts and stated their intention "to work from within the BSA Board to actively encourage dialogue and sustainable progress" in changing the policy.[8][9]
Personal[edit]
Stephenson is a current member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[10]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
