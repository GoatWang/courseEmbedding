(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  This discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC'). We present such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically underlying and organic non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company's operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis, and these provide a measure against which our businesses may be assessed in the future. Underlying total revenues, underlying total expenses, underlying salaries and benefits, underlying other operating expenses, underlying operating income, underlying operating margin, underlying EBITDA, underlying net income and underlying earnings per diluted share (hereinafter referred to collectively as the 'underlying measures') are calculated by excluding the impact of certain items and period over period movements in foreign currency, from the most directly comparable GAAP measures.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Table of Contents  Management's Discussion and Analysis  occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering plans. We are not an insurance company and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account.  Table of Contents  Willis Towers Watson plc  overall underwriting margins remain under substantial pressure. Although we are beginning to see the return of more normal market conditions, these challenging and uneven market conditions may result in quarterly volatility in actual financial performance in comparison to our 2015 strategic and financial goals. In the face of this challenging economic environment, we have adopted a strategy to (1) invest selectively in growth areas, defined by geography, industry sector, and client segment and (2) better coordinate our segments so as to bring our clients greater access to the Company's specialty areas and analytical capabilities. Our growth strategy also involves increasing our investment in, and deployment of, our analytical capabilities.  With respect to the Legacy Towers Watson operations, the market for our services is subject to change as a result of economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, and increased competition from established and new competitors. Regulatory and legislative actions, along with continuously evolving technological developments, will likely have the greatest impact on the overall market for our exchange products. We believe the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation, the ability to provide measurable increases to stockholder value and return on investment, global scale, quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients' unique needs. With regard to the market for exchanges, we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients, a strong reputation for efficient execution, a provider's capability in delivering a broad number of configurations to serve various population segments and financing options, and an innovative service delivery model and platform. For our traditional consulting and risk management services and the rapidly evolving exchange products, we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors.   Total operating expenses of $3,402 million increased by $247 million, or 7.8 percent over the prior year. This growth included a $90 million increase in restructuring costs related to the Operational Improvement Program, a $77 million increase in M&A related-transaction costs, a $70 litigation provision, a $181 million net increase in expenses from acquisitions and disposals, partially offset by $197 million favorable foreign currency movements.   Operating margin decreased 580 basis points to 11.2 percent from 17.0 percent in the prior year, as the increase in total operating expenses exceeded the increase in total revenues, primarily due to the $90 million increase in restructuring costs related to the Operational Improvement Program, the $70 million litigation provision referred to above, and the increase in expenses due to the mid-year acquisition of Miller initially exceeding the increase in revenues generated by the acquisition, due the seasonal profile of the business.   Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson was $373 million, or $5.41 per diluted share, an increase of $11 million, or 3.0 percent, from $362 million, or $5.32 per diluted share, in 2014.   Cash flows from operating activities were $243 million in 2015, a decrease of $234 million, or 49.1 percent from $477 million in 2014. The $234 decrease was largely due to the following: higher cash outflow for restructuring costs and M&A transaction-related costs; higher cash outflow for incentives; and increase in accounts receivable from growth in the business and the timing of cash collections.  Our non-GAAP financial measures were as follows:  Table of Contents  Management's Discussion and Analysis   Underlying total expenses of $3,122 million increased $207 million, or 7.1 percent, over the prior year. Excluding the net $181 million increase from acquisitions and disposals, organic total operating expenses of $2,912 million increased $26 million, or 0.9 percent, over the prior year.   The resultant organic operating margin increased by 150 basis points to 19.5 percent from 18.0 percent in the prior year.  Acquisitions and Disposals   On May 31, 2015, Legacy Willis acquired an 85 percent interest in Miller Insurance Services LLP and its subsidiaries, a leading London wholesale specialist insurance broking firm.   On December 29, 2015, Legacy Willis acquired substantially all of the remaining share capital of GS & Cie Group ('Gras Savoye'), the leading insurance broker in France. Gras Savoye has access to high-growth markets through a comprehensive network that spans Central and Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East.  During 2015, Legacy Willis also acquired:   Carsa Consultores, Agente de Seguros y de Fianzas de CV and its group companies, a leading insurance broker in Mexico;   the trade and assets of Evolution Benefits Consulting, Inc., a human capital practice in Pennsylvania;   Elite Risk Services, Taiwan;   CKA Risk Solutions, Australia;   Sparsam, Sweden;   PMI Group, UK (Private Medicine Intermediaries); and   the remaining interest in Miller do Brasil.  Operational improvement program   net workforce reductions in support positions;   lease consolidation in real estate and reductions in ratios of seats per employee and square footage of floor space per employee; and   information technology systems simplification and rationalization.  The program began in the second quarter of 2014 and is expected to be complete by the end of 2017. The program was expecting to deliver cumulative cost savings of at least $420 million through 2017 and annual cost savings of approximately $300 million starting in 2018. However, due to strong execution against the overall strategy to date, the Company has increased  Table of Contents  Willis Towers Watson plc  its expectations for cost savings from the program. The annual cost savings expected to be generated by the end of 2017 are now expected to be $325 million and the cumulative savings are now expected to be in excess of $490 million through the end of the program. The program cumulative expected savings exclude merger-related savings.   indexed ratio of square footage of real estate per FTE as at December 31, 2015 was 95 (December 31, 2014 ratio was 98; March 31, 2014 ratio was 100); and   indexed ratio of desks per FTE as at December 31, 2015 was 101 (December 31, 2014 ratio was 99 (March 31, 2014 ratio was 100).  By releasing 93,000 square feet of space since March 2014, we have been able to have more employees occupy a smaller area. We are still adding employees to our new office in Tampa, Florida, completed in the fourth quarter of 2015, which has impacted the desk per FTE ratio, as have the additional desks required throughout the business for contractors and consultants not included in the FTE headcount.   $27 million in Willis GB, comprising $10 million termination benefits and $17 million professional services and other program costs;   $26 million in Willis International, comprising $8 million termination benefits and $18 million professional services and other program costs;   $9 million in Willis CWR, comprising $7 million termination benefits and $2 million professional services and other program costs; and   $33 million in Corporate and other, comprising $3 million termination benefits and $30 million professional services and other program costs.  UK Defined Benefit Pension Scheme  Salary freeze  On March 6, 2015, Legacy Willis announced to members of the UK defined benefit pension plan that, with effect from June 30, 2015, future salary increases would not be pensionable (the 'salary freeze'). The Company has recognized the salary freeze as a plan amendment at the announcement date. The impact of the salary freeze is to reduce the plan's projected benefit obligation by approximately $215 million and create a prior service credit which is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) and then amortized to the Statement of Operations over the remaining expected service life of active employees.  Table of Contents  Management's Discussion and Analysis  Schedule of contributions  Annual deficit funding contributions will reduce to approximately $22 million for 2017 through 2020 although additional 'funding level' contributions may become payable based on funding level assessments made between December 31, 2017 and 2024. Such annual funding level contributions are capped at approximately $15 million. From 2021 annual deficit funding contributions may be ceased, and instead paid into escrow, if the Scheme is ahead of its funding plan.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  Legacy Willis non-GAAP financial measures for 2015 We believe that the understanding of the Company's performance and comparative analysis of our results is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP financial measures. We use these and other measures to establish Group performance targets and evaluate the performance of our operations. Our method for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. Our calculation methods are:  Our underlying non-GAAP measures are calculated by excluding restructuring costs relating to the Operational Improvement Program, the impact of the Venezuelan Bolivar devaluation, certain litigation provisions, gains (losses) on disposal of operations, remeasurement of previously held equity interests, non-recurring changes in deferred tax valuation allowances and, from the second quarter of 2015, merger and acquisition ('M&A') transaction-related costs, as relevant, from total revenues, total expenses, salaries and benefits, other operating expenses, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. As a result of excluding merger and acquisition transaction-related costs from the second quarter of 2015, underlying non-GAAP measures for 2014 have been restated.  Our organic non-GAAP measures are calculated by further excluding the twelve-month impact from acquisitions and disposals from our underlying measures.  Table of Contents  Willis Towers Watson plc A reconciliation of reported total expenses, salaries and benefits and other operating expense, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, to underlying and organic total expenses, underlying and organic salaries and benefits and underlying and organic other operating expenses is as follows (in millions, except percentages): 2015 compared to 2014 Salaries and benefits Other operating expenses Total expenses 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Expenses, GAAP basis $ 2,306 $ 2,314 $ 799 $ 659 $ 3,402 $ 3,155 Excluding: Restructuring costs - - - - 126 36 M&A transaction-related costs (a) 3 - 81 7 84 7 Litigation provision (b) - - 70 - 70 - Foreign currency movements (c) - 148 - 42 - 197 Underlying expenses $ 2,303 $ 2,166 $ 648 $ 610 $ 3,122 $ 2,915 Less: net expenses from acquisitions and disposals 134 25 40 4 210 29 Organic expenses $ 2,169 $ 2,141 $ 608 $ 606 $ 2,912 $ 2,886 _________________________________  Feb 29, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

Overview[edit]
Willis Towers Watson operates in more than 140 countries and has a workforce of more than 40,000 employees.[2] It has joined the Hedge Fund Standards Board and follows the voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.[3]
History[edit]
Willis Towers Watson was formed as a merger of equals between London based Willis Group Holdings plc and Arlington, VA based Towers Watson & Co.[4]
Merger process[edit]
Rationale[edit]
The merging companies announced the merger on 30 June 2015[1] in a deal valued at $18 billion.[4] Willis Towers Watson would maintain its domicile in Ireland lowering taxes and list on the New York Stock Exchange. Later in 2015 the company moved its domicile to Virginia in The US and delisted from The NYSE and relisted on The NASDAQ.
Criticism[edit]
Critics to the deal pointed out that the original offer would not be beneficial to Towers Watson shareholders as they would receive package of shares and a special cash dividend that is valued at $125.13 per share.[5] This value was 9.3% lower than the trading price of Towers Watson's stock as at the time of the announcement of the deal.[6] The revised offer in November increased the value to $130.26 per share, which was still lower than the trading price of Towers Watson shares at the time of the announcement. The deal also gives Willis Group shareholders more control despite the firm having a lower market capitalization compared to Towers Watson.[5]
In an open letter, investment adviser Driehaus Capital Management urged Towers Watson shareholders to vote against a proposed merger.[7] Driehaus argued that Towers Watson was worth between 39% and 53% more as a standalone company than by merging with Willis Group.[8] It was also reported that Towers Watson CEO John Haley had disposed of his shares in the company in early March 2015 while the merger negotiations were ongoing.[9]
On November 18, 2015, the board of Towers Watson failed to get enough investor support for the deal, with only 40% of shareholders voting in favor of the proposed merger with Willis Group.[10] This rejection led to Willis Group increasing its special cash dividend for Towers Watson shareholders to USD $10 per share. This revised offer was approved by Towers Watson shareholders on December 11, 2015.[11]
Completion[edit]
The merger was closed on 5 January 2016 once all regulatory approvals were received. Willis Towers Watson publicly announced their name change on 5 January. It is the day 1 of the company as Willis Towers Watson.[12][13] Willis Group shareholders owned 50.1% while those of Towers Watson shareholders owned 49.9% of the combined company.[14]
On completion, Towers Watson CEO, John Haley, became the CEO, Willis Group CEO, Dominic Casserley, became the President and Deputy CEO while Willis Group Chairman, James McCann, became the chairman of the merged group with the twelve board seats shared equally between the two companies.[15]
For the first fiscal quarter of 2016, the first earnings release since the merger completed, Willis Towers Watson reported that merger and acquisition costs remain significant and are likely to total between $150 million and $175 million.[16]

Overview[edit]
Willis Towers Watson operates in more than 140 countries and has a workforce of more than 40,000 employees.[2] It has joined the Hedge Fund Standards Board and follows the voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.[3]
History[edit]
Willis Towers Watson was formed as a merger of equals between London based Willis Group Holdings plc and Arlington, VA based Towers Watson & Co.[4]
Merger process[edit]
Rationale[edit]
The merging companies announced the merger on 30 June 2015[1] in a deal valued at $18 billion.[4] Willis Towers Watson would maintain its domicile in Ireland lowering taxes and list on the New York Stock Exchange. Later in 2015 the company moved its domicile to Virginia in The US and delisted from The NYSE and relisted on The NASDAQ.
Criticism[edit]
Critics to the deal pointed out that the original offer would not be beneficial to Towers Watson shareholders as they would receive package of shares and a special cash dividend that is valued at $125.13 per share.[5] This value was 9.3% lower than the trading price of Towers Watson's stock as at the time of the announcement of the deal.[6] The revised offer in November increased the value to $130.26 per share, which was still lower than the trading price of Towers Watson shares at the time of the announcement. The deal also gives Willis Group shareholders more control despite the firm having a lower market capitalization compared to Towers Watson.[5]
In an open letter, investment adviser Driehaus Capital Management urged Towers Watson shareholders to vote against a proposed merger.[7] Driehaus argued that Towers Watson was worth between 39% and 53% more as a standalone company than by merging with Willis Group.[8] It was also reported that Towers Watson CEO John Haley had disposed of his shares in the company in early March 2015 while the merger negotiations were ongoing.[9]
On November 18, 2015, the board of Towers Watson failed to get enough investor support for the deal, with only 40% of shareholders voting in favor of the proposed merger with Willis Group.[10] This rejection led to Willis Group increasing its special cash dividend for Towers Watson shareholders to USD $10 per share. This revised offer was approved by Towers Watson shareholders on December 11, 2015.[11]
Completion[edit]
The merger was closed on 5 January 2016 once all regulatory approvals were received. Willis Towers Watson publicly announced their name change on 5 January. It is the day 1 of the company as Willis Towers Watson.[12][13] Willis Group shareholders owned 50.1% while those of Towers Watson shareholders owned 49.9% of the combined company.[14]
On completion, Towers Watson CEO, John Haley, became the CEO, Willis Group CEO, Dominic Casserley, became the President and Deputy CEO while Willis Group Chairman, James McCann, became the chairman of the merged group with the twelve board seats shared equally between the two companies.[15]
For the first fiscal quarter of 2016, the first earnings release since the merger completed, Willis Towers Watson reported that merger and acquisition costs remain significant and are likely to total between $150 million and $175 million.[16]

Written for today’s global risk managers, general counsel, board members and executives, the FINEX Observer shares our insights into noteworthy trends, developing concerns and, most importantly, opportunities that are hidden in the financial and executive risks of today’s global business environment.
A central theme for this inaugural edition is the evolving risk of individual accountability. Regulators, investors and customers around the world are trending toward holding individuals — as opposed to corporate entities — liable for perceived wrongdoing. An understanding of this exposure and how one’s risk transfer/insurance program may respond is, therefore, essential, as is recognizing and managing other very particular and developing risks, such as transactional-related exposures and cyber-related threats.
Contents include:
Individual accountability

Protecting D&Os from “informal” investigations
Personal accountability of senior managers in the U.K.
FCA v. Macris: A problem for senior managers in the U.K.?
A conflict over privilege: The U.K. Senior Managers Regime and the legal function

Individual risks — transactions

Private vs. public D&O coverage in M&A.

Emerging risks

D&O risk in the age of cyber insecurity
Fee litigation plague spreads to universities and mid-market companies
Will emissions disclosures remain a hot D&O risk?

Insurers across the globe agree on one thing — the cost of medical care continues to rise with no light at the end of the tunnel. Drivers contributing to the bulk of the cost are hospital/inpatient services, basic medical/outpatient services, provider and employee behavior, new medical technology, and rising provider profits. The question plaguing employers remains: How can we provide effective medical benefits and promote better workforce health while also controlling costs?
How do you expect the medical trend in your overall book of business to change over the next three years compared to current rates?


The 2017 Global Medical Trends Survey Report is the latest in over a decade of research by Willis Towers Watson on global medical trends. This year, 231 insurers across 79 countries provided insights on medical costs, what is driving them and the cost management techniques employers are using to manage them. This year’s report also includes a snapshot of the U.S. medical trend drawn from other Willis Towers Watson research. Highlights from the research show:

Private medical insurance trend continues to rise globally with a projected 7.8% in 2017, up slightly from 7.3% in 2016 and 7.5% in 2015 (all weighted by GDP per capita).
More than half of health insurers globally expect trend to be higher or significantly higher over the next three years. Latin America leads all regions on trend, largely due to high inflation, while Europe continues to have the lowest trend due to the level of coverage provided through the various social security systems.
Cardiovascular disease, cancer and respiratory illness are projected by insurers worldwide to be the top three diseases for at least the next five years.
While traditional methods of cost management and cost sharing with employees continue to dominate globally, there’s been a notable increase of employers offering preventive care and empowering employees to take responsibility for their own health.
Adoption of the ICD-9 and 10 claim-coding systems has remained nearly static over the last three years. Insurers’ use of these commonly accepted systems makes it easier for multinational employers to get consistent claim data reporting and facilitate data management. However, more encouraging is the improvement in the types of claim data insurers now provide, especially to larger clients.

Press Release


            Employers’ cost to provide employee benefits has risen 24% since 2001, Willis Towers Watson analysis finds
        

            Employers now spending more on health care benefits, less on retirement benefits
        


                July 18, 2017
            

| United States
                
            




















ARLINGTON, VA, July 18, 2017 — U.S. employers’ cost to provide employee benefits, measured as a percentage of pay, increased 24% between 2001 and 2015, fueled largely by a doubling in health care benefit costs, according to a new analysis by Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ: WLTW), a leading global advisory, broking and solutions company. The analysis reveals a major shift in how employers allocate benefit dollars and prompts questions as to whether they are delivering the benefits their employees want. 
The analysis, Shifts in Benefit Allocations Among U.S. Employers, found the total cost of employer-provided benefits — health care, retirement and postretirement medical — rose from 14.8% of pay in 2001 to 18.3% of pay in 2015, a jump of 24%. During this period, health care costs for active employees more than doubled, rising from 5.7% to 11.5% of pay. Conversely, total retirement benefits, which include defined benefit (DB), defined contribution (DC) and postretirement medical plans (PRM), declined by 25% between 2001 and 2015, from 9.1% to 6.8% of pay. The analysis defines total retirement benefits as the combined value of DB, DC and PRM plans. Other benefits such as paid time off, lifestyle and flexible benefits are not included in the analysis.


“The rising cost of employee benefits remains a challenge as employers seek to get the most employee value from their pay and benefit programs,” said John Bremen, managing director, Human Capital and Benefits, Willis Towers Watson. “Beyond the overall increase, there has been a seismic shift that can be characterized as a tale of two benefit programs. Health care benefits are eating up a larger portion of dollars while the amount spent on retirement programs is on the decline. This reallocation has major implications for employers and employees alike.

Indeed, in 2001, health care costs for active employees comprised about two-fifths (42%) of benefits, while retirement benefits made up the remaining three-fifths (58%). By 2015, the ratio had flipped, with health care benefits accounting for just under two-thirds of costs (64%) and the retirement share falling to slightly more than one-third (37%).

The analysis noted much of the reduction in retirement costs during this 15-year period can be attributed to the widespread shift by employers from offering a traditional DB plan as their primary retirement vehicle, to typically replacing them with enhancements to their DC plan. While DC plan costs increased by 1.6 percentage points between 2001 and 2015, this wasn’t enough to offset the 2.9 percentage point decline in DB benefit costs.
The analysis also suggests the reallocation of retirement dollars to health care benefits might not align with employee preferences and needs. While Willis Towers Watson’s Global Benefits Attitudes Survey shows that employees value their health care benefits just as highly as their retirement benefits, many employees appear to have reached the limit of how much they are willing or able to pay for health care benefits. Additionally, many employees are worried about their current and future financial situations, and fear they won’t have saved enough for retirement and will have to work past normal retirement age.
“With the shift from DB to DC plans well established, employers may want to reevaluate the allocation of benefit dollars to better respond to employees’ needs and concerns,” said Alexa Nerdrum, senior retirement consultant at Willis Towers Watson. “This could consist of more tax-efficient saving mechanisms, such as the broader use of health savings accounts, as well as wiser spending on health care. While the solution for each organization will be unique, employers need to balance cost with the long-term returns on providing benefit packages that will be highly valued by their workers.”
About the analysis

The Willis Towers Watson analysis, Shifts in Benefit Allocations Among U.S. Employers, examined trends in employer costs for benefit plans since 2001 by examining a proprietary database of retirement and health care programs from over 500 medium and large U.S. employers.

Written for today’s global risk managers, general counsel, board members and executives, the FINEX Observer shares our insights into noteworthy trends, developing concerns and, most importantly, opportunities that are hidden in the financial and executive risks of today’s global business environment.
A central theme for this inaugural edition is the evolving risk of individual accountability. Regulators, investors and customers around the world are trending toward holding individuals — as opposed to corporate entities — liable for perceived wrongdoing. An understanding of this exposure and how one’s risk transfer/insurance program may respond is, therefore, essential, as is recognizing and managing other very particular and developing risks, such as transactional-related exposures and cyber-related threats.
Contents include:
Individual accountability

Protecting D&Os from “informal” investigations
Personal accountability of senior managers in the U.K.
FCA v. Macris: A problem for senior managers in the U.K.?
A conflict over privilege: The U.K. Senior Managers Regime and the legal function

Individual risks — transactions

Private vs. public D&O coverage in M&A.

Emerging risks

D&O risk in the age of cyber insecurity
Fee litigation plague spreads to universities and mid-market companies
Will emissions disclosures remain a hot D&O risk?

Press Release


            Employers’ cost to provide employee benefits has risen 24% since 2001, Willis Towers Watson analysis finds
        

            Employers now spending more on health care benefits, less on retirement benefits
        


                July 18, 2017
            

| United States
                
            




















ARLINGTON, VA, July 18, 2017 — U.S. employers’ cost to provide employee benefits, measured as a percentage of pay, increased 24% between 2001 and 2015, fueled largely by a doubling in health care benefit costs, according to a new analysis by Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ: WLTW), a leading global advisory, broking and solutions company. The analysis reveals a major shift in how employers allocate benefit dollars and prompts questions as to whether they are delivering the benefits their employees want. 
The analysis, Shifts in Benefit Allocations Among U.S. Employers, found the total cost of employer-provided benefits — health care, retirement and postretirement medical — rose from 14.8% of pay in 2001 to 18.3% of pay in 2015, a jump of 24%. During this period, health care costs for active employees more than doubled, rising from 5.7% to 11.5% of pay. Conversely, total retirement benefits, which include defined benefit (DB), defined contribution (DC) and postretirement medical plans (PRM), declined by 25% between 2001 and 2015, from 9.1% to 6.8% of pay. The analysis defines total retirement benefits as the combined value of DB, DC and PRM plans. Other benefits such as paid time off, lifestyle and flexible benefits are not included in the analysis.


“The rising cost of employee benefits remains a challenge as employers seek to get the most employee value from their pay and benefit programs,” said John Bremen, managing director, Human Capital and Benefits, Willis Towers Watson. “Beyond the overall increase, there has been a seismic shift that can be characterized as a tale of two benefit programs. Health care benefits are eating up a larger portion of dollars while the amount spent on retirement programs is on the decline. This reallocation has major implications for employers and employees alike.

Indeed, in 2001, health care costs for active employees comprised about two-fifths (42%) of benefits, while retirement benefits made up the remaining three-fifths (58%). By 2015, the ratio had flipped, with health care benefits accounting for just under two-thirds of costs (64%) and the retirement share falling to slightly more than one-third (37%).

The analysis noted much of the reduction in retirement costs during this 15-year period can be attributed to the widespread shift by employers from offering a traditional DB plan as their primary retirement vehicle, to typically replacing them with enhancements to their DC plan. While DC plan costs increased by 1.6 percentage points between 2001 and 2015, this wasn’t enough to offset the 2.9 percentage point decline in DB benefit costs.
The analysis also suggests the reallocation of retirement dollars to health care benefits might not align with employee preferences and needs. While Willis Towers Watson’s Global Benefits Attitudes Survey shows that employees value their health care benefits just as highly as their retirement benefits, many employees appear to have reached the limit of how much they are willing or able to pay for health care benefits. Additionally, many employees are worried about their current and future financial situations, and fear they won’t have saved enough for retirement and will have to work past normal retirement age.
“With the shift from DB to DC plans well established, employers may want to reevaluate the allocation of benefit dollars to better respond to employees’ needs and concerns,” said Alexa Nerdrum, senior retirement consultant at Willis Towers Watson. “This could consist of more tax-efficient saving mechanisms, such as the broader use of health savings accounts, as well as wiser spending on health care. While the solution for each organization will be unique, employers need to balance cost with the long-term returns on providing benefit packages that will be highly valued by their workers.”
About the analysis

The Willis Towers Watson analysis, Shifts in Benefit Allocations Among U.S. Employers, examined trends in employer costs for benefit plans since 2001 by examining a proprietary database of retirement and health care programs from over 500 medium and large U.S. employers.

LONDON and NEW YORK, July  19, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Willis Towers Watson, the leading global advisory, broking and solutions company, has launched a new cyber work diagnostic tool designed to help organizations assess their cyber readiness with emphases on talent management, emerging skills and roles and defining the requirements of cyber work.
Roles in cybersecurity are some of the most in-demand across all industries, with premium jobs available for employees with the emerging skillset. A recent Willis Towers Watson survey of global company cybersecurity functions shows that over 84% of such functions are anticipating headcount growth. Willis Towers Watson found that companies can benefit from having a deeper understanding of organizational priorities when recruiting for positions in cyber, as well as understanding alternatives and having a comprehensive view of skills gaps and talent deficits. With the launch of the cyber work diagnostic tool, organizations will be able to address the questions asked by Boards and management about their cybersecurity readiness. CISOs, and cybersecurity leads with HR, participate in a workshop series to assess levels of work and organizational needs across their company. This includes a complete workforce review to assess requisite skills as well as a plan to identify talent gaps within the organization and relative to benchmark. The tool then addresses a full spectrum of options and provides actionable recommendations for executives to address cyber work readiness. Core elements include: Application of a Work Model that defines the nature of cybersecurity work and how that work grows (within CISO, IT or other divisions covering cyber work for alignment)Key and emerging skills required for cybersecurity readiness and identification of critical talent gapsAlternatives for addressing talent deficitsPrioritized action plan for addressing talent priorities and career enablement  Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving threat that requires organizational readiness from an effective structure and skilled talent base. It is no longer solely the job of risk and IT departments to handle cyber exposure, but essential for human capital experts to assess organizational culture, employee engagement and identify talent and educational gaps to protect against cyber threats. “When it comes to corporate cybersecurity needs, organizations must give more focus to the people element of cyber risk, particularly within IT functions where vulnerabilities can exist if the right skills and talent are not managing the day-to-day technology of the organization,” said Tracey Malcolm, Willis Towers Watson Future of Work Leader.  “Willis Towers Watson is combining our deep expertise in both talent and rewards programs and cyber risk  to address these issues, as it is essential that companies have more sophisticated talent strategies in place to identify vulnerabilities, boost their resiliency and improve employee ‘cyber IQ’.” About Willis Towers Watson Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) is a leading global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth. With roots dating to 1828, Willis Towers Watson has 40,000 employees serving more than 140 countries.

LONDON and NEW YORK, July  19, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Willis Towers Watson, the leading global advisory, broking and solutions company, has launched a new cyber work diagnostic tool designed to help organizations assess their cyber readiness with emphases on talent management, emerging skills and roles and defining the requirements of cyber work.
Roles in cybersecurity are some of the most in-demand across all industries, with premium jobs available for employees with the emerging skillset. A recent Willis Towers Watson survey of global company cybersecurity functions shows that over 84% of such functions are anticipating headcount growth. Willis Towers Watson found that companies can benefit from having a deeper understanding of organizational priorities when recruiting for positions in cyber, as well as understanding alternatives and having a comprehensive view of skills gaps and talent deficits. With the launch of the cyber work diagnostic tool, organizations will be able to address the questions asked by Boards and management about their cybersecurity readiness. CISOs, and cybersecurity leads with HR, participate in a workshop series to assess levels of work and organizational needs across their company. This includes a complete workforce review to assess requisite skills as well as a plan to identify talent gaps within the organization and relative to benchmark. The tool then addresses a full spectrum of options and provides actionable recommendations for executives to address cyber work readiness. Core elements include: Application of a Work Model that defines the nature of cybersecurity work and how that work grows (within CISO, IT or other divisions covering cyber work for alignment)Key and emerging skills required for cybersecurity readiness and identification of critical talent gapsAlternatives for addressing talent deficitsPrioritized action plan for addressing talent priorities and career enablement  Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving threat that requires organizational readiness from an effective structure and skilled talent base. It is no longer solely the job of risk and IT departments to handle cyber exposure, but essential for human capital experts to assess organizational culture, employee engagement and identify talent and educational gaps to protect against cyber threats. “When it comes to corporate cybersecurity needs, organizations must give more focus to the people element of cyber risk, particularly within IT functions where vulnerabilities can exist if the right skills and talent are not managing the day-to-day technology of the organization,” said Tracey Malcolm, Willis Towers Watson Future of Work Leader.  “Willis Towers Watson is combining our deep expertise in both talent and rewards programs and cyber risk  to address these issues, as it is essential that companies have more sophisticated talent strategies in place to identify vulnerabilities, boost their resiliency and improve employee ‘cyber IQ’.” About Willis Towers Watson Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) is a leading global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth. With roots dating to 1828, Willis Towers Watson has 40,000 employees serving more than 140 countries.

People are the next frontier in cyber risk management, according to Willis Towers Watson’s U.S. and UK employer and employee Cyber Risk surveys.  View the content as an interactive PDF - Download.

Introduction
One in five U.S. and UK organizations that participated in the Willis Towers Watson 2017 Cyber Risk Surveys reported that their organizations have suffered a cyber breach in the last year with 6% of those incidents having been significant, consistent with publicized recent large cyber breaches.  
Two thirds of U.S. companies, and just under half of UK businesses, see cybersecurity as a fundamental challenge to their organization as reflected in the priority given to cybersecurity — 85% of U.S. employers, and 72% in the UK, regard it as a top priority.
To date, technological responses have led the way. However, growing recognition of the human element in cyber risk means that most companies that responded to the survey expect to focus more heavily on operating procedures and creating a more cyber-savvy workforce in the months and years to come. 
And with good reason it would seem. Willis Towers Watson’s recent Cyber Claims Database shows that by far the largest proportion of cyber claims reported to insurers stems from employees’ actions, or collective inaction. 
Figure 1: Percentage of U.S. cyber insurance claims by breach type


The concurrent employee view of the survey appears to offer some explanation for the claim statistics, by showing a disconnect between cyber awareness and accountability of the workforce and organization’s views of their preparedness.
Toward a culture of cybersecurity
While most companies feel they are on the right track in terms of data privacy and information security, many say they are looking to create a culture of cybersecurity in their organization. Most admit, however, to being currently on the lower rungs of the ladder to reach this goal, although they have aspirations to climb it quickly. Over half have no formally articulated cyber strategy now, but over 80% want to be in a position of having embedded cyber risk management within the company culture within three years
So, how will they get there?
The unequivocal answer on both sides of the Atlantic is by making more progress on improving business and operating processes and on addressing factors tied to human error or actions (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Progress made in respective areas to mitigate the vulnerability of a cyber-attack over the last/next three years.


Business-related activities expected to figure prominently in companies’ plans include more stringent reviews of contractors and third-party suppliers and testing of emergency response plans. To offset risk, a large majority of companies are also reviewing or adding to their cyber insurance coverage as the available market has expanded, with the higher levels of activity seen in the U.S. so far reflecting the fact that American companies have historically bought more of this type of cover, compared to European companies that have tended to focus more on business interruption and continuity. Fifty four percent of U.S. companies have added to or enhanced cyber coverage in the last two years, compared to 26% of UK companies. Notably, however, an additional 45% of the UK businesses surveyed said they expect to review cyber insurance cover in the next two years (before taking into account the recent WannaCry ransomware incident that has accelerated inquiries from UK businesses about cyber insurance).
   Two thirds of companies on both sides of
the Atlantic have also already taken steps
to centralize data privacy and information
security.

Two thirds of companies on both sides of the Atlantic have also already taken steps to centralize data privacy and information security. This may account for most companies believing they have or need appropriate levels of corporate support and clear lines of responsibility for data privacy and information security — leaving more to do on supporting processes and employee engagement.
Among the specific people-related actions that companies expect to take in the next couple of years, training programs for both employees and contract workers frequently top the agenda. This is particularly the case in the UK, where the survey figures indicate there is some catching up to do relative to the U.S. on the people-related risks. For example, UK employers believe that over 60% of their employees don’t understand cyber risks to a great or moderate extent. This compares with 34% of U.S. employers who feel the same. These figures allude to the fact that organizations, even across the Atlantic, are at different stages of their cyber resiliency journeys. The difference in results also highlights the need for HR and risk management functions to work more closely together on cyber risk mitigation strategies, something that only a third of companies reported they are currently doing.  
Does employee behavior match company policy?
As companies adapt their cybersecurity approaches to more actively address people risks, they will of course need employees to step up to the plate and play their part.
Combining the results of our employee and employer surveys shows they have some work to do here, including doing more in some cases to create and maintain an environment in which employees are comfortable reporting data privacy and security incidents.
 One dangerous but apparently common belief
among employees is that the company’s IT and
security systems are the ultimate protector.

One dangerous but apparently common belief among employees is that the company’s IT and security systems are the ultimate protector. Even though a significant majority of companies feel they are doing what they need to in setting up and communicating robust protection systems, policies and processes, the message does not always resonate, judging by some current employee behaviors. Around 40% use a work computer or cellular device to access confidential company information and discuss work-related topics in public places. About 30% admit to logging in to a work device on an unsecured public network or using a work computer in public settings. Roughly 25% take confidential paper files home and use unapproved devices to do work at home. Some employee attitudes toward opening email attachments, changing passwords regularly and sharing personal information, such as employer name and job title, on social media sites may also leave companies more vulnerable, particularly to social engineering, where cyber criminals use impersonation techniques to trick employees into divulging confidential information or data.
Given these findings, there certainly seems to be a need to more closely assess the reasons why employees continue to engage in risk producing behaviors. 
A root cause may be that nearly half of both the U.S. and UK employees surveyed said they spent less than 30 minutes on data protection and information security training last year. Around 60% said they had only completed any training because it was a company requirement, although many claimed to have derived some knowledge and benefit from whatever they had done. 
Figure 3. Time spent on cyber training in the last year

Segmenting employees
Such results inevitably lead to employees with different levels of understanding, accountability or engagement with cyber risk management. It may benefit companies, therefore, to segment their awareness training and other learning tools in order to refine an approach for different groups of employees/workers. For example, executive-level employees may need more training on confidential corporate information and use of company devices while traveling in foreign countries, while HR training may focus primarily on protection of employee data.
From the responses to a range of questions on the employee survey, we have defined four types of employees according to how they use technology at work or at home. 

Alert – those who protect personal information in daily life and are aware of information security at work.
Comply – those who follow data/information protection policies at work but are careless on a personal level.
Ignore – those who pay attention to protecting personal information, but who don’t act with the same care at work.
Unconcerned – those whose technology usage patterns at home and work may lead to potential cyber risks.

The percentage of survey respondents falling into each category in the U.S. and UK was remarkably similar, with just over a third in each country meeting the ‘Alert’ criteria. Furthermore, the behavior of each group was found to be strongly linked to training time, type of work and age (Figure 4). For example, IT and non-IT staff have very different knowledge and behaviors, and hence different training needs. Similarly, younger employees in general report more risky behaviors and a more cavalier approach to technology and compliance, suggesting that companies may need a different approach to engaging and educating Generation Y groups in cyber risk mitigation.
Figure 4. How employee characteristics affect cyber risk attitudes

Conclusion: beyond technology
The findings from our surveys signal a shift in cybersecurity strategies. Although companies still think there is more work to do on technological responses, most feel they are broadly on track and making progress in addressing potential weaknesses in their IT infrastructure.
Attention is now increasingly turning to the operational- and people-related risks that cyber claims experience shows leave companies exposed to cyber risk even with state-of-the-art technology strategies.
There is growing impetus behind the view that building effective cyber resilience has to have its roots within the organization culture and its people. Solutions are likely to be complex and multidimensional, as is always the case for any kind of cultural change. Certainly, companies may have to adapt their operations to the constantly changing nature of cyber threats. Nor should they ignore the expanding risk mitigation options available through the insurance market. But employers will increasingly look to foster a more cyber-savvy workforce, including the use of innovative employee engagement, talent management and reward strategies, to fortify their cyber security posture. 
About the surveys
Willis Towers Watson carried out web-based surveys with a combined 163 U.S. and UK employers, and with over 2,000 employees in each country, a quarter of whom work in a corporate IT function.

People are the next frontier in cyber risk management, according to Willis Towers Watson’s U.S. and UK employer and employee Cyber Risk surveys.  View the content as an interactive PDF - Download.

Introduction
One in five U.S. and UK organizations that participated in the Willis Towers Watson 2017 Cyber Risk Surveys reported that their organizations have suffered a cyber breach in the last year with 6% of those incidents having been significant, consistent with publicized recent large cyber breaches.  
Two thirds of U.S. companies, and just under half of UK businesses, see cybersecurity as a fundamental challenge to their organization as reflected in the priority given to cybersecurity — 85% of U.S. employers, and 72% in the UK, regard it as a top priority.
To date, technological responses have led the way. However, growing recognition of the human element in cyber risk means that most companies that responded to the survey expect to focus more heavily on operating procedures and creating a more cyber-savvy workforce in the months and years to come. 
And with good reason it would seem. Willis Towers Watson’s recent Cyber Claims Database shows that by far the largest proportion of cyber claims reported to insurers stems from employees’ actions, or collective inaction. 
Figure 1: Percentage of U.S. cyber insurance claims by breach type


The concurrent employee view of the survey appears to offer some explanation for the claim statistics, by showing a disconnect between cyber awareness and accountability of the workforce and organization’s views of their preparedness.
Toward a culture of cybersecurity
While most companies feel they are on the right track in terms of data privacy and information security, many say they are looking to create a culture of cybersecurity in their organization. Most admit, however, to being currently on the lower rungs of the ladder to reach this goal, although they have aspirations to climb it quickly. Over half have no formally articulated cyber strategy now, but over 80% want to be in a position of having embedded cyber risk management within the company culture within three years
So, how will they get there?
The unequivocal answer on both sides of the Atlantic is by making more progress on improving business and operating processes and on addressing factors tied to human error or actions (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Progress made in respective areas to mitigate the vulnerability of a cyber-attack over the last/next three years.


Business-related activities expected to figure prominently in companies’ plans include more stringent reviews of contractors and third-party suppliers and testing of emergency response plans. To offset risk, a large majority of companies are also reviewing or adding to their cyber insurance coverage as the available market has expanded, with the higher levels of activity seen in the U.S. so far reflecting the fact that American companies have historically bought more of this type of cover, compared to European companies that have tended to focus more on business interruption and continuity. Fifty four percent of U.S. companies have added to or enhanced cyber coverage in the last two years, compared to 26% of UK companies. Notably, however, an additional 45% of the UK businesses surveyed said they expect to review cyber insurance cover in the next two years (before taking into account the recent WannaCry ransomware incident that has accelerated inquiries from UK businesses about cyber insurance).
   Two thirds of companies on both sides of
the Atlantic have also already taken steps
to centralize data privacy and information
security.

Two thirds of companies on both sides of the Atlantic have also already taken steps to centralize data privacy and information security. This may account for most companies believing they have or need appropriate levels of corporate support and clear lines of responsibility for data privacy and information security — leaving more to do on supporting processes and employee engagement.
Among the specific people-related actions that companies expect to take in the next couple of years, training programs for both employees and contract workers frequently top the agenda. This is particularly the case in the UK, where the survey figures indicate there is some catching up to do relative to the U.S. on the people-related risks. For example, UK employers believe that over 60% of their employees don’t understand cyber risks to a great or moderate extent. This compares with 34% of U.S. employers who feel the same. These figures allude to the fact that organizations, even across the Atlantic, are at different stages of their cyber resiliency journeys. The difference in results also highlights the need for HR and risk management functions to work more closely together on cyber risk mitigation strategies, something that only a third of companies reported they are currently doing.  
Does employee behavior match company policy?
As companies adapt their cybersecurity approaches to more actively address people risks, they will of course need employees to step up to the plate and play their part.
Combining the results of our employee and employer surveys shows they have some work to do here, including doing more in some cases to create and maintain an environment in which employees are comfortable reporting data privacy and security incidents.
 One dangerous but apparently common belief
among employees is that the company’s IT and
security systems are the ultimate protector.

One dangerous but apparently common belief among employees is that the company’s IT and security systems are the ultimate protector. Even though a significant majority of companies feel they are doing what they need to in setting up and communicating robust protection systems, policies and processes, the message does not always resonate, judging by some current employee behaviors. Around 40% use a work computer or cellular device to access confidential company information and discuss work-related topics in public places. About 30% admit to logging in to a work device on an unsecured public network or using a work computer in public settings. Roughly 25% take confidential paper files home and use unapproved devices to do work at home. Some employee attitudes toward opening email attachments, changing passwords regularly and sharing personal information, such as employer name and job title, on social media sites may also leave companies more vulnerable, particularly to social engineering, where cyber criminals use impersonation techniques to trick employees into divulging confidential information or data.
Given these findings, there certainly seems to be a need to more closely assess the reasons why employees continue to engage in risk producing behaviors. 
A root cause may be that nearly half of both the U.S. and UK employees surveyed said they spent less than 30 minutes on data protection and information security training last year. Around 60% said they had only completed any training because it was a company requirement, although many claimed to have derived some knowledge and benefit from whatever they had done. 
Figure 3. Time spent on cyber training in the last year

Segmenting employees
Such results inevitably lead to employees with different levels of understanding, accountability or engagement with cyber risk management. It may benefit companies, therefore, to segment their awareness training and other learning tools in order to refine an approach for different groups of employees/workers. For example, executive-level employees may need more training on confidential corporate information and use of company devices while traveling in foreign countries, while HR training may focus primarily on protection of employee data.
From the responses to a range of questions on the employee survey, we have defined four types of employees according to how they use technology at work or at home. 

Alert – those who protect personal information in daily life and are aware of information security at work.
Comply – those who follow data/information protection policies at work but are careless on a personal level.
Ignore – those who pay attention to protecting personal information, but who don’t act with the same care at work.
Unconcerned – those whose technology usage patterns at home and work may lead to potential cyber risks.

The percentage of survey respondents falling into each category in the U.S. and UK was remarkably similar, with just over a third in each country meeting the ‘Alert’ criteria. Furthermore, the behavior of each group was found to be strongly linked to training time, type of work and age (Figure 4). For example, IT and non-IT staff have very different knowledge and behaviors, and hence different training needs. Similarly, younger employees in general report more risky behaviors and a more cavalier approach to technology and compliance, suggesting that companies may need a different approach to engaging and educating Generation Y groups in cyber risk mitigation.
Figure 4. How employee characteristics affect cyber risk attitudes

Conclusion: beyond technology
The findings from our surveys signal a shift in cybersecurity strategies. Although companies still think there is more work to do on technological responses, most feel they are broadly on track and making progress in addressing potential weaknesses in their IT infrastructure.
Attention is now increasingly turning to the operational- and people-related risks that cyber claims experience shows leave companies exposed to cyber risk even with state-of-the-art technology strategies.
There is growing impetus behind the view that building effective cyber resilience has to have its roots within the organization culture and its people. Solutions are likely to be complex and multidimensional, as is always the case for any kind of cultural change. Certainly, companies may have to adapt their operations to the constantly changing nature of cyber threats. Nor should they ignore the expanding risk mitigation options available through the insurance market. But employers will increasingly look to foster a more cyber-savvy workforce, including the use of innovative employee engagement, talent management and reward strategies, to fortify their cyber security posture. 
About the surveys
Willis Towers Watson carried out web-based surveys with a combined 163 U.S. and UK employers, and with over 2,000 employees in each country, a quarter of whom work in a corporate IT function.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
