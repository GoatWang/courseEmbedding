CHARLESTON, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Blackbaud, Inc. (Nasdaq: BLKB), 
      a leading global provider of software and services designed for 
      nonprofits, today announced that Michael P. Gianoni has been named 
      president and chief executive officer, effective January 13, 2014. 
      Gianoni will also join the Blackbaud Board of Directors, effective upon 
      becoming chief executive officer. Anthony Boor, who has served as 
      interim president and chief executive officer since August 31, 2013, 
      will maintain that role until January 13, 2014, after which he will 
      continue to serve as chief financial officer and senior vice president, 
      finance and administration.
    


      Gianoni, 52, brings extensive experience critical to Blackbaud’s growth, 
      operational excellence and market leadership goals. Most recently, he 
      served as executive vice president and group president, Financial 
      Institutions Group at Fiserv, Inc. (Nasdaq: FISV), a leading global 
      provider of financial services technology solutions. He 
      previously served as president of the Investment Services division at 
      Fiserv, where he was responsible for product, technology, sales, 
      finance, operations and strategy.
    

      “After conducting a thorough search process, we are excited to announce 
      Mike's appointment as president and CEO of Blackbaud,” said Andrew 
      Leitch, chairman of the Blackbaud Board of Directors. “His significant 
      experience and expertise in software solutions and product development 
      make him the ideal candidate to lead Blackbaud during its next phase of 
      growth. In addition to his extensive industry background, he has a 
      proven track record of delivering operational excellence and scaling a 
      technology business.
    

      “On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Tony for his dedication 
      to the team as interim CEO. We look forward to his continued 
      contributions in the coming months in this role and as chief financial 
      officer. Mike’s skills, coupled with Tony’s financial acumen, together 
      with the rest of the management team, will help guide the company to 
      further enhance innovation, simplify and strengthen our product 
      portfolio, respond to the market demand for SaaS technology and improve 
      operational excellence while delivering greater value to both our 
      customers and shareholders.”
    

      Gianoni joined Fiserv as part of its acquisition of CheckFree, where he 
      served as executive vice president and general manager of CheckFree 
      Investment Services. He spent 11 years at DST Systems Inc. where he led 
      various divisions focused on developing new platforms while ensuring 
      stronger operational controls. Earlier in his career, Gianoni worked at 
      Applications Systems Group, Sequent Computer Systems, Wang Laboratories, 
      U.S. Design Corporation and Canberra Industries.
    

      “It is a privilege to join the Blackbaud team at such an exciting time 
      in the company’s growth,” said Gianoni. “Blackbaud has a rich history of 
      supporting the missions of nonprofit organizations, and I look forward 
      to further extending the company’s contributions to this vital sector 
      and building on its track record of success.”
    

      Gianoni received his associate degree in electrical engineering at 
      Waterbury State Technical College, his bachelor’s degree with a business 
      concentration from Charter Oak State College and his masters of business 
      administration degree from the University of New Haven. He will be based 
      out of Blackbaud’s Charleston headquarters.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

 Blackbaud appoints new CEO
Blackbaud
November 14, 2013 







Blackbaud has announced that Michael P. Gianoni has been named president and chief executive officer, effective January 13, 2014. Gianoni will also join the Blackbaud Board of Directors, effective upon becoming chief executive officer. Anthony Boor, who has served as interim president and chief executive officer since August 31, 2013, will maintain that role until January 13, 2014, after which he will continue to serve as chief financial officer and senior vice president, finance and administration.
Gianoni, 52, brings extensive experience critical to Blackbaud’s growth, operational excellence and market leadership goals. Most recently, he served as executive vice president and group president, Financial Institutions Group at Fiserv, Inc. (Nasdaq: FISV), a leading global provider of financial services technology solutions. He previously served as president of the Investment Services division at Fiserv, where he was responsible for product, technology, sales, finance, operations and strategy.
“After conducting a thorough search process, we are excited to announce Mike’s appointment as president and CEO of Blackbaud,” said Andrew Leitch, chairman of the Blackbaud Board of Directors. “His significant experience and expertise in software solutions and product development make him the ideal candidate to lead Blackbaud during its next phase of growth. In addition to his extensive industry background, he has a proven track record of delivering operational excellence and scaling a technology business.
“On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Tony for his dedication to the team as interim CEO. We look forward to his continued contributions in the coming months in this role and as chief financial officer. Mike’s skills, coupled with Tony’s financial acumen, together with the rest of the management team, will help guide the company to further enhance innovation, simplify and strengthen our product portfolio, respond to the market demand for SaaS technology and improve operational excellence while delivering greater value to both our customers and shareholders.”
Gianoni joined Fiserv as part of its acquisition of CheckFree, where he served as executive vice president and general manager of CheckFree Investment Services. He spent 11 years at DST Systems Inc. where he led various divisions focused on developing new platforms while ensuring stronger operational controls. Earlier in his career, Gianoni worked at Applications Systems Group, Sequent Computer Systems, Wang Laboratories, U.S. Design Corporation and Canberra Industries.
“It is a privilege to join the Blackbaud team at such an exciting time in the company’s growth,” said Gianoni. “Blackbaud has a rich history of supporting the missions of nonprofit organizations, and I look forward to further extending the company’s contributions to this vital sector and building on its track record of success.”
Gianoni received his associate degree in electrical engineering at Waterbury State Technical College, his bachelor’s degree with a business concentration from Charter Oak State College and his masters of business administration degree from the University of New Haven. He will be based out of Blackbaud’s Charleston headquarters.
