It looked great when we first received it. However after a couple vacuums the edges are coming undone. I expected it to be better quality with Home Depot putting there name by it.

        Great rug, but gets very dirty easily.
This rug is amazing, however the white colors show dirt too easily. I have it in my office here in Hawaii and the white parts of the "G" are already turning orange after a week or two. Might be permanently stained. Looks awesome though!

EVGA GTX 1080 FTW DT overview




1Description







Based on NVIDIA's Pascal architecture, the EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 FTW DT GAMING Graphics Card provides major improvements in performance, memory bandwidth, and power efficiency over its predecessor, the high-performance Maxwell architecture. It also introduces innovative graphics features and technologies that redefine the computer as the platform for playing AAA games and taking full advantage of virtual reality via NVIDIA VRWorks. The front panel of the card features a variety of outputs. There are three DisplayPort 1.4 outputs in addition to an HDMI 2.0b output and a DVI-D Dual-Link output. The GTX 1080 is not just about high-resolution gaming. Computationally intensive programs can utilize the GPU's 2560 cores to accelerate tasks using CUDA or other APIs. This GPU has an adjustable RGB LED that can be controlled in EVGA Precision X OC. For cooling, EVGA implemented ACX 3.0 cooling technology. It has more heatpipes and a larger copper contact area for cooler operation as well as optimized fan curve for even quieter gaming. The dual fans feature optimized swept fan blades, double ball bearings, and an extreme low power motor, delivering more air flow with less power and unlocking additional power for the GPU.




VRWorks 


										
												VRWorks Graphics includes a simultaneous multi-projection capability that renders natively to the unique dimensions of VR displays instead of traditional 2D monitors. It also renders geometry for the left and right eyes simultaneously in a single pass.   VRWorks Audio uses the NVIDIA OptiX ray-tracing engine to trace the path of sounds across an environment in real-time, fully reflecting the size, shape, and material of the virtual world.   NVIDIA PhysX for VR detects when a hand controller interacts with a virtual object, and enables the game engine to provide a physically accurate visual and haptic response. It also models the physical behavior of the virtual world around the user so that all interactions -- whether an explosion or a hand splashing through water -- behave as if in the real world.
										  
										 


NVIDIA Ansel 


										
												With Ansel, gamers can compose the gameplay shots they want, pointing the camera in any direction and from any vantage point within a gaming world. They can capture screenshots at up to 32 times the screen resolution, and then zoom in where they choose without losing fidelity. With photo-filters, they can add effects in real-time before taking the shot. And they can capture 360-degree stereo photospheres for viewing in a VR headset or Google Cardboard.
										  
										 


SLI Ready 


										
												With a compatible motherboard and a connecting bracket, two or more NVIDIA GPUs of the same model can combine processing power using NVIDIA's Scalable Link Interface (SLI). How the cards work together can be customized to suit your preferences. Alternate frame rendering has each alternating card prepare the next frame, essentially multiplying the capabilities of a single card's maximum capable frame rate output. Each card in the configuration can also be used to improve anti-aliasing by being able to process an image in parallel with the other cards before filtering out jagged edges.   NVIDIA's SLI HB bridge doubles the available transfer bandwidth compared to the NVIDIA Maxwell architecture. Delivering smooth gameplay, it's an effective way to enjoy surround gaming and it's only compatible with the GeForce GTX 1080 graphics cards.   Note: The benefits of SLI will vary based on component configuration.



CUDA 


										
												NVIDIA's parallel computing platform which enables an increase in computing performance by harnessing the parallel nature of GPU processing. CUDA compatible applications can assign intensive parallel computing tasks, such as real-time video rendering, to the GPU to process, freeing up the computer's CPU to run other tasks.
										  
										 


G-SYNC Ready 


										
												When used with a monitor that has G-SYNC hardware installed, the monitor's refresh rate will sync and lock with the graphics card's output frame rate. Establishing this sync removes tearing and stuttering which can result from conventional fixed screen refresh rates, especially important for gaming in stereoscopic 3D. An additional benefit of G-SYNC is reduced lag so gamers will benefit from the improved command response time as well.
										  
										 


NVIDIA GPU Boost 3.0 


										
												Boosts the card's clock speed in real-time based on the target temperature. If the card is running below the set target temperature, GPU Boost 3.0 will increase the clock speed to improve performance. The target temperature can be reset depending on your preference so you can have the card run more quietly for everyday tasks and older games, and run at full tilt during intense high-resolution gaming sequences.

                    A firmware upgrade transforms this audio system into a completely new product
        
        
                    Image: Hugh Threlfall
            Where to findAbout £130; Google for prices/stockists and see www.jawbone.com.December 21 2011

                            / Jonathan MargolisEmailTwitterPinterestFacebookBack in March, I told you about the best portable audio system I’d come across for filling a hotel room with your own high-quality sounds from your laptop or portable music player. The Jambox, by Bluetooth headset specialist Jawbone, has been my constant business-travelling companion for the whole of 2011 – despite some annoying issues I’ve had connecting by Bluetooth to a MacBook. (There is no such problem with a PC laptop, iPhone or iPad, by the way.)AdvertisementNow I don’t normally reprise products I’ve looked at previously, unless they’ve undergone major revision. And apart from this Jambox being red, while the one I showed you earlier was grey, you might imagine that nothing else has changed. But as the iPhone 4S showed us when it was launched and everyone expected an iPhone 5, sometimes the same exterior can hide greatly improved innards. AdvertisementIn the Jambox’s case, this involves a comprehensive firmware upgrade that has made it in effect a completely new product. The software, called LiveAudio – which you can download if you already have a Jambox – changes the already impressive sound to something almost weird, it’s so spatial and 3-D. It does run a bit more quietly, so you can turn LiveAudio off if it’s just volume you’re after.AdvertisementShare this articleEmailTwitterPinterestFacebookRelatedAudio/VisualJawbone JamboxSee alsoiDevice accessoriesJawboneSpeakersWirelessAdvertisementLoad next articleLoadingFinancial Times - How to Spend itCloseSearch How to Spend itSearch
