Share Article


















Procura USA Holdings, Inc., a leading global provider of software and solutions to home health agencies, community care agencies, hospice and residential care agencies, announced today that it has named Christopher Junker as the new President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, including all related subsidiaries.








I’m extremely excited to be part of a company that, in the past year alone, has realized significant growth, and whose strong foundation is built upon a 22 year legacy in the marketplace.


Victoria, BC (PRWEB)
May 05, 2015
 Procura USA Holdings, Inc., a leading global provider of software and solutions to home health agencies, community care agencies, hospice and residential care agencies, announced today that it has named Christopher Junker as the new President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, including all related subsidiaries.  Chris, an experienced software CEO with a proven track record in expanding innovation and driving quality development at high growth software companies, replaces Scott Overhill, who served as Procura’s CEO since April, 2014.
Mr. Junker will be called upon to drive Procura’s organic and transaction growth objectives, both in North America and abroad. “Procura’s multi-platform, multi-lingual solutions, including its web-based, SaaS solution, ContinuLink, are uniquely suited to support the exploding demand for quality, non-hospital based healthcare.  With the support of the Company’s strong leadership team and valued employees, we will ensure that our innovative product offerings and revenue growth remain superior,” indicated Chris.   
“The board set out to find an experienced CEO that could lead us through this period of unparalleled growth and product line expansion, while maintaining focus on the customer experience,” says Mike Greenough, Chairman of the Board, Procura.  “I am confident we have identified the right person as Chris has an impressive career and brings a wealth of sales and product experience to this role.  He has consistently achieved exceptional results by focusing on the customer as well as product content and performance, creating an enhanced user experience.” Added Mr. Greenough: “As we continue to expand our product offerings, including the delivery of superior cloud based applications for our customers, we have asked Mr. Overhill to return to his former role as Chief Technology Officer and to spearhead our product innovation and quality initiatives. His unmatched technical and industry expertise will help ensure that Procura maintains its leadership position. ” 
Added Chris: “I’m extremely excited to be part of a company that, in the past year alone, has realized significant growth, and whose strong foundation is built upon a 22 year legacy in the marketplace.  The continuing evolution of the healthcare industry provides multiple opportunities for Procura’s future growth and expansion worldwide, and my goal is to continue to advance while consistently bringing additional innovative, cutting edge technology to market.”
Mr. Junker has over 20 years of experience in enterprise software with a focus in billing, content management, and big data. Most recently, Chris held the CEO post at Microsystems, Inc., a document analysis software company serving the legal and life science industries.  He also served as the CEO at SpringCM, a cloud enterprise content management firm and Fios, Inc. (now DTI), a cloud e-discovery software firm.  Prior to that, Chris held the position of general manager and worldwide vice president of sales for the legal and professional services industry at Interwoven, which was acquired in 2009 by Autonomy Corporation Plc in a transaction valued at approximately $800 million. At Interwoven, Chris led the company through 21 consecutive quarters of year-over-year revenue growth and operating margin expansion.
In his ongoing role as CTO, Scott Overhill will focus on product strengthening and development.  “I am extremely pleased that Chris has decided to join the Procura team and my goal will be to ensure we are providing world class products and service to our customers, while working closely with Chris to expand our global foot print,” indicated Mr. Overhill.

VITAS Hospice and Palliative Care

VITAS Healthcare serves people with serious illnesses.
Our hospice care and palliative services provide comfort to patients and preserve dignity in the face of terminal illness. 
Hospice Care
When medical treatments can no longer cure a disease, our interdisciplinary team of hospice care professionals still can do a great deal to control pain, reduce anxiety and offer needed spiritual and emotional support to patients and their families. We introduce gradual, non-crisis transitions from curative care to hospice care. There is time to talk, to try treatments and therapies, and to ensure comfort and dignity. 
Hospice care at VITAS is focused on serving and comforting patients and families at the end of their lives. We offer a range of hospice care services, including music therapy and pet visits. To learn more, find your local VITAS hospice provider. Additionally, VITAS offers bereavement support & grief resources to support loved ones.
What You Should Know About Hospice:

VITAS brings hospice care services to the patient's home, whether a private residence, long term care community or nursing home
If care cannot be managed at home, patients receive inpatient hospice care until symptoms are under control
Telecare responds to patient and family questions 24 hours a day, and can dispatch a team member to the patient's bedside if necessary

Palliative Care 
If you or a loved one has a serious illness, palliative care can help. A complement to the medical treatments your doctor is already providing, palliative care helps manage pain, alleviates symptoms to improve quality of life and offers emotional and spiritual support as you deal with difficult medical issues.

Medicare & the Costs of Hospice




Medicare & the Cost of Hospice
Does Medicare cover hospice?
Hospice is covered by Medicare, Medicaid/Medi-Cal and most private insurance
Congress established the Medicare hospice benefit in 1982 to provide patients with life-limiting illnesses compassionate, coordinated care to manage the symptoms and consequences of their disease. Medicare's hospice benefit was designed to help terminally ill patients with the often significant expenses incurred at the end of life, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, medical equipment and supplies, hospital copayments and grief support for the family.
While the benefit offered a lifeline to terminally ill patients covered by Medicare (later extended to Medicaid/Medi-Cal and to most private insurance plans), it enacted a number of requirements that providers must meet in order to be certified as hospices by Medicare and qualify for payment from Medicare. These include the mandate to provide or manage all services needed to manage the terminal illness.

Other features of the Medicare hospice benefit include a limit on the proportion of days of care a hospice can provide in an inpatient setting rather than the patient’s home; a global cap on total average payment per patient; and a requirement that dedicated and trained volunteers must contribute at least 5 percent of the hospice provider’s services.



Medicare Hospice Patient Eligibility 
For Medicare hospice coverage, a patient must:

Be eligible for Medicare Part A
Consent to hospice care and agree that he/she wishes to receive “palliative, not curative care”
Be certified by his/her physician and the hospice medical director as having a “medical prognosis that his/her life expectancy is six months or less if the illness runs its normal course”
Continue to have a six-months-or-less prognosis, although some individual patients may receive hospice services for longer than six months as long as they continue to have a limited life expectancy throughout that time

VITAS hospice patients who meet those qualifications will have their hospice care covered by Medicare. For care unrelated to a patient’s terminal illness, Medicare and Medicaid continue to provide their usual benefits. Since each private insurance company has its own policies regarding hospice coverage, VITAS can contact the patient’s insurer to ask about coverage provided. However, VITAS is committed to admitting and caring for all hospice-appropriate patients who are referred to us, regardless of their insurance coverage or ability to pay.
What Does Hospice Cost?
Hospices are paid a daily per-diem rate for their services in one of four levels of care:

Routine home care
Continuous care (Intensive Comfort Care®)
Inpatient care
Respite care

Out of this basic per-diem rate, the hospice is responsible for all prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, medical equipment and supplies, labs and other tests related to comfort and management of the terminal illness, as designated by the hospice team.
In addition, patients receive regular visits from nurses, hospice aides, chaplains, social workers, rehabilitation therapists,  counselors, volunteers and physician services, as needed. Organized bereavement services are provided to surviving loved ones for at least one year after the patient’s death, again at no cost to the patient's family.

Partner with VITAS: Physicians

As a hospice leader and innovator, VITAS brings our services to your patients when they need us most—near the end of life.
VITAS services are based on delivering what physicians tell us are the keys to providing excellent care to the terminally ill:

Effective pain and symptom management designed to assure patient comfort
Care provided in the most comfortable and appropriate environment
An automated process for updating physicians on the patient’s status and condition—customized to fit the needs of each physician

VITAS is successful because we put the needs of patients and families first. Our staff work each day to optimize patient care, to make the transition to hospice & palliative care more efficient and less costly.

As the provider at the forefront of hospice care, we are committed to quality and innovation. VITAS has established clinical protocols that serve as national hospice standards. We employ expert clinicians, from physicians to nurses and hospice aides, and then enhance their expertise with extensive additional palliative care training.
VITAS’ innovative model of end-of-life care also is reflected in ongoing, company-generated research on:

Effective methods of pain control
Proprietary tools and protocols, including a pain formulary, hospice-specific wound care and an electronic patient record
Specialized care programs for diagnoses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, kidney disease, liver disease, AIDS, Alzheimer’s and other neurological conditions
Specialized training and formal credentialing of all staff involved in patient care

Our model of care results in national outcomes that speak for themselves.

Most importantly, VITAS’ clinical leadership and expertise have improved quality of life for the terminally ill by providing the most appropriate, customized care plans and effective pain management available today, with daily pain management scores recorded at every patient visit.
With one of the hospice field’s most sophisticated information technology systems, VITAS can customize reports for individual physicians by collecting and sorting data using a variety of metrics. Our information technology resources also allow VITAS to analyze more clinical data on more hospice patients than any other provider.
Services such as our national Telecare® centers are available at all times after hours and on weekends and holidays, and our online referral capacity offers immediate benefits with the kind of value that gets reflected in high patient/family satisfaction scores.
VITAS offers a number of tools that physicians may find helpful in:

Assessing limited life expectancy and hospice eligibility
Breaking bad news to patients and families and initiating a discussion about options for end-of-life care
Determining clinical appropriateness for the inpatient level of hospice care or Intensive Comfort Care (continuous care) in the home
Billing for attending physician care plan oversight services provided to Medicare hospice beneficiaries
Comparing VITAS’ hospice services with traditional home healthcare as an option for your patient

As the attending physician for the patient(s) you refer to VITAS for hospice services, you are an integral member of our interdisciplinary team, which has overall responsibility for managing and providing hospice care to these patients.
To provide hospice care to your patients, VITAS must obtain, at the time a patient is admitted to hospice care, a certification that, based on your clinical expertise, the patient's prognosis is for a life expectancy of six months or less if the terminal illness runs its normal course.
As the attending physician, you are jointly responsible with the VITAS physician and interdisciplinary team for establishing, reviewing and updating your patient's plan of care. You will be consulted regularly regarding your patient's hospice plan of care and are encouraged to participate in VITAS' interdisciplinary team meetings.
