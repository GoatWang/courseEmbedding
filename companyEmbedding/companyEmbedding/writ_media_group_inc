	WRIT MEDIA GROUP, INC.






	NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016



	 



	NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 




	Organization and Business Operations




	 


	WRIT Media Group, Inc. (“we”, “our”, “WRIT” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on March 9, 2007 to produce films, television programs and similar entertainment programs for various media formats. The Company has three wholly owned subsidiaries: Front Row Networks, Inc., Amiga Games, Inc., and Retro Infinity, Inc.


	 


	Front Row Networks, Inc. is a content creation company which produces, acquires and distributes live concerts in 3D for initial worldwide digital broadcast into digitally-enabled movie theaters, TV and mobile streaming providers.


	 


	On August 19, 2013, the Company acquired certain software through the purchase of 100% of Amiga Games Inc. in exchange for 500,000 shares. Amiga Games Inc. became WRIT’s wholly-owned subsidiary.


	 


	Amiga Games Inc. licenses classic pre-Windows computer game libraries and adapts and republishes the most popular titles for smartphones, modern game consoles, PCs, tablets, and other television streaming devices.


	 


	WRIT also established a new company, Retro Infinity Inc., to publish and brand games that were not originally released for Amiga brand computers. The two companies tap into the growing “retro gaming” marketplace, building on the "Amiga", “Atari”, and “MS-DOS” brands, delivering retro-gaming titles adapted for modern devices as well as merchandise featuring brands and characters from the games.


	 


	On January 22, 2014, the Company changed the name of the corporation to WRIT Media Group, Inc.


	 


	On June 20, 2016, WRIT Media Group, Inc. acquired Pandora Venture Capital Corp, a Florida based company. The Company acquired Pandora Venture Capital Corp through the issuance of 14,000,000 restricted shares of its Common Stock to the shareholders of Pandora, in exchange for all issued and outstanding shares of Pandora, making Pandora a wholly-owned subsidiary of WRIT Media Group, Inc.


	 


	On June 21, 2016 the Board of Directors of WRIT Media Group, Inc. appointed Boris Nayflish as an independent director to serve on the Board. The appointment was effective as of June 20, 2016. The Board was not required to increase its size due to the existence of vacancies on the Board at the time of appointment. The Board does not expect at this time that Mr. Nayflish will receive any cash or stock compensation as director.


	 


	The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of WRIT Media Group, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016 as filed with the SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the consolidated financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements as reported in the annual report on Form 10-K have been omitted.


	 




	 




	5













	 




	 



	NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN



	 


	As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $3,529,055 which includes a loss of $343,361 at September 30, 2016 and a working capital deficiency of $871,130. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from outcome of this uncertainty. Although management is currently attempting to implement its business plan, and is seeking additional sources of equity or debt financing, there is no assurance these activities will be successful.

	EAM Delaware LLC – related party



	 


	On August 4, 2016, the Company borrowed $50,000 from related party EAM Delaware LLC. The maturity date of this note is August 5, 2017 and this loan bears an interest rate of 12% per annum from the issuance date. The note is still outstanding as of September 30, 2016.

The maturity date of this note is October 1, 2017 and this loan bears an interest rate of 12% per annum from the issuance date. The note is still outstanding as of September 30, 2016.


	 



	Falmouth Street Holdings, LLC



	 


	On March 2, 2015, the Company borrowed $7,500 from Falmouth Street Holdings, LLC. The maturity date of this note is August 29, 2015 and this loan bears an interest rate of 12% per annum from the issuance date. The note is still outstanding as of September 30, 2016.

	JL Shaw



	 


	On June 22, 2016, the Company borrowed $5,000 from JL Shaw. The maturity date of this note is June 22, 2017 and this loan bears an interest rate of 8% per annum from the issuance date. The note is still outstanding as of September 30, 2016.


	 



	S. Karban



	 


	On June 9, 2015, the Company borrowed $3,300 from S.Karban and $3,000 was received with the remaining $300 recorded as debt discount. The maturity date of this note is June 22, 2015, and this loan bears an interest rate of 10% per annum from the issuance date. As of March 31, 2016, the note is still outstanding and therefore in default. On April 4, 2016 the Company entered into a debt modification agreement with debt holder S Karban. The modified note is convertible into common stock at a price of $0.10, bears an extend maturity date of October 14, 2016, and an interest rate of 8% per annum. The principal amount of the modified note is $4,475 which includes the original principal balance of $3,300 plus accrued interest of $1,175. The Company evaluated the application of ASC 470-50 and ASC 470-60 and concluded that the addition of a conversion feature constituted a debt extinguishment rather than a trouble debt restructuring. No gain or loss was resulted from the debt extinguishment since the fair value the new debt was the same as the old debt. See more discussion about the new debt in Note 4. On April 5, 2016, this note was converted in its entirety and has been surrendered to the Company.

	Overview



	 


	WRIT Media Group, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “WRIT”, or the “Company”) was incorporated as Writers’ Group Film Corp. in Delaware on March 9, 2007 to produce films, television programs and similar entertainment programs for various media formats.


	 


	Front Row Networks (“FRN”) was incorporated on July 27, 2010 in the State of Nevada. The Company is a content creation company which was launched to produce, acquire, license, and distribute music-related content in 3D and ultra-high definition (4K) for initial worldwide digital broadcast into digitally-enabled movie theaters. Through the distribution of music-related “alternative content,” the Company intends to present live concerts, music documentaries, and other music-related content at affordable prices, to a massive fan base worldwide in a cost-effective manner. The Company intends to shift its focus from 3D to developing ultra-high definition (4K) content for distribution in the Americas and Asia. In some cases, Front Row Networks will also sell merchandising and other products, bolstered by both in-theater and in-App advertising, tailored around each Artist and/or event, to maximize potential merchandising and sponsorship revenues.


	 


	In February 2011, FRN completed a reverse acquisition transaction through a share exchange with WRIT, whereby WRIT acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of FRN in exchange for 100,000 shares of the Common Stock of WRIT. As a result of the reverse acquisition, FRN became WRIT’s wholly-owned subsidiary and the former FRN’s shareholders became controlling stockholders of WRIT. The share exchange transaction with WRIT was treated as a reverse acquisition, with FRN as the accounting acquirer and WRIT as the acquired party.


	 






	 




	11













	 




	 


	Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations were reflected in the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the Share Exchange Agreement were those of FRN and will be recorded at the historical cost basis. After the completion of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company’s consolidated financial statements included the assets and liabilities of both FRN and WRIT, the historical operations of FRN and the operations of WRIT from the closing date of the Share Exchange Agreement.


	 


	On July 7, 2011, we modified our February 2011 Share Exchange Agreement and agreed to assume $100,000 in new debt which is shown as a reduction of our Paid-In Capital.


	 


	While the core business of Front Row Networks remains the licensing, production, acquisition and distribution of music-related content and programming, the core business is dependent upon negotiating and financing projects with schedules that are solely determined by third parties, such as Artists and rights owners. In order to secure less cyclical entertainment product, the Company sought to license or purchase entertainment content that could be easily secured and distributed through the multiple distribution arrangements already established by the Company and via the rapidly growing marketplace represented by consumers of mobile, internet, and TV set-top devices. To reach this goal during the fiscal year, the Company set out to acquire exclusive branded content and entertainment programming, and achieved this goal through the acquisition of Amiga Games Inc.


	 


	On August 19, 2013, the Company completed an acquisition transaction through a share exchange with Amiga Games Inc., whereby WRIT acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock, assets, and trademarks of Amiga Games Inc. in exchange for 500,000 shares of the Common Stock of WRIT. As a result of the acquisition, Amiga Games Inc. became WRIT’s wholly-owned subsidiary.


	 


	Amiga Games Inc. licenses classic pre-Windows computer game libraries and adapts and republishes the most popular titles for smartphones, modern game consoles, PCs, tablets, and other television streaming devices. WRIT also established a new company, Retro Infinity Inc., to publish and brand games that were not originally released for Amiga brand computers. The two companies tap into the growing “retro gaming” marketplace, building on the "Amiga", “Atari”, and “MS-DOS” brands, delivering retro-gaming titles adapted for modern devices as well as merchandise featuring brands and characters from the games.


	 


	During the 2014 fiscal year, Amiga Games Inc. and Retro Infinity Inc. entered several marketing and distribution agreements, including those with Microsoft Corporation and Roku Inc. Both agreements include minimum guarantees, defined as advances against future sales. Additionally, the Retro Infinity Inc. licensed dozens of classic games for distribution via the Windows 8, Roku player, iOS (Apple), and Android platforms. Although it was the Company’s strategic goal to distribute a broad range of video game titles on the Windows 8 and iOS platforms during the 4th quarter of 2014, lack of operating capital caused the Company to temporarily halt software development funding, which delayed the Company’s overall gaming product release schedule. This temporary reduction in operating capital was due to mainly to regulatory delays encountered in structuring WRIT’s equity-line financing, and the Company’s difficulty in raising alternative investment capital, due to its sub-penny share price at the time.


	 


	On January 22, 2014, the Company changed the name of the corporation to WRIT Media Group, Inc., and authorized a 1 for 1,000 reverse split of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. The name change was authorized to encompass the Company's broadened activities, including additional business plans and models, and the acquisition and formation of new subsidiaries. The equity restructuring was authorized to achieve the following: (a) price per share -- the rollback will increase the price per share to above $0.01, sub-penny markets are getting harder to trade and next to impossible to finance; (b) funding -- with a sub penny share price the Company was unable to fund because of dilution, post rollback the share price should be well above $0.01 and allow management to close on numerous funding opportunities that have been presented; (c) larger potential audience -- with a higher share price the Company will have access to investors who do not trade sub penny stocks such as institutions and Europeans; (d) listing in Europe -- the Company will now be able to list its common shares for trading on a European Stock Exchange, as co-listings in Europe are not accepted with a sub penny share price; and (e) acquisitions -- the Company will be able to use common shares to acquire larger assets and other industry related companies.

	On January 16, 2014 WRIT’s Equity Line Financing (“ELF”) agreement with Dutchess Opportunity Fund II, and its corresponding S1 registration statement, was declared effective by the SEC. The ELF agreement, executed in September 2013, allows but does not require WRIT to sell up to US$10,000,000 of common stock to Dutchess at a 5% discount to market price, during the 36 month term. Compared to the Company’s convertible debt financing, ELFs provide a lower discount to market that minimize dilution while increasing operating capital. This additional financing source allowed the company to reduce debt and reduce the balance of the more expensive convertible notes that were outstanding during the last quarter of the fiscal year.


	 


	On February 4, 2014 the Company completed its administrative and legal work with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ("DTCC") and the DTCC's long-standing "Administrative Chill" on clearing WRIT stock certificates was removed. DTCC resumed accepting deposits of the Company's common stock for book entry transfer services. As a result, shareholders with online brokerage accounts at firms such as Scottrade, ETRADE, TD Ameritrade and other full service brokerage firms are allowed to deposit new shares of WRIT's common stock in the electronic system that controls clearance and settlement. The reinstatement of the DTC depository services is an instrumental and enormous accomplishment for WRIT, which greatly reduced the costs and expenses associated with private equity investments in the Company.


	 


	In September 2014 the Company launched two online point of sale platforms; www.RetroInfinity.com and www.AmigaGamesInc.com to market its “retro” gaming titles directly to consumers. Both sales platforms initially offer only downloads for windows based computers. The online store launch was completed in conjunction with an initial marketing program which featured NASCAR, the RWR Retro Infinity NASCAR race team, and the “Drive to Championship Weekend” branding program. In December 2014 the Company intended to launch additional titles on additional mobile platforms, such as Windows phone, iOS, and Android platforms, so that the video game titles can be downloaded as Apps on various mobile devices, the Company experienced additional financing delays which interrupted software development and caused the Company to reschedule the anticipated release on mobile platforms into 2015. The online store launch generated an increase in consumer traffic to the Company’s websites and created awareness in the Company’s product, but generated minimal sales, most consumers were interested only in the mobile versions of the gaming titles, which were not yet available.


	 


	The websites are currently being modified to accept payment for crowdfunding transactions, and we launched the Retro Infinity/Amiga Games crowdfunding platform, supported by a social marketing campaign, in the 3rd quarter of 2015. The initial crowdfunding campaign was not successful, so the Company is seeking additional financing from strategic partners that will allow the Company to resume and complete software development, and commence product marketing activities.


	 


	On June 25, 2015, the Company authorized a 1 for 200 reverse split of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. The equity restructuring was authorized to achieve the following: (a) price per share -- the rollback will increase the price per share to above $0.01, sub-penny markets are getting harder to trade and next to impossible to finance; (b) funding -- with a sub penny share price the Company was unable to fund because of dilution, post rollback the share price should be well above $0.01 and allow management to close on numerous funding opportunities that have been presented; (c) larger potential audience -- with a higher share price the Company will have access to investors who do not trade sub penny stocks such as institutions and Europeans; (d) listing in Europe -- the Company will now be able to list its common shares for trading on a European Stock Exchange, as co-listings in Europe are not accepted with a sub penny share price; and (e) acquisitions -- the Company will be able to use common shares to acquire larger assets and other industry related companies. 


	 


	On June 20, 2016 WRIT Media Group, Inc. acquired all assets, trademarks and common stock of Pandora Venture Capital Corp, a Florida based company through a share exchange agreement. The Company acquired Pandora Venture Capital Corp through the issuance of 14,000,000 restricted shares of its Common Stock to the shareholders of Pandora, in exchange for all outstanding shares of Pandora, making Pandora a wholly-owned subsidiary of WRIT Media Group, Inc.


	 


	We believe WRIT is well positioned to benefit from the developing market and growth in digital currency trading platforms and products, and block chain technology applications, and intend to continue to look for opportunities to explore business relationships with entities that have the resources to offer financing, licensing, distribution and marketing of WRIT’s product.

	Obligations under Material Contracts



	 


	Except with respect to the loan obligations disclosed above, we have no obligations to pay cash or deliver cash to any other party.


	 



	Inflation



	 


	Inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future. However, our management will closely monitor price changes in our industry and continually maintain effective cost controls in operations.


	 



	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to an investor in our securities.


	 



	Seasonality



	 


	Our operating results and operating cash flows historically have not been subject to seasonal variations. This pattern may change, however, as a result of new market opportunities or new product introduction.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial conditions and results of operations and require management’s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management’s current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements:


	 




	Long Lived Assets




	 


	In accordance with ASC 360 "Property Plant and Equipment," the Company reviews the carrying value of intangibles subject to amortization and long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property, if any, exceeds its fair market value.

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	We do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.


	 



	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.



	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that, because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016. See our discussion at “Item 9A Controls and Procedures” on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016.


	 


	We have noted the following material weaknesses in our control environment: 


	 


	1.

	Material weaknesses in Our Control Environment.

	Our control environment did not sufficiently promote effective internal control over financial reporting throughout the organization. This material weakness exists because of the aggregate effect of multiple deficiencies in internal control which affect our control environment, including: a) the lack of an effective risk assessment process for the identification of fraud risks; b) the lack of an internal audit function or other effective mechanism for ongoing monitoring of the effectiveness of internal controls; c) and insufficient documentation and communication of our accounting policies and procedures as of September 30, 2016.


	 


	2.

	Material weaknesses in the staffing of our financial accounting department.

	Management had engaged an outside consultant to assist in the financial reporting. However, the number of qualified accounting personnel with experience in public company SEC reporting and GAAP is limited. This weakness does not enable us to maintain adequate controls over our financial accounting and reporting processes regarding the accounting for non-routine and non-systematic transactions. There is a risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements could be caused, or at least not be detected in a timely manner, by this shortage of qualified resources.


	 


	3.

	Material weaknesses in Segregation of Duties.

	The limited number of qualified accounting personnel results in an inability to have independent review and approval of financial accounting entries. Furthermore, management and financial accounting personnel have wide-spread access to create and post entries in our financial accounting system. There is a risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements could be caused, or at least not be detected in a timely manner, due to insufficient segregation of duties. Because of its inherent limitation, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management is still determining additional measures to remediate deficiencies related to staffing.


	 


	Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process certain safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting.


	 



	Changes in Internal Controls



	 


	There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



	 


	On July 21, 2016, Magna Equities II, LLC and Hanover Holdings I, LLC (collectively as “Magna”) filed a Summons with Notice of Appearance against the Company, and its former and current transfer agents (collectively as the “Parties”), in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. The litigation is in its preliminary stages and discovery has commenced. Magna’s allegations against the Parties, which are briefly outlined in the summons, are to recover monetary damages related to Magna’s loan to the Company which has a principal balance equal to $85,750. Magna alleges breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion and negligence against the Parties and seeks relief in excess of $1,500,000. Although the company has reason to believe that it will prevail on the merits of a summary judgment, the litigation could have a lengthy duration, and the ultimate outcome cannot be predicted at this time.


	 


	On August 17, 2016, KBM Worldwide Inc. (“KBM”) filed a Summons in a Civil Action against the Company in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The litigation is in its preliminary stages, the Company has filed an answer to the complaint and a first counterclaim against the plaintiffs on November 1, 2016. KBM’s allegations which are briefly outlined in the summons, are to recover monetary damages related to KBM’s loans to the Company which have a principal balance equal to $142,765. KBM seeks equitable and injunctive relief against the Parties in excess of $142,765. Although the company has reason to believe that it will prevail on the merits of its case against the plaintiff, the litigation could have a lengthy duration, and the ultimate outcome cannot be predicted at this time.


	 


	On July 27, 2016, Mr. George Sharp filed suit against the company in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego. Sharp had previously filed a similar lawsuit in 2011 which was dismissed on February 16, 2012, and included a settlement agreement signed by Sharp which was filed with the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles (Case Number: BC461550) Sharp alleges misrepresentation and violation of the Unfair Business Practices Act, and seeks unspecified damages. The litigation is in its preliminary stages and discovery has commenced. Although the company has reason to believe that it will prevail on the merits of a summary judgment, the litigation could have a lengthy duration, and the ultimate outcome cannot be predicted at this time.

	WRIT MEDIA GROUP, INC.






	NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS




	AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016



	 



	NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT
	ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 




	Organization
	and Business Operations




	 


	WRIT Media Group, Inc. (“we”, “our”,
	“WRIT” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on March 9, 2007 to produce films, television programs
	and similar entertainment programs for various media formats. The Company has three wholly owned subsidiaries: Front Row Networks,
	Inc., Amiga Games, Inc., and Retro Infinity, Inc.


	 


	Front Row Networks, Inc. is a content creation
	company which produces, acquires and distributes live concerts in 3D for initial worldwide digital broadcast into digitally-enabled
	movie theaters, TV and mobile streaming providers.


	 


	On August 19, 2013, the Company acquired certain
	software through the purchase of 100% of Amiga Games Inc. in exchange for 500,000 shares. Amiga Games Inc. became WRIT’s
	wholly-owned subsidiary.


	 


	Amiga Games Inc. licenses classic pre-Windows
	computer game libraries and adapts and republishes the most popular titles for smartphones, modern game consoles, PCs, tablets,
	and other television streaming devices.


	 


	WRIT also established a new company, Retro
	Infinity Inc., to publish and brand games that were not originally released for Amiga brand computers. The two companies tap into
	the growing “retro gaming” marketplace, building on the "Amiga", “Atari”, and “MS-DOS”
	brands, delivering retro-gaming titles adapted for modern devices as well as merchandise featuring brands and characters from the
	games.


	 


	On January 22, 2014, the Company changed the
	name of the corporation to WRIT Media Group, Inc.


	 


	On June 20, 2016, WRIT Media Group, Inc. acquired
	Pandora Venture Capital Corp, a Florida based company. The Company acquired Pandora Venture Capital Corp through the issuance of
	14,000,000 restricted shares of its Common Stock to the shareholders of Pandora, in exchange for all issued and outstanding shares
	of Pandora, making Pandora a wholly-owned subsidiary of WRIT Media Group, Inc.


	 


	On June 21, 2016 the Board of Directors of
	WRIT Media Group, Inc. appointed Boris Nayflish as an independent director to serve on the Board. The appointment was effective
	as of June 20, 2016. The Board was not required to increase its size due to the existence of vacancies on the Board at the time
	of appointment. The Board does not expect at this time that Mr. Nayflish will receive any cash or stock compensation as director.


	 


	The accompanying unaudited interim financial
	statements of WRIT Media Group, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America and rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
	statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016 as filed
	with the SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation
	of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of
	operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the consolidated
	financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements as reported
	in the annual report on Form 10-K have been omitted.


	 






	 






	4




	 









	 









	NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN



	 


	As reflected in the accompanying consolidated
	financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $3,700,425 which includes a loss of $514,731 at December 31, 2016
	and a working capital deficiency of $942,500. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue
	as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments
	that might result from outcome of this uncertainty. Although management is currently attempting to implement its business plan,
	and is seeking additional sources of equity or debt financing, there is no assurance these activities will be successful.


	 





	NOTE 3 – NOTES PAYABLE



	 


	Note payable consists of the following:

	On March 2, 2015, the Company borrowed $7,500
	from Falmouth Street Holdings, LLC. The maturity date of this note is August 29, 2015 and this loan bears an interest rate of 12%
	per annum from the issuance date. The note is still outstanding as of December 31, 2016. As of today the debt is still outstanding

	JL Shaw



	 


	On June 22, 2016, the Company borrowed $5,000
	from JL Shaw. The maturity date of this note is June 22, 2017 and this loan bears an interest rate of 8% per annum from the issuance
	date. The note is still outstanding as of December 31, 2016.


	 



	S. Karban



	 


	On June 9, 2015, the Company borrowed $3,300
	from S. Karban and $3,000 was received with the remaining $300 recorded as debt discount. The maturity date of this note is June
	22, 2015, and this loan bears an interest rate of 10% per annum from the issuance date. As of March 31, 2016, the note is still

	S. Karban. The modified note is convertible into common stock at a price of $0.10, bears an extend maturity date of October 14,
	2016, and an interest rate of 8% per annum. The principal amount of the modified note is $4,475 which includes the original principal
	balance of $3,300 plus accrued interest of $1,175. The Company evaluated the application of ASC 470-50 and ASC 470-60 and concluded
	that the addition of a conversion feature constituted a debt extinguishment rather than a trouble debt restructuring. No gain or
	loss was resulted from the debt extinguishment since the fair value the new debt was the same as the old debt. See more discussion
	about the new debt in Note 4. On April 5, 2016, this note was converted in its entirety and has been surrendered to the Company.

	The Company evaluated the embedded conversion
	feature within the above KBM convertible notes payable under ASC 815-15 and ASC 815-40 and determined embedded conversion feature
	does not meet the definition of a liability. Then the Company evaluated the conversion feature for a beneficial conversion feature

	payable and a total debt discount of $148,500 was recorded on the KBM notes. The debt discount had been fully amortized as of March

	S. Karban



	 


	On April 4, 2016 the Company entered into a
	debt modification agreement with debt holder S Karban (see Note 3). The modified note is convertible into common stock at a price
	of $0.10, bears an extend maturity date of October 14, 2016, and an interest rate of 8% per annum. The principal amount of the

	Company.


	 


	The Company evaluated the application of ASC
	470-50 and ASC 470-60 and concluded the addition of a conversion feature constituted a debt extinguishment rather than a troubled
	debt restructuring, with the old debt written off and the new debt initially recorded at fair value with a new effective interest
	rate. No gain or loss was resulted from the debt extinguishment since the fair value the new debt was the same as the old debt.
	The Company evaluated the embedded conversion feature within the S. Karban convertible note payable under ASC 815-15 and ASC 815-40
	and determined embedded conversion feature does not meet the definition of a liability. Then the Company evaluated the conversion
	feature for a beneficial conversion feature at inception. The Company accounted for the intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion
	feature inherent to the convertible note payable and a total debt discount of $4,475 was recorded on the S. Karban note. During
	the nine months ended December 31, 2016, debt discount of $4,475 was amortized, and the unamortized debt discount is $0 as of December
	31, 2016.

	Each share of Series
	A preferred stock is convertible at any time into the number of common shares equal to four times the sum of all outstanding common

	A shareholders may receive dividends as declared by the Board.  The Company has 2,400 Series A preferred shares outstanding
	at December 31, 2016.

	EAM Delaware LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability company controlled by Eric Mitchell, the current President and Chairman of WRIT
	Media Group, Inc., converted 100 Preferred Series A shares into 5,308,434 common shares.

	Overview



	 


	WRIT Media Group,
	Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “WRIT”, or the “Company”) was incorporated
	as Writers’ Group Film Corp. in Delaware on March 9, 2007 to produce films, television programs and similar entertainment
	programs for various media formats.


	 


	Front Row Networks
	(“FRN”) was incorporated on July 27, 2010 in the State of Nevada. The Company is a content creation company which
	was launched to produce, acquire, license, and distribute music-related content in 3D and ultra-high definition (4K) for initial
	worldwide digital broadcast into digitally-enabled movie theaters. Through the distribution of music-related “alternative
	content,” the Company intends to present live concerts, music documentaries, and other music-related content at affordable
	prices, to a massive fan base worldwide in a cost-effective manner. The Company intends to shift its focus from 3D to developing
	ultra-high definition (4K) content for distribution in the Americas and Asia. In some cases, Front Row Networks will also sell
	merchandising and other products, bolstered by both in-theater and in-App advertising, tailored around each Artist and/or event,
	to maximize potential merchandising and sponsorship revenues.


	 






	 






	11




	 









	 








	In February 2011,
	FRN completed a reverse acquisition transaction through a share exchange with WRIT, whereby WRIT acquired 100% of the issued and
	outstanding capital stock of FRN in exchange for 100,000 shares of the Common Stock of WRIT. As a result of the reverse acquisition,
	FRN became WRIT’s wholly-owned subsidiary and the former FRN’s shareholders became controlling stockholders of WRIT.
	The share exchange transaction with WRIT was treated as a reverse acquisition, with FRN as the accounting acquirer and WRIT as
	the acquired party.


	 


	Consequently, the
	assets and liabilities and the historical operations were reflected in the consolidated financial statements for periods prior
	to the Share Exchange Agreement were those of FRN and will be recorded at the historical cost basis. After the completion of the
	Share Exchange Agreement, the Company’s consolidated financial statements included the assets and liabilities of both FRN
	and WRIT, the historical operations of FRN and the operations of WRIT from the closing date of the Share Exchange Agreement.


	 


	On July 7, 2011,
	we modified our February 2011 Share Exchange Agreement and agreed to assume $100,000 in new debt which is shown as a reduction
	of our Paid-In Capital.


	 


	While the core
	business of Front Row Networks remains the licensing, production, acquisition and distribution of music-related content and programming,
	the core business is dependent upon negotiating and financing projects with schedules that are solely determined by third parties,
	such as Artists and rights owners. In order to secure less cyclical entertainment product, the Company sought to license or purchase
	entertainment content that could be easily secured and distributed through the multiple distribution arrangements already established
	by the Company and via the rapidly growing marketplace represented by consumers of mobile, internet, and TV set-top devices. To
	reach this goal during the fiscal year, the Company set out to acquire exclusive branded content and entertainment programming,
	and achieved this goal through the acquisition of Amiga Games Inc.


	 


	On August 19, 2013,
	the Company completed an acquisition transaction through a share exchange with Amiga Games Inc., whereby WRIT acquired 100% of
	the issued and outstanding capital stock, assets, and trademarks of Amiga Games Inc. in exchange for 500,000 shares of the Common
	Stock of WRIT. As a result of the acquisition, Amiga Games Inc. became WRIT’s wholly-owned subsidiary.


	 


	Amiga Games Inc.
	licenses classic pre-Windows computer game libraries and adapts and republishes the most popular titles for smartphones, modern
	game consoles, PCs, tablets, and other television streaming devices. WRIT also established a new company, Retro Infinity Inc.,
	to publish and brand games that were not originally released for Amiga brand computers. The two companies tap into the growing
	“retro gaming” marketplace, building on the "Amiga", “Atari”, and “MS-DOS” brands,
	delivering retro-gaming titles adapted for modern devices as well as merchandise featuring brands and characters from the games.


	 


	During the 2014
	fiscal year, Amiga Games Inc. and Retro Infinity Inc. entered several marketing and distribution agreements, including those with
	Microsoft Corporation and Roku Inc. Both agreements include minimum guarantees, defined as advances against future sales. Additionally,
	the Retro Infinity Inc. licensed dozens of classic games for distribution via the Windows 8, Roku player, iOS (Apple), and Android
	platforms. Although it was the Company’s strategic goal to distribute a broad range of video game titles on the Windows
	8 and iOS platforms during the 4

	th

	quarter of 2014, lack of operating capital caused the Company to temporarily halt
	software development funding, which delayed the Company’s overall gaming product release schedule. This temporary reduction
	in operating capital was due to mainly to regulatory delays encountered in structuring WRIT’s equity-line financing, and
	the Company’s difficulty in raising alternative investment capital, due to its sub-penny share price at the time.


	 






	 






	12




	 









	 








	On January 22,
	2014, the Company changed the name of the corporation to WRIT Media Group, Inc., and authorized a 1 for 1,000 reverse split of
	the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. The name change was authorized to encompass the Company's broadened
	activities, including additional business plans and models, and the acquisition and formation of new subsidiaries. The equity
	restructuring was authorized to achieve the following: (a) price per share -- the rollback will increase the price per share to
	above $0.01, sub-penny markets are getting harder to trade and next to impossible to finance; (b) funding -- with a sub penny
	share price the Company was unable to fund because of dilution, post rollback the share price should be well above $0.01 and allow
	management to close on numerous funding opportunities that have been presented; (c) larger potential audience -- with a higher
	share price the Company will have access to investors who do not trade sub penny stocks such as institutions and Europeans; (d)
	listing in Europe -- the Company will now be able to list its common shares for trading on a European Stock Exchange, as co-listings
	in Europe are not accepted with a sub penny share price; and (e) acquisitions -- the Company will be able to use common shares
	to acquire larger assets and other industry related companies. 


	 


	On January 16,
	2014 WRIT’s Equity Line Financing (“ELF”) agreement with Dutchess Opportunity Fund II, and its corresponding
	S1 registration statement, was declared effective by the SEC. The ELF agreement, executed in September 2013, allows but does not
	require WRIT to sell up to US$10,000,000 of common stock to Dutchess at a 5% discount to market price, during the 36 month term.
	Compared to the Company’s convertible debt financing, ELFs provide a lower discount to market that minimize dilution while
	increasing operating capital. This additional financing source allowed the company to reduce debt and reduce the balance of the
	more expensive convertible notes that were outstanding during the last quarter of the fiscal year.


	 


	On February 4,
	2014 the Company completed its administrative and legal work with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ("DTCC")
	and the DTCC's long-standing "Administrative Chill" on clearing WRIT stock certificates was removed. DTCC resumed accepting
	deposits of the Company's common stock for book entry transfer services. As a result, shareholders with online brokerage accounts
	at firms such as Scottrade, ETRADE, TD Ameritrade and other full service brokerage firms are allowed to deposit new shares of
	WRIT's common stock in the electronic system that controls clearance and settlement. The reinstatement of the DTC depository services
	is an instrumental and enormous accomplishment for WRIT, which greatly reduced the costs and expenses associated with private
	equity investments in the Company.


	 


	In September 2014
	the Company launched two online point of sale platforms; www.RetroInfinity.com and www.AmigaGamesInc.com to market its “retro”
	gaming titles directly to consumers. Both sales platforms initially offer only downloads for windows based computers. The online
	store launch was completed in conjunction with an initial marketing program which featured NASCAR, the RWR Retro Infinity NASCAR
	race team, and the “Drive to Championship Weekend” branding program. In December 2014 the Company intended to launch
	additional titles on additional mobile platforms, such as Windows phone, iOS, and Android platforms, so that the video game titles
	can be downloaded as Apps on various mobile devices, the Company experienced additional financing delays which interrupted software
	development and caused the Company to reschedule the anticipated release on mobile platforms into 2015. The online store launch
	generated an increase in consumer traffic to the Company’s websites and created awareness in the Company’s product,
	but generated minimal sales, most consumers were interested only in the mobile versions of the gaming titles, which were not yet
	available.


	 


	The websites are
	currently being modified to accept payment for crowdfunding transactions, and we launched the Retro Infinity/Amiga Games crowdfunding
	platform, supported by a social marketing campaign, in the 3rd quarter of 2015. The initial crowdfunding campaign was not successful,
	so the Company is seeking additional financing from strategic partners that will allow the Company to resume and complete software
	development, and commence product marketing activities.

	On June 25, 2015,
	the Company authorized a 1 for 200 reverse split of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. The equity
	restructuring was authorized to achieve the following: (a) price per share -- the rollback will increase the price per share to
	above $0.01, sub-penny markets are getting harder to trade and next to impossible to finance; (b) funding -- with a sub penny
	share price the Company was unable to fund because of dilution, post rollback the share price should be well above $0.01 and allow
	management to close on numerous funding opportunities that have been presented; (c) larger potential audience -- with a higher
	share price the Company will have access to investors who do not trade sub penny stocks such as institutions and Europeans; (d)
	listing in Europe -- the Company will now be able to list its common shares for trading on a European Stock Exchange, as co-listings
	in Europe are not accepted with a sub penny share price; and (e) acquisitions -- the Company will be able to use common shares
	to acquire larger assets and other industry related companies. 


	 


	On June 20, 2016
	WRIT Media Group, Inc. acquired all assets, trademarks and common stock of Pandora Venture Capital Corp, a Florida based company
	through a share exchange agreement. The Company acquired Pandora Venture Capital Corp through the issuance of 14,000,000 restricted
	shares of its Common Stock to the shareholders of Pandora, in exchange for all outstanding shares of Pandora, making Pandora a
	wholly-owned subsidiary of WRIT Media Group, Inc.


	 


	We believe WRIT
	is well positioned to benefit from the developing market and growth in digital currency trading platforms and products, and block
	chain technology applications, and intend to continue to look for opportunities to explore business relationships with entities
	that have the resources to offer financing, licensing, distribution and marketing of WRIT’s product.

	We incurred $42,725 in interest expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and $152,297 for the same

	income or loss

	.

	As a result of the foregoing factors, we generated a net loss of $514,731 for the nine months ended December
	31, 2016, and a net loss of $664,785 for the same period in 2015. The decrease is mainly related to the decrease in interest expense
	and operating expenses from the same period in 2015.




	 





	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources






	 





	As
	reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring net losses and had a working
	capital deficiency of $942,500. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going
	concern. Although management is currently attempting to implement its business plan, and is seeking additional sources of equity
	or debt financing, there is no assurance these activities will be successful.




	 




	As
	of December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, we have $14,163 and $264 in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. To date, we have
	financed our operations primarily through cash flows from borrowings from third and related parties.

	Obligations under Material Contracts



	 


	Except with respect
	to the loan obligations disclosed above, we have no obligations to pay cash or deliver cash to any other party.


	 



	Inflation



	 


	Inflation and changing
	prices have not had a material effect on our business and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect
	our business in the foreseeable future. However, our management will closely monitor price changes in our industry and continually
	maintain effective cost controls in operations.


	 



	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We do not have
	any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
	changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures or capital resources
	that is material to an investor in our securities.


	 



	Seasonality



	 


	Our operating results
	and operating cash flows historically have not been subject to seasonal variations. This pattern may change, however, as a result
	of new market opportunities or new product introduction.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	The preparation
	of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management
	to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures
	of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation
	of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results
	of operation. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial conditions and
	results of operations and require management’s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need
	to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting
	estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that
	future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management’s current judgments. We believe the following
	critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements:

	Long Lived Assets





	 



	In accordance with ASC 360 "Property
	Plant and Equipment," the Company reviews the carrying value of intangibles subject to amortization and long-lived assets
	for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
	may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted
	cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment
	to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property, if any, exceeds its fair market value.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	We do not expect the adoption of
	recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash
	flow.





	 




	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.



	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	As of the end of
	the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
	management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of our disclosure
	controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on this
	evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that, because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
	described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2016. See our discussion at “Item
	9A Controls and Procedures” on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016.  


	 


	We have noted the
	following material weaknesses in our control environment: 


	 


	1.

	Material
	weaknesses in Our Control Environment.

	Our control environment did not sufficiently promote effective internal control over
	financial reporting throughout the organization. This material weakness exists because of the aggregate effect of multiple deficiencies
	in internal control which affect our control environment, including: a) the lack of an effective risk assessment process for the
	identification of fraud risks; b) the lack of an internal audit function or other effective mechanism for ongoing monitoring of
	the effectiveness of internal controls; c) and insufficient documentation and communication of our accounting policies and procedures
	as of December 31, 2016.


	 


	2.

	Material
	weaknesses in the staffing of our financial accounting department.

	Management had engaged an outside consultant to assist
	in the financial reporting. However, the number of qualified accounting personnel with experience in public company SEC reporting
	and GAAP is limited. This weakness does not enable us to maintain adequate controls over our financial accounting and reporting
	processes regarding the accounting for non-routine and non-systematic transactions. There is a risk that a material misstatement
	of the financial statements could be caused, or at least not be detected in a timely manner, by this shortage of qualified resources.


	 






	 






	20




	 









	 








	3.

	Material
	weaknesses in Segregation of Duties.

	The limited number of qualified accounting personnel results in an inability to have
	independent review and approval of financial accounting entries. Furthermore, management and financial accounting personnel have
	wide-spread access to create and post entries in our financial accounting system. There is a risk that a material misstatement
	of the financial statements could be caused, or at least not be detected in a timely manner, due to insufficient segregation of
	duties. Because of its inherent limitation, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
	because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management
	is still determining additional measures to remediate deficiencies related to staffing.


	 


	Because of such
	limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control
	over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore,
	it is possible to design into the process certain safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible
	for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting.


	 





	Changes in Internal Controls



	 


	There have been
	no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
	that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
	our internal control over financial reporting.


	 





	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



	 


	On July 21, 2016, Magna Equities II,
	LLC and Hanover Holdings I, LLC (collectively as “Magna”) filed a Summons with Notice of Appearance against the Company,
	and its former and current transfer agents (collectively as the “Parties”), in the Supreme Court of the State of New
	York, County of New York. The litigation is in its preliminary stages and discovery has commenced. Magna’s allegations against
	the Parties, which are briefly outlined in the summons, are to recover monetary damages related to Magna’s loan to the Company
	which has a principal balance equal to $85,750. Magna alleges breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and
	fair dealing, conversion and negligence against the Parties and seeks relief in excess of $1,500,000. Although the company has
	reason to believe that it will prevail on the merits of a summary judgment, the litigation could have a lengthy duration, and
	the ultimate outcome cannot be predicted at this time.


	 


	On August 17, 2016, KBM Worldwide Inc.
	(“KBM”) filed a Summons in a Civil Action against the Company in the United States District Court for the Eastern
	District of New York. The litigation is in its preliminary stages, the Company has filed an answer to the complaint and a first
	counterclaim against the plaintiffs on November 1, 2016. KBM’s allegations which are briefly outlined in the summons, are
	to recover monetary damages related to KBM’s loans to the Company which have a principal balance equal to $142,765. KBM
	seeks equitable and injunctive relief against the Parties in excess of $142,765. Although the Company has reason to believe that
	it will prevail on the merits of its case against the plaintiff, the litigation could have a lengthy duration, and the ultimate
	outcome cannot be predicted at this time.

	On July 27, 2016, Mr. George Sharp
	filed suit against the company in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego. Sharp had previously filed a similar
	lawsuit in 2011 which was dismissed on February 16, 2012, and included a settlement agreement signed by Sharp which was filed
	with the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles (Case Number: BC461550) Sharp alleges misrepresentation and violation
	of the Unfair Business Practices Act, and seeks unspecified damages. The litigation is in its preliminary stages and discovery
	has commenced. Although the Company has reason to believe that it will prevail on the merits of a summary judgment, the litigation
	could have a lengthy duration, and the ultimate outcome cannot be predicted at this time.

Pelecoin's proprietary algorithm optimizes currency "mining" profitability, while providing the added benefit of liquidity through the leading exchanges of digital currency.








Eric Mitchell, CEO stated "The Beta-test was proven to be very successful, and the test-users aided us by suggesting some minor changes, which we have already incorporated into the product to enhance its overall functionality. Pelecoin, has now been tested and proven to generate revenue, even with a limited number of users. We are now working closely with our developers and marketing consultants to oversee the marketing launch of Pelecoin, with a July, 2017 target date. We anticipate a welcoming response from our customers and the digital currency market in general."
Beta testing is a part of user acceptance testing, and is performed by the intended audience in order to receive user feedback for the product, and check if the product meets the objectives set by management. Pelecoin's Beta version was released to fifty test-users outside of the development team, using basic PC mining setups, to ensure that the product has few faults and bugs. During the limited three month Beta test, the Pelecoin platform generated over $11,000 in gross revenue to WRIT Media Group. 
Pelecoin is now available to the public by registering for a free Pelecoin account and downloading the Pelecoin miner in order to start mining. New accounts receive an initial Pelecoin bonus, to register follow the link www.pelecoin.com/Register and when prompted use referral code: bb3b24dd-dd9f-44d9-838d-0bcd5e902c33

NASCAR Sponsorship  Retro Infinity has negotiated an arrangement with DEVCAP Partners LLC and its related NASCAR Nationwide Series racing team, which provides marketing of Retro Infinity’s gaming products and point-of-purchase website, branding of Retro and Amiga games, and additional advertising and branding of the company’s partners. The marketing deal provides inherent value by combining Retro Infinity’s brand with NASCAR on national television and through social media at an affordable cost. The value proposition is very compelling and is expected to create significant value for the stakeholders of WRIT Media Group, Devcap, and Rick Ware Racing. NASCAR is the nation’s No. 1 spectator sport, and 17 of the top 20 most-attended sporting events in the country are NASCAR events. It is the second-most-watched sport in the United States, after the NFL. In addition to the huge number of female fans, more than 21% of fans are minorities, and more than 50% of the nation’s young people, ages 7 to 17, report they are NASCAR fans. NASCAR fans are among the most loyal. They will switch brands to be supportive of their favorite drivers or to protest other drivers. Nearly two-thirds of them willingly spend more to buy a NASCAR sponsor’s product. They see it as a way to support the sport as well as the sponsor. Female fans report they would buy non-racing-related items, such as detergent, if they had NASCAR logos on the packaging.   Distribution and Licensing Microsoft Corporation  The Company entered into a co-marketing and distribution agreement with Microsoft Corporation. The agreement will bring between fifty and five hundred classic game titles to Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 through the Windows Store and Windows Phone Store. Microsoft will co-market the release of the gaming titles via Windows.com and Windows Store promotions, Windows social marketing, and Surface Store Picks. The Company will create special versions of their titles to take advantage of Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8's unique features, including live tiles, cross-platform game data sharing, and Snap and Share. In addition, AGI's releases will support Microsoft's Windows 8.1. Roku Inc. Retro Infinity entered into a Channel Application Development and Games Distribution Agreement with Roku, the market leader in set-top streaming video players, with over 1,000 channels. Roku is the market leader in streaming entertainment devices for television, with well over 5 million users and 8 billion video streams. The agreement allows the Company to distribute a minimum of 50 classic game titles to Roku players, with an option by Roku to license up to an additional 500 titles. Roku will co-market the release of the gaming titles via Roku.com and the on-device Roku Channel Store.

Pelecoin
Pelecoin crypto-currency (“PLCN”) was originally created in 2014 with the intention of integrating classic digital (like Bitcoin) with a multi-level marketing platform. The idea had unexpected success, in the first six months, PLCN was trading at two crypto-currency exchanges with approximately half a million new Pelecoin accounts. The results of the experience encouraged its founders to continue to develop Pelecoin – a structured financial product based on optimized variety of crypto-currencies. PLCN’s crypto-currency basket is created from the top 25 crypto-currencies (with high liquidity on the leading exchanges) and is optimized for the profitability of its mining.
Most users from many countries, including India, China, Indonesia, and Russia, cannot afford the expensive equipment required for effective mining of Bitcoin or Ethereum. Pelecoin solves this problem by using modern Internet channels of promotion (like social networks) to assist in creating a big referral tree. A Pelecoin user can achieve the mining power equivalent to the most expensive mining equipment, and achieve monthly income in hundreds to thousands of US Dollars. This approach opens the crypto-currency market to millions of people from around the world, allowing them to convert their Internet and social activities into real money.

Front Row Networks
Front Row Networks (“FRN”) was incorporated on July 27, 2010 in the State of Nevada. The Company is a content creation company which produces, acquires and distributes live concerts in Ultra HD (4K) format for initial worldwide digital broadcast into digitally-enabled movie theaters. The Company presents live concerts at lower ticket prices, to a massive fan base worldwide in a cost-effective manner. Following the initial theatrical run, the distribution rights to the concerts will be licensed, in both 2D and 3D format, to DVD and Blu-Ray retailers, Free TV broadcasters, cable and emerging 3D cable channels, and mobile streaming providers. Front Row Networks will also sell merchandising and other goods and products, tailored to each Artist and to each Sponsor, in movie theaters where the live concert is exhibited.
Front Row Networks also secures and distributes non-concert alternative theatrical programming, such as animated family content, music-related documentaries, and other gaming content that can be distributed via mobile and internet platforms. It is the Company’s strategic goal to acquire the broadest range of rights for exclusive programming, we may finance all or part of the production of our entertainment programs, acquire rights to completed projects, acquire content catalogues, or acquire companies which own or control content catalogues. We believe that we are positioned to benefit from the market growth and increased demand for alternative theatrical content and mobile content, and we intend to continue expansion of our exclusive library content in the future.

Announces its Successful Beta Test Completion of Pelecoin, a New Digital Currency PlatformPR NewswireJune 5, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareLOS ANGELES, June 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- WRIT Media Group, Inc. (WRIT) announced the successful completion of Beta testing for its new digital currency Pelecoin. Pelecoin is a proprietary, structured digital currency, based on an optimized basket of the top 25 crypto-currencies. Pelecoin's proprietary algorithm optimizes currency "mining" profitability, while providing the added benefit of liquidity through the leading exchanges of digital currency.Eric Mitchell, CEO stated "The Beta-test was proven to be very successful, and the test-users aided us by suggesting some minor changes, which we have already incorporated into the product to enhance its overall functionality. Pelecoin, has now been tested and proven to generate revenue, even with a limited number of users. We are now working closely with our developers and marketing consultants to oversee the marketing launch of Pelecoin, with a July, 2017 target date. We anticipate a welcoming response from our customers and the digital currency market in general."Beta testing is a part of user acceptance testing, and is performed by the intended audience in order to receive user feedback for the product, and check if the product meets the objectives set by management. Pelecoin's Beta version was released to fifty test-users outside of the development team, using basic PC mining setups, to ensure that the product has few faults and bugs. During the limited three month Beta test, the Pelecoin platform generated over $11,000 in gross revenue to WRIT Media Group.Pelecoin is now available to the public by registering for a free Pelecoin account and downloading the Pelecoin miner in order to start mining.

(  OTCQB :  WRIT ) today announces the formal launch of Pelecoin -- a unique digital currency and the first product in a family of unprecedented cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology solutions, acquired through the previously announced Pandora Venture Capital transaction."We are pleased to introduce to market our unique Pelecoin technology, and look forward to the potential it creates not only for WRIT Media and company shareholders, but for the broader digital currency space as well," said president and CEO Eric Mitchell. "There are several advantageous ways Pelecoin differs from other digital currencies on the market, and we're excited to be part of the many advances taking place in cryptocurrency."What is PELECOIN and why is it different? Pelecoin is a cryptocurrency platform that provides secure digital currency products and services -- including wallets, exchanges, loyalty rewards, and merchant integration -- to consumers and businesses around the globe. The online platform allows users to send money to any Pelecoin wallet; send and receive Pelecoins; shop online; and to store Pelecoins. The platform also enables merchants and payment platforms to accept Pelecoin digital currency.In the current digital currency landscape, "rules of emission" prevent existing digital currencies from becoming more widely distributed and used. All known systems generate new coins (emission) in a manner that disregards the currency's market value. For example, Bitcoin generates 5 coins per minute while Litecoin generates 25 coins per minute, on a permanent basis without regard to the current value of the currency.Additionally, new coins are distributed between active users (miners) whose computers participate in the generation process. This model obligates the users to have not only a very deep knowledge of software programming, but also expensive computer equipment. As time passes, the process becomes more sophisticated and expensive, and less accessible to new miners.Pelecoin's emission system differs in that it is based on a simple proprietary algorithm, making it accessible to all and clear to its users. The system generates Pelecoins based upon a set of rules and events that increase the currency's worth, such as: new user registration; acceptance of Pelecoin for real goods or services; and trade between Pelecoins and real currencies (USD, Euro, etc.).The initial distribution of newly generated coins is based on user's participation in an event. The emission and distribution of coins follow simple rules, allowing unexperienced users to actively participate in the process and to earn significant amounts of coin in a short period of time. Instead of complicated searches for crypto configurations demanded by other crypto currency systems, Pelecoin automatically increases your account based upon your participation in a simple "value" event.How Does PELECOIN Work?New users can register online for Pelecoin, as well as fund their wallet and gain access to the platform's services, by completing a simple new user registration here: Pelecoin Registration (http://www.pelecoin.com/join.aspx?ref=bb3b24dd-dd9f-44d9-838d-0bcd5e902c33). The main dashboard includes terms of service, emission rules, frequently asked questions, and the user's Pelecoin account balance. The dashboard will also provide users with their own account ID, and describe ways to facilitate "value" events to increase their account balance. Each new user will receive 1,000 Pelecoins to get started.About Writ Media Group WRIT Media Group, Inc.
