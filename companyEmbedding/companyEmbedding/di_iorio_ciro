Ciro and his crew did an outstanding job and completed the work as promised within the time frame we discussed. His crew was extremely professional and cleaned up after themselves once all the work was completed. I will definiltey use Ciro next spring when I need my front year re-landscaped. He put in a beautiful patio in my backyard that we will enjoy for years to come. Great job Ciro!!

Mr.  DiIorio brings years of experience to the job.  He can make recommendations that not only will work in your environment, but will add a touch of uniqueness that will make your neighbors jealous!  He is scrupulously honest.  He says what he will do and does what he says.

He is a hard working guy, has a lot of ideas, has seen a lot of big projects and can bring some East Coast flair to whatever job he does.

What is the screening process that Service Professionals go through in order to become members of the HomeAdvisor network?





Verify Trade License
            HomeAdvisor checks to see if the business carries the appropriate state-level license. 
Verify Insurance
            As a part of our screening process, we encourage professionals to carry general liability insurance. We require coverage for hundreds of services. 
Verification of State Business Filings
            For business types that require a Secretary of State filing, we confirm that the business is in good standing in the state in which it is located.
Criminal Records Search
            HomeAdvisor uses 3rd party data sources to conduct a criminal search for any relevant criminal activity associated with the owner/principal of the business.
Sex Offender Search
            We confirm that the owner/principal is not listed on the official state Sex Offender web site in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located. 
Bankruptcy Search
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the history of the principal/owner of the business for bankruptcy filings by or against them.
Legal Search for Civil Judgments
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the principal/owner of the business for state level civil legal judgments entered against them.
Liens Search
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the principal/owner of the business for liens placed against them.
Identity Verification (SSN)
            HomeAdvisor verifies the social security number(s) of the owner/principal for identity check purposes. This check applies primarily to smaller business entities.
Identity Verification (Reverse Phone Lookup)
            We conduct a reverse business phone lookup to identify records matching the phone number information provided by the business.








NOTE: Member service professional information confirmed as described above may change or expire over time; while HomeAdvisor attempts to maintain accurate and up-to-date information, and confirms changes when notified, we cannot guarantee that profile and screening information is accurate.

Criminal Records Search
HomeAdvisor uses third-party sources to conduct a criminal search, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, for relevant criminal activity associated with the business owner/principal within three years prior to application.




State Business Filings
We confirm that service professionals applying as corporations or limited liability companies are in good standing in the state in which they are located.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 03/13/2017
            

                BBB has determined that Ciro Diiorio Masonry and Landscaping LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
