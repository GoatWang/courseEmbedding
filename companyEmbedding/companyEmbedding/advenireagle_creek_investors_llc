Warranty 



Eagle Creek is synonymous with quality. Every buckle, zipper, and fabric choice is meticulously selected and then analyzed after rigorous lab testing. After it’s built, we take it to the road to make sure it can handle real-world travel abuse. And it does. Our return rate is less than 1%
   Our Warranty Promise

  No Matter What™ Warranty

Our No Matter What™ Warranty covers the Lifetime Warranty promise plus the added insurance of repair or replacement due to product failure during the product lifetime, regardless of the cause. During this period, we will repair or replace it at our discretion. Contents of your bag are excluded, as are lost or stolen parts (such as zip-off daypack, backpack straps, Cargo Net, etc.) 


  Lifetime Warranty

Our Lifetime Warranty covers workmanship and materials against defect for the entire life of the product. During this period, if the product is covered by the warranty, we will repair or replace it at our discretion. Contents of your bag, normal wear and tear, abuse and cosmetic wear and tear are excluded. ‘Lifetime’ is defined as the lifetime of the product not of the purchaser. 


  What is specifically covered?

We build our products to last over extended periods of use, but inevitably everything does eventually wear out. Fabrics will deteriorate and fade and moving parts will wear out. All gear will suffer from differing degrees of wear-and-tear, depending upon use. Gear used by an adventure travel guide for 200 days of the year will, by comparison, degrade faster than gear used by someone who travels 2 to 3 times a year.
By taking care of your products you will ensure longer lifetime for your gear. Visit Caring for Your Eagle Creek Product for information on how to clean, care for, and store your gear. Use your judgment when assessing whether your product is likely to be covered under our warranty policy. It may simply be time to replace it.
We will cover your product against defect and malfunction until such a time that it has been used and worn out beyond reasonable repair.
This warranty does not cover, normal wear and tear, or the natural breakdown of colors and materials over extended time and use. Accident, improper care, negligence are excluded. Normal wear and tear is the wear and tear caused by the expected use of the bag over an extended period of time. There are a few factors that determine the end of “product life”. (1) Fabric: Product fabric makes up 90% of most Eagle Creek products. If the fabric is discolored, degraded, de-laminated or deteriorated we may determine this to be end of “product life”. (2) If a major component fails due to years of use (such as a handle, wheel or zipper) we may deem the product to have met its full life cycle.
Damage not covered under the Lifetime Warranty that is repairable can be repaired for a reasonable rate and a fee will be charged for return shipping. We have Certified Repair Centers that utilize the same type of machinery and processes used in our factory to create the original product. One of these facilities may be closer to you than the Eagle Creek on-site warranty department.
*California State Law requires that all items sent for repair to be clean. Only clean items will be repaired by our team. 


  What does Defect or Malfunction Mean?

Defects in materials or workmanship are covered for the practical lifetime of the product. Material refers to zippers, buckles and fabrics, etc. Workmanship refers to seams, and construction. Damage due to wear and tear such as rips, tears, abrasion or UV degradation, misuse or neglect is not covered under our warranty policy but may be repairable for a fee. 


  What does Product Failure mean?

Product failure can happen when the components are stressed outside of their design specifications and are no longer able to function in the manner originally stated. For instance, Eagle Creek wheels can withstand cobblestone streets, but are not built to be run-over by a train. The fabrics are meant to withstand heavy abrasion, but not a sanding belt.

When we receive your product, if it is covered under our warranty, we will repair it or replace it with an available product of similar features and value
We will send it back to you at no charge.
Please note this on the outside of your package in clear, bold letters. Attn: Warranty Dept, It will help us to track your product during its visit to one of our repair facilities.
Letter of explanation: Please enclose a letter of explanation that includes: Contact name, repair type, the, return ship-to address, phone number, e-mail address (Required if you want automated notifications when your product is shipped back) and any other special instructions, like: Rush or Please Do Not Replace
Care and handling instructions: By law a clean product is required (and more pleasant) for our technicians to work with. We recommend you hand-wash your item with a mild soap and line dry. Avoid brushing the exterior or the inside fabric coating with a stiff brush, instead use a soft sponge or cloth. Do not use bleach as this could damage the fabric and the coating. Do not put it in the washing machine or dryer!
 

  Caring for Your Eagle Creek Product

  Cleaning your Product Properly:

Dirt and grime will abrade the fabric and wear it out. For cleaning, use a sponge with warm water. Always use a non-detergent soap. Most liquid soaps contain detergents, powdered soaps are preferred because they usually do not. To dry your bag stuff it loosely with crumpled-up paper, and hang it in the shade. To preserve the integrity of the fabric coating inside of the bag, the interior should only be cleaned with a damp cloth (no soap). Lastly, it is essential that your product is completely dry before you store it. 


  Never Machine Wash Your Product:

Unless stated otherwise on the care label, never machine wash or machine dry your travel gear or accessories. Never use hot water, bleach, dishwashing liquid, pre-soaking solutions, or spot removers. Always use a powdered non-detergent soap. Never use solvents to clean your gear or accessories as solvents may irreparably damage the materials and components of your product. *Any use of solvents will void Eagle Creek’s Lifetime and No Matter What™ Warranties. 


  Zipper Maintenance:

Keep your zippers clean, free of sand and grit, and out of the dirt. This will help them last much longer. 


  Storing Your Product:

Before storing your Eagle Creek gear bag or travel accessories always make sure they are clean and dry. Never pack or store your gear or accessories if they are dirty or damp. Wet or damp fabric can mildew, causing delamination, leaks, and foul odors. There is no cure for mildew damage. Storing your gear or accessories while they are damp could cause the polyurethane coating to soften and stick to itself (a chemical reaction called hydrolysis). With prolonged exposure to moisture, the coating will become sticky and is likely to peel away from the fabric. In caring for your bag it is also important to keep your pets away from your bag. They smell your scent and know it’s your bag. Somehow they also know that it is your companion when you are away from home, and tend to mark it. Many types of pet urine have a strong odor and cannot be washed out of your bag… so unfortunately you will end up traveling with the memory of your pet the entire life of the product. Odors, scratches, fading and scuffs are considered cosmetic damage because they do not affect the function of the bag and so are therefore not covered under the Eagle Creek Warranties. Store your gear and accessories in a cool, dry, temperate environment. Do not stack heavy objects on top of your gear and accessories and, if possible, stuff bags with clothing or crumpled-up paper to help maintain shape.

Company with 305 employees and regional offices in Florida, Texas, and

development and rehabilitation.   












Investment Criteria Advenir's acquisition focus is on mid 1980s vintage or newer Class “A” and “B” value-add multi-family assets in locations that feature strong infill dynamics, established competition, population in-migration, job growth, and high barriers to entry. The intrinsic value of these assets is unlocked through a combination of sound financing strategies, calculated renovations and aggressive management.Key factors that drive Advenir's investments are:Purchase multifamily assets well below replacement costs in markets with high barriers to entrySeek favorable debt terms in current capital market conditionsCreate value through superior operational execution and sell at peak periodsLeverage dynamic markets to increase net operating incomeBe best in our competitive set, and compete with class A product at a significant rental discountFoster co-beneficial and long-term relationships with sellers and brokersEstablish a reputation as a known and trusted buyer in our target markets

Warranty 



Eagle Creek is synonymous with quality. Every buckle, zipper, and fabric choice is meticulously selected and then analyzed after rigorous lab testing. After it’s built, we take it to the road to make sure it can handle real-world travel abuse. And it does. Our return rate is less than 1%
   Our Warranty Promise

  No Matter What™ Warranty

Our No Matter What™ Warranty covers the Lifetime Warranty promise plus the added insurance of repair or replacement due to product failure during the product lifetime, regardless of the cause. During this period, we will repair or replace it at our discretion. Contents of your bag are excluded, as are lost or stolen parts (such as zip-off daypack, backpack straps, Cargo Net, etc.) 


  Lifetime Warranty

Our Lifetime Warranty covers workmanship and materials against defect for the entire life of the product. During this period, if the product is covered by the warranty, we will repair or replace it at our discretion. Contents of your bag, normal wear and tear, abuse and cosmetic wear and tear are excluded. ‘Lifetime’ is defined as the lifetime of the product not of the purchaser. 


  What is specifically covered?

We build our products to last over extended periods of use, but inevitably everything does eventually wear out. Fabrics will deteriorate and fade and moving parts will wear out. All gear will suffer from differing degrees of wear-and-tear, depending upon use. Gear used by an adventure travel guide for 200 days of the year will, by comparison, degrade faster than gear used by someone who travels 2 to 3 times a year.
By taking care of your products you will ensure longer lifetime for your gear. Visit Caring for Your Eagle Creek Product for information on how to clean, care for, and store your gear. Use your judgment when assessing whether your product is likely to be covered under our warranty policy. It may simply be time to replace it.
We will cover your product against defect and malfunction until such a time that it has been used and worn out beyond reasonable repair.
This warranty does not cover, normal wear and tear, or the natural breakdown of colors and materials over extended time and use. Accident, improper care, negligence are excluded. Normal wear and tear is the wear and tear caused by the expected use of the bag over an extended period of time. There are a few factors that determine the end of “product life”. (1) Fabric: Product fabric makes up 90% of most Eagle Creek products. If the fabric is discolored, degraded, de-laminated or deteriorated we may determine this to be end of “product life”. (2) If a major component fails due to years of use (such as a handle, wheel or zipper) we may deem the product to have met its full life cycle.
Damage not covered under the Lifetime Warranty that is repairable can be repaired for a reasonable rate and a fee will be charged for return shipping. We have Certified Repair Centers that utilize the same type of machinery and processes used in our factory to create the original product. One of these facilities may be closer to you than the Eagle Creek on-site warranty department.
*California State Law requires that all items sent for repair to be clean. Only clean items will be repaired by our team. 


  What does Defect or Malfunction Mean?

Defects in materials or workmanship are covered for the practical lifetime of the product. Material refers to zippers, buckles and fabrics, etc. Workmanship refers to seams, and construction. Damage due to wear and tear such as rips, tears, abrasion or UV degradation, misuse or neglect is not covered under our warranty policy but may be repairable for a fee. 


  What does Product Failure mean?

Product failure can happen when the components are stressed outside of their design specifications and are no longer able to function in the manner originally stated. For instance, Eagle Creek wheels can withstand cobblestone streets, but are not built to be run-over by a train. The fabrics are meant to withstand heavy abrasion, but not a sanding belt.

Avoid brushing the exterior or the inside fabric coating with a stiff brush, instead use a soft sponge or cloth. Do not use bleach as this could damage the fabric and the coating. Do not put it in the washing machine or dryer!
 

  Caring for Your Eagle Creek Product

  Cleaning your Product Properly:

Dirt and grime will abrade the fabric and wear it out. For cleaning, use a sponge with warm water. Always use a non-detergent soap. Most liquid soaps contain detergents, powdered soaps are preferred because they usually do not. To dry your bag stuff it loosely with crumpled-up paper, and hang it in the shade. To preserve the integrity of the fabric coating inside of the bag, the interior should only be cleaned with a damp cloth (no soap). Lastly, it is essential that your product is completely dry before you store it. 


  Never Machine Wash Your Product:

Unless stated otherwise on the care label, never machine wash or machine dry your travel gear or accessories. Never use hot water, bleach, dishwashing liquid, pre-soaking solutions, or spot removers. Always use a powdered non-detergent soap. Never use solvents to clean your gear or accessories as solvents may irreparably damage the materials and components of your product. *Any use of solvents will void Eagle Creek’s Lifetime and No Matter What™ Warranties. 


  Zipper Maintenance:

Keep your zippers clean, free of sand and grit, and out of the dirt. This will help them last much longer. 


  Storing Your Product:

Before storing your Eagle Creek gear bag or travel accessories always make sure they are clean and dry. Never pack or store your gear or accessories if they are dirty or damp. Wet or damp fabric can mildew, causing delamination, leaks, and foul odors. There is no cure for mildew damage. Storing your gear or accessories while they are damp could cause the polyurethane coating to soften and stick to itself (a chemical reaction called hydrolysis). With prolonged exposure to moisture, the coating will become sticky and is likely to peel away from the fabric. In caring for your bag it is also important to keep your pets away from your bag. They smell your scent and know it’s your bag. Somehow they also know that it is your companion when you are away from home, and tend to mark it. Many types of pet urine have a strong odor and cannot be washed out of your bag… so unfortunately you will end up traveling with the memory of your pet the entire life of the product. Odors, scratches, fading and scuffs are considered cosmetic damage because they do not affect the function of the bag and so are therefore not covered under the Eagle Creek Warranties. Store your gear and accessories in a cool, dry, temperate environment. Do not stack heavy objects on top of your gear and accessories and, if possible, stuff bags with clothing or crumpled-up paper to help maintain shape.
