General Moly, Inc. (AMEX:GMO)Intraday Stock Chart
Today : Friday 21 July 2017



LAKEWOOD, Colo., July 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- General Moly, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE MKT and TSX: GMO), the only western exchange listed, pure-play molybdenum mineral development company, announced that the Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") has published its Notice of Intent ("NOI") to complete a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement ("Supplemental EIS") for General Moly's majority-owned Mt. Hope Project. The Supplemental EIS will address concerns raised by the December 28, 2016 Opinion of the U.S Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ("Ninth Circuit").  
The NOI was published in the Federal Register on July 19, 2017. The Company has been working closely with the BLM to resolve the technical matters noted by the Ninth Circuit under the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA").  
Bruce D. Hansen, Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased that the Supplemental EIS process is underway as evidenced by the publication of the NOI. We look forward to receiving the Record of Decision, and anticipate this approval in late 2017, or early 2018. This time frame could align with the continuing gradual recovery of the molybdenum market. Our internal go-ahead decision for construction will require a sustained period of higher molybdenum prices and re-instatement of water permits from the state of Nevada, followed by approval from the Board of Directors."
With the publication of the NOI, the public is informed of the Supplemental EIS's proposed scope to provide updated information regarding certain air quality data and analysis used in the original EIS, and to also provide clarification regarding the existence and status of any Public Water Reserves, which may be potentially impacted by the Mt. Hope Project. The Ninth Circuit affirmed all other aspects of the original EIS.
After a draft of the Supplemental EIS is completed, the BLM will publish a Notice of the Availability (NOA) of the Draft Supplemental EIS in the Federal Register for public review and comment, specific only to the narrow scope of the Supplemental EIS. Thereafter, the BLM will address substantive comments and any additional analysis will then be incorporated into the Final Supplemental EIS.  Once the Final Supplemental EIS is completed the BLM will again publish an NOA in the Federal Register.  Thereafter, it is anticipated that the BLM will reissue a Record of Decision authorizing the construction and operation of the Mt. Hope Project.  
About General Moly
General Moly is a U.S.-based molybdenum mineral development, exploration and mining company listed on the NYSE MKT and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol GMO. The Company's primary asset, an 80% interest in the Mt. Hope Project located in central Nevada, is considered one of the world's largest and highest grade molybdenum deposits. Combined with the Company's wholly-owned Liberty Project, a molybdenum and copper property also located in central Nevada, General Moly's goal is to become the largest pure play primary molybdenum producer in the world.  
Molybdenum is a metallic element used primarily as an alloy agent in steel manufacturing. When added to steel, molybdenum enhances steel strength, resistance to corrosion and extreme temperature performance. In the chemical and petrochemical industries, molybdenum is used in catalysts, especially for cleaner burning fuels by removing sulfur from liquid fuels, and in corrosion inhibitors, high performance lubricants and polymers.

The Company is very pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Michael Iannacchione as the new General Manager at the Florida Canyon mine.  Mr. Michael Iannacchione has over 30 years of experience in the mining industry, 25 years of which has been at a management level.  Mike was the Vice President General Manager for General Moly’s Mt.

	MOLYBDENUM

	Molybdenum (“moly”) is a metallic element used primarily as an alloy agent in steel manufacturing.  When added to steel, moly enhances steel strength, resistance to corrosion, and extreme temperature performance.  Within the chemical industry, moly has an important role in the petroleum refining process, acting as a cracking agent to remove sulfur from liquid fuels.

 LAKEWOOD, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May. 15, 2013--
      General
      Moly, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE MKT and TSX: GMO), a U.S.-based
      molybdenum mineral development, exploration and mining company, provided
      an update on finance activities.
    

      On May 14, 2013, General Moly and Hanlong (USA) Mining (“Hanlong”)
      mutually agreed to terminate a $125 million subordinated loan agreement
      intended to supplement a $665 million Chinese sourced term loan for the
      financing of the Mt. Hope Project. The subordinated loan agreement,
      which would have become available upon receipt of the Chinese sourced
      term loan, was terminated to provide General Moly with greater
      flexibility in securing an additional Chinese strategic partner. The
      termination of the subordinated loan agreement also cancels the
      arrangement fee of $6.25 million payable upon closing of a Chinese
      sourced term loan. Further, the warrant with a 2.5 year maturity to
      purchase ten million shares of General Moly common stock at a strike
      price of $4.23 per share was terminated.
    

Bruce D. Hansen, Chief Executive Officer of General Moly, said,
      “Hanlong’s cooperation and assistance is appreciated as we move forward
      to secure another Chinese strategic partner capable of advancing the
      full financing of the Mt. Hope Project and reinvigorating advanced stage
      loan negotiations with China Development Bank.”
    

      Mr. Hansen added, “Our efforts to secure such a strategic partner are
      incrementally enhanced by the elimination of these warrants which
      reduces the potential for future dilution. We are actively marketing the
      Mt. Hope Project as a fully permitted, construction-ready, high grade /
      lower cost molybdenum deposit supported by our joint venture partner
      POS-Minerals, and recently attracted a number of parties in China who
      are beginning to engage in due diligence.”
    

      Mr. Hansen concluded, “We are also in discussions to negotiate an
      equipment lease agreement on the mobile mining fleet to replace all or
      part of the subordinated loan agreement component of our Mt. Hope
      Project finance plan.”
    

      In a previous project financing update, the Company reported that on
      March 20, 2013, the Company was notified that China Development Bank had
      provided instructions to its legal counsel to suspend work on the $665
      million term loan. This suspension relates to reports that Mr. Liu Han,
      Founder of Sichuan Hanlong Group has been detained by Chinese
      authorities.
    

General Moly is a U.S.-based molybdenum mineral development, exploration
      and mining company listed on the NYSE MKT (formerly the NYSE AMEX) and
      the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol GMO. Our primary asset, our
      interest in the Mt.
      Hope�Project located in central Nevada, is considered one of the
      world's largest and highest grade molybdenum
      deposits. Combined with our second molybdenum property, the Liberty
      Project that is also located in central Nevada, our goal is to become
      the largest pure play primary molybdenum producer in the world. For more
      information on the Company, please visit our website at http://www.generalmoly.com.

Latest News
 LAKEWOOD, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 9, 2013--
      General
      Moly, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE MKT and TSX: GMO), a U.S.-based
      molybdenum mineral development, exploration and mining company,
      announced that it has implemented a cost reduction program to preserve
      liquidity while actively pursuing financing options for the Mt. Hope
      Project. The Company will continue to maintain its permits in good
      standing and preserve the capacity to rapidly restart engineering,
      procurement and construction at Mt. Hope after completing full project
      financing.
    

      Specific provisions of the cost reduction program include:
    


        25% reduction in base cash compensation for the CEO and members of the
        Board of Directors with other senior employees receiving 10 to 20%
        salary reductions.
      

        Prudent focus on reducing all other expenditures including
        engineering, administrative and procurement expenses.
      

General Moly has implemented a personnel retention program to
        facilitate due-diligence by potential lenders and investors and for
        the start of full construction activities at Mt. Hope. In parallel
        with compensation reductions, the Company has provided cash and equity
        incentives for employees who remain with General Moly through January
        15th, 2015 or earlier under certain circumstances.
      


Bruce D. Hansen, Chief Executive Officer, said, "As we continue to
      develop a full financing package that provides the best outcomes for our
      stockholders in the current market, the Company is taking prudent steps
      to reduce planned expenditures that maximize our financial flexibility
      and secure readiness for the rapid start of construction activities at
      Mt. Hope. Our carefully crafted program maintains liquidity by reducing
      engineering, administrative and procurement expenses, trimming our
      expenditures from $2-3 million per month to less than $1.5 million per
      month.”
    

      Mr. Hansen added, "The Company is actively pursuing a number of
      financing options we believe are executable, with a focus on minimizing
      dilution, long term cost and risk to stockholders, but acknowledge that
      these alternatives will take time to complete. In this regard, our Board
      has also established an Independent Finance Committee to actively review
      all potential finance options and alternatives. Given that the
      fully-permitted Mt. Hope Project is construction ready and backed by
      off-take agreements and a strong joint venture partner, we believe the
      Company is well positioned to execute full project financing."
    

      Mr. Hansen concluded, “In addition, engineering at Mt. Hope is advanced
      to a point of six months ahead of construction activities, and can now
      be hibernated and resumed when finance is secured without jeopardizing a
      rapid start of construction.”
    

The Mt Hope Project remains one of the world’s best and largest
      undeveloped moly projects, and is fully permitted and construction
      ready. Currently, the Company is updating its resource models, mine plan
      and project economics, in conjunction with ongoing due-diligence. This
      updating effort is expected to be complete early in the fourth quarter
      and will assist in the financing effort.�Once the full financing is
      completed the construction of Mt. Hope will take approximately 2 years,
      and at full production on a 100% basis, the Project will�have the
      capacity to produce approximately 40 million lbs per year of moly metal.

      and mining company listed on the NYSE MKT (formerly the NYSE AMEX) and

Interesting GMO Call Options For December 18th

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
