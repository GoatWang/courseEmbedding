True Male Enhancement Supplements Revealed

How You Really Can Achieve Harder, Stronger, Longer-Lasting Erections And Improve Your Sex Drive.


                    
                    

Updated 7:26 PM EST, Mon May 23, 2016.





Tom Stakleff
Senior Researcher
Mens Health and Wellness

                      I’ve probably said this to you before, but I’ll say it again: As the Senior Researcher for Men’s Health and Wellness at Supplement Review Digest, my mission is to empower you with knowledge that will help you find the best natural supplements. I want you to be able to solve your problems and change your life for the better. In regards to us men, that means I have to address some issues that none of us like to talk about—like decreased sex drive, the inability to get and stay hard, and the confusing male enhancement industry.
                
                Millions of men around the world are afflicted by age-related issues that make it difficult to gain and sustain an erection. Most of these men are between the ages of 40 and 80, like me. There are various causes of our pain, but the effects are all the same: we feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed, and sexually frustrated. There’s nothing more emasculating than not being able to perform for our partners. Today, I’m going to help you find REAL solutions that thousands of other men have used to reinvigorate their sex lives.
First, it’s important to understand that it’s not your fault. Don’t be ashamed. The challenge of getting a hard, lasting erection is something that just naturally happens to men of our age group. You haven’t failed your partner unless you do nothing about it—but you’re reading this right now because you WILL do something about it. So, keep your head up. The struggle to stay positive is one of the first hurdles you need to get over to improve your sex life.
The next hurdle is navigating the ludicrous male enhancement market. You’ve seen all the false claims out there. Every company says they have all the answers. You could easily develop a distrust of the entire industry. A quick bit of research on PubMed (or even just Wikipedia or WebMD) will lead you to information about how some herbs really do help with sex drive and erection strength, so there must be some legitimate supplements out there. The struggle is in finding a company has the right combinations of highly-concentrated herbs, backed by research and science, and that other men use again and again because it works.
It’s no wonder I’ve gotten so many emails asking what male enhancement pills I recommend. Some of you are so sick of the malarkey that you’re ready to resort to the “blue pill.” I’m happy to tell you that you don’t have to. You don’t need to suffer from extreme headaches just to get an erection and satisfy your partner.
I’m answering your calls for help today. There ARE effective male enhancement supplements out there, and I’m going to help you find them. You can spend your money on something that is a legitimate investment in yourself and your health. Best of all, you can attain the sexual satisfaction you deserve.
The Science of Erections
You probably already know this by now, but I’m going to rehash it just in case: there are chambers in the penis that fill up with blood to make it erect. The full process is a little bit more complicated than that, but that’s the important part. So, to find an effective supplement, you need to find something that helps the blood fill the chambers and keeps them filled.
There are several factors that can complicate this process. Some of the factors are mental (depression, stress, anxiety), some are physical (circulation, hormones, diabetes). A good supplement will address these factors and counteract any effect they might be having on your sex drive.

How to Spot a Scam
               These are my top 5 red flags I use to avoid throwing money away:
            
             1. PRESCRIPTION STRENGTH. This might be obvious, but be mindful of any herbal supplement that exaggerates its effectiveness. If a company is trying to tell you that their supplement can run side-by-side with a prescription drug, immediately look to its ingredients and user reviews and let common sense be your guide.
            


2. FREE TRIAL. When a company offers to give you a free product and asks you to just pay for shipping, they enter you into a subscription as soon as you give them your credit card info. The subscription becomes nearly impossible to cancel. So, whether the product works or not, you’re stuck paying for it again and again.

       
          3. THE PRODUCT PROMISES TO ADD INCHES TO YOUR MEMBER. As I mentioned before, every penis has chambers that fill up with blood during an erection. Those chambers determine the size of an erect penis. Aside from surgery, there is no way to change the size of those chambers. There is no magic pill that permanently adds inches and girth. Some supplements will claim to “maximize size.” That’s different——that just means they promise their pill will help fully fill the existing chambers.
          
       4. IF THE WEBSITE LOOKS AMATEUR. This one is probably obvious. If the site has simple coding errors where buttons don’t line up or if there are obvious misspellings all over, be warned. If a company can’t afford to hire a decent web designer, how can they afford to develop an effective supplement?
       
         5. IF IT’S NOT MADE IN AMERICA. Foreign-made products are not subject to FDA scrutiny and might be full of ingredients that are completely worthless, or are rendered worthless by sitting in shipping crates on container ships for months at a time. Some of these supplements may do more harm than good.
          
       

How to Spot a Life-Changer
There are multiple ways to identify a good product. I reveal my full process in identifying good products later in this article. For now, here’s a general rule: Rather than look at the ingredients in the product, look at the research behind the ingredients. Don’t trust a company that doesn’t do its homework, or that won’t show it to you. A credible company will share their research with you. You know they’re confident in their product if they demonstrate that they have nothing to hide. They will be able to show you exactly how the ingredients in their product will get you these results:

  
Harder, Longer-Lasting Erections 
Improved Sex Drive 
Maximized Size 
Boosted Mood & Confidence 
Satisfied Partners 
More Intimate Love Life 
Sexual Satisfaction 



How We Rated Our Winners
Now that I have helped you avoid the time and money wasters, it’s time to fill you in on how MY search for effective supplements went. The male enhancement market is HUGE. My research team and I sorted through hundreds of the supplements out there. I’m ready to help you find the good ones.
At Supplement Review Digest, we’ve shopped around and seen it all so that you don’t have to. We’ve selected the Top 3 male enhancement supplements that I believe are actually worth your money.
These brands were selected based on the research, safety, and effectiveness of their chosen ingredients, consistently high customer reviews, and how well they performed in our in-house double-blind trials against placebos. 
My team had two groups take pills for 4 months (one group took a product, the other a placebo) and report back to us weekly with their results. Our male enhancement groups had individuals who reported improvements in ability to get and maintain erections. The placebo groups reported no gains. 
We ranked the products by which group had the highest number of erection-achieving men at the end of the trial period and by these 10 factors:


1. Customer Reviews
2. Purity of Ingredients
3. Are FDA Guidelines Followed


4. Research & Scientific Evidence
5. Speed of Expected Result
6. Customer Service


7. Types of Ingredients in Formula
8. Price
9. Return Policy

Steel Libido Red from Irvin Naturals has been on the market for a few years now. It’s a follow up formula to their original Steel Libido product. You can still buy the original formula however, we found that most customers prefer the new “Red” formula.
Experiment Results: 14 out of 20 men reported erection improvements over 4 months achieved the "same results as the number 2 choice in our trial, but when we had a staff member call their customer support pretending to be a dissatisfied customer, we were unimpressed with their service, so we used that as the tie-breaker.” ~70% Success Rate.

Irvin Natural’s a trusted brand and has been a staple for many men. It has positive feedback from users but not as strong as some of the other products on our list.
For best results, its recommended to take 4 softgels 60 minutes before sexual activity. The is 18.75 serving per bottle.
It is our number 3 choice. To read the full review just click Learn More.

Male Enhancement Buyer’s Guide
for March 2015

How To Choose An ED Supplement, That Effectively Increases Men’s Sex Drive, Erection Size,  Erection Hardness and Erection Strength.
                    
March 23, 2014
Supplement Review Digest does not often review products in the male enhancement category, but since we have received a ton of requests from men wanting our opinion on what is the most effectively male enhancement supplement on the market today, we decided to investigate and find out if these pills really live up to their claims.





(Shopping for male enhancement products can be downright difficult)


Improving bedroom performance is one of those things that every male looks for, especially if it can be done safely and without any side effects. As you get into your 40’s, the general work/life related stress levels rise, and it is natural for your libido to slow and firmness to go, in fact the national health research indicates erectile dysfunction happens to over 78% of males over 40. What this means for you is that about 8 out of 10 of your male friends over 40 are also experiencing this.                    
It is not  surprising that millions of men are turning to natural Male Enhancement for a solution. According to McKinney and Co.  Male Enhancement Industry is valued at $1.3 billion, and is projected to grow 5 or 6 percent a year through 2017.
But what we found was even with so many men purchasing these male enhancement again and again, there are a ton of reviews from disappointed customers that can be found all over the web. If there is one thing we don’t like, it's companies taking advantage of this trend by selling low grade, and  effective ED supplements.                    
As it turns out, many brands use their existing reputation and marketing-budgets to sell you medium quality products. Even worse, some put dangerous fillers such as Hydrogenated Oils and Titanium Dioxide. On the other hand some companies honestly do try to provide good quality products by using highest quality ingrediants with the same dosages as were used in human studies.
At first it may seem counterintuitive that  big brands would sell a low quality product, or that a product would be on the market without result tests, but since these are “Natural Extracts” these companies are not legally required to research results. 
The good part is We Did the reseach for you! You, our readers Identified the bellow as the most important benefits:
              1. You want to Get A Firmer Erection
2. Last Longer
3. and Increase your size
                    
                    We’ve researched the Top Erectile Dysfunction and male enhancement supplements available, and identified the top 3  products tht users said have helped them achieve these results:

If there is one thing we don’t like, it's companies taking advantage of this trend by selling low grade, and  effective ED supplements.                    
As it turns out, many brands use their existing reputation and marketing-budgets to sell you medium quality products. Even worse, some put dangerous fillers such as Hydrogenated Oils and Titanium Dioxide. On the other hand some companies honestly do try to provide good quality products by using highest quality ingrediants with the same dosages as were used in human studies.
At first it may seem counterintuitive that  big brands would sell a low quality product, or that a product would be on the market without result tests, but since these are “Natural Extracts” these companies are not legally required to research results. 
The good part is We Did the reseach for you! You, our readers Identified the bellow as the most important benefits:

It's our top pick for the best male enhancement supplement of 2015. 

Users claim to have stronger and larger erections than ever before. Many of the users over 50 also report having an increased sex drive at an all time high and a better performance in the bedroom.

Older men say that they feel like  they are in their early 20s after an average of 1 to 3 weeks of use.

Some users report having tried many different supplements and ASOX9 to be the only one to get them completely hard and actually work for them.
Do we recomemnd it? Absolutely, it is one of the few products that users claim actually works and there is good reason for it... The Formula.

High T Black is the newest product from the King Fisher Company. According to their website, it improves sex drive and libido, strength and stamina, energy and vitality, and nitric oxide and muscle mass. 

Most users report having positive results but not as good as the claims on King Fishers website. They say that it works best if taken for 2 weeks straight or longer. 
Most mentioned benefit that we found from users was energy. The product contains 200mg of caffeine (about 2 cups of coffee) per serving.  The downside to this is if you are sensitive to caffeine, this is not a good choice for you. Also, the added caffeine could is bit dangerous for the heart. Thus, anyone with heart issues should check with their doctor prior to use.
The main ingredients include Fenugreek, Eurycoma Longfolia Extra, Rhodiola Rosea Extract, and Arginine-Arginine Alphaketoglutarate. For best results, the company recommends to taking 4 capsules per daily with water along with following a exercise routine.

Male Enhancement Buyer’s Guide
for March 2015

How To Choose An ED Supplement, That Effectively Increases Men’s Sex Drive, Erection Size,  Erection Hardness and Erection Strength.
                    
March 23, 2014
Supplement Review Digest does not often review products in the male enhancement category, but since we have received a ton of requests from men wanting our opinion on what is the most effectively male enhancement supplement on the market today, we decided to investigate and find out if these pills really live up to their claims.





(Shopping for male enhancement products can be downright difficult)


Improving bedroom performance is one of those things that every male looks for, especially if it can be done safely and without any side effects. As you get into your 40’s, the general work/life related stress levels rise, and it is natural for your libido to slow and firmness to go, in fact the national health research indicates erectile dysfunction happens to over 78% of males over 40. What this means for you is that about 8 out of 10 of your male friends over 40 are also experiencing this.                    
It is not  surprising that millions of men are turning to natural Male Enhancement for a solution. According to McKinney and Co.  Male Enhancement Industry is valued at $1.3 billion, and is projected to grow 5 or 6 percent a year through 2017.
But what we found was even with so many men purchasing these male enhancement again and again, there are a ton of reviews from disappointed customers that can be found all over the web.

			Mr. Loughry served as Vice-Chairman of the Company until his retirement on December 31, 2007, a position he had held since March 15, 2006, following the merger between the Company and Cavalry Bancorp. Mr. Loughry joined Cavalry Banking in 1968 and served as president and chief executive officer of Cavalry Banking from 1982 until its merger with the Bank in March 2006.  He also served as president and chief executive officer of Cavalry Bancorp, a SEC registered public company that was Cavalry Banking's parent corporation, from its inception in 1998 until its merger with the Company in March 2006.

 

Mr. Loughry received his Bachelor of Science degree in finance from The University of Tennessee.





Mr. Loughry has served on the boards of directors of the Rutherford County Chamber of Commerce, the United Way, the Heart Fund, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (Nashville branch), the American Bankers Association board and the ABA Bank Pac board. He is past Chairman of the Tennessee Bankers Association. He also received the Leader in Banking Excellence award from the Tennessee Bankers Association. He is also currently serving on the Middle Tennessee Medical Center board and the Christy-Houston Foundation. He was selected Business Person of the Year in 1993 and Business Legend in 2000 by the Rutherford County Chamber of Commerce.

 

Mr. Loughry's extensive banking experience, including having served as the president and a director of Cavalry, brings to the Board valuable insight into the day to day operations of a financial institution and a deep understanding of the banking industry generally and of the Company's market area specifically.  His institutional knowledge of all operational aspects of Cavalry's business prior to its merger with the Company and his experience as past chairman of the Tennessee Bankers Association are both valuable to the Board. He is widely respected among Tennessee community bankers and provides valuable industry knowledge to Board strategic deliberations.

True Male Enhancement Supplements Revealed

How You Really Can Achieve Harder, Stronger, Longer-Lasting Erections And Improve Your Sex Drive.


                    
                    

Updated 7:26 PM EST, Mon May 23, 2016.





Tom Stakleff
Senior Researcher
Mens Health and Wellness

                      I’ve probably said this to you before, but I’ll say it again: As the Senior Researcher for Men’s Health and Wellness at Supplement Review Digest, my mission is to empower you with knowledge that will help you find the best natural supplements. I want you to be able to solve your problems and change your life for the better. In regards to us men, that means I have to address some issues that none of us like to talk about—like decreased sex drive, the inability to get and stay hard, and the confusing male enhancement industry.
                
                Millions of men around the world are afflicted by age-related issues that make it difficult to gain and sustain an erection. Most of these men are between the ages of 40 and 80, like me. There are various causes of our pain, but the effects are all the same: we feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed, and sexually frustrated. There’s nothing more emasculating than not being able to perform for our partners. Today, I’m going to help you find REAL solutions that thousands of other men have used to reinvigorate their sex lives.
First, it’s important to understand that it’s not your fault. Don’t be ashamed. The challenge of getting a hard, lasting erection is something that just naturally happens to men of our age group. You haven’t failed your partner unless you do nothing about it—but you’re reading this right now because you WILL do something about it. So, keep your head up. The struggle to stay positive is one of the first hurdles you need to get over to improve your sex life.
The next hurdle is navigating the ludicrous male enhancement market. You’ve seen all the false claims out there. Every company says they have all the answers. You could easily develop a distrust of the entire industry. A quick bit of research on PubMed (or even just Wikipedia or WebMD) will lead you to information about how some herbs really do help with sex drive and erection strength, so there must be some legitimate supplements out there. The struggle is in finding a company has the right combinations of highly-concentrated herbs, backed by research and science, and that other men use again and again because it works.
It’s no wonder I’ve gotten so many emails asking what male enhancement pills I recommend. Some of you are so sick of the malarkey that you’re ready to resort to the “blue pill.” I’m happy to tell you that you don’t have to. You don’t need to suffer from extreme headaches just to get an erection and satisfy your partner.
I’m answering your calls for help today. There ARE effective male enhancement supplements out there, and I’m going to help you find them. You can spend your money on something that is a legitimate investment in yourself and your health. Best of all, you can attain the sexual satisfaction you deserve.
The Science of Erections
You probably already know this by now, but I’m going to rehash it just in case: there are chambers in the penis that fill up with blood to make it erect. The full process is a little bit more complicated than that, but that’s the important part. So, to find an effective supplement, you need to find something that helps the blood fill the chambers and keeps them filled.
There are several factors that can complicate this process. Some of the factors are mental (depression, stress, anxiety), some are physical (circulation, hormones, diabetes). A good supplement will address these factors and counteract any effect they might be having on your sex drive.

How to Spot a Scam
               These are my top 5 red flags I use to avoid throwing money away:
            
             1. PRESCRIPTION STRENGTH. This might be obvious, but be mindful of any herbal supplement that exaggerates its effectiveness. If a company is trying to tell you that their supplement can run side-by-side with a prescription drug, immediately look to its ingredients and user reviews and let common sense be your guide.
            


2. FREE TRIAL. When a company offers to give you a free product and asks you to just pay for shipping, they enter you into a subscription as soon as you give them your credit card info. The subscription becomes nearly impossible to cancel. So, whether the product works or not, you’re stuck paying for it again and again.

       
          3. THE PRODUCT PROMISES TO ADD INCHES TO YOUR MEMBER. As I mentioned before, every penis has chambers that fill up with blood during an erection. Those chambers determine the size of an erect penis. Aside from surgery, there is no way to change the size of those chambers. There is no magic pill that permanently adds inches and girth. Some supplements will claim to “maximize size.” That’s different——that just means they promise their pill will help fully fill the existing chambers.
          
       4. IF THE WEBSITE LOOKS AMATEUR. This one is probably obvious. If the site has simple coding errors where buttons don’t line up or if there are obvious misspellings all over, be warned. If a company can’t afford to hire a decent web designer, how can they afford to develop an effective supplement?
       
         5. IF IT’S NOT MADE IN AMERICA. Foreign-made products are not subject to FDA scrutiny and might be full of ingredients that are completely worthless, or are rendered worthless by sitting in shipping crates on container ships for months at a time. Some of these supplements may do more harm than good.
          
       

How to Spot a Life-Changer
There are multiple ways to identify a good product. I reveal my full process in identifying good products later in this article. For now, here’s a general rule: Rather than look at the ingredients in the product, look at the research behind the ingredients. Don’t trust a company that doesn’t do its homework, or that won’t show it to you. A credible company will share their research with you. You know they’re confident in their product if they demonstrate that they have nothing to hide. They will be able to show you exactly how the ingredients in their product will get you these results:

  
Harder, Longer-Lasting Erections 
Improved Sex Drive 
Maximized Size 
Boosted Mood & Confidence 
Satisfied Partners 
More Intimate Love Life 
Sexual Satisfaction 



How We Rated Our Winners
Now that I have helped you avoid the time and money wasters, it’s time to fill you in on how MY search for effective supplements went. The male enhancement market is HUGE. My research team and I sorted through hundreds of the supplements out there. I’m ready to help you find the good ones.
At Supplement Review Digest, we’ve shopped around and seen it all so that you don’t have to. We’ve selected the Top 3 male enhancement supplements that I believe are actually worth your money.
These brands were selected based on the research, safety, and effectiveness of their chosen ingredients, consistently high customer reviews, and how well they performed in our in-house double-blind trials against placebos. 
My team had two groups take pills for 4 months (one group took a product, the other a placebo) and report back to us weekly with their results. Our male enhancement groups had individuals who reported improvements in ability to get and maintain erections. The placebo groups reported no gains. 
We ranked the products by which group had the highest number of erection-achieving men at the end of the trial period and by these 10 factors:


1. Customer Reviews
2. Purity of Ingredients
3. Are FDA Guidelines Followed


4. Research & Scientific Evidence
5. Speed of Expected Result
6. Customer Service


7. Types of Ingredients in Formula
8. Price
9. Return Policy

If you ever wanted to give any male enhancement a try, this is the one we recommend to go with.
Experiment Results: 17 out of 20 men reported erection improvements over 4 months. 85%+ Success Rate.
Overview: ASOX9 was created by a researcher, and Harvard biology graduate who created the formula to help boost his own sexual performance. He spent years researching different formulas in order to undertand why many products didn't work for him, and ended up creating his own formula.  It's our top pick for the best male enhancement supplement of 2016. 

Users claim to have stronger and larger erections than ever before. Many of the users over 50 also report having an increased sex drive at an all time high and a better performance in the bedroom.

Older men say that they feel like  they are in their early 20s after an average of 1 to 3 weeks of use.

Some users report having tried many different supplements and ASOX9 to be the only one to get them completely hard and actually work for them.
Do we recomemnd it? Absolutely, it is one of the few products that users claim actually works and there is good reason for it... The Formula.

So give it a try for yourself and let us know what you think by emailing me at david.g@supplementreviewdigest.com

High T Black is the newest product from the King Fisher Company. According to their website, it improves sex drive and libido, strength and stamina, energy and vitality, and nitric oxide and muscle mass. 
Experiment Results: 14 out of 20 men reported erection improvements over 4 months. ~70% Success Rate.
                   Overview: Most users report having positive results but not as good as the claims on King Fishers website. They say that it works best if taken for 2 weeks straight or longer. 
Most mentioned benefit that we found from users was energy. The product contains 200mg of caffeine (about 2 cups of coffee) per serving.  The downside to this is if you are sensitive to caffeine, this is not a good choice for you. Also, the added caffeine could is bit dangerous for the heart. Thus, anyone with heart issues should check with their doctor prior to use.
The main ingredients include Fenugreek, Eurycoma Longfolia Extra, Rhodiola Rosea Extract, and Arginine-Arginine Alphaketoglutarate. For best results, the company recommends to taking 4 capsules per daily with water along with following a exercise routine.
It is our number 2 choice. To read the full review just click to Learn More.

Steel Libido Red from Irvin Naturals has been on the market for a few years now. It’s a follow up formula to their original Steel Libido product. You can still buy the original formula however, we found that most customers prefer the new “Red” formula.
Experiment Results: 14 out of 20 men reported erection improvements over 4 months achieved the "same results as the number 2 choice in our trial, but when we had a staff member call their customer support pretending to be a dissatisfied customer, we were unimpressed with their service, so we used that as the tie-breaker.” ~70% Success Rate.

              Overview: Main ingredients in Steel Libido Red include L-Citrulline, Velvet Bean Extract, Ginseng, Ginkgo Balboa and Theobromine.  Most of the customer reviews we found online were positive. 
Irvin Natural’s a trusted brand and has been a staple for many men. It has positive feedback from users but not as strong as some of the other products on our list.
For best results, its recommended to take 4 softgels 60 minutes before sexual activity. The is 18.75 serving per bottle.
It is our number 3 choice. To read the full review just click Learn More.

If a company is trying to tell you that their supplement can run side-by-side with a prescription drug, immediately look to its ingredients and user reviews and let common sense be your guide.
            


2. FREE TRIAL. When a company offers to give you a free product and asks you to just pay for shipping, they enter you into a subscription as soon as you give them your credit card info. The subscription becomes nearly impossible to cancel. So, whether the product works or not, you’re stuck paying for it again and again.

       
          3. THE PRODUCT PROMISES TO ADD INCHES TO YOUR MEMBER. As I mentioned before, every penis has chambers that fill up with blood during an erection. Those chambers determine the size of an erect penis. Aside from surgery, there is no way to change the size of those chambers. There is no magic pill that permanently adds inches and girth. Some supplements will claim to “maximize size.” That’s different——that just means they promise their pill will help fully fill the existing chambers.
          
       4. IF THE WEBSITE LOOKS AMATEUR. This one is probably obvious. If the site has simple coding errors where buttons don’t line up or if there are obvious misspellings all over, be warned. If a company can’t afford to hire a decent web designer, how can they afford to develop an effective supplement?
       
         5. IF IT’S NOT MADE IN AMERICA. Foreign-made products are not subject to FDA scrutiny and might be full of ingredients that are completely worthless, or are rendered worthless by sitting in shipping crates on container ships for months at a time. Some of these supplements may do more harm than good.
          
       

How to Spot a Life-Changer
There are multiple ways to identify a good product. I reveal my full process in identifying good products later in this article. For now, here’s a general rule: Rather than look at the ingredients in the product, look at the research behind the ingredients. Don’t trust a company that doesn’t do its homework, or that won’t show it to you. A credible company will share their research with you. You know they’re confident in their product if they demonstrate that they have nothing to hide. They will be able to show you exactly how the ingredients in their product will get you these results:

  
Harder, Longer-Lasting Erections 
Improved Sex Drive 
Maximized Size 
Boosted Mood & Confidence 
Satisfied Partners 
More Intimate Love Life 
Sexual Satisfaction 



How We Rated Our Winners
Now that I have helped you avoid the time and money wasters, it’s time to fill you in on how MY search for effective supplements went. The male enhancement market is HUGE. My research team and I sorted through hundreds of the supplements out there. I’m ready to help you find the good ones.
At Supplement Review Digest, we’ve shopped around and seen it all so that you don’t have to. We’ve selected the Top 3 male enhancement supplements that I believe are actually worth your money.
These brands were selected based on the research, safety, and effectiveness of their chosen ingredients, consistently high customer reviews, and how well they performed in our in-house double-blind trials against placebos. 
My team had two groups take pills for 4 months (one group took a product, the other a placebo) and report back to us weekly with their results. Our male enhancement groups had individuals who reported improvements in ability to get and maintain erections. The placebo groups reported no gains. 
We ranked the products by which group had the highest number of erection-achieving men at the end of the trial period and by these 10 factors:


1. Customer Reviews
2. Purity of Ingredients
3. Are FDA Guidelines Followed


4. Research & Scientific Evidence
5. Speed of Expected Result
6. Customer Service


7. Types of Ingredients in Formula
8. Price
9. Return Policy

Steel Libido Red from Irvin Naturals has been on the market for a few years now. It’s a follow up formula to their original Steel Libido product. You can still buy the original formula however, we found that most customers prefer the new “Red” formula.
Experiment Results: 14 out of 20 men reported erection improvements over 4 months achieved the "same results as the number 2 choice in our trial, but when we had a staff member call their customer support pretending to be a dissatisfied customer, we were unimpressed with their service, so we used that as the tie-breaker.” ~70% Success Rate.

              Overview: Main ingredients in Steel Libido Red include L-Citrulline, Velvet Bean Extract, Ginseng, Ginkgo Balboa and Theobromine.  Most of the customer reviews we found online were positive. 
Irvin Natural’s a trusted brand and has been a staple for many men. It has positive feedback from users but not as strong as some of the other products on our list.
For best results, its recommended to take 4 softgels 60 minutes before sexual activity. The is 18.75 serving per bottle.
It is our number 3 choice. To read the full review just click Learn More.

Male Enhancement Buyer’s Guide
for March 2015

How To Choose An ED Supplement, That Effectively Increases Men’s Sex Drive, Erection Size,  Erection Hardness and Erection Strength.
                    
March 23, 2014
Supplement Review Digest does not often review products in the male enhancement category, but since we have received a ton of requests from men wanting our opinion on what is the most effectively male enhancement supplement on the market today, we decided to investigate and find out if these pills really live up to their claims.





(Shopping for male enhancement products can be downright difficult)


Improving bedroom performance is one of those things that every male looks for, especially if it can be done safely and without any side effects. As you get into your 40’s, the general work/life related stress levels rise, and it is natural for your libido to slow and firmness to go, in fact the national health research indicates erectile dysfunction happens to over 78% of males over 40. What this means for you is that about 8 out of 10 of your male friends over 40 are also experiencing this.                    
It is not  surprising that millions of men are turning to natural Male Enhancement for a solution. According to McKinney and Co.  Male Enhancement Industry is valued at $1.3 billion, and is projected to grow 5 or 6 percent a year through 2017.
But what we found was even with so many men purchasing these male enhancement again and again, there are a ton of reviews from disappointed customers that can be found all over the web. If there is one thing we don’t like, it's companies taking advantage of this trend by selling low grade, and  effective ED supplements.                    
As it turns out, many brands use their existing reputation and marketing-budgets to sell you medium quality products. Even worse, some put dangerous fillers such as Hydrogenated Oils and Titanium Dioxide. On the other hand some companies honestly do try to provide good quality products by using highest quality ingrediants with the same dosages as were used in human studies.
At first it may seem counterintuitive that  big brands would sell a low quality product, or that a product would be on the market without result tests, but since these are “Natural Extracts” these companies are not legally required to research results. 
The good part is We Did the reseach for you! You, our readers Identified the bellow as the most important benefits:
              1. You want to Get A Firmer Erection
2. Last Longer
3. and Increase your size
                    
                    We’ve researched the Top Erectile Dysfunction and male enhancement supplements available, and identified the top 3  products tht users said have helped them achieve these results:
