Fitch Affirms Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust Series 
      2014-C18
























NEW YORK, Aug 18, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch 
      Trust (MSBAM) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series 
      2014-C18. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this 
      release.


                                        








The transaction is collateralized by 65 loans and 100 properties. Fitch 
      has only issued ratings for the 300 North LaSalle B Note (300N Rake) 
      certificates issued by MSBAM 2014-C18. These certificates are 
      subordinate in right of payment of interest and principal to the 300 
      North LaSalle A notes and derive their cash flow solely from the 300 
      North LaSalle Street loan. The 300N Rake certificates are generally not 
      subject to losses from any of the other loans collateralizing the MSBAM 
      2014-C18 transaction. No other classes issued by MSBAM 2014-C18 are 
      rated by Fitch.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








The affirmations are the result of the stable performance of the 
      underlying asset. The certificates represent the beneficial interests in 
      the mortgage loan securing the fee interest in the 300 North LaSalle 
      office property located in Chicago, IL. Per servicer reporting, the 
      subject property was 98% occupied as of April 2016, with a net operating 
      income (NOI) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 2.44x as of year-end 
      (YE) 2015.


                                        








Constructed in 2009, 300 North LaSalle is a 60-story, class A, LEED 
      Platinum building with a prime location within Chicago's central 
      business district. The institutional-quality tenant roster at the 
      subject includes Kirkland & Ellis LLP, with a lease encompassing 52.8% 
      of net rentable area (NRA) that expires in February 2029, Boston 
      Consulting Group (9.8% of NRA, expiry December 2024), and Quarles & 
      Brady LLP (6.3% of NRA, expiry March 2024). Scheduled lease rollover is 
      minimal in the near term, with in-place leases having an average of 11 
      years remaining.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable. Due to the recent 
      issuance of the transaction, limited historical servicer reporting, and 
      stable performance, Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings 
      migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes the 
      transaction's portfolio-level metrics. The rated certificates are 
      secured by a single property and are, therefore, more susceptible to 
      single-event risk related to the market, sponsor or the largest tenants 
      occupying the property.


                                        








USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10


                                        








No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.


                                        








Fitch affirms the following classes:


                                        








--$67.4 million class 300-A at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$39 million class 300-B at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$57 million class 300-C at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$49 million class 300-D at 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$32 million class 300-E at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.


                                        








Fitch does not rate the A-1, A-2, A-3 of any classes of Morgan Stanley 
      Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust, series 2014-C18 other than those 
      listed above.

Fitch Affirms Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust Series 2014-C18 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust Series 
      2014-C18
    





August 18, 2016 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch 
      Trust (MSBAM) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series 
      2014-C18. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this 
      release.
    

      The transaction is collateralized by 65 loans and 100 properties. Fitch 
      has only issued ratings for the 300 North LaSalle B Note (300N Rake) 
      certificates issued by MSBAM 2014-C18. These certificates are 
      subordinate in right of payment of interest and principal to the 300 
      North LaSalle A notes and derive their cash flow solely from the 300 
      North LaSalle Street loan. The 300N Rake certificates are generally not 
      subject to losses from any of the other loans collateralizing the MSBAM 
      2014-C18 transaction. No other classes issued by MSBAM 2014-C18 are 
      rated by Fitch.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are the result of the stable performance of the 
      underlying asset. The certificates represent the beneficial interests in 
      the mortgage loan securing the fee interest in the 300 North LaSalle 
      office property located in Chicago, IL. Per servicer reporting, the 
      subject property was 98% occupied as of April 2016, with a net operating 
      income (NOI) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 2.44x as of year-end 
      (YE) 2015.
    

      Constructed in 2009, 300 North LaSalle is a 60-story, class A, LEED 
      Platinum building with a prime location within Chicago's central 
      business district. The institutional-quality tenant roster at the 
      subject includes Kirkland & Ellis LLP, with a lease encompassing 52.8% 
      of net rentable area (NRA) that expires in February 2029, Boston 
      Consulting Group (9.8% of NRA, expiry December 2024), and Quarles & 
      Brady LLP (6.3% of NRA, expiry March 2024). Scheduled lease rollover is 
      minimal in the near term, with in-place leases having an average of 11 
      years remaining.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable. Due to the recent 
      issuance of the transaction, limited historical servicer reporting, and 
      stable performance, Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings 
      migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes the 
      transaction's portfolio-level metrics. The rated certificates are 
      secured by a single property and are, therefore, more susceptible to 
      single-event risk related to the market, sponsor or the largest tenants 
      occupying the property.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes:
    

      --$67.4 million class 300-A at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$39 million class 300-B at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57 million class 300-C at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$49 million class 300-D at 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$32 million class 300-E at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Fitch does not rate the A-1, A-2, A-3 of any classes of Morgan Stanley 
      Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust, series 2014-C18 other than those 
      listed above.

A single fixed-rate, 10-year commercial mortgage loan with an initial principal balance of $475.0 million;

The mortgage loan is secured by the fee simple interest in 300 North LaSalle located in Chicago's Central Business District, a 1.3-million-square-foot Class A+ office tower.

    401(k) Fee Transparency: Best & Worst Providers  
As the DOL’s fee transparency rules take effect, Research and Dalbar rank retirement plans on their compliance













On the surface, it may seem like just another onerous, costly government drill: The Department of Labor’s new ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) 408(b) (2) disclosure rule. It mandates that 401(k) plan service providers and others furnish plan sponsors with highly detailed transparency disclosures, especially concerning fees—or face enforcement consequences.
But the impact of the new regulations could be market-changing for the entire 401(k) industry.

Under the new regulations, enforcement is expected to become aggressive, a big change from the spotty activity of the past. Whistle-blowing is encouraged, and those not complying will be penalized. Sponsors are exempt from “regulatory action,” Dalbar notes, “merely by reporting service provider failures.” That can be conveniently accomplished via an online reporting system. 
Based on the technical requirements of 408(b) (2), Dalbar’s Transparency Analysis evaluated and ranked recordkeepers and others according to parameters of: overall usefulness, cost estimates, description of services, fiduciary status and conflicts of interest.













“Revenue sharing is that the expenses of the fund have been subsidizing the administrative costs of the plan,” says Ed O’Connor, managing director-retirement services at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in Purchase, N.Y. “Generally, plan sponsors like that because they want to show employees fund performance, not account fees being charged.”
O’Connor adds: “But if the rule leads to no revenue sharing, and fund expenses do not subsidize administrative costs, what we’ll have are account fees, with participants paying directly for things like online series.” 













BB&T’s disclosure has a unique summary of plan services with a succinct explanation of each plan-option’s benefits for both sponsors and employees. John Hancock opens with a three-page outline of services and a hard-to-miss presentation of costs and compensation. TIAA-CREF uses reader-friendly language and includes an educational introduction.
Other mandated information zeroes in on the critical issue of fiduciary responsibility. But the new government directive concerning that is “cloaked in mystery,” Dalbar says, “since, technically, only fiduciaries are required to make a disclosure.” Therefore, when not stated, plan sponsors have no way of knowing if a service provider is or is not a fiduciary. That information, for example, could have been left out accidentally.

    401(k) Fee Transparency: Best & Worst Providers  
As the DOL’s fee transparency rules take effect, Research and Dalbar rank retirement plans on their compliance













On the surface, it may seem like just another onerous, costly government drill: The Department of Labor’s new ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) 408(b) (2) disclosure rule. It mandates that 401(k) plan service providers and others furnish plan sponsors with highly detailed transparency disclosures, especially concerning fees—or face enforcement consequences.
But the impact of the new regulations could be market-changing for the entire 401(k) industry.

Under the new regulations, enforcement is expected to become aggressive, a big change from the spotty activity of the past. Whistle-blowing is encouraged, and those not complying will be penalized. Sponsors are exempt from “regulatory action,” Dalbar notes, “merely by reporting service provider failures.” That can be conveniently accomplished via an online reporting system. 
Based on the technical requirements of 408(b) (2), Dalbar’s Transparency Analysis evaluated and ranked recordkeepers and others according to parameters of: overall usefulness, cost estimates, description of services, fiduciary status and conflicts of interest.













“Revenue sharing is that the expenses of the fund have been subsidizing the administrative costs of the plan,” says Ed O’Connor, managing director-retirement services at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in Purchase, N.Y. “Generally, plan sponsors like that because they want to show employees fund performance, not account fees being charged.”
O’Connor adds: “But if the rule leads to no revenue sharing, and fund expenses do not subsidize administrative costs, what we’ll have are account fees, with participants paying directly for things like online series.” 













BB&T’s disclosure has a unique summary of plan services with a succinct explanation of each plan-option’s benefits for both sponsors and employees. John Hancock opens with a three-page outline of services and a hard-to-miss presentation of costs and compensation. TIAA-CREF uses reader-friendly language and includes an educational introduction.
Other mandated information zeroes in on the critical issue of fiduciary responsibility. But the new government directive concerning that is “cloaked in mystery,” Dalbar says, “since, technically, only fiduciaries are required to make a disclosure.” Therefore, when not stated, plan sponsors have no way of knowing if a service provider is or is not a fiduciary. That information, for example, could have been left out accidentally.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
