Title: Chief Operating Officer
               Company: Monarch Casino & Resort , Inc.
Job Details
               Company Size: $100 mil to less than $250 mil - Employee Range: 1,000 to less than 5,000. Monarch Casino & Resort, Inc. and its management team are committed to providing the best possible gaming entertainment experience. We believe that this incorporates actively promoting responsible behavior among our customers. We recognize that, while a majority of our guests participate in gaming activities in a responsible and rational manner, there exists a small percentage who do not. Compulsive and underage gambling are serious issues that counteract our goal of providing an enjoyable entertainment experience for all. As a company, we have educated ourselves on the issue of problem gaming, and will continue to update our team on the most recent developments in the identification and response to compulsive and underage gambling. We adhere to industry standards and regulatory requirements. Accordingly, each team member plays a crucial part in our mission to promote responsible gaming, and our team members are educated on their role in combating problem gambling. While we recognize that our team members are not social service counselors, we do give them information to share with others on how to get help for a gambling problem. We also have dedicated space on our gaming floor where guests can easily receive information on responsible gaming via print materials. To discourage and limit underage gaming, we have empowered any team member to ask for identification from any suspected minor, and if the individual is underage, we immediately remove him or her from the casino. We also have implemented a "self-restriction" program which allows guests to request not to receive direct marketing materials from Monarch or its subsidiaries, and/or to be denied gaming credit privileges. Forms to request self-restriction or self-exclusion are available at the Atlantis or by calling the Director of Cage and Credit at (775) 335-4524. For more information on this issue, or if you need additional resources, we encourage you take advantage of the resources offered by the following:The National Council on Problem Gambling208 G Street NEWashington, DC 2002.
