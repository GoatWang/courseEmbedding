Group One Trading Analyst






About Us
At Group One we encourage all of our employees to continually challenge themselves and exceed their goals. We strive for excellence in all aspects of the business and reward our employees through a unique compensation structure. Our culture promotes accountability and pushes every team member to maximize their impact on the firm’s profitability. Our training program takes highly intelligent and driven individuals, and places them in positions where they are constantly seeking opportunity for growth. Through openness and constant dialogue, every person plays a key role in problem solving and allows us to stay nimble in a constantly changing environment. We put a premium on work-life balance, and sponsor events which facilitate off the field interaction and promote team work.


Trading

Group One is a leading specialist and market maker in exchange listed derivatives. Headquartered in Chicago, we maintain a floor presence with specialist posts on the Chicago Board Options Exchange and NYSE AMEX. Armed with expertise developed through a rigorous training program, our traders provide competitive liquidity across a broad range of securities. We manage portfolios of several hundred issues, and simultaneously stream quotes across multiple exchanges. Our unique understanding of pricing and special situations, combined with real time risk management and superior technology allow us to stay a step ahead of the markets.



Technology

Technology drives everything we do.
We craft proprietary systems that power all aspects of our business.  Our platform is built to handle massive amounts of data in real time and is optimized to meet tight performance requirements.  We collaboratively solve the challenging problems presented by a constantly evolving electronic trading landscape.
We are skilled, passionate developers who take pride in designing robust, scalable, low-latency applications on a managed runtime.  Core to our beliefs is that designing thoughtful and consistent software infrastructure yields exceptional, maintainable systems.  Enabling agility from design through deployment allows for rapid response to change and facilitates immediate feedback for new features.
We build our platform through discussion, not directive.  Developers, traders, and other business stakeholders devise our approach through continuous communication.  Each member of our team is empowered to make an impact and drive the technological vision.

Risk Management

Thanks to a real time risk database, our desk is able to simultaneously monitor the activity and exposure of the entire firm’s positions. Underlying and derivative markets are constantly in flux and require dynamic systems to track liquidity and market risk. With over 6,000 unique positions, our business analytics database ensures that we are not only taking intelligent risks, but also maximizing returns and capitalizing on opportunities as they expand and contract. The Risk Management group works with all functional areas of the firm to stress test the complexities of our positions, systems and operational risk.

Our Training



"I work with many of the smartest and most motivated people I know.  I can get excellent trading advice and tech assistance, but after a long and exhausting trading day, they’re not a bunch of robots -- I can crack jokes and hang out with them."- Group One Senior Trader






Our Training

Trading Analyst Intern Program:  Group One hires bright, analytical, and competitive people to become successful traders.  Candidates typically participate in our intern program, where they interact with traders and developers regarding high-level issues on a daily basis.  Providing interns with an inside look at the daily processes and decisions made at Group One is unique in the industry.  We truly think of our interns as essential components in our operation.  The internship program also offers option trading classes after the close where they learn the finer points of options trading, hedging, and risk management.  

Trading Analyst Training Program:  Hard working, meticulous, and deeply interested candidates are best suited to success at Group One.  Our program consists of three phases.  The pace and duration of the training program is highly tailored to each individual’s progress.


Phase One:  In classroom sessions during the day and after the close, analysts start with options basics: Trading, hedging, and spreads. Logical thought processes are stressed, and trainees are encouraged to think creatively.  Supporting our traders on a daily basis adds to the exposure, where the details of the day’s trading is discussed in class.  By the end of this stage, analysts are able to succinctly answer complex trading questions and how Group One approaches them.  



Phase Two:  While Phase One is largely concerned with the basics, Phase Two stresses how to adapt to varied trading environments, how to leverage our proprietary trading software to best react to changing conditions, and how to manage risk in a dynamic environment.  Understanding the nuances at this stage are essential.  Group One’s approach to market making is founded on the concept that our traders are highly trained in adapting to complex situations.  



Phase Three:  Here we begin the transition from analyst to trader.  Analysts are given the opportunity to trade a moderate-sized portfolio so they can begin to leverage the knowledge gained in Phase One and Two in a real-time environment.  At this stage they also have experienced traders as mentors, which provides them with a lot of guidance and confidence as they acclimate to options market making in the real world.  Through ongoing conversations about risk management and opportunity, analysts forge the skills and mindset of successful traders.

This small privately held company has given me the best job I've ever had of the 16 jobs I've held in my life.The experience you will have at Group One depends directly on your own ability to produce useful results for the company, and the department you work in. This is not a place that wastes time in endless meetings, or where schmoozing and politics are the main way to get ahead. This company is for people who are self-motivated high achievers and measure their results in dollars, not hours worked.There are many departments at Group One, and your impression of the company will depend on the type of position you have. (Each department will have its own pluses and minuses.) As someone in the Computer / IT area of the company, our day can start earlier than everyone else, and end later, depending on how the systems are behaving. Management knows this, and- unlike other companies- doesn't make you work an 8 hour shift followed by having to do late night maintenance, and then get up early and start all over again. They treat you like a human, not a machine. Most other positions at this company do not have an out of market hour requirement, and their hours are correspondingly shorter.The company is fast paced, professional, and the focus is on the business and what is needed to get the job done. Their compensation and benefits are competitive with industry standards. As can be expected in a trading company, Traders take on the most risk, and can earn the most compensation.If you've had other jobs to compare this to, you will be shocked at how little overhead there is in activities that are time wasters. The amount of management used is the amount needed to ensure the company is working efficiently and no more. No one will be breathing down your neck as long as you are producing results.These working conditions generally mean that co-workers are enthusiastic about their jobs, and most employees feel fortunate to be employed here. Employees are lively, colorful, and fun to be around. We all work as a team.When it comes to reviewing any company, we can only speak from our own personal experience. For me, I have found the company to be kind, generous, caring, and fun to work for. It's been the best, most productive time of my life. I truly feel indebted for the opportunity. I have been treated with the utmost respect, rewarded for my efforts, and shown kindness by the company at every turn. I feel obligated to defend it against some of the harsh reviews that seem to unfairly portray the company in an overly negative light. Most of those reviews are by former employees, and most people aren't very positive when things don't work out their way.Working for a trading company is volatile, exciting, and like driving a high performance sports car. You won't know how great it is until you are behind the wheel. You can only appreciate it superficially from the outside. You have to try it to fully understand it.ConsThis is not the kiddie bowling alley. If you keep throwing gutter balls, there aren't rubber bumpers and do-overs. Your mistakes can easily cost the firm huge sums of money, and you could lose your job, or prevent your career from advancing further. This is perfectly fair, and perfectly scary at the same time. Trader Trainees have it the worst, and you will see that in the other reviews. Put yourself in the firm's position-Are you going to give your money to someone else to trade for you if you aren't fully confident in their abilities?As such, it is the duty of the company to only select the best when it comes to advancing trainees, and that unfortunately means that not everyone is selected to advance. No process is perfect, and rejection always feels personal. It's the company's obligation to shake out candidates early in the process to minimize potential losses. There must be confidence and trust on both sides of the table.If you are looking for a large corporation where you can disappear into the shadows and be anonymous, this isn't it.As with any trading company, market volatility, which is out of your control, can have a big effect on your paycheck. If you're a hand wringer, this may not be your best choice.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) Group One Trading Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Group One Trading 2013-11-25 17:23 PST Apr 8, 2013 Helpful (2)"Fun and challenging, but senior management was a bit sketchy"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Options Trader in New York, NYFormer Employee - Options Trader in New York, NYDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Group One Trading full-time (More than a year)ProsFun group of guys who know how to have fun at work while still giving it their all.

From my past experience, most trading and development environments are stocked with smart folks that have giant egos but somehow Group One managed to avoid employing this type of employee. Developers and traders are all very high achievers, many are been with the firm for more than 5-10 years and a handful of the 2-5 year traders are very successful. The dress code is quite casual, there are regular poker games and ping pong games after the market closes. Most employees have been with the Group One for many years, so the environment is fairly stable.ConsThere were some lean times a few years back but things have seemed to stabilize and quite a few new employees have been hired and some former employees have rejoined the firm. The firms results are volatile but I suspect that is largely due to macroeconomic and industry trends. Our office is a bit of a dump and could use a little renovation, but the location is great.Advice to ManagementWe like the communication of firm results – keep it up.

This makes me not want to do quality work since apparently it has no impact on the ability to become a trader.Advice to Management-I appreciate that you gave me a chance to reapply as a trainee while keeping me at the company, but I don't understand why trainees are basically full-time ops people. Day to day, I do the exact same thing as trainees except they do mock trading for an hour every afternoon. If only 1 or 2 out of 10 top graduates from the best schools can make it to actually begin trading, there is something wrong with the program. Hire ops people to be ops people and trainee traders to learn about trading.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (5) Group One Trading Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Group One Trading 2012-01-29 15:57 PST Showing 22 of 27 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious123NextReviews > Group One Trading RSS Feed</>EmbedCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountReviews by Job TitleTrader Trainee (3) Options Trader (2) Equity Derivatives Trader (2) CloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCompanies to Explore Company BenefitsDoctor's valiseThere are currently no benefit reviews for this company.Add Benefits Review Job Seekers Also ViewedAKUNA CAPITAL ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 51 ReviewsTransMarket Group ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 49 ReviewsJump Trading ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 61 ReviewsT3 Trading Group ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 173 ReviewsMaverick Trading ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 33 ReviewsIMC Financial Markets ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 71 ReviewsWorden Capital Management ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 8 ReviewsPEAK6 Investments ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 131 ReviewsOptiver ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 111 ReviewsBelvedere Trading ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 30 ReviewsSusquehanna International Group ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 331 ReviewsTwo Sigma ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 66 Reviews Related Job SearchTrader Trainee jobsTrader Trainee salaries ($61k)Options Trader jobsOptions Trader salaries ($63k)Trainee jobsTrainee salaries ($30k)Applications Developer jobsApplications Developer salaries ($84k)Intern jobsIntern salaries ($33k)Quantitative Risk Analyst jobsQuantitative Risk Analyst salaries ($95k)Senior Programmer Analyst jobsSenior Programmer Analyst salaries ($88k)Junior Trader jobsJunior Trader salaries ($77k)Senior Applications Developer jobsSenior Applications Developer salaries ($98k)Trader jobsTrader salaries ($89k)Assistant Trader jobsAssistant Trader salaries ($77k)Software Developer jobsSoftware Developer salaries ($79k)Interested in a New Job?Upload a resume to mobile apply.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
