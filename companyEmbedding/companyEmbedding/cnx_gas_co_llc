In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

Consol Energy Inc. /kənˈsɒl/ is an American energy company with interests in coal and natural gas production headquartered in the suburb of Cecil Township, in the Southpointe complex, just outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[4] In April 2017, Consol Energy had divested all of its coal operations, except for the Pennsylvania mine which it was in the process of spinning off into an independent company.[5] In 2010 Consol was the leading producer of high-BTU bituminous coal in the United States and the U.S.'s largest underground coal mining company.[6]
The company has natural gas reserves totaling 3.7 trillion cu. ft. as of 2011 and employs more than 8,800 people.[6]

History[edit]
Consolidation Coal Company (1860–1991)[edit]




Table of Cumberland Coal Trade Production 1865


Consol Energy was originally created in 1860 as the Consolidation Coal Company after several small mining companies in Western Maryland decided to combine their operations. The company was formally established in 1864 and headquartered in Cumberland, Maryland for the first 85 years (1864–1945), where the company became the largest bituminous coal company in the eastern United States.[7]
Western Maryland's coal production rose about 1 million short tons in 1865, exceeded 4 million short tons by the turn of the century, and reached an all-time high of about 6 million short tons in 1907. A small amount of the coal production in the early 1900s was premium smithing coal (as in blacksmith) that was specially processed and delivered in boxcars to customers throughout the United States and Canada. In 1945, Consolidation Coal Company was merged with Pittsburgh Coal Company and its headquarters were moved to Western Pennsylvania. [8]
With growing demand for natural gas in the U.S. following World War II, Consolidation Coal Company was acquired by the Continental Oil Company, or Conoco, in 1966.[8] By the mid-1970s, Consolidation Coal Company operated 56 mines and employed nearly 20,000 miners.[7] In 1981, Conoco along with Consolidation Coal Company was acquired by DuPont, which then sold some of its coal mining interests in Pennsylvania to the German energy company, Rheinbraun A.G.[8]
Consol Energy (1991-present)[edit]
Looking to invest in coal reserves in North America, Rheinbraun A.G offered Dupont stakes in coal mines and $890 million in 1991 to join in an equal part joint venture creating Consol Energy.[9] Despite the cost of coal dropping in the 1990s, Consol's long-term contracts and investments in longwall mining techniques allowed the company to remain competitive.[7] In 1998, Dupont sold the large majority of its stake in Consol, leaving it with only a 6 percent share and Rheinbraun A.G with a 94 percent interest.[10] Consol also acquired Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal Company in 1998.[11]
In 1999, Consol underwent a public offering (NYSE: CNX)[12] in order to pay down some of the debt the company had incurred with the majority buy-out from Dupont and the acquisition of Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal Company. Due to uncertainty surrounding demand for coal in the early 2000s, Consol began to place a greater emphasis on diversification, primarily into natural gas. Consol's first major natural gas investment was through the acquisition of MCN Energy Group Inc.'s methane reserves in southwestern Virginia for $160 million.[13] In 2001, Consol acquired Conoco Inc.'s coalbed methane gas production assets in southwestern Virginia.[14]
Consol subsidiaries CNX Ventures and CNX Land Resources also began diversification efforts during this time into methane gas and timber and farming. In 2006, Consol spun off its subsidiary CNX Gas as a standalone company, but retained 83 percent of the new company's shares.[15] On June 28, 2006,Consol Energy entered the S&P 500 replacing Knight-Ridder.[16] In 2007, CNX Gas also began investing heavily in natural gas exploration in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. In 2010, Consol acquired Dominion Resources Inc.'s natural gas production and exploration assets for 3.74 billion dollars, which included nearly 500,000 acres of Marcellus potential, tripling Consol's position in the Marcellus to approximately 750,000 acres. Consol also acquired all of the remaining publicly owned shares of CNX Gas for a cash payment of $991 million.[15]
In 2010 Consol was also named by Forbes magazine as one of the "100 Most Trustworthy Companies."[17] in 2011, Consol entered into two separate joint venture agreements to expedite its natural gas production. The first, an agreement with Noble Energy, Inc. will jointly develop the company's 663,350 Marcellus Shale acres in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.[18] The second joint agreement, with Hess Corporation, will jointly explore and develop Consol's nearly 200,000 Utica Shale acres in Ohio.[19] Consol also began an expansion of its Baltimore Terminal in 2011 to increase capacity from 14 million to 16 million tons to increase its revenue from sales of its metallurgical coal.[20]
Operations and financials[edit]
Divisions and areas of business[edit]
Consol Energy operates as a producer of multiple energy sources, primarily for electric power generation. The company's largest assets consist of its coal and natural gas divisions, but Consol also maintains support services including Baltimore Marine Terminal, River Division, Research & Development, Land Division, and Fairmont Supply Company.
Consol's Coal Division operates 12 coal mining complexes in four states in the United States, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia and Utah.[6] As of 2011, the company maintained an estimated 4.4 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves and produced nearly 64 million tons of coal in 2010.[6] The coal produced from these mining operations are sold from offices in Pittsburgh, PA, Philadelphia, PA, and Atlanta, GA. Consol's coal division received the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining National Award for Excellence in Surface Mining for the company's innovative reclamation practices in 2002, 2003, and 2004.[21]
Consol's Gas Division deals with natural gas exploration, development and production, producing nearly 128 billion cubic feet of coalbed methane in 2010. With the acquisition of the exploration and production business of Dominion Resources in 2010, the company has access to over 3.7 trillion cubic feet of proved clean-burning natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, including coalbed methane and shale beds. The company currently has nearly 13,000 net producing wells.[6]
As the owner of more than 430,000 surface acres in the U.S. and Canada, Consol Energy has a Land Division that oversees various projects, including selling reserve land that the company does not develop, land donation and conservation projects. Consol Energy has also been recognized for its reclamation efforts by national and state governments and has worked in partnership with several conservation groups on land reclamation projects.[22][23] Consol's River Division oversees transportation of coal and other products on the Monongahela, Allegheny, Kanawha, and Ohio Rivers with 22 tow and tugboats and over 620 barges. Consol's Baltimore Marine terminal provides coal transshipment services from rail cars to ocean transport ships.[6]
Consol's Water Division is involved in water purification with a focus on treating wastewater produced as a byproduct of hydraulic fracturing. The company operates reverse osmosis water purification plants and has a minority interest in a company that develops solar-powered water purification systems which, as of July 2012[update], was conducting a pilot test at one of Consol's gas drilling sites.[24][25]

Consol also maintains the Fairmont Supply Company, dedicated to the sale and distribution of mining services and equipment. Additionally, the company operates the largest privately owned research and development facility in the industry that is devoted exclusively to coal and energy utilization and production.[26]
Financials[edit]
In 2010, Consol Energy had an annual revenue of $5.236 billion. Customers primarily include electric utilities and steel mills in the U.S., but demand from European utilities has increased during the 2000s.[6] Consol Energy was ranked number 428 on the Fortune 500 list in 2011.[27]
Corporate responsibility[edit]

Environmental record[edit]
In September 2009, several thousand fish were killed in Dunkard Creek, Monongalia County, West Virginia. While state officials attributed the fish kill to a golden algae bloom, an investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency claimed that mining discharges from Consol Energy's Blacksville No. 2 mine created the conditions for the golden algae bloom.[28] After halting operations at the mine following the fish kill, Consol was allowed to continue mining operations after coming to an agreement with the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection to submit a proposal for discharge treatment plants by April 15 of 2010.[29] Consol also invested $200 million in a water treatment facility and paid a $5.5 million federal penalty to the U.S. Department of Justice and half to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection in 2011.[30] The company maintains that it was never found liable for the fish kill.[31]
As a producer of coal and natural gas, the environmental impact of coal mining and natural gas drilling has been a subject of controversy for Consol Energy. Despite this, the company has been recognized for its efforts at environmental protection and was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Climate Protection Award in 2002.[32] Additionally, Consol maintains ongoing environmental efforts aimed at restoring and enhancing property managed by the company and has worked with conservation groups including Ducks Unlimited and the National Wild Turkey Federation on habitat restoration efforts.[33]
Political involvement[edit]
An ad by the National Rifle Association critical of President Barack Obama that was filmed on Consol's Blacksville No. 2 coal mine in West Virginia became an issue of political debate in 2009.[34] The National Rifle Association intended to ask miners the question "How do you feel about having your Second Amendment rights taken away if Obama becomes president." Word spread among pro-Obama miners who contacted their union, the United Mine Workers of America, resulting in 440 miners taking the day off to avoid appearing in the ad in a contract-sanctioned protest, halting production at Consol's Blacksville No. 2 coal mine.[35]
Lobbying efforts on the part of Consol have also been an issue of controversy. In the first quarter of 2010, Consol spent $1.02 million in lobbying expenses on issues relating to the coal mining and natural gas industries.[36]
Naming rights[edit]
Consol Energy has put its name to two sports facilities in its Pittsburgh-area. In 2007, Consol Energy purchased the naming rights to Washington, Pennsylvania's minor league baseball team the Washington Wild Things' field, Consol Energy Park.[37] Consol later purchased the naming rights to the Consol Energy Center in 2008; the arena that hosts the Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League team. [38][39] It is estimated that Consol Energy won the bid for naming rights at a cost between $2.0 - $4.0 million per year, for 21 years. As of October 2016 the Consol Energy Center has been renamed PPG Paints Arena as Consol Energy has ended its naming rights of the venue. [40]

Consol Energy Inc. /kənˈsɒl/ is an American energy company with interests in coal and natural gas production headquartered in the suburb of Cecil Township, in the Southpointe complex, just outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[4] In April 2017, Consol Energy had divested all of its coal operations, except for the Pennsylvania mine which it was in the process of spinning off into an independent company.[5] In 2010 Consol was the leading producer of high-BTU bituminous coal in the United States and the U.S.'s largest underground coal mining company.[6]
The company has natural gas reserves totaling 3.7 trillion cu. ft. as of 2011 and employs more than 8,800 people.[6]

History[edit]
Consolidation Coal Company (1860–1991)[edit]




Table of Cumberland Coal Trade Production 1865


Consol Energy was originally created in 1860 as the Consolidation Coal Company after several small mining companies in Western Maryland decided to combine their operations. The company was formally established in 1864 and headquartered in Cumberland, Maryland for the first 85 years (1864–1945), where the company became the largest bituminous coal company in the eastern United States.[7]
Western Maryland's coal production rose about 1 million short tons in 1865, exceeded 4 million short tons by the turn of the century, and reached an all-time high of about 6 million short tons in 1907. A small amount of the coal production in the early 1900s was premium smithing coal (as in blacksmith) that was specially processed and delivered in boxcars to customers throughout the United States and Canada. In 1945, Consolidation Coal Company was merged with Pittsburgh Coal Company and its headquarters were moved to Western Pennsylvania. [8]
With growing demand for natural gas in the U.S. following World War II, Consolidation Coal Company was acquired by the Continental Oil Company, or Conoco, in 1966.[8] By the mid-1970s, Consolidation Coal Company operated 56 mines and employed nearly 20,000 miners.[7] In 1981, Conoco along with Consolidation Coal Company was acquired by DuPont, which then sold some of its coal mining interests in Pennsylvania to the German energy company, Rheinbraun A.G.[8]
Consol Energy (1991-present)[edit]
Looking to invest in coal reserves in North America, Rheinbraun A.G offered Dupont stakes in coal mines and $890 million in 1991 to join in an equal part joint venture creating Consol Energy.[9] Despite the cost of coal dropping in the 1990s, Consol's long-term contracts and investments in longwall mining techniques allowed the company to remain competitive.[7] In 1998, Dupont sold the large majority of its stake in Consol, leaving it with only a 6 percent share and Rheinbraun A.G with a 94 percent interest.[10] Consol also acquired Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal Company in 1998.[11]
In 1999, Consol underwent a public offering (NYSE: CNX)[12] in order to pay down some of the debt the company had incurred with the majority buy-out from Dupont and the acquisition of Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal Company. Due to uncertainty surrounding demand for coal in the early 2000s, Consol began to place a greater emphasis on diversification, primarily into natural gas. Consol's first major natural gas investment was through the acquisition of MCN Energy Group Inc.'s methane reserves in southwestern Virginia for $160 million.[13] In 2001, Consol acquired Conoco Inc.'s coalbed methane gas production assets in southwestern Virginia.[14]
Consol subsidiaries CNX Ventures and CNX Land Resources also began diversification efforts during this time into methane gas and timber and farming. In 2006, Consol spun off its subsidiary CNX Gas as a standalone company, but retained 83 percent of the new company's shares.[15] On June 28, 2006,Consol Energy entered the S&P 500 replacing Knight-Ridder.[16] In 2007, CNX Gas also began investing heavily in natural gas exploration in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. In 2010, Consol acquired Dominion Resources Inc.'s natural gas production and exploration assets for 3.74 billion dollars, which included nearly 500,000 acres of Marcellus potential, tripling Consol's position in the Marcellus to approximately 750,000 acres. Consol also acquired all of the remaining publicly owned shares of CNX Gas for a cash payment of $991 million.[15]
In 2010 Consol was also named by Forbes magazine as one of the "100 Most Trustworthy Companies."[17] in 2011, Consol entered into two separate joint venture agreements to expedite its natural gas production. The first, an agreement with Noble Energy, Inc. will jointly develop the company's 663,350 Marcellus Shale acres in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.[18] The second joint agreement, with Hess Corporation, will jointly explore and develop Consol's nearly 200,000 Utica Shale acres in Ohio.[19] Consol also began an expansion of its Baltimore Terminal in 2011 to increase capacity from 14 million to 16 million tons to increase its revenue from sales of its metallurgical coal.[20]
Operations and financials[edit]
Divisions and areas of business[edit]
Consol Energy operates as a producer of multiple energy sources, primarily for electric power generation. The company's largest assets consist of its coal and natural gas divisions, but Consol also maintains support services including Baltimore Marine Terminal, River Division, Research & Development, Land Division, and Fairmont Supply Company.
Consol's Coal Division operates 12 coal mining complexes in four states in the United States, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia and Utah.[6] As of 2011, the company maintained an estimated 4.4 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves and produced nearly 64 million tons of coal in 2010.[6] The coal produced from these mining operations are sold from offices in Pittsburgh, PA, Philadelphia, PA, and Atlanta, GA. Consol's coal division received the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining National Award for Excellence in Surface Mining for the company's innovative reclamation practices in 2002, 2003, and 2004.[21]
Consol's Gas Division deals with natural gas exploration, development and production, producing nearly 128 billion cubic feet of coalbed methane in 2010. With the acquisition of the exploration and production business of Dominion Resources in 2010, the company has access to over 3.7 trillion cubic feet of proved clean-burning natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, including coalbed methane and shale beds. The company currently has nearly 13,000 net producing wells.[6]
As the owner of more than 430,000 surface acres in the U.S. and Canada, Consol Energy has a Land Division that oversees various projects, including selling reserve land that the company does not develop, land donation and conservation projects. Consol Energy has also been recognized for its reclamation efforts by national and state governments and has worked in partnership with several conservation groups on land reclamation projects.[22][23] Consol's River Division oversees transportation of coal and other products on the Monongahela, Allegheny, Kanawha, and Ohio Rivers with 22 tow and tugboats and over 620 barges. Consol's Baltimore Marine terminal provides coal transshipment services from rail cars to ocean transport ships.[6]
Consol's Water Division is involved in water purification with a focus on treating wastewater produced as a byproduct of hydraulic fracturing. The company operates reverse osmosis water purification plants and has a minority interest in a company that develops solar-powered water purification systems which, as of July 2012[update], was conducting a pilot test at one of Consol's gas drilling sites.[24][25]

Consol also maintains the Fairmont Supply Company, dedicated to the sale and distribution of mining services and equipment. Additionally, the company operates the largest privately owned research and development facility in the industry that is devoted exclusively to coal and energy utilization and production.[26]
Financials[edit]
In 2010, Consol Energy had an annual revenue of $5.236 billion. Customers primarily include electric utilities and steel mills in the U.S., but demand from European utilities has increased during the 2000s.[6] Consol Energy was ranked number 428 on the Fortune 500 list in 2011.[27]
Corporate responsibility[edit]

Environmental record[edit]
In September 2009, several thousand fish were killed in Dunkard Creek, Monongalia County, West Virginia. While state officials attributed the fish kill to a golden algae bloom, an investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency claimed that mining discharges from Consol Energy's Blacksville No. 2 mine created the conditions for the golden algae bloom.[28] After halting operations at the mine following the fish kill, Consol was allowed to continue mining operations after coming to an agreement with the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection to submit a proposal for discharge treatment plants by April 15 of 2010.[29] Consol also invested $200 million in a water treatment facility and paid a $5.5 million federal penalty to the U.S. Department of Justice and half to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection in 2011.[30] The company maintains that it was never found liable for the fish kill.[31]
As a producer of coal and natural gas, the environmental impact of coal mining and natural gas drilling has been a subject of controversy for Consol Energy. Despite this, the company has been recognized for its efforts at environmental protection and was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Climate Protection Award in 2002.[32] Additionally, Consol maintains ongoing environmental efforts aimed at restoring and enhancing property managed by the company and has worked with conservation groups including Ducks Unlimited and the National Wild Turkey Federation on habitat restoration efforts.[33]
Political involvement[edit]
An ad by the National Rifle Association critical of President Barack Obama that was filmed on Consol's Blacksville No. 2 coal mine in West Virginia became an issue of political debate in 2009.[34] The National Rifle Association intended to ask miners the question "How do you feel about having your Second Amendment rights taken away if Obama becomes president." Word spread among pro-Obama miners who contacted their union, the United Mine Workers of America, resulting in 440 miners taking the day off to avoid appearing in the ad in a contract-sanctioned protest, halting production at Consol's Blacksville No. 2 coal mine.[35]
Lobbying efforts on the part of Consol have also been an issue of controversy. In the first quarter of 2010, Consol spent $1.02 million in lobbying expenses on issues relating to the coal mining and natural gas industries.[36]
Naming rights[edit]
Consol Energy has put its name to two sports facilities in its Pittsburgh-area. In 2007, Consol Energy purchased the naming rights to Washington, Pennsylvania's minor league baseball team the Washington Wild Things' field, Consol Energy Park.[37] Consol later purchased the naming rights to the Consol Energy Center in 2008; the arena that hosts the Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League team. [38][39] It is estimated that Consol Energy won the bid for naming rights at a cost between $2.0 - $4.0 million per year, for 21 years. As of October 2016 the Consol Energy Center has been renamed PPG Paints Arena as Consol Energy has ended its naming rights of the venue. [40]

Consol Energy Inc. /kənˈsɒl/ is an American energy company with interests in coal and natural gas production headquartered in the suburb of Cecil Township, in the Southpointe complex, just outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[4] In April 2017, Consol Energy had divested all of its coal operations, except for the Pennsylvania mine which it was in the process of spinning off into an independent company.[5] In 2010 Consol was the leading producer of high-BTU bituminous coal in the United States and the U.S.'s largest underground coal mining company.[6]
The company has natural gas reserves totaling 3.7 trillion cu. ft. as of 2011 and employs more than 8,800 people.[6]

History[edit]
Consolidation Coal Company (1860–1991)[edit]




Table of Cumberland Coal Trade Production 1865


Consol Energy was originally created in 1860 as the Consolidation Coal Company after several small mining companies in Western Maryland decided to combine their operations. The company was formally established in 1864 and headquartered in Cumberland, Maryland for the first 85 years (1864–1945), where the company became the largest bituminous coal company in the eastern United States.[7]
Western Maryland's coal production rose about 1 million short tons in 1865, exceeded 4 million short tons by the turn of the century, and reached an all-time high of about 6 million short tons in 1907. A small amount of the coal production in the early 1900s was premium smithing coal (as in blacksmith) that was specially processed and delivered in boxcars to customers throughout the United States and Canada. In 1945, Consolidation Coal Company was merged with Pittsburgh Coal Company and its headquarters were moved to Western Pennsylvania. [8]
With growing demand for natural gas in the U.S. following World War II, Consolidation Coal Company was acquired by the Continental Oil Company, or Conoco, in 1966.[8] By the mid-1970s, Consolidation Coal Company operated 56 mines and employed nearly 20,000 miners.[7] In 1981, Conoco along with Consolidation Coal Company was acquired by DuPont, which then sold some of its coal mining interests in Pennsylvania to the German energy company, Rheinbraun A.G.[8]
Consol Energy (1991-present)[edit]
Looking to invest in coal reserves in North America, Rheinbraun A.G offered Dupont stakes in coal mines and $890 million in 1991 to join in an equal part joint venture creating Consol Energy.[9] Despite the cost of coal dropping in the 1990s, Consol's long-term contracts and investments in longwall mining techniques allowed the company to remain competitive.[7] In 1998, Dupont sold the large majority of its stake in Consol, leaving it with only a 6 percent share and Rheinbraun A.G with a 94 percent interest.[10] Consol also acquired Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal Company in 1998.[11]
In 1999, Consol underwent a public offering (NYSE: CNX)[12] in order to pay down some of the debt the company had incurred with the majority buy-out from Dupont and the acquisition of Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal Company. Due to uncertainty surrounding demand for coal in the early 2000s, Consol began to place a greater emphasis on diversification, primarily into natural gas. Consol's first major natural gas investment was through the acquisition of MCN Energy Group Inc.'s methane reserves in southwestern Virginia for $160 million.[13] In 2001, Consol acquired Conoco Inc.'s coalbed methane gas production assets in southwestern Virginia.[14]
Consol subsidiaries CNX Ventures and CNX Land Resources also began diversification efforts during this time into methane gas and timber and farming. In 2006, Consol spun off its subsidiary CNX Gas as a standalone company, but retained 83 percent of the new company's shares.[15] On June 28, 2006,Consol Energy entered the S&P 500 replacing Knight-Ridder.[16] In 2007, CNX Gas also began investing heavily in natural gas exploration in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. In 2010, Consol acquired Dominion Resources Inc.'s natural gas production and exploration assets for 3.74 billion dollars, which included nearly 500,000 acres of Marcellus potential, tripling Consol's position in the Marcellus to approximately 750,000 acres. Consol also acquired all of the remaining publicly owned shares of CNX Gas for a cash payment of $991 million.[15]
In 2010 Consol was also named by Forbes magazine as one of the "100 Most Trustworthy Companies."[17] in 2011, Consol entered into two separate joint venture agreements to expedite its natural gas production. The first, an agreement with Noble Energy, Inc. will jointly develop the company's 663,350 Marcellus Shale acres in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.[18] The second joint agreement, with Hess Corporation, will jointly explore and develop Consol's nearly 200,000 Utica Shale acres in Ohio.[19] Consol also began an expansion of its Baltimore Terminal in 2011 to increase capacity from 14 million to 16 million tons to increase its revenue from sales of its metallurgical coal.[20]
Operations and financials[edit]
Divisions and areas of business[edit]
Consol Energy operates as a producer of multiple energy sources, primarily for electric power generation. The company's largest assets consist of its coal and natural gas divisions, but Consol also maintains support services including Baltimore Marine Terminal, River Division, Research & Development, Land Division, and Fairmont Supply Company.
Consol's Coal Division operates 12 coal mining complexes in four states in the United States, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia and Utah.[6] As of 2011, the company maintained an estimated 4.4 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves and produced nearly 64 million tons of coal in 2010.[6] The coal produced from these mining operations are sold from offices in Pittsburgh, PA, Philadelphia, PA, and Atlanta, GA. Consol's coal division received the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining National Award for Excellence in Surface Mining for the company's innovative reclamation practices in 2002, 2003, and 2004.[21]
Consol's Gas Division deals with natural gas exploration, development and production, producing nearly 128 billion cubic feet of coalbed methane in 2010. With the acquisition of the exploration and production business of Dominion Resources in 2010, the company has access to over 3.7 trillion cubic feet of proved clean-burning natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, including coalbed methane and shale beds. The company currently has nearly 13,000 net producing wells.[6]
As the owner of more than 430,000 surface acres in the U.S. and Canada, Consol Energy has a Land Division that oversees various projects, including selling reserve land that the company does not develop, land donation and conservation projects. Consol Energy has also been recognized for its reclamation efforts by national and state governments and has worked in partnership with several conservation groups on land reclamation projects.[22][23] Consol's River Division oversees transportation of coal and other products on the Monongahela, Allegheny, Kanawha, and Ohio Rivers with 22 tow and tugboats and over 620 barges. Consol's Baltimore Marine terminal provides coal transshipment services from rail cars to ocean transport ships.[6]
Consol's Water Division is involved in water purification with a focus on treating wastewater produced as a byproduct of hydraulic fracturing. The company operates reverse osmosis water purification plants and has a minority interest in a company that develops solar-powered water purification systems which, as of July 2012[update], was conducting a pilot test at one of Consol's gas drilling sites.[24][25]

Consol also maintains the Fairmont Supply Company, dedicated to the sale and distribution of mining services and equipment. Additionally, the company operates the largest privately owned research and development facility in the industry that is devoted exclusively to coal and energy utilization and production.[26]
Financials[edit]
In 2010, Consol Energy had an annual revenue of $5.236 billion. Customers primarily include electric utilities and steel mills in the U.S., but demand from European utilities has increased during the 2000s.[6] Consol Energy was ranked number 428 on the Fortune 500 list in 2011.[27]
Corporate responsibility[edit]

Environmental record[edit]
In September 2009, several thousand fish were killed in Dunkard Creek, Monongalia County, West Virginia. While state officials attributed the fish kill to a golden algae bloom, an investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency claimed that mining discharges from Consol Energy's Blacksville No. 2 mine created the conditions for the golden algae bloom.[28] After halting operations at the mine following the fish kill, Consol was allowed to continue mining operations after coming to an agreement with the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection to submit a proposal for discharge treatment plants by April 15 of 2010.[29] Consol also invested $200 million in a water treatment facility and paid a $5.5 million federal penalty to the U.S. Department of Justice and half to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection in 2011.[30] The company maintains that it was never found liable for the fish kill.[31]
As a producer of coal and natural gas, the environmental impact of coal mining and natural gas drilling has been a subject of controversy for Consol Energy. Despite this, the company has been recognized for its efforts at environmental protection and was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Climate Protection Award in 2002.[32] Additionally, Consol maintains ongoing environmental efforts aimed at restoring and enhancing property managed by the company and has worked with conservation groups including Ducks Unlimited and the National Wild Turkey Federation on habitat restoration efforts.[33]
Political involvement[edit]
An ad by the National Rifle Association critical of President Barack Obama that was filmed on Consol's Blacksville No. 2 coal mine in West Virginia became an issue of political debate in 2009.[34] The National Rifle Association intended to ask miners the question "How do you feel about having your Second Amendment rights taken away if Obama becomes president." Word spread among pro-Obama miners who contacted their union, the United Mine Workers of America, resulting in 440 miners taking the day off to avoid appearing in the ad in a contract-sanctioned protest, halting production at Consol's Blacksville No. 2 coal mine.[35]
Lobbying efforts on the part of Consol have also been an issue of controversy. In the first quarter of 2010, Consol spent $1.02 million in lobbying expenses on issues relating to the coal mining and natural gas industries.[36]
Naming rights[edit]
Consol Energy has put its name to two sports facilities in its Pittsburgh-area. In 2007, Consol Energy purchased the naming rights to Washington, Pennsylvania's minor league baseball team the Washington Wild Things' field, Consol Energy Park.[37] Consol later purchased the naming rights to the Consol Energy Center in 2008; the arena that hosts the Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League team. [38][39] It is estimated that Consol Energy won the bid for naming rights at a cost between $2.0 - $4.0 million per year, for 21 years. As of October 2016 the Consol Energy Center has been renamed PPG Paints Arena as Consol Energy has ended its naming rights of the venue. [40]

Consol Energy Inc. /kənˈsɒl/ is an American energy company with interests in coal and natural gas production headquartered in the suburb of Cecil Township, in the Southpointe complex, just outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[4] In April 2017, Consol Energy had divested all of its coal operations, except for the Pennsylvania mine which it was in the process of spinning off into an independent company.[5] In 2010 Consol was the leading producer of high-BTU bituminous coal in the United States and the U.S.'s largest underground coal mining company.[6]
The company has natural gas reserves totaling 3.7 trillion cu. ft. as of 2011 and employs more than 8,800 people.[6]

History[edit]
Consolidation Coal Company (1860–1991)[edit]




Table of Cumberland Coal Trade Production 1865


Consol Energy was originally created in 1860 as the Consolidation Coal Company after several small mining companies in Western Maryland decided to combine their operations. The company was formally established in 1864 and headquartered in Cumberland, Maryland for the first 85 years (1864–1945), where the company became the largest bituminous coal company in the eastern United States.[7]
Western Maryland's coal production rose about 1 million short tons in 1865, exceeded 4 million short tons by the turn of the century, and reached an all-time high of about 6 million short tons in 1907. A small amount of the coal production in the early 1900s was premium smithing coal (as in blacksmith) that was specially processed and delivered in boxcars to customers throughout the United States and Canada. In 1945, Consolidation Coal Company was merged with Pittsburgh Coal Company and its headquarters were moved to Western Pennsylvania. [8]
With growing demand for natural gas in the U.S. following World War II, Consolidation Coal Company was acquired by the Continental Oil Company, or Conoco, in 1966.[8] By the mid-1970s, Consolidation Coal Company operated 56 mines and employed nearly 20,000 miners.[7] In 1981, Conoco along with Consolidation Coal Company was acquired by DuPont, which then sold some of its coal mining interests in Pennsylvania to the German energy company, Rheinbraun A.G.[8]
Consol Energy (1991-present)[edit]
Looking to invest in coal reserves in North America, Rheinbraun A.G offered Dupont stakes in coal mines and $890 million in 1991 to join in an equal part joint venture creating Consol Energy.[9] Despite the cost of coal dropping in the 1990s, Consol's long-term contracts and investments in longwall mining techniques allowed the company to remain competitive.[7] In 1998, Dupont sold the large majority of its stake in Consol, leaving it with only a 6 percent share and Rheinbraun A.G with a 94 percent interest.[10] Consol also acquired Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal Company in 1998.[11]
In 1999, Consol underwent a public offering (NYSE: CNX)[12] in order to pay down some of the debt the company had incurred with the majority buy-out from Dupont and the acquisition of Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal Company. Due to uncertainty surrounding demand for coal in the early 2000s, Consol began to place a greater emphasis on diversification, primarily into natural gas. Consol's first major natural gas investment was through the acquisition of MCN Energy Group Inc.'s methane reserves in southwestern Virginia for $160 million.[13] In 2001, Consol acquired Conoco Inc.'s coalbed methane gas production assets in southwestern Virginia.[14]
Consol subsidiaries CNX Ventures and CNX Land Resources also began diversification efforts during this time into methane gas and timber and farming. In 2006, Consol spun off its subsidiary CNX Gas as a standalone company, but retained 83 percent of the new company's shares.[15] On June 28, 2006,Consol Energy entered the S&P 500 replacing Knight-Ridder.[16] In 2007, CNX Gas also began investing heavily in natural gas exploration in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. In 2010, Consol acquired Dominion Resources Inc.'s natural gas production and exploration assets for 3.74 billion dollars, which included nearly 500,000 acres of Marcellus potential, tripling Consol's position in the Marcellus to approximately 750,000 acres. Consol also acquired all of the remaining publicly owned shares of CNX Gas for a cash payment of $991 million.[15]
In 2010 Consol was also named by Forbes magazine as one of the "100 Most Trustworthy Companies."[17] in 2011, Consol entered into two separate joint venture agreements to expedite its natural gas production. The first, an agreement with Noble Energy, Inc. will jointly develop the company's 663,350 Marcellus Shale acres in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.[18] The second joint agreement, with Hess Corporation, will jointly explore and develop Consol's nearly 200,000 Utica Shale acres in Ohio.[19] Consol also began an expansion of its Baltimore Terminal in 2011 to increase capacity from 14 million to 16 million tons to increase its revenue from sales of its metallurgical coal.[20]
Operations and financials[edit]
Divisions and areas of business[edit]
Consol Energy operates as a producer of multiple energy sources, primarily for electric power generation. The company's largest assets consist of its coal and natural gas divisions, but Consol also maintains support services including Baltimore Marine Terminal, River Division, Research & Development, Land Division, and Fairmont Supply Company.
Consol's Coal Division operates 12 coal mining complexes in four states in the United States, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia and Utah.[6] As of 2011, the company maintained an estimated 4.4 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves and produced nearly 64 million tons of coal in 2010.[6] The coal produced from these mining operations are sold from offices in Pittsburgh, PA, Philadelphia, PA, and Atlanta, GA. Consol's coal division received the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining National Award for Excellence in Surface Mining for the company's innovative reclamation practices in 2002, 2003, and 2004.[21]
Consol's Gas Division deals with natural gas exploration, development and production, producing nearly 128 billion cubic feet of coalbed methane in 2010. With the acquisition of the exploration and production business of Dominion Resources in 2010, the company has access to over 3.7 trillion cubic feet of proved clean-burning natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, including coalbed methane and shale beds. The company currently has nearly 13,000 net producing wells.[6]
As the owner of more than 430,000 surface acres in the U.S. and Canada, Consol Energy has a Land Division that oversees various projects, including selling reserve land that the company does not develop, land donation and conservation projects. Consol Energy has also been recognized for its reclamation efforts by national and state governments and has worked in partnership with several conservation groups on land reclamation projects.[22][23] Consol's River Division oversees transportation of coal and other products on the Monongahela, Allegheny, Kanawha, and Ohio Rivers with 22 tow and tugboats and over 620 barges. Consol's Baltimore Marine terminal provides coal transshipment services from rail cars to ocean transport ships.[6]
Consol's Water Division is involved in water purification with a focus on treating wastewater produced as a byproduct of hydraulic fracturing. The company operates reverse osmosis water purification plants and has a minority interest in a company that develops solar-powered water purification systems which, as of July 2012[update], was conducting a pilot test at one of Consol's gas drilling sites.[24][25]

Consol also maintains the Fairmont Supply Company, dedicated to the sale and distribution of mining services and equipment. Additionally, the company operates the largest privately owned research and development facility in the industry that is devoted exclusively to coal and energy utilization and production.[26]
Financials[edit]
In 2010, Consol Energy had an annual revenue of $5.236 billion. Customers primarily include electric utilities and steel mills in the U.S., but demand from European utilities has increased during the 2000s.[6] Consol Energy was ranked number 428 on the Fortune 500 list in 2011.[27]
Corporate responsibility[edit]

Environmental record[edit]
In September 2009, several thousand fish were killed in Dunkard Creek, Monongalia County, West Virginia. While state officials attributed the fish kill to a golden algae bloom, an investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency claimed that mining discharges from Consol Energy's Blacksville No. 2 mine created the conditions for the golden algae bloom.[28] After halting operations at the mine following the fish kill, Consol was allowed to continue mining operations after coming to an agreement with the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection to submit a proposal for discharge treatment plants by April 15 of 2010.[29] Consol also invested $200 million in a water treatment facility and paid a $5.5 million federal penalty to the U.S. Department of Justice and half to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection in 2011.[30] The company maintains that it was never found liable for the fish kill.[31]
As a producer of coal and natural gas, the environmental impact of coal mining and natural gas drilling has been a subject of controversy for Consol Energy. Despite this, the company has been recognized for its efforts at environmental protection and was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Climate Protection Award in 2002.[32] Additionally, Consol maintains ongoing environmental efforts aimed at restoring and enhancing property managed by the company and has worked with conservation groups including Ducks Unlimited and the National Wild Turkey Federation on habitat restoration efforts.[33]
Political involvement[edit]
An ad by the National Rifle Association critical of President Barack Obama that was filmed on Consol's Blacksville No. 2 coal mine in West Virginia became an issue of political debate in 2009.[34] The National Rifle Association intended to ask miners the question "How do you feel about having your Second Amendment rights taken away if Obama becomes president." Word spread among pro-Obama miners who contacted their union, the United Mine Workers of America, resulting in 440 miners taking the day off to avoid appearing in the ad in a contract-sanctioned protest, halting production at Consol's Blacksville No. 2 coal mine.[35]
Lobbying efforts on the part of Consol have also been an issue of controversy. In the first quarter of 2010, Consol spent $1.02 million in lobbying expenses on issues relating to the coal mining and natural gas industries.[36]
Naming rights[edit]
Consol Energy has put its name to two sports facilities in its Pittsburgh-area. In 2007, Consol Energy purchased the naming rights to Washington, Pennsylvania's minor league baseball team the Washington Wild Things' field, Consol Energy Park.[37] Consol later purchased the naming rights to the Consol Energy Center in 2008; the arena that hosts the Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League team. [38][39] It is estimated that Consol Energy won the bid for naming rights at a cost between $2.0 - $4.0 million per year, for 21 years. As of October 2016 the Consol Energy Center has been renamed PPG Paints Arena as Consol Energy has ended its naming rights of the venue. [40]

Consol Energy Inc. /kənˈsɒl/ is an American energy company with interests in coal and natural gas production headquartered in the suburb of Cecil Township, in the Southpointe complex, just outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[4] In April 2017, Consol Energy had divested all of its coal operations, except for the Pennsylvania mine which it was in the process of spinning off into an independent company.[5] In 2010 Consol was the leading producer of high-BTU bituminous coal in the United States and the U.S.'s largest underground coal mining company.[6]
The company has natural gas reserves totaling 3.7 trillion cu. ft. as of 2011 and employs more than 8,800 people.[6]

History[edit]
Consolidation Coal Company (1860–1991)[edit]




Table of Cumberland Coal Trade Production 1865


Consol Energy was originally created in 1860 as the Consolidation Coal Company after several small mining companies in Western Maryland decided to combine their operations. The company was formally established in 1864 and headquartered in Cumberland, Maryland for the first 85 years (1864–1945), where the company became the largest bituminous coal company in the eastern United States.[7]
Western Maryland's coal production rose about 1 million short tons in 1865, exceeded 4 million short tons by the turn of the century, and reached an all-time high of about 6 million short tons in 1907. A small amount of the coal production in the early 1900s was premium smithing coal (as in blacksmith) that was specially processed and delivered in boxcars to customers throughout the United States and Canada. In 1945, Consolidation Coal Company was merged with Pittsburgh Coal Company and its headquarters were moved to Western Pennsylvania. [8]
With growing demand for natural gas in the U.S. following World War II, Consolidation Coal Company was acquired by the Continental Oil Company, or Conoco, in 1966.[8] By the mid-1970s, Consolidation Coal Company operated 56 mines and employed nearly 20,000 miners.[7] In 1981, Conoco along with Consolidation Coal Company was acquired by DuPont, which then sold some of its coal mining interests in Pennsylvania to the German energy company, Rheinbraun A.G.[8]
Consol Energy (1991-present)[edit]
Looking to invest in coal reserves in North America, Rheinbraun A.G offered Dupont stakes in coal mines and $890 million in 1991 to join in an equal part joint venture creating Consol Energy.[9] Despite the cost of coal dropping in the 1990s, Consol's long-term contracts and investments in longwall mining techniques allowed the company to remain competitive.[7] In 1998, Dupont sold the large majority of its stake in Consol, leaving it with only a 6 percent share and Rheinbraun A.G with a 94 percent interest.[10] Consol also acquired Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal Company in 1998.[11]
In 1999, Consol underwent a public offering (NYSE: CNX)[12] in order to pay down some of the debt the company had incurred with the majority buy-out from Dupont and the acquisition of Rochester & Pittsburgh Coal Company. Due to uncertainty surrounding demand for coal in the early 2000s, Consol began to place a greater emphasis on diversification, primarily into natural gas. Consol's first major natural gas investment was through the acquisition of MCN Energy Group Inc.'s methane reserves in southwestern Virginia for $160 million.[13] In 2001, Consol acquired Conoco Inc.'s coalbed methane gas production assets in southwestern Virginia.[14]
Consol subsidiaries CNX Ventures and CNX Land Resources also began diversification efforts during this time into methane gas and timber and farming. In 2006, Consol spun off its subsidiary CNX Gas as a standalone company, but retained 83 percent of the new company's shares.[15] On June 28, 2006,Consol Energy entered the S&P 500 replacing Knight-Ridder.[16] In 2007, CNX Gas also began investing heavily in natural gas exploration in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. In 2010, Consol acquired Dominion Resources Inc.'s natural gas production and exploration assets for 3.74 billion dollars, which included nearly 500,000 acres of Marcellus potential, tripling Consol's position in the Marcellus to approximately 750,000 acres. Consol also acquired all of the remaining publicly owned shares of CNX Gas for a cash payment of $991 million.[15]
In 2010 Consol was also named by Forbes magazine as one of the "100 Most Trustworthy Companies."[17] in 2011, Consol entered into two separate joint venture agreements to expedite its natural gas production. The first, an agreement with Noble Energy, Inc. will jointly develop the company's 663,350 Marcellus Shale acres in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.[18] The second joint agreement, with Hess Corporation, will jointly explore and develop Consol's nearly 200,000 Utica Shale acres in Ohio.[19] Consol also began an expansion of its Baltimore Terminal in 2011 to increase capacity from 14 million to 16 million tons to increase its revenue from sales of its metallurgical coal.[20]
Operations and financials[edit]
Divisions and areas of business[edit]
Consol Energy operates as a producer of multiple energy sources, primarily for electric power generation. The company's largest assets consist of its coal and natural gas divisions, but Consol also maintains support services including Baltimore Marine Terminal, River Division, Research & Development, Land Division, and Fairmont Supply Company.
Consol's Coal Division operates 12 coal mining complexes in four states in the United States, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia and Utah.[6] As of 2011, the company maintained an estimated 4.4 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves and produced nearly 64 million tons of coal in 2010.[6] The coal produced from these mining operations are sold from offices in Pittsburgh, PA, Philadelphia, PA, and Atlanta, GA. Consol's coal division received the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining National Award for Excellence in Surface Mining for the company's innovative reclamation practices in 2002, 2003, and 2004.[21]
Consol's Gas Division deals with natural gas exploration, development and production, producing nearly 128 billion cubic feet of coalbed methane in 2010. With the acquisition of the exploration and production business of Dominion Resources in 2010, the company has access to over 3.7 trillion cubic feet of proved clean-burning natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, including coalbed methane and shale beds. The company currently has nearly 13,000 net producing wells.[6]
As the owner of more than 430,000 surface acres in the U.S. and Canada, Consol Energy has a Land Division that oversees various projects, including selling reserve land that the company does not develop, land donation and conservation projects. Consol Energy has also been recognized for its reclamation efforts by national and state governments and has worked in partnership with several conservation groups on land reclamation projects.[22][23] Consol's River Division oversees transportation of coal and other products on the Monongahela, Allegheny, Kanawha, and Ohio Rivers with 22 tow and tugboats and over 620 barges. Consol's Baltimore Marine terminal provides coal transshipment services from rail cars to ocean transport ships.[6]
Consol's Water Division is involved in water purification with a focus on treating wastewater produced as a byproduct of hydraulic fracturing. The company operates reverse osmosis water purification plants and has a minority interest in a company that develops solar-powered water purification systems which, as of July 2012[update], was conducting a pilot test at one of Consol's gas drilling sites.[24][25]

Consol also maintains the Fairmont Supply Company, dedicated to the sale and distribution of mining services and equipment. Additionally, the company operates the largest privately owned research and development facility in the industry that is devoted exclusively to coal and energy utilization and production.[26]
Financials[edit]
In 2010, Consol Energy had an annual revenue of $5.236 billion. Customers primarily include electric utilities and steel mills in the U.S., but demand from European utilities has increased during the 2000s.[6] Consol Energy was ranked number 428 on the Fortune 500 list in 2011.[27]
Corporate responsibility[edit]

Environmental record[edit]
In September 2009, several thousand fish were killed in Dunkard Creek, Monongalia County, West Virginia. While state officials attributed the fish kill to a golden algae bloom, an investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency claimed that mining discharges from Consol Energy's Blacksville No. 2 mine created the conditions for the golden algae bloom.[28] After halting operations at the mine following the fish kill, Consol was allowed to continue mining operations after coming to an agreement with the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection to submit a proposal for discharge treatment plants by April 15 of 2010.[29] Consol also invested $200 million in a water treatment facility and paid a $5.5 million federal penalty to the U.S. Department of Justice and half to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection in 2011.[30] The company maintains that it was never found liable for the fish kill.[31]
As a producer of coal and natural gas, the environmental impact of coal mining and natural gas drilling has been a subject of controversy for Consol Energy. Despite this, the company has been recognized for its efforts at environmental protection and was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Climate Protection Award in 2002.[32] Additionally, Consol maintains ongoing environmental efforts aimed at restoring and enhancing property managed by the company and has worked with conservation groups including Ducks Unlimited and the National Wild Turkey Federation on habitat restoration efforts.[33]
Political involvement[edit]
An ad by the National Rifle Association critical of President Barack Obama that was filmed on Consol's Blacksville No. 2 coal mine in West Virginia became an issue of political debate in 2009.[34] The National Rifle Association intended to ask miners the question "How do you feel about having your Second Amendment rights taken away if Obama becomes president." Word spread among pro-Obama miners who contacted their union, the United Mine Workers of America, resulting in 440 miners taking the day off to avoid appearing in the ad in a contract-sanctioned protest, halting production at Consol's Blacksville No. 2 coal mine.[35]
Lobbying efforts on the part of Consol have also been an issue of controversy. In the first quarter of 2010, Consol spent $1.02 million in lobbying expenses on issues relating to the coal mining and natural gas industries.[36]
Naming rights[edit]
Consol Energy has put its name to two sports facilities in its Pittsburgh-area. In 2007, Consol Energy purchased the naming rights to Washington, Pennsylvania's minor league baseball team the Washington Wild Things' field, Consol Energy Park.[37] Consol later purchased the naming rights to the Consol Energy Center in 2008; the arena that hosts the Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League team. [38][39] It is estimated that Consol Energy won the bid for naming rights at a cost between $2.0 - $4.0 million per year, for 21 years. As of October 2016 the Consol Energy Center has been renamed PPG Paints Arena as Consol Energy has ended its naming rights of the venue. [40]

OPINION BY Justice BARBARA MILANO KEENAN.
In this appeal, we consider whether the provisions in a lease granting to a lessee *529 exclusive rights in coalseam gas on the lessor's property also granted to the lessee the exclusive right to construct and maintain pipelines and structures to transport any gas over the lessor's property.
Pocahontas Mining Limited Liability Company (Pocahontas) is the owner of a tract of land consisting of over 20,000 acres (the property) located partially in Buchanan and Tazewell Counties, and partially in West Virginia. In 1998, Pocahontas[1] entered into a lease (the 1998 lease) with Pocahontas Gas Partnership (PGP) granting to PGP rights in the coalseam gas located beneath the surface of the property. The relevant granting provisions of the lease (the granting clause) provided that:
Lessor grants, leases and lets exclusively unto Lessee any and all rights it has to all of the coalseam gas, including, but not limited to, coalbed methane gas, coalbed gas, methane gas, gob gas, occluded natural gas in any formation or other naturally occurring gases contained in or associated with any coalseam lying below the base of the Tiller seam and all zones in communication therewith and all associated natural gas and other hydrocarbons contained therein and all gas originating or produced from coalseam to coalseam (hereinafter collectively referred to as "coalseam gas" or "coalbed methane"), underlying [the property] together with any and all rights necessary or convenient to develop, produce, market and sell said coalseam gas including, but not limited to, the exclusive rights of exploring, drilling, producing, gathering, transporting, and selling the coalseam gas, the rights to construct and maintain all pipelines, tanks, structures, and utility lines that Lessee may deem necessary and convenient for the production and/or transportation of coalseam gas or other gas, whether or not owned, leased, or produced by Lessee, from this and other lands, whether or not owned or leased by Lessee....
Further, the 1998 lease had a clause addressing Pocahontas' reservation of certain rights that provided:
Except as granted and leased herein, there is excepted and reserved to Lessor the entire ownership and control of the lands included herein and the oil, gas, coal, stone, sand, water, timber, and other minerals and products therein and thereon, with the right to use and dispose of the same for all purposes other than those for which this Lease is made except as such ownership and control may be leased to other parties by other instruments.
In 2006, Pocahontas and GeoMet Operating Co., Inc. (GeoMet) entered into a right of way agreement (the right of way agreement), in which Pocahontas granted to GeoMet the exclusive right to construct, operate, and maintain a pipeline to transport natural gas across, through, upon, over, and under a portion of the property. In accordance with the right of way agreement, GeoMet began to construct a pipeline to transport natural gas. Shortly thereafter, agents of CNX Gas Company, L.L.C. (CNX), PGP's successor in interest under the 1998 lease, installed gates and prevented representatives of GeoMet or Pocahontas from obtaining access to the property.[2]
GeoMet and Pocahontas filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Buchanan County (the circuit court) seeking a declaratory judgment interpreting the respective rights of GeoMet, Pocahontas, and CNX under the 1998 lease and the right of way agreement. GeoMet and Pocahontas also sought an injunction to prevent CNX from blocking access to the property. CNX filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment of the parties' rights under the 1998 lease and the right of way agreement.[3]
*530 The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. In May 2007, the circuit court entered an order (the May order) granting CNX's motion for summary judgment. In that order, the circuit court held that the 1998 lease was unambiguous and that all the rights CNX possessed under the lease were exclusive, including the rights to construct and maintain all pipelines and all structures on the property and to transport coalseam gas or other gas on, over, under, or through the property. The circuit court ordered GeoMet to remove its pipeline from the property and to cease its transportation of coalseam gas or other gas on, over, under, or through the property.
GeoMet and Pocahontas appealed the injunctive provisions of the May order to this Court under Code § 8.01-626. Concluding that the May order contained injunctive relief that CNX did not request, this Court vacated the portion of the order granting injunctive relief and remanded the case to the circuit court. The circuit court later certified the remaining provisions of the May order to this Court for review under the interlocutory appeal procedures of Code § 8.01-670.1. In accordance with the circuit court's certification, GeoMet and Pocahontas seek review in this Court of those remaining provisions in the circuit court's award of summary judgment.
GeoMet and Pocahontas (collectively, GeoMet) argue that the terms of the 1998 lease are unambiguous. GeoMet asserts that under a plain reading of the lease, the term "exclusively" in the phrase "Lessor grants, leases and lets exclusively unto Lessee" refers only to the rights to the coalseam gas estate. Thus, GeoMet contends that in the 1998 lease, Pocahontas granted to CNX exclusive rights to the coalseam gas, "together with" non-exclusive "rights necessary or convenient to develop, produce, market and sell said coalseam gas."
GeoMet cites additional language in the 1998 lease in support of its position that some of the rights granted in the lease are exclusive, while other rights granted are non-exclusive. GeoMet points to the language granting "the exclusive rights of exploring, drilling, producing, gathering, transporting, and selling the coalseam gas, the rights to construct and maintain all pipelines, tanks, structures, and utility lines...." (emphasis added). GeoMet contends that the omission of the term "exclusive" with respect to the rights to construct and maintain pipelines, tanks, structures, and utility lines indicates that those rights granted to CNX are not exclusive rights.
In response, CNX agrees that the 1998 lease is unambiguous, but contends that under a plain reading of the lease, all the rights granted in the lease are exclusive to CNX. In support of its argument, CNX cites to the lease language that "[l]essor grants, leases and lets exclusively unto [l]essee," and argues that the term "exclusively" governs all the rights granted to CNX in the lease. CNX further contends that its interpretation of the term "exclusively" does not conflict with other terms of the lease because the sole purpose of the lease was to grant to CNX exclusive rights, including the exclusive right to transport gas from any source.
Alternatively, CNX argues that if the lease terms do not unambiguously grant to CNX such exclusive rights, then the disputed lease language must be considered ambiguous and the case must be remanded to the circuit court for the receipt of parol evidence concerning the parties' intent when the lease was executed. We disagree with CNX's arguments.
In our analysis of the lease terms, we rely on established principles of contract interpretation. The question whether a contract is ambiguous presents an issue of law. Virginia Elec. & Power Co. v. Northern Virginia Reg'l Park Auth., 270 Va. 309, 315, 618 S.E.2d 323, 326 (2005); Video Zone, Inc. v. KF & F Props. L.C., 267 Va. 621, 625, 594 S.E.2d 921, 923 (2004); Utsch v. Utsch, 266 Va. 124, 129, 581 S.E.2d 507, 509 (2003); Eure v. Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Corp., 263 Va. 624, 631, 561 S.E.2d 663, 667 (2002). Accordingly, on appeal, we review the circuit court's interpretation of the disputed lease provisions de novo. Virginia Elec. & Power Co., 270 Va. at 315, 618 S.E.2d at 326; Video Zone, Inc., 267 Va. at 625, 594 S.E.2d at 923; Utsch, 266 Va. at 129, 581 S.E.2d at 509; Eure, 263 Va. at 631, 561 *531 S.E.2d at 667. We do not accord any deference to the circuit court's resolution of this question of law because we are afforded the same opportunity as the circuit court to interpret the terms of the parties' contract. Video Zone, Inc., 267 Va. at 625, 594 S.E.2d at 923; Pyramid Dev., L.L.C. v. D & J Assocs., 262 Va. 750, 754, 553 S.E.2d 725, 727 (2001).
A court's primary focus in considering disputed contractual language is to determine the parties' intention, which should be ascertained, whenever possible, from the language the parties employed in their agreement. Flippo v. CSC Assocs. III, L.L.C., 262 Va. 48, 64, 547 S.E.2d 216, 226 (2001); Langman v. Alumni Ass'n of the Univ. of Va., 247 Va. 491, 498-99, 442 S.E.2d 669, 674 (1994); Camp v. Camp, 220 Va. 595, 597, 260 S.E.2d 243, 245 (1979). An ambiguity exists when the contract's language is of doubtful import, is susceptible of being understood in more than one way or of having more than one meaning, or refers to two or more things at the same time. Video Zone, Inc., 267 Va. at 625, 594 S.E.2d at 923; Tuomala v. Regent Univ., 252 Va. 368, 374, 477 S.E.2d 501, 505 (1996); Galloway Corp. v. S.B. Ballard Constr., 250 Va. 493, 502, 464 S.E.2d 349, 355 (1995). The mere fact that the parties disagree about the meaning of the contract's terms is not evidence that the contract language is ambiguous. Pocahontas Mining Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Jewell Ridge Coal Corp., 263 Va. 169, 173, 556 S.E.2d 769, 771 (2002); Galloway, 250 Va. at 502, 464 S.E.2d at 354; Wilson v. Holyfield, 227 Va. 184, 187, 313 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1984).
In determining whether disputed contractual terms are ambiguous, we consider the words employed by the parties in accordance with their usual, ordinary, and popular meaning. Video Zone, Inc., 267 Va. at 626, 594 S.E.2d at 924; Haisfield v. Lape, 264 Va. 632, 637, 570 S.E.2d 794, 796 (2002); Pocahontas Mining Ltd. Liab. Co., 263 Va. at 173, 556 S.E.2d at 772. No word or phrase employed in a contract will be treated as meaningless if a reasonable meaning can be assigned to it, and there is a presumption that the contracting parties have not used words needlessly. City of Chesapeake v. States Self-Insurers Risk Retention Group, Inc., 271 Va. 574, 578, 628 S.E.2d 539, 541 (2006); Westmoreland-LG&E Partners v. Virginia Elec. & Power Co., 254 Va. 1, 11, 486 S.E.2d 289, 294 (1997). Further, the omission of a particular term from a contract is evidence that the parties intended to exclude that term. Bentley Funding Group, L.L.C. v. SK & R Group, L.L.C., 269 Va. 315, 330, 609 S.E.2d 49, 56 (2005); First Nat'l Bank v. Roy N. Ford Co., 219 Va. 942, 946, 252 S.E.2d 354, 357 (1979).
In ascertaining the parties' intention regarding specific contract provisions, we consider the document as a whole. American Spirit Ins. Co. v. Owens, 261 Va. 270, 275, 541 S.E.2d 553, 555 (2001); Lansdowne Development Co. v. Xerox Realty Corp., 257 Va. 392, 401, 514 S.E.2d 157, 161 (1999); Westmoreland-LG&E Partners, 254 Va. at 11, 486 S.E.2d at 294; Langman, 247 Va. at 498-99, 442 S.E.2d at 675. When the writing, considered as a whole, is clear, unambiguous, and explicit, a court asked to interpret such a document should look no further than the four corners of the instrument. Virginia Elec. & Power Co., 270 Va. at 316, 618 S.E.2d at 326; Langman, 247 Va. at 498, 442 S.E.2d at 675; Trailsend Land Co. v. Virginia Holding Corp., 228 Va. 319, 325, 321 S.E.2d 667, 670 (1984).
Applying these principles, we conclude that the disputed lease provisions are unambiguous. By selectively identifying certain rights as "exclusive," while omitting any reference to the term "exclusive" in describing other rights, the lease language signifies the parties' clear intention that only some, rather than all, the stated rights are exclusively granted to CNX. The lease gives CNX exclusive rights to the coalseam gas estate, including the exclusive rights of exploration, drilling, production, gathering, transportation, and sale of the coalseam gas. The lease also grants to CNX non-exclusive rights, including the right to construct and maintain pipelines and other facilities necessary and convenient for the production and transportation of the coalseam gas, and of other gas from whatever source.
*532 Notably, the language in the lease granting to CNX rights to construct and maintain pipelines does not limit Pocahontas' right to use the property for those purposes, except to require that Pocahontas permit CNX to construct and maintain "all pipelines, tanks, structures, and utility lines that [CNX] may deem necessary and convenient" for the production and transportation of the coalseam gas or other gas. The language at issue merely details CNX's right to erect pipelines and other facilities and to use those pipelines and facilities for the purposes described in the lease.
The lease language is not rendered ambiguous by the parties' use of the term "exclusively," which appears at the beginning of the disputed language. The parties' inclusion of this term merely clarified that Pocahontas granted exclusively to CNX all the rights to the coalseam gas underlying the property. CNX's more expansive interpretation of the term "exclusively" is unavailing, because acceptance of CNX's position would impermissibly require us to treat as meaningless and redundant the lease's later designation of particular rights as "exclusive." See States Self-Insurers, 271 Va. at 578, 628 S.E.2d at 541; Westmoreland-LG&E Partners, 254 Va. at 11, 486 S.E.2d at 294.
Viewed in this context, the absence of a term denoting exclusivity in the description of CNX's "rights to construct and maintain all pipelines" is significant. Plainly, by omitting any reference to an exclusive right in addressing the subject of pipelines on the leased property, the parties expressed their intent that such rights of CNX would not be exclusive.[4]See Bentley Funding Group, 269 Va. at 330, 609 S.E.2d at 57; First Nat'l Bank, 219 Va. at 946, 252 S.E.2d at 357.
The opposite conclusion urged by CNX is additionally unpersuasive because that conclusion would render inoperative Pocahontas' reservation of rights to the property for such purposes as the development of oil and non-coalseam gas, which would have to be transported from the property through pipelines. Further, under CNX's view of the lease language, Pocahontas would be precluded from engaging in any activity that was "necessary or convenient" for CNX's utilization of its interest in the leasehold property, irrespective whether Pocahontas' activities actually caused CNX to suffer any inconvenience or other difficulty. Such a construction would effect a sweeping evisceration of Pocahontas' other production rights in the property, in contravention of Pocahontas' express reservation of rights in the lease.
In sum, the clear purpose of the lease was to allow CNX to produce, transport, and sell the coalseam gas obtained from the property, and to transport "other gas" from whatever source over Pocahontas' property. The disputed lease provisions protect CNX's rights to take such actions as are necessary and convenient to conduct these activities, but do not permit CNX to prevent other uses of the land that do not affect CNX's exercise of its stated lease rights.
For these reasons, we will reverse the circuit court's order declaring the parties' rights under the 1998 lease and remand the case for such further action as may be required consistent with the principles expressed in this opinion.
Reversed and remanded.
NOTES
[1]  The entity named in the lease was Pocahontas Mining Company Limited Partnership, L.L.P., which later became Pocahontas Mining Limited Liability Company.
[2]  Although CNX was not a party to the 1998 lease, CNX is the successor in interest to PGP, the named lessee. For purposes of this opinion, we will refer to the rights granted under the 1998 lease as rights granted to CNX.
[3]  Additionally, CNX sought adjudication of its rights under a deed of easement it entered into with Pocahontas in 1998.
[4]  CNX also argues that in determining the parties' intent, we should consider a memorandum of lease that was executed contemporaneously with the 1998 lease. However, because we determine that the 1998 lease was unambiguous, we limit our consideration to the four corners of that document. See Virginia Elec. & Power Co., 270 Va. at 316, 618 S.E.2d at 326; Langman, 247 Va. at 498, 442 S.E.2d at 674.

Corporations Compared to LLCs - Corporation Topics | LegalZoom


































In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs

        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.
