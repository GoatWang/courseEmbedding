How do you want to be remembered?

How do you want to change the world?

What will your legacy be?


A thoughtful charitable plan will help you address these questions while, at the same time, reducing your tax bill now and in the future.
​

The CGOV Foundation can help.























The CGOV Foundation
Charitable giving made easier and more impactful.





While many generous individuals embrace the idea of creating a philanthropic legacy, most charitable giving is done without the benefit of a long-term plan. As a result, donations are typically made on an ad hoc basis.
By implementing a long-term giving plan, the impact of your donations will multiply and create a powerful legacy that can truly change the world. 

The CGOV Foundation provides a framework that allows you to build your legacy by creating a plan that vastly improves the efficiency of your charitable giving. The CGOV Foundation is designed to offer a more focused and strategic approach to philanthropy, while also providing for efficient tax and estate planning.




Features of The CGOV Foundation
Funding: Create your account with a donation of as little as $100,000. You may also add further contributions anytime in the future.
Naming: You decide the name given to your Fund (e.g., John Smith Family Fund; Save the Whales Endowment, etc.).
Supporting: You decide the charities that will benefit from your generosity, as well as how much they will receive from your Fund. Your recipients must be Canadian registered charities or other qualified recipients.
Efficiency: Your Fund operates similarly to a Private Foundation, but without the upfront costs and administrative responsibilities.
Succession: You decide on the appropriate succession options for your Fund.
























Benefits of the CGOV Foundation





IMPACT
The CGOV Foundation allows you to shape and define your legacy. Whatever your interests, whatever your passions, you can make a real and sustained difference.
CONTINUITY
The CGOV Foundation provides a mechanism that involves your family in your charitable plan. This assists in the reinforcement of the values you pass on to future generations, including the importance of giving back to society.




FLEXIBILITY
The CGOV Foundation give you the flexibility to:

Incorporate a variety of different assets into your plan to support your charitable giving in a tax-advantaged manner
Support various charities close to home, across the country, and/or around the world
Decide on how you want your legacy to be managed well into the future
Choose an investment strategy that better reflects your philosophy and time horizon






Fees

1% for investment management services
0.25% for administrative services (i.e. legal, audit, granting funds to charities)

Patient. Disciplined. Distinct. We believe that superior equity portfolios are built by investing in a focused number of companies that have great management and operate in diverse industry sectors.

















"As conservative investors we must diversify, but as effective investors, we must focus and diversify wisely. This has been our investment philosophy since 1995." Gord O'Reilly


 






  Our investment process is: • Disciplined • Patient • Repeatable

Investment ideas come to us from industry contacts, screens, reading, and competitors. We have a diligent, internal research process that we follow strictly, and form independent judgments about the companies in which we invest. 
Our investment process balances the science of quantifiable, financial metrics and the art of evaluating the people that make up the management of businesses. We evaluate three critical ingredients: people, business and price. 
Because the traditional definitions of “value” and “growth” have become so blurred, we have developed the nomenclature of Core Companies and Opportunistic Companies to categorize the two types of companies we purchase.















 



"Limiting the number of companies in a mandate to a maximum of 25 allows us to become familiar with all aspects of a business. Our limits also ensure each client’s portfolio does not exhibit index-like characteristics, thereby giving the portfolio a greater chance of outperforming over the long term." ROY HEWSON

CGOV Asset Management believes that a superior equity portfolio can be built by investing in a focused number of companies run by great management teams diversified across globally recognized industry sectors. 
There is a wide body of research extolling the virtues of diversification, but far less has been devoted to the risks of being overly-diversified. Over-diversifying is probably the single most influential reason that the vast majority of professional managers under-perform their targeted benchmark after fees. As conservative investors we must diversify, but as effective investors we must focus and diversify wisely.









Limiting our equity holdings to a maximum of 25 companies per mandate allows us to become familiar with all critical aspects of a business including:
  • management • business plan execution • employees • customers • suppliers • board members • capital structure • competitive advantage

Patient. Disciplined. Distinct. We believe that superior equity portfolios are built by investing in a focused number of companies that have great management and operate in diverse industry sectors.

















"As conservative investors we must diversify, but as effective investors, we must focus and diversify wisely. This has been our investment philosophy since 1995." Gord O'Reilly


 






  Our investment process is: • Disciplined • Patient • Repeatable

Investment ideas come to us from industry contacts, screens, reading, and competitors. We have a diligent, internal research process that we follow strictly, and form independent judgments about the companies in which we invest. 
Our investment process balances the science of quantifiable, financial metrics and the art of evaluating the people that make up the management of businesses. We evaluate three critical ingredients: people, business and price. 
Because the traditional definitions of “value” and “growth” have become so blurred, we have developed the nomenclature of Core Companies and Opportunistic Companies to categorize the two types of companies we purchase.















 



"Limiting the number of companies in a mandate to a maximum of 25 allows us to become familiar with all aspects of a business. Our limits also ensure each client’s portfolio does not exhibit index-like characteristics, thereby giving the portfolio a greater chance of outperforming over the long term." ROY HEWSON

CGOV Asset Management believes that a superior equity portfolio can be built by investing in a focused number of companies run by great management teams diversified across globally recognized industry sectors. 
There is a wide body of research extolling the virtues of diversification, but far less has been devoted to the risks of being overly-diversified. Over-diversifying is probably the single most influential reason that the vast majority of professional managers under-perform their targeted benchmark after fees. As conservative investors we must diversify, but as effective investors we must focus and diversify wisely.









Limiting our equity holdings to a maximum of 25 companies per mandate allows us to become familiar with all critical aspects of a business including:
  • management • business plan execution • employees • customers • suppliers • board members • capital structure • competitive advantage

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Identifying the main drivers of long-term change is key to investment success in the 21st century. We believe we are at the beginning of a secular growth phase for the U.S. economy driven largely by the rebalancing of global growth from the developed to the developing world. We focus on the long-term drivers, the macro forces and investment themes at play across industries that are taking us into the next growth cycle.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

A radical shift in the forces shaping emerging market (EM) growth will require investors to take a different investment approach from what may have worked in the past.
