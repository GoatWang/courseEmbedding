FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

Call us to see if you qualify.

Loan Disclosures


This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.

      Fitch to Rate COMM 2014-CCRE18 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Certificates; Presale Issued
    





June 16, 2014 02:48 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM 2014-CCRE18 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$47,076,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$139,682,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$53,600,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$20,350,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$195,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$241,730,000 class A-5 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$758,464,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$53,554,000c class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$26,153,000c class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Notional amount and interest only.
    

      (b) Class A-M, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-M, 
      B, and C certificates.
    

      (c) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of June 16, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $79,707,247 
      interest-only class X-C certificates the $23,664,000c class F or 
      $29,890,247 class G certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 49 loans secured by 60 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $996 
      million, as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P., German American Capital 
      Corporation, Ladder Capital Finance LLC, and Natixis Real Estate Capital 
      LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 71.8% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 82.7%, and asset summary reviews on 82.6% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Concentrated Pool: The 10 largest loans represent 57.5% of the total 
      pool balance, which is higher than the average 2013 top 10 concentration 
      of 54.5%.
    

      High Leverage: The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV of 1.14x and 110.5%, 
      respectively, are worse than the 1st quarter 2014 averages of 1.18x and 
      104.7%, respectively.
    

      Diverse Property Type Mix: The pool has a good mix of property types, 
      with retail as the largest property type at 23.7%, followed by 
      multifamily at 18.3%, mixed-use at 18.2%, office at 12.6% and hotel at 
      12.2%. There are 13 retail properties. None of the retail properties are 
      malls. The retail properties consist of a mix of anchored and unanchored 
      shopping centers.
    

      Limited Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 11.7% of the 
      initial pool balance prior to maturity. Three loans (16.4%), including 
      the largest loan, are full-term interest only, and 20 loans (47.3%) are 
      partial interest only. Fitch rated transactions in the 1st quarter of 
      2014 had an average full-term interest only percentage of 15.8% and a 
      partial interest only percentage of 37.6%. This transaction has a lower 
      than average amount of full-term interest only but a higher amount of 
      partial interest only.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 11.5% below the 
      most recent NOI (for properties that a recent NOI was provided, 
      excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period). 
      Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in 
      higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and could result 
      in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch evaluated the 
      sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 2014-CCRE18 certificates and 
      found that the transaction displays slightly above average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in 
      which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 75 - 76.
    

      The master servicer will be KeyBank National Association, rated 'CMS1' 
      by Fitch. The special servicer will be Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC, 
      rated 'CSS2-'.
    

      Criteria Application
    

      Fitch property-level cash flow analysis, modeling assumptions, and 
      application of Fitch mortgage constants and cap rates were generally 
      consistent with Fitch Research on 'Criteria for Analyzing Multiborrower 
      U.S. Commercial Mortgage Transactions,' dated Aug. 7, 2013, available on 
      Fitch's website at www.fitchratings.com. 
      Updates to the published criteria were applied as follows:
    

      --For non-pari passu full-term IO conduit loans in this transaction, the 
      FC-DSCR is weighted 33.3% FT-DSCR and 66.7% FK-DSCR. In addition, 
      amortization credit has been increased for all amortizing loans. This 
      criteria update is based on recent regression testing which demonstrated 
      a more significant difference in the performance of amortizing versus 
      interest-only loans.
    

      --The confidence interval for the 'AAAsf' rating category has been 
      increased from 99.990% to 99.995% and the confidence interval for the 
      'AAsf' rating category has been decreased from 99.920% to 99.880%. This 
      criteria update is based on an examination of tranche thickness and 
      implied loss coverage multiples as they compare to other structured 
      finance sectors.
    

      An updated version of the Criteria for Analyzing Multiborrower U.S. 
      Commercial Mortgage Transactions containing a detailed description and 
      examples of the updates mentioned above is anticipated to be published 
      in June 2014. The presale report is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.
    

      Additional Information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

Call us to see if you qualify.

Loan Disclosures


This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
