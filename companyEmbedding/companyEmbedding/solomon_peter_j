History[edit]
PJSC was founded in 1989 by Peter J. Solomon and was the first private independent investment banking firm on Wall Street,[9] created to mirror the ethos and culture of the original privately held investment banks at a time when many of the large investment banks had gone public.[10] In the ensuing decades, the firm has grown to more than 75 people and has added senior bankers drawn from major Wall Street investment banks.[11]
In June 2016, PJSC entered into an alliance with Natixis, the international corporate, investment, insurance and financial services arm of Groupe BPCE, France's second largest financial institution - selling a 51% stake in the firm. The remaining 49% of PJSC's ownership continues to be held by its existing partners. The Natixis investment is intended to create an enhanced global M&A advisory and financing platform, coupling PJSC's entrepreneurial spirit with a multi-faceted debt and equity financing vehicle that offers international reach across the Americas, EMEA and Asia.
Solomon is a former Vice Chairman of Lehman Brothers where he was co-chairman of investment banking.[11]
From 1978 to 1980, Mr. Solomon served as Deputy Mayor of Economic Policy and Development in New York City under Mayor Edward Koch, and in 1980, he served as Counselor to the United States Treasury in the Carter Administration.[12] In 2010, he testified before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission created by the U.S. Congress.[13]

The international hit comedy My Mother's Italian, My Father's Jewish & I'm in Therapy!, featuring Peter J. Fogel, comes to the Lakewood Cultural Center in August.

Performances are Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m., Thursdays at 2 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., Fridays at 7:30 p.m., Saturdays at 2 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets are $40-$59 and available at lakewood.showare.com or by phone at 303-987-7845. For group rates (10 or more) call 1-888-264-1788.
 
Described as "One part lasagna, one part kreplach, and two parts Prozac," you don't have to be Jewish or Italian to love this show. All you need is to know what it feels like to leave a family dinner with heartburn and a headache!
 
My Mother's Italian, My Father's Jewish & I'm in Therapy! played for two years in New York City and has toured internationally in more than 100 cities.
 
Written by award-winning author Steve Solomon, the hilarious one-man comedy is based on his life growing up in a wacky family noted for its bi-ethnic diversity and aptitude for dysfunctional behavior, and all the people in his life whose sole purpose was to drive him into therapy! The author, whose mother is from Palermo and whose father is from Russia, grew up as one of two siblings in Brooklyn.
 
My Mother's Italian, My Father's Jewish & I'm in Therapy!, stars award-winning actor and comedian Peter Fogel, who has appeared in more than 20 television programs including Married With Children, Unhappily Ever After and Men Behaving Badly.
 
The production won "Favorite New Play" by Broadway.com and won the "Broadway Theater Fans Choice Award" on BroadwayWorld.com. The Connecticut Critics Circle and the San Francisco Drama Desk also nominated the show for awards.
 
The show is produced by Philip Roger Roy and Dana Matthow. For more information, visit PlayhouseInfo.com.
 
Peter J. Fogel is an award-winning comedian, actor, playwright and published author who has performed in the U.S., Canada and Australia, for more than 25 years.
 
He's either worked or performed on more than 22 television programs such as Comic Strip Live, Comedy on the Road, Married With Children, Unhappily Ever After, Chicago Sons (Jason Bateman) and Men Behaving Badly! (Rob Schneider).
 
Other network appearance: HBO, NBC MTV, PBS and A&E. As a sitcom writer, Peter wrote for Columbia Tri-Star's television's Rita's Velt, Germany's number one sitcom, (and their only one.) He's also contributed comedy material to Oscar nominated actor Chazz Palminteri (A Bronx Tale).
 
No stranger to theatrical audiences, Peter's had the good fortune of gracing the stage at the Parker Playhouse, Coral Springs Center for the Performing Arts, Wisdom Bridge Theatre, Gordon Center for the Arts, SUNY Rockland Community College's Cultural Arts Center and Lyric Theatre. Theatre credits include Yentl, Ghosts of a Lonely Heart and Cocoa's Cabaret and Burlesque (Seminole Casino).
 
As a commercial actor, you might have seen or heard Peter Shamelessly hawk products for Budweiser, Zima, American Express, Wisk Detergent (He was the Ring Around the Collar Man).
 
From cruise ships to casinos and Vegas showrooms, this eclectic funny man has shared the stage with such comedic luminaries as Ray Romano, Jon Stewart, RoBert Klein, Ed Asner, Harry Anderson, Lewis Black and Dennis Miller.
 
Peter received his BFA at the famed SUNY at Purchase Theatre Arts program whose graduates include Ving Rhames, (Mission Impossible), Steven Weber (Wings) Wesley Snipes (Blade) and Stanley Tucci (The Hunger Games).
 
When not acting, Peter keeps busy as an in-demand corporate trainer/business speaker and is the best-selling author of Reboot Your Career: 27 Ways to Reinvent Yourself in the Workplace (If You Still have a Job!).
 
As if he's not busy enough, Peter's also the Host of Boomer Humor Radio, the number one self-indulgent help show on internet radio (www.boomerhumorradio.com).

History[edit]
PJSC was founded in 1989 by Peter J. Solomon and was the first private independent investment banking firm on Wall Street,[9] created to mirror the ethos and culture of the original privately held investment banks at a time when many of the large investment banks had gone public.[10] In the ensuing decades, the firm has grown to more than 75 people and has added senior bankers drawn from major Wall Street investment banks.[11]
In June 2016, PJSC entered into an alliance with Natixis, the international corporate, investment, insurance and financial services arm of Groupe BPCE, France's second largest financial institution - selling a 51% stake in the firm. The remaining 49% of PJSC's ownership continues to be held by its existing partners. The Natixis investment is intended to create an enhanced global M&A advisory and financing platform, coupling PJSC's entrepreneurial spirit with a multi-faceted debt and equity financing vehicle that offers international reach across the Americas, EMEA and Asia.
Solomon is a former Vice Chairman of Lehman Brothers where he was co-chairman of investment banking.[11]
From 1978 to 1980, Mr. Solomon served as Deputy Mayor of Economic Policy and Development in New York City under Mayor Edward Koch, and in 1980, he served as Counselor to the United States Treasury in the Carter Administration.[12] In 2010, he testified before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission created by the U.S. Congress.[13]

Described as "One part lasagna, one part kreplach, and two parts Prozac," you don't have to be Jewish or Italian to love this show. All you need is to know what it feels like to leave a family dinner with heartburn and a headache!
 
My Mother's Italian, My Father's Jewish & I'm in Therapy! played for two years in New York City and has toured internationally in more than 100 cities.
 
Written by award-winning author Steve Solomon, the hilarious one-man comedy is based on his life growing up in a wacky family noted for its bi-ethnic diversity and aptitude for dysfunctional behavior, and all the people in his life whose sole purpose was to drive him into therapy! The author, whose mother is from Palermo and whose father is from Russia, grew up as one of two siblings in Brooklyn.
 
My Mother's Italian, My Father's Jewish & I'm in Therapy!, stars award-winning actor and comedian Peter Fogel, who has appeared in more than 20 television programs including Married With Children, Unhappily Ever After and Men Behaving Badly.
 
The production won "Favorite New Play" by Broadway.com and won the "Broadway Theater Fans Choice Award" on BroadwayWorld.com. The Connecticut Critics Circle and the San Francisco Drama Desk also nominated the show for awards.
 
The show is produced by Philip Roger Roy and Dana Matthow. For more information, visit PlayhouseInfo.com.
 
Peter J. Fogel is an award-winning comedian, actor, playwright and published author who has performed in the U.S., Canada and Australia, for more than 25 years.
 
He's either worked or performed on more than 22 television programs such as Comic Strip Live, Comedy on the Road, Married With Children, Unhappily Ever After, Chicago Sons (Jason Bateman) and Men Behaving Badly! (Rob Schneider).
 
Other network appearance: HBO, NBC MTV, PBS and A&E. As a sitcom writer, Peter wrote for Columbia Tri-Star's television's Rita's Velt, Germany's number one sitcom, (and their only one.) He's also contributed comedy material to Oscar nominated actor Chazz Palminteri (A Bronx Tale).
 
No stranger to theatrical audiences, Peter's had the good fortune of gracing the stage at the Parker Playhouse, Coral Springs Center for the Performing Arts, Wisdom Bridge Theatre, Gordon Center for the Arts, SUNY Rockland Community College's Cultural Arts Center and Lyric Theatre. Theatre credits include Yentl, Ghosts of a Lonely Heart and Cocoa's Cabaret and Burlesque (Seminole Casino).
 
As a commercial actor, you might have seen or heard Peter Shamelessly hawk products for Budweiser, Zima, American Express, Wisk Detergent (He was the Ring Around the Collar Man).
 
From cruise ships to casinos and Vegas showrooms, this eclectic funny man has shared the stage with such comedic luminaries as Ray Romano, Jon Stewart, RoBert Klein, Ed Asner, Harry Anderson, Lewis Black and Dennis Miller.
 
Peter received his BFA at the famed SUNY at Purchase Theatre Arts program whose graduates include Ving Rhames, (Mission Impossible), Steven Weber (Wings) Wesley Snipes (Blade) and Stanley Tucci (The Hunger Games).
 
When not acting, Peter keeps busy as an in-demand corporate trainer/business speaker and is the best-selling author of Reboot Your Career: 27 Ways to Reinvent Yourself in the Workplace (If You Still have a Job!).
 
As if he's not busy enough, Peter's also the Host of Boomer Humor Radio, the number one self-indulgent help show on internet radio (www.boomerhumorradio.com).

Uncompromised advice and innovative solutions 
A successful investment banking relationship requires that the investment banker understand the values and aspirations of the client. These values and
    goals are usually not apparent immediately, nor is the client always certain at the outset of a project how to weigh and value the components of a
    successful outcome.
Peter J. Solomon Company listens carefully to clients and works with them to articulate their key objectives. Once we understand their goals, we use quantitative
    analysis and informed experience to determine the course of action most likely to attain their goals.

A Place to Grow
Because of our entrepreneurial nature, PJSC encourages our employees to assume increasing levels of responsibility commensurate with their
                    progress. As a result, PJSC believes our professionals develop important client and deal experience earlier than their peers at larger,
                    more structured investment banking firms. If you are resourceful, energetic and demonstrate initiative, you can build a career at PJSC.
                    We regularly promote our junior bankers up through the ranks. 
People who have demonstrated leadership skills, who can flourish in a team environment and who are flexible by nature and creative in their
                    thinking will thrive at our firm.
We recruit the best and brightest. This is what we look for in candidates:

PJSC Culture
PJSC’s culture is built on honesty, integrity and a collective commitment to providing clients with sound, unbiased advice. We are guided
                    on a daily basis by these values and pursue them in a collaborative environment that promotes excellence and creativity.
                     
 Intellectual Integrity
Clients retain PJSC to render objective conclusions about strategic decisions which affect their capitalizations. Our advice is free
                        from conflicts of interest. The partnership does not invest for its own account, trade securities, provide research or manage client
                        assets. Relationship Focused
Our personal, responsive approach emphasizes relationships, not transactions, and is at the heart of our concept of investment banking.
                        A dedicated team remains with the client throughout every project. We Give Back
We encourage and support our people to engage in the non-profit world whether through volunteer projects, participation in charitable
                        events or donating their time in non-profit board positions.

Real Estate






OUR ADVISORY APPROACH: THINK LIKE AN OWNER
Drawing upon more than 50 years of experience and as a complement to our legacy advisory services, PJSC offers clients a suite of services dedicated exclusively
    to maximizing their real estate assets.
Whereas many firms in advising real estate do so only as intermediaries, PJSC advises from the unique position of having been principals and owners of
    real estate. As a result, we are able to analyze opportunities from our clients’ perspective.
PJSC's partnership with JOSS Realty Partners, in its $100mm PJSC-JOSS Real Estate Fund, has produced a unique set of tools when it comes to representing
    clients.
HELPING CLIENTS DERIVE VALUE FROM REAL ESTATE
We understand that optimizing real estate is not just about maximizing real estate value but also involves strategy to have the real estate maximize the
    value of the business. Our professionals bring together a wealth of knowledge and creativity to address the real estate assets of a company. We position
    and monetize them as efficiently as possible and determine the best course of action for a company’s portfolio.
THE REAL ESTATE MARKETS: A CHANGING TIDE
Over the last 20 years there has been a seminal change in how real estate is valued and financed. Real Estate is now considered a valuable long term asset
    that can be efficiently financed and capitalized. As a result of this change, many companies, whose real estate holdings up until recently simply sat
    on balance sheets, are able to rethink these assets and extract significant value from them.
The maturity and breadth of today’s landscape offers more capital sources than ever before, which translates to more options for companies. This enables
    PJSC to present multiple options for a real estate transaction, whether it be stand alone or as part of a corporate financing or M&A assignment.

RECENT ADVISORY WORK
Select recent transactions include advising a New York City family office on the valuation and partial sale of a $250mm portfolio of downtown New York City office
    buildings and producing a valuation study for a for-profit post-secondary institution vis-à-vis its $300mm New York City portfolio.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER re: 51 MOTION for Summary Judgment, filed by ADC Products (UK) Limited, 53 MOTION for Summary Judgment, filed by Peter J. Solomon Company, L.P., Peter J. Solomon Securities Company, L.L.C. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is granted as to the issue of liability only. Defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied. Because there are material disputed issues of fact regarding the total amount of consideration that was paid in connection with the AZ transaction, and thus regarding the fee owed to Plaintiffs under the Agreement, the Court denies the Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion to the extent it seeks an award of damages. The parties are directed to use their best efforts to resolve the damages issue. The trial of this action will be limited to the issue of damages. The final pre-trial conference is hereby adjourned to June 16, 2016, at 10:00 a.m., and the parties are directed to consult and make submissions in advance of the conference as provided in the Pre-trial Scheduling Order (docket entry no. 14.) This Memorandum Opinion and Order resolves docket entry numbers 51 and 53. (As further set forth in this Order.) (Signed by Judge Laura Taylor Swain on 3/30/2016) (spo) (Entered: 03/30/2016)
