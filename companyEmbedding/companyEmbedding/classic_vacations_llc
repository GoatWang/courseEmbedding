Terms of Use




 

WEBSITE TERMS OF USE 
Last Revised:  September 21, 2016


Welcome to the ClassicVacations.com website (the "Website"). This Website is provided solely to assist customers in gathering travel information, determining the availability of travel-related goods and services, making legitimate reservations or otherwise transacting business with travel suppliers, and for no other purposes. The terms "we", "us", "our", “Classic”, and "Classic Vacations" refer to Classic Vacations, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company. The term "you" refers to the customer visiting the Website and/or booking a reservation through us on this Website or through our customer service agents. The term "Classic Vacations Companies” means, collectively, Classic Vacations, its subsidiaries and corporate affiliates, and the term “Classic Vacations Affiliates” refers to the affiliated, co-branded and/or linked Website partners through whom we provide service.
This Website is offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance without modification of all the terms, conditions, and notices set forth below (collectively, the "Terms of Use” or “Agreement"). Please read the Terms of Use carefully, as they contain important information about limitations of liability and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than in court. You should also read our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Website, and is incorporated by reference in this Agreement. By accessing or using this Website, booking any reservation for travel products or services on this Website, or contacting our call center agents, you agree that the Terms of Use then in force shall apply. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, please do not use or book any reservations through this Website or our call center agents.
USE OF THE WEB SITE
As a condition of your use of this Website, you warrant that
 you are at least 18 years of age;
 you possess the legal authority to create a binding legal obligation;
 you will use this Website in accordance with these Terms of Use;
 you will only use this Website to make legitimate reservations for you or for another person for whom you are legally authorized to act;
 you will inform such other persons about the Terms of Use that apply to the reservations you have made on their behalf, including all rules and restrictions applicable thereto;
 all information supplied by you on this Website is true, accurate, current and complete; and 
if you have a Classic Vacations account, you will safeguard your account information and will supervise and be completely responsible for any use of your account by you and anyone other than you.
We retain the right at our sole discretion to deny access to anyone to this Website and the services we offer, at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, for violation of these Terms of Use. 
DISPUTES
Classic Vacations is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve your concerns. But if we are unsuccessful, you may pursue claims as explained in this section.
You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims relating in any way to the Website, any dealings with our customer service agents, any services or products provided, any representations made by us, or our Privacy Policy (“Claims”) by contacting Customer Support at http://www.classicvacations.com/about-us/customer-support or 800-221-3949. If we are not able to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.
Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except you may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. This includes any Claims you assert against us, our subsidiaries, travel suppliers or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement). This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms of Use, regardless of whether prior versions of the Terms of Use required arbitration.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs), and must follow and enforce these Terms of Use as a court would.
Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA Consumer Rules.   Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, except as provided in this section.  . If your total Claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator’s fees.  You may choose to have an arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the state where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims to “Classic Vacations Legal: Arbitration Claim Manager,” at 333 108th Ave N.E. Bellevue, WA 98004. If we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided. The AAA’s rules and filing instructions are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. 
Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.   The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.  An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction.

SUPPLIER RULES AND RESTRICTIONSAdditional terms and conditions will apply to your reservation and purchase of travel-related goods and services that you select.  Please read these additional terms and conditions carefully. In particular, if you have purchased an airfare, please ensure you read the full terms and conditions of carriage issued by the Supplier, which can be found on the Suppliers’ website. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions of purchase imposed by any supplier with whom you elect to deal, including, but not limited to, payment of all amounts when due and compliance with the supplier's rules and restrictions regarding availability and use of fares, products, or services. We reserve the right to cancel your booking if full payment is not received in a timely fashion. You acknowledge that some third-party providers offering certain services and/or activities may require you to sign their liability waiver prior to participating in the service and/or activity they offer. You understand that any violation of any such supplier's rules and restrictions may result in cancellation of your reservation(s), in your being denied access to the applicable travel product or services, in your forfeiting any monies paid for such reservation(s), and/or in our charging back your account for any costs we incur as a result of such violation.

return to topPREPAID HOTEL RESERVATIONS
You acknowledge that the Classic Vacations Companies pre-negotiate certain room rates with hotel suppliers to facilitate the booking of reservations. You also acknowledge that the Classic Vacations Companies provide you services to facilitate such booking of reservations for a consideration (the “facilitation fee”). The room rate displayed on the Website is a combination of the pre-negotiated room rate for rooms reserved on your behalf by the Classic Vacations Companies and the facilitation fee retained by Classic Vacations to compensate us for our services. You authorize the Classic Vacations Companies to book reservations for the total reservation price, which includes the room rate displayed on the Website, plus tax recovery charges, and service fees. You agree that your credit card will be charged by the Classic Vacations Companies for the total reservation price. Upon submitting your reservation request you authorize the Classic Vacations Companies, including Travelscape, LLC, to facilitate hotel reservations on your behalf, including making payment arrangements with hotel suppliers. 
You acknowledge that Classic Vacations does not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax recovery charges on prepaid hotel transactions are a recovery of the estimated transaction taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc.) that the Classic Vacations Companies pays to the hotel supplier in connection with your hotel reservations. The hotel suppliers invoice the Classic Vacations Companies for certain charges, including tax amounts. The Hotel suppliers remit applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. Classic Vacations does not act as co-vendors with the supplier with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. The actual tax amounts paid by the Classic Vacations Companies to the hotel suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the hotel by our customers. We retain our service fees as compensation in servicing your travel reservation. Our service fees vary based on the amount and type of hotel reservation. 
You may cancel or change your prepaid hotel reservation, but you will be charged the cancellation or change fee indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. If you do not cancel or change your reservation before the cancellation policy period applicable to the hotel you reserved, which varies by hotel (usually 24 to 72 hours) prior to your date of arrival), you will be subject to a charge equal to nightly rates, tax recovery charges and service fees. In the event you do not show for the first night of the reservation and plan to check-in for subsequent nights in your reservation, you must confirm the reservation changes with Classic Vacations no later than the date of the first night of the reservation to prevent cancellation of your reservation.
You agree to pay any cancellation or change fees that you incur. In limited cases, some hotels do not permit changes to or cancellations of reservations after they are made, as indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions imposed with respect to your prepaid hotel reservations. 
USTOA $1 Million Consumer Protection Plan: Classic Vacations, as an Active Member of the United States Tour Operators Association (“USTOA”), is required to post $1 million with USTOA to be used to reimburse, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the USTOA Consumer Protection Plan, the advance payments of Classic Vacations customers in the unlikely event of Classic Vacations bankruptcy or insolvency. Complete details of the USTOA Consumer Protection Plan may be obtained by writing to 275 Madison Avenue, Suite 2014, NY, NY 10016 or by visiting the website atwww.USTOA.comhref>.

If we determine that you have booked more than one (1) room in separate reservations, we may cancel your reservations, and charge you a cancellation fee, if applicable. If you paid a non-refundable deposit, your deposit will be forfeited. If you wish to book more than one room, you must contact our group travel specialists by email at groups@classicvacations.com.   One of our group travel specialists will research your request and contact you to complete your reservation. You may be asked to sign a written contract and/or pay a nonrefundable deposit.

You are responsible for ensuring that you meet foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, such as passports and visas (transit, business, tourist, and otherwise), are in order and any other foreign entry requirements are met. Classic Vacations has no special knowledge regarding foreign entry requirements or travel documents. We urge customers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements, and advisories issued by the relevant governments prior to booking travel to international destinations.
Passport and Visa: You must consult the relevant Embassy or Consulate for this information. Requirements may change and you should check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. We accept no liability if you are refused entry onto a flight or into any country due to your failure to carry the correct and adequate passport, visa, or other travel documents required by any airline, authority, or country, including countries you may just be transiting through. This includes all stops made by the aircraft, even if you do not leave the aircraft or airport.
Health: Recommended inoculations for travel may change and you should consult your doctor for current recommendations before you depart. It is your responsibility to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements, obtain the recommended inoculations, take all recommended medication, and follow all medical advice in relation to your trip.
Disinsection: Although not common, most countries reserve the right to disinsect aircraft if there is a perceived threat to public health, agriculture or environment. The World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization have approved the following disinsection procedures: (1) spray the aircraft cabin with an aerosolized insecticide while passengers are on board or (2) treat the aircraft's interior surfaces with a residual insecticide while passengers are not on board.

SECTION B - RULES AND RESTRICTION FOR TRAVEL PRODUCTS AND SERVICE
By making a payment for your Classic Vacation reservation, you acknowledge and agree to the terms and conditions set forth below: 	
PRICING AND PAYMENT
Forms of Payment.  Payment may be made by travel agency check, American Express, Diners Club, Discover Card, MasterCard, Optima, or Visa credit card.
Prices.  Airfare is only guaranteed once the purchase has been completed and the tickets have been issued. Airlines and other travel suppliers may change their prices without notice. All applicable taxes at the time of booking are included in the price of the vacation. Fees or other charges such as resort fees, surcharges, or taxes imposed by the airline after your vacation purchase (if any), are solely your responsibility. Some airport departure fees may not be included and must be paid directly to the airline. 	
Price Protection.  All bookings are price-protected upon receipt of deposit by Classic Vacations and purchase of the Travel Smart Plan, or when full payment is received for the entire booking. Published airfares require full payment at time of booking to qualify for price protection. Tax increases, fuel, airport and other surcharges, and consumer-initiated changes are not price-protected.
Bank and Credit Card Fees. Some banks and credit card companies impose fees for international transactions. If you are making a booking from outside of the United States on a US credit card, your bank may convert the payment amount to your local currency and charge you a conversion fee. This means the amount listed on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency and therefore a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on the Website. In addition, a foreign transaction fee may be assessed if the bank that issued your credit card is located outside of the United States. Booking international travel may be considered to be an international transaction by the bank or card company, since the Classic Vacations Companies may pass on your payment to an international travel supplier. The currency exchange rate and foreign transaction fee is determined solely by your bank on the day that they process the transaction. If you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.
Not Included in Price. Gratuities, meals (except where otherwise noted), telephone calls, airport departure fees, resort fees, local driver’s license, car seats, rental insurance, gas, parking, rental-car overtime fees, some airport departure taxes, and any other items of a personal nature.CHANGE AND CANCELLATION, REFUNDS
Change and Cancellation Fees.  Carrier, property, and provider change and cancellation policies vary. Hotels and condominiums may charge an additional fee. Villas may charge the full amount, regardless of cancellation date. Some hotel suppliers may require you to present a credit card upon check-in to cover additional expenses incurred during your stay. Such deposit is unrelated to any payment received by Classic Vacations for your hotel booking. Classic Vacations is not liable for any costs incurred due to relocation. Some airline tickets may be nonrefundable. Airlines may charge significant change and cancellation fees, which may vary by carrier. Name changes are treated as a cancellation, and all cancellation fees apply. Once travel has commenced, any changes or cancellations will be at the traveler’s expense. To avoid many of these fees, ask for the Travel Smart Plan program or the Change & Cancellation Waiver at the time of booking. 
Restrictions.  Once travel has commenced, routing and/or class-of-service changes are not permitted on purchase airline tickets. A maximum of two changes are allowed on published air and other restricted airfares per person per booking. Tax changes, surcharges, and consumer-initiated changes that result in a higher cost are not price-protected. For refunds on special or weekly rates for accommodations and/or car rentals, the used portion will be charged at regular published daily rates. Name changes will be treated as a cancellation, and all cancellation fees will apply.
Refunds.  Unused portions of airfare are nonrefundable. Unused portions of your land package (e.g., hotel accommodations, car rentals, tours, and activities) will not be refunded for any reason unless the Travel Smart Plan program has been purchased. For changes or cancellations prior to departure, Classic Vacations will remit a refund to you or your travel specialist within 30 days, less the following: (i) supplier charges for change or cancellation (which vary and may be significant); (ii) administrative charge by Classic Vacations for processing the change or cancellation (unless the Travel Smart Plan program has been purchased); (iii) nonrefundable airline tickets will not be refunded once ticketed; (iv) refundable airline tickets must be canceled before ticketed departure date; (v) all ticketing-service fees; (vi) all express-mail fees; and (vii) purchase price of each Travel Smart Plan program.AIR TRANSPORTATION
All airline tickets are purchased and issued on a round-trip basis. Most departure fees are not included. No refunds are allowed on unused portions. Changes to flight itineraries may result in an increased airfare, a carrier-imposed charge or, in some instances, may not be permitted. Once travel has commenced, routing and/or class-of-service changes are not permitted. Additional cancellation fees are assessed by the airline on special fares. Classic Vacations passengers are subject to all airline limitations, liabilities, and tariffs. All air carriers booked by Classic Vacations shall be liable only as common carriers to Classic Vacations passengers. Classic Vacations is not responsible for schedule changes or airline strikes. Some countries charge a separate departure tax that is collected at the airport and typically must be paid for in the local currency. In most cases, this tax is not included in your fare. Name changes are not allowed. Classic Vacations is not responsible for multiple connections due to schedule changes.RENTAL CARS
Car-rental rates reflect unlimited mileage for a 24-hour rental period. Overtime fees are paid directly to the car company by client. Some locations may require a voucher. International driver’s license fees are to be paid directly to the car company by client. No refunds will be made on car rentals of less than 24 hours. There will be drop charges assessed for car rentals returned to alternate car-rental stations, to be paid directly to the car company. The renter is responsible for paying directly to the car- rental company all charges not covered by Classic Vacations’ booking. Car-rental companies require that drivers possess a valid driver’s license and major credit card or leave a cash deposit upon pick-up. Drivers must be at least 25 years of age. Additional drivers must be at least 25 years old. An additional-driver fee may apply and must be paid directly to the car company.BEDDING & MAXIMUM OCCUPANCY
Classic Vacations will request the bedding desired, although the requested bedding cannot be guaranteed. At some hotels, villas and condominiums there may be an additional charge if a crib or rollaway is required. These charges are payable to the property upon check-out.PHYSICAL DISABILITIES
Any physical disability requiring special attention, treatment, or facilities must be communicated to Classic Vacations when the booking is made. Please call Reservations at 1-800-221-3949 for assistance.MINIMUM STAYS
The length of stay required varies by property, season and airline tariff.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
