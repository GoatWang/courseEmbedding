Private Market Approach to Public Market Investing





















































Investor Login




















Private Market Approach to Public Market Investing


Ivory approaches public market investing by assessing companies on a private market, or fundamental value, basis through a research-intensive, bottom-up approach. Ivory leverages its investment team’s experience in the investment banking and private equity industries to identify and assess the fundamental aspects that underlie prospective investment opportunities. With a solid understanding of these fundamentals, the team seeks to invest in those opportunities where a divergence exists between market values and underlying fundamental values.
Ivory’s investment team develops its own set of expectations based on proprietary research and analysis and contrasts these with consensus expectations to identify investment opportunities created by material misperceptions in the markets. For Ivory, an investment thesis must be quantifiable and data driven, while the pricing dislocation must be expected to correct (or converge to its fundamental value) within a reasonable time frame. Ivory believes this security selection process must be augmented and balanced at the portfolio level by managing exposure to macro and systematic risks. In doing so, Ivory applies its unique, systematic risk management approach to measure, monitor and limit unintended or unexpected correlations in the portfolio.
Ivory takes a fundamental value approach to security selection. Ivory defines fundamental value as the “price at which a company’s cash flows or asset values provide an adequate, risk-adjusted cash-on-cash return.” This approach is based on the belief that:

Over time, securities trade at their fundamental value
Short-term dislocations can cause market values to vary from fundamental values
Investment opportunities are created by these misperceptions
Intense focus and analysis of individual securities can uncover these opportunities

                  Montgomery Securities was a west-coast investment bank based in San Francisco, California, that specialized in high technology and health care sectors. The firm was founded in 1978 by Thom Weisel.

The bank was acquired by NationsBank Corporation on June 30, 1997. It competed in the same geographic region and market sectors as Robertson Stephens (acquired by BankAmerica Corporation) and Hambrecht & Quist (now part of JPMorganChase).

The merger of BankAmerica Corporation and NationsBank Corporation, prompted NationsBank CEO Hugh McColl to propose to put the together the two investment banks, BancAmerica Robertson Stephens and NationsBanc Montgomery Securities.Ultimately the combination did not happen as Robertson Stephens was sold off in 1998 to FleetBoston. Though, FleetBoston was later acquired by Bank of America in 2004, Robertson Stephens was closed in 2002.

Montgomery Securities is the predecessor of Banc of America Securities.
