Martha Kelly isn’t sure why Zach Galifianakis called her “out of the blue” a couple of years ago and asked her to star in his new FX comedy, “Baskets,” which debuts Thursday, Jan. 21. But she’s pretty sure it wasn’t for her dramatic gifts.A longtime comic who has known Mr. Galifianakis through comedy circles since the late 1990s, Ms. Kelly has performed stand-up on Comedy Central and late-night shows but had never acted in so much as a commercial before shooting the “Baskets” pilot. Created by Mr. Galifianakis, Louis C.K. and Jonathan Krisel, the series stars Mr. Galifianakis as Chip Baskets, a sad rodeo clown with more ambitious aspirations, both personal and artistic. Ms. Kelly is Martha, the demure insurance claims adjuster who tries to befriend him. She is gentle but persistent, with an unexplained cast on her forearm, and shares a muted but agreeably guileless manner with the woman who plays her.“Zach said not to worry about the acting stuff,” Ms. Kelly said. “He wanted me to act like I would in real life.”Onstage, Ms. Kelly, 47, specializes in caustic, self-deprecating jokes that often play off her bookish looks and deadpan delivery. (Her signature move in the bedroom, according to one punch line, was “what I like to refer to as the Mannequin.”) Early success on talk shows and in comedy competitions was derailed somewhat by a drinking problem, something she now refers to in her act.

“Now that I’m sober, I find I have a lot of energy to do stuff I never did before,” goes one joke, “like crying and cussing at strangers.”

Ms. Kelly (pictured with her dog, Rosie) spoke by phone from Austin, Tex., where she’s based, to discuss “Baskets,” Jar Jar Binks and that mysterious cast. These are excerpts from the conversation.Q. Chip is pretty prickly. What do you think Martha sees in him?A. To be honest, I’m still a little bit in the dark about that stuff. I think it’s supposed to be that he’s a really lonely person, and she’s maybe a few notches lonelier.

Why does she wear a cast?I don’t think we find out.You don’t have any theories?I thought it would be funny if the character had just accidentally sat on her own hand and broke it. A lot of Zach’s humor is instinctive — knowing something’s going to be funny without overthinking it. The cast makes my character seem more vulnerable, which maybe makes it funnier that his character is not very gentle toward her. I don’t know if he thinks that way or if he just thinks, Oh my God it would be so funny if she just has a cast for no reason.

What did you think when Zach asked you to be on the show?At first I didn’t want to do it, because I’m not an actor. I was really scared that I would ruin it. I don’t know yet whether I did ruin it. I hope not. I don’t know why they didn’t fire me, to be honest. But I’m glad they didn’t.The tone and energy of the performance seemed consistent with your stand-up.That’s kind of what Zach said before we did it. However, I feel in retrospect maybe I should have taken some acting lessons. It’s like if your friend invites you to an awesome party, and they’re like, “You don’t have to bring anything,” you should bring something anyway.Have your feelings about acting changed after doing the show?If there is a Season 2, I will definitely put a lot more effort into acting. Can I ask you something? I haven’t done interviews and stuff — have I done anything that made anybody or the show in any way sound negative?No.O.K. Hopefully I don’t become the Jar Jar Binks of the show, and hopefully we do another season because I really would love to see everyone again. Also, I love money, and I’d love to get some more money.

The rooms are dated but more importantly the necessaty to maintain their hot water & HVAC systems is basic human need. The location of this hotel is wonderful as you know but I would question the updating of the very system that provide basic need.Are you sure you want to delete this answer?Delete Confirm CancelHelpful answer0VotesNot as helpfulbrojohnvB&B, Breakfast included?December 31, 2016|Answer Show all 5 answers Hide all answersAre you sure you want to delete this question?Delete Confirm CancelWhat is your answer?Posting guidelinesSubmitCancelResponse from Ruth H | Reviewed this property |No, but there's a great little breakfast spot in walking distance.

The four-day Diamond Jubilee Pageant, held on the private grounds of Windsor Castle, featured over 550 horses and more than 1,000 dancers, musicians, and performers from around the world.Ms. Kelly, along with Raghuvendra Singh Dunlod, are co-founders of the Indigenous Horse Society of India. The pair brought eight Marwaris, members of a rare Indian breed, that was once close to extinction to the celebration. Marwaris are characterized by their inward turning ear tips and intelligence.Ms. Kelly produced the Asian portion of the program, which consisted of seven acts from different parts of the globe.  The Indian spectacle included 12 traditional dancers, a large group of musicians, five riders, and two trainers. Performing concurrently was a group of riders from India and Pakistan who demonstrated tent pegging, a cavalry sport of skill.“The horses were racing at full gallop diagonally intersecting the arena with the riders picking out pegs attached to the ground,” Ms. Kelly said. The costumed dancers — both equine and human, performing on adjacent stages — made for a fast-paced, colorful spectacle.“It was such an honor to be invited to participate,” Ms. Kelly said. “As a Brit, to do that in my own country was very emotional for me.”  After the show, Ms. Kelly, Mr. Dunlod, and three of the dancers were among the guests invited for tea with the queen at Windsor Castle. Ms. Kelly just received a letter of thanks from Buckingham Palace recognizing her for her participation in the event and thanking her for a set of scarves featuring the Marwaris which Ms. Kelly designed and presented to the Queen.Ms. Kelly spends about four months every winter in India where she produces a series of performances tribal dancers and 23 local Marwaris that she maintains. As well as choreographing the shows, she also performs, although she did not perform for the jubilee. She also stables horses on Chappaquiddick.Ms. Kelly, who comes from a family of British diplomats, has been riding since she was three years old and living in Egypt. In 1994, she and her husband at the time took part in a riding safari in India. She fell in love with the indigenous horses (the Marwari is the most popular of the five breeds that are represented by the Indigenous Horse Society) and set up the first major Marwari stud farm in India in 1995.In 2000, Ms. Kelly and her then husband settled full time at their summer home on Chappaquiddick. That year she was able to fulfill a longtime dream when she became the first person to export Indian horses to the U.S. She brought six horses over to Chappy and has been breeding and training them here ever since.Despite increased restrictions on Indian horse exports, Ms. Kelly is able to arrange for artificial insemination with horses in India. “Because of my two decades of philanthropic work with the breed, I have a certain leeway that is not available to other people,” she says.Ms. Kelly does not raise the horses for profit, but rather to maintain the breed. However, she has sold a few of her horses, including a seed herd of three that went to Spain, and she has donated three to the non-profit Kentucky Horse Park.Today she has eight horses in the U.S. and one in England. She winters the horses at a farm in New Jersey and keeps them here in the summer on land on Chappaquiddick that she leases from the Sheriff’s Meadow Foundation. The Marwaris on Chappy attract a lot of attention. A photographer included pictures of them in a prestigious salon show in France, they will be the subject of an Australian documentary next year, and Ms. Kelly has published a coffee table book documenting her experience exporting the horses — and is working on a follow-up. Both are illustrated with photos by accomplished horse photographer Dale Durphee of England.Ms. Kelly has been able to combine a number of her passions to produce the Dancing with Horses shows. “I love dance, I love music, and I love the performing horses,” she said. “It comes quite easily to me to put together a creative performance native to India.”Ms. Kelly is devoted to raising awareness of the Marwaris, working on decreased export restrictions, and establishing the breed in the U.S. and elsewhere. “The Indian horse is, without a doubt, the oldest horse in the world,” she said. “They have extraordinarily soulful personalities. They’re not what I call horizontal horses — not overly domesticated. They’re sensitive. They have very special temperaments.”The horse that starred in the jubilee pageant was a former Chappaquiddick horse named Dilraj (King of Hearts in Hindi) who Ms. Kelly sent to England in 2006 because he was prone to escaping. “He was high-spirited. He needed to work,” she said.Next week, the other horses will be returning to the Vineyard for the summer. “They love the Island,” Ms. Kelly said. “They know the trails. This is their home.”A documentary on the Diamond Jubilee Pageant will air on British TV on June 3. It will eventually be seen on American television. Ms. Kelly said she also plans to screen it on Island somewhere this summer.

The Martha's Vineyard Times         HomeNews/SportsCommunityArts & EntertainmentThings to DoReal EstateClassifiedsDirectories   Home  Obituaries  Francine Esther Kelly  Francine Esther Kelly January 17, 20170 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter   Francine Esther Kelly died on Sunday, Jan. 8, 2017, at her daughter’s home in Culver City, Calif. Francine was born on Sept. 30, 1939, and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. She graduated from Walnut Hills High School in 1957. She spent time as a youth in the Young Churchmen at St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church, where her grandfather, Edmund Oxley, was the rector. She matriculated to Oberlin College and graduated with a degree in history and international government in 1961. Francine married, began teaching history, social studies, and economics to middle and high schoolers, and became the mother of four daughters.Francine lived in Cincinnati, Ohio; Iowa City, Iowa; Ankara, Turkey; Basel, Switzerland; and Lynbrook, Long Island, before settling in Indianapolis, Ind., in 1972. She became a member of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority in the Cincinnati Chapter in 1973.Francine credited the strong influence of her mother (a physician, artist, and pianist/organist), her exposure to the arts at Oberlin, and her extensive worldwide travel in making her a champion of and for the arts. Francine always encouraged artists and promoted the arts. She was an art collector and art dealer, but most important an arts supporter. Francine was a major civic volunteer in Indianapolis — she served as a docent at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, served on the boards of the Indianapolis Art Center, Young Audiences, and Very Special Arts. She was a member of the Indianapolis Chapter of Links, the Coalition of 100 Black Women, and Jack & Jill.Francine served as the director of programs at the Indianapolis Children’s Museum (the world’s largest children’s museum) from 1986 to 2000. She created thousands of innovative programs for children of all ages, and managed a staff of more than 20 programmers. She became the director of community initiatives in 2000, with a groundbreaking role of using the Children’s Museum’s influence to revitalize the surrounding neighborhood, creating partnerships with Lilly Endowment, the Community Development Council, Neighborhood Resource Centers, and Habitat for Humanity. She retired from the museum in February of 2003.Francine first came to Martha’s Vineyard in 1951. She summered on the Island ever after. Francine loved the Island, and knew that this was where she would retire. Francine fulfilled her dream, “retiring” to the Island in March 2003. On April 1, 2003, she was named the executive director of Featherstone Center for the Arts (the first paid executive director). Francine increased the number of gallery shows as well the class offerings, and initiated collaborations with numerous organizations including Polly Hill, the Martha’s Vineyard Museum, and the Yard. She was particularly proud of Featherstone’s five-year partnership with the Martha’s Vineyard Regional High School, where each March, Featherstone showcased high school art for the entire month, providing these students the opportunity of presenting their artwork in a professional setting, preparing their portfolios for college, and readying them for future art experiences. Mentoring the next generation of artists was one of Francine’s strongest passions. Francine truly fulfilled Featherstone’s mission of a year-round community center for the arts, creating a welcoming and inspiring environment for all and nurturing personal relationships with Island artists. Known for never saying “no” and dubbed the “Queen of Collaboration,” Francine retired as Featherstone’s executive director on Labor Day 2010. As director emerita, she consulted for Featherstone’s 15th anniversary celebration in 2011, and the 20th anniversary in 2016. She continued to be present at all Featherstone special events and opening receptions, and was a catalyst for fundraising for Featherstone’s current capital campaign. The Martha’s Vineyard Museum honored Francine with the Martha’s Vineyard Medal in 2011. Francine and her daughter, Ann Smith, were the recipients of the Permanent Endowment for Martha’s Vineyard’s Creative Living Award in 2015. And just this past summer at Featherstone’s Annual Gala, Featherstone celebrated Francine’s many accomplishments in conjunction with Featherstone’s 20th anniversary.Francine served as the Oak Bluffs appointee to the MVTV Board and the Martha’s Vineyard Cultural Council. She was a past board member of the Oak Bluffs Association, and a proud participant of the Savor the Moment Della Hardman Day Committee. She often served as a judge at the All-Island Art Show. Francine was instrumental in drafting the Arts Section of the Martha’s Vineyard Commission’s Island Plan. Francine enjoyed being in the pool at the YMCA for water aerobics and catching up with her cronies. She loved a good meal, and was often seen frequenting her favorite dining establishments on the Vineyard. Most of all, Francine was extremely proud of her family, and loved to celebrate their achievements and successes.Francine was preceded in death by her parents, Frances Jack Kelly and Dr. Lucy O. Oxley. She is survived by her four daughters: Ann Smith (William Green), Janis Smith- Gomez (Todd Gomez), Gwen Smith (Haim Steinbach), and Jill Moniz; five grandchildren: Anna Gomez, River Smith Steinbach, Jonathan Moniz, Jackson Moniz, and Julian Moniz; her only niece: Kimberly Christmas Goins (Rick Goins); her great-nieces: Kristin Goins and Kelsi Goins; her aunt Elizabeth Oxley Hatcher; and a host of cousins. Her presence will be missed by so many — extended family, friends, and colleagues. Donations in her memory may be made to Featherstone Center for the Arts at featherstoneart.org or by mail: P.O. Box 1145, Oak Bluffs, MA 02557.A celebration of Francine’s life will take place at Featherstone this summer.RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR ObituariesTerry Hass ObituariesServices for June A.

Martha Stewart's Best Lemon Curd



Kelly S.




                When Martha Stewart first published this recipe in her Martha Stewart Living Magazine in 1995, she had an entire article explaining the "where's/how's/and what not to do's" with regards to lemon curd. I had only ever purchased lemon curd prior to this recipe, and wasn't impressed with it. Too thick, too tart and short shelf life for the very high price. THIS recipe changed my mind: soft, teasingly tart, the ability to make it tarter or softer in flavour all had me saying "THIS IS THE WORLD'S BEST LEMON CURD!!!" I've never tried another recipe since, even Martha's "New & Improved" curd recipes, where she seems to have forgotten what she taught us fans of hers, so many years ago.

According to the article, the reasons why THIS curd recipe is so superior is the following:1) Beating the egg yolks until rich yellow and then straining the first time creates a smooth, albumen-free base. 2) Cooking the mixture WITHOUT the zest creates a "softer", less bitter curd. Cooked zest just becomes more bitter, even without the white pith. 3) A second straining removes any possibility of "scrambled eggs" from your curd! 4) Adding the chilled butter, cut into pieces,  to the eggs does two things: it rapidly cools down the curd so it doesn't continue to cook and also the buttery flavour is not changed by cooking with the yolks! 5) Adding the zest after the curd is cooled creates a smooth, flavourful but not bitter curd!

Are these steps too many for some people? Oh, I'm sure of it, especially the straining steps. And some curd recipes have you dump everything together in the pan so that sure makes it simple. However, after 15 years of making this one curd recipe, I've found the little bit of extra time involved in creating it makes for a superiour end product. 

NOTE: If you do not want a dense, eggy Lemon Curd, use WHOLE EGGS for the recipe, rather than egg yolks. That would be four whole eggs to the six egg yolks.

Ingredients


6
egg yolks, beaten (adding whites makes it lighter and less rich)


1
cup sugar


½
cup fresh lemon juice, strained


½
cup unsalted butter (COLD and cut into small pieces to melt faster )


1
tablespoon lemon rind, grated




Directions

1. Beat the egg yolks until well blended and lemon yellow in colour. Strain the egg yolks through a sieve into a medium-size heavy saucepan. (Sieving removes any shells or albumen; heavy saucpan prevents curdling.).

2. Add the sugar and lemon juice, stir to combine, and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, for about 10-15 minutes. DO NOT HURRY THE PROCESS OR THE EGGS WILL CURDLE!

3. Cook until the mixture coats the back of a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and immediately pour through another sieve to catch any "scrambled egg bits". Pour into a heat proof 4 cup measuring cup and stir in the cold butter pieces, which cools down the mixture quickly.

4. Add the rind, continue stirring until well-blended.

5. Transfer to whatever storage container you want: either a large one or several samll ones. 

6. Shelf Life: MUST BE REFRIGERATED! Keeps 2 weeks.

Variations:

Lime Curd: substitute lime juice and increase grated lime peel to 2 tablespoons.
Orange Curd: Use orange juice, decrease sugar to 2/3 cup. 1 tablespoon orange peel.
Grapefruit Curd: Use grapefruit juice, same sugar and zest as lemon curd.

eTextbook Studying Features
Learn about eTextbook features that help you study smarter, not harder.












We know there are things you would rather be doing than studying, so we built X-Ray for Textbooks to help you save time. With X-Ray for Textbooks, get everything you need with a single tap, including definitions, related pages in your eTextbook, and even relevant content from other sources like Wikipedia and YouTube. X-Ray for Textbooks is available on Fire tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac on select eTextbooks. To access X-Ray for Textbooks, bring up the control bar within an eTextbook by tapping at the top or bottom of your screen.  You can find the X-Ray for Textbooks button at the top of the control screen.

Just carrying around a yellow highlighter? How about pink, blue, orange, and yellow? Multi-color highlights are available on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. Tap a word and hold–the digital highlighting tool will pop up and you can adjust the highlighted text and highlight color. You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. Notebook is available on Fire HD tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook. On PC/Mac, the Notebook icon is on the left side of the Kindle Reading app.














Just finished a chapter and need to review key terms and definitions? Flashcards allow you to quickly brush up on all the terms, concepts, and definitions in each chapter with a simple, easy to use interface. Flashcards are available on iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac from within the eTextbook. Click on the flashcards icon to make your own flashcards. Or, you can auto-generate Flashcards from your notes and highlights and X-Ray terms if your eTextbook includes X-Ray for eTextbooks.














Have a tablet and a laptop? With eTextbooks, you can read your content on all your devices with the free Kindle Reading App. eTextbooks are currently supported on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. eTextbooks give you access to your content however you want, whenever you need it. Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks. Quickly create and manage your notes and highlights and access them anytime in the Amazon cloud.














Carry less around campus this semester. Take your entire library with you wherever you go, without having to lug around all of your physical textbooks. You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Fire tablet, iPad, iPhone, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle Reading App.














With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets. Tap the top or bottom of your tablet screen from inside the eTextbook to access swift navigation. On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.
