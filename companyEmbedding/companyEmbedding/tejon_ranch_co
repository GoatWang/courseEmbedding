Tejon Ranch Co. And Majestic Realty Co. Finalize Development Agreement






Business Wire




Sep 20, 2016 2:00 PM EDT













 




























































  Tejon Ranch Co. (NYSE: TRC) announced today that it has signed a joint venture agreement with Majestic Realty Co., the nation's largest privately-held industrial developer, to build an approximate 480,000-square-foot speculative industrial building at the Tejon Ranch Commerce Center.  Majestic Realty Co. is headquartered in Los Angeles County and has a current portfolio of about 78 million square feet of industrial, office and retail space, as a well as sports, entertainment and hospitality projects.  "This is our second joint venture with Majestic Realty and we are excited about the synergies this partnership between our two companies will create at the Tejon Ranch Commerce Center," says Hugh F. McMahon, Tejon Ranch Co.'s Executive Vice President of Commercial and Industrial Real Estate. "We're very pleased to be joining forces on this next phase of our industrial development."  "In what continues to be a very tight market in terms of both available product and land available for the development of large scale distribution centers, the Tejon Ranch Commerce Center features turn-key sites for distribution, manufacturing and e-commerce operations that allow users to serve southern and northern California, as well as all 11 western states, from one location," said Majestic Realty Co. Senior Vice President, Brett Tremaine.  The building will be located just east of Interstate 5, giving it near immediate access to California's principal north/south highway, and the ability to serve nearly 90% of California consumers within a single day truck turn. Construction is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2016 with completion anticipated in the second quarter of 2017.  Tejon Ranch and Majestic recently partnered to purchase a fully-leased 651,909-square-foot industrial building, also located at the Tejon Ranch Commerce Center. That purchase closed on September 9, 2016.  John DeGrinis, SIOR, and Tom Taylor of Colliers International convened the relationship between the two parties and will serve as listing brokers for the new development.

Los Angeles—Majestic Realty Co. and Tejon Ranch Co. have entered a joint venture agreement to develop a new speculative industrial facility at the Tejon Ranch Commerce Center. The venture was facilitated by Colliers International representative Tom Taylor and John DeGrinis of SIOR.
Tejon Ranch Commerce Center
Set to become a part of the Tejon Ranch Commerce Center, the new facility will total 480,000 square feet of industrial space. Majestic, one of the largest privately-held industrial developers in the nation, had previously completed the acquisition of an existing Tejon Ranch industrial building totaling 651,909 square feet of space earlier this month.
Once completed, the facility will offer easy access to the I-5, providing accessibility to the state’s main highway. With construction starting during this year’s fourth quarter, the asset is set for completion in the second quarter of 2017. “In what appears to be a very tight market in terms of both available product and land available for the development of large scale distribution centers, the Tejon Ranch Commerce Center features turn-key sites for distribution, manufacturing and e-commerce operations that allow users to serve southern and northern California, as well as all 11 western states, from one location,” noted Majestic Realty Co. Senior Vice President Brett Tremaine.

A Land of Abundance

  
 
 





 
 
 


Agriculture



Farming on Tejon Ranch can be traced to the 1850s, when Native Americans cultivated an area on Rancho de Castac – one of the original Mexican land grants that eventually became part of what Tejon Ranch is today.
Although sheep and later cattle were the main focus of the ranch in the 1880s, records show that vineyards and orchards were planted by the 1890s, with 20 acres of oranges, 20 acres of figs and 15 acres of vineyards and mixed deciduous trees listed.
Today, that tradition continues with about 6,000 acres devoted to pistachios, almonds, alfalfa, and winegrapes.
 

State-of-the-Art Farming Methods
The Ranch uses the latest and best farm management practices to minimize the potential environmental effects of farm operations.



For example, Tejon Ranch works hard to preserve air quality by employing a variety of practices. The Ranch no longer burns prunings, historically a common practice in agriculture. Instead, it took the lead in instituting a no-burn policy. Now, when trees are trimmed, the trimmings are shredded to make chips, which can be reused in a controlled facility to generate electricity.


Several programs are in place to control dust. They include growing turf or other natural vegetation between the rows of trees in the orchards to prevent the dust being kicked up, particularly during harvest season. Other programs include good planning of daily trips each day on dirt roads and watering down roads in dust-prone areas.




 Other practices that help conserve water and energy, include capturing stream run-offs and installing state-of-the-art drip irrigation systems that rely on gravity whenever possible and require less water.


An integrated pest management program depends less on pesticides and more on the natural environment to control pests. For example, owl boxes are located throughout the ranch to attract these migratory birds for nesting and to feed upon pests. It’s considered an environmentally sensitive way to manage pest problems.





vineyardsVineyards and Orchards



Vineyards
More than 1,400 acres are devoted to vineyards in two locations – the mountain area, where warm days and cool nights are ideal conditions for growing premium wines, and the valley floor, where grapes are grown for generic wines.The Tejon vineyards are a prime example of how the Ranch takes its stewardship of the land very seriously. As a member of California Association of Winegrape Growers, the Ranch subscribes to “sustainable wine growing practices,” a program that illustrates how winegrowers can farm in harmony with the natural environment. The goal is to conserve as many natural resources as possible.State-of-the art practices include a pest management program, where only a few ounces or grams of treatment compounds are applied per acre, not pounds, and a very selective drip water system, where the water goes directly to the roots where it’s needed.Other practices ensure the vines are balanced with the right spacing, and the soil is managed so there’s no erosion into creeks, streams or lakes.

Countries



Orchards
Overall, the ranch devotes more than 3,000 acres to almonds and pistachios. Several varieties of almonds on about 1,700 acres yield the largest crop. The almonds typically are harvested in mid-August to October. You never know where you’ll find a Tejon Ranch almond. During a recent year, almonds from the Ranch were shipped to 22 different countries worldwide.
Approximately 1,000 acres are dedicated to pistachios, which are harvested in early September. Pistachios require careful handling as the nuts are already split when they are ready to harvest, so they are not allowed to hit the ground. They are then sent to a processing facility, where they end up either roasted or salted.

The Ranch



Tejon Ranch is a California landmark, a land of legacy – bigger than life, rich in history, blessed by nature.
Established in 1843 as a Mexican land grant, this grand sweep of territory was home to some of the Old West’s most illustrious exploits.  Trappers, hardy settlers and frontiersmen, outlaws, the Camel Corps, Butterfield stagecoach lines and Army dragoons all traversed its range.  Historic pioneers such as Jedediah Smith, Kit Carson and John C. Fremont explored Tejon’s frontier.  In the decades following its founding, the Ranch grew in size as additional land grants were purchased by Tejon’s founder, General Edward Fitzgerald Beale, an explorer of the west and a historic figure in early California.
Located just an hour north of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, a survey of Tejon’s remarkable landscape reveals a dramatic tapestry of rugged mountains, steep canyons, oak-covered rolling hills, and broad valleys.  Oaks of almost every kind can be found on the land, as can conifer forests, Joshua trees, and spectacular spring displays of wildflowers as far as the eye can see.
As in the days of the vaqueros, cowboys on horseback still herd cattle on open grazing land.  Orchards and vineyards yield their bounty on fertile acreage leading into California’s agriculturally-rich Central Valley.  Vast stretches of ranch land remain in their natural state, protected by California’s largest and most significant private conservation agreement.

Our Communities



Tejon Ranch Company is committed to responsibly using its land and resources to meet the housing, employment and lifestyle needs of current and future generations of Californians, while being guided by the Ranch’s historic core values of conservation and good stewardship.
That commitment includes the environmentally sensitive development of a small portion of the Ranch.
Tejon Ranch’s real estate development projects include:





Mountain Village at Tejon Ranch

It’s a hidden treasure. One of the largest stretches of private land in California, today, Tejon Ranch remains essentially unchanged since its formation under a Mexican Land Grant back in 1843. The vast majority of its terrain is protected ranch land and wildlife habitat with the surety of staying wild. When you are here, taking it all in…the hills and valley stretching to the horizon, the centuries–old oaks, the crisp mountain air, the silence…you may find it hard to believe that you’re just an hour from Los Angeles. It’s a rare haven from modern existence…an escape. And one you’ll soon be able to enjoy. We’re dedicating one of the most beautiful parts of the ranch to Mountain Village at Tejon Ranch, a new conservation-based retreat designed to live in harmony with nature, and continue the legacy of this storied place for future generations.
