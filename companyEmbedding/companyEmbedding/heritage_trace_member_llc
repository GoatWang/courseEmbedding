About



In April 2005, a partnership was formed between Trinity Title of Texas, LLC and ET Investments, Inc.  ET Investments owns and operates title agencies in Colorado, Nevada, Arizona and Texas.  This partnership was made possible because of the similar business cultures, ethical beliefs and moral values between the two companies. Initially, Trinity was licensed in Travis, Hays and Williamson Counties.  In 2009, Trinity expanded its operations into the greater San Antonio area and most recently to Dallas/Fort Worth. Trinity is now licensed in Harris, Travis, Williamson, Bastrop, Hays, Tarrant, Dallas, Kaufman, Rockwall, Wise, Denton, Collin, Bexar, Comal, Guadalupe, Kendall, Johnson, Medina, Atascosa, and Nueces counties. Trinity Title aligned itself with the nation’s premier title underwriters which include Old Republic National Title, First American Title Company, Westcor Land Title Insurance Company, Title Resource Guaranty Company, and Alliant National Title Insurance Company.  This relationship effectively gives Trinity Title the best of both worlds in having local management and national capital support.  It also allows flexibility in finding solutions to complex title and escrow issues.
