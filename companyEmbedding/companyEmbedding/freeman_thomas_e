Every car provides an opportunity to create an adventure.”
By Charles Fishmanlong ReadMore: Design – Charlie TrotterBack in 1986, before he was one of the hottest designers in the United States, Freeman Thomas gave a ride to a guy he barely knew. It was winter, and Thomas was living in Germany. “I remember thrashing through these narrow, twisted roads,” says Grant Larson, who is now a friend and colleague of Thomas. “He had a little Fiat Uno, and he was scaring the hell out of me. He was hammering around these curves, these narrow streets. I was fresh from America, where the streets are wider, of course, and the cars don’t handle as well as European cars.”advertisementThirteen years later, Freeman Thomas is doing the same thing, again with someone he hardly knows. This time, he’s doing it on a sunny, cool afternoon in the suburbs of Detroit. He’s slamming through turns, using all five gears, dodging slow movers — providing a breathtaking, and breathless, tour of the landscape. One landmark flashes into view, and before you can absorb it or appreciate it, Freeman Thomas is downshifting and roaring off to the next one.The Detroit performance is even more remarkable than the German one, however, because Freeman Thomas is taking this ride without the benefit of a car. He’s sitting at a weathered picnic table behind a small Catholic church. And his brain is moving so fast that his mouth can hardly keep up.In one hour, Thomas manages to connect the show “I Love Lucy”; the American Dream; Frank Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater house; Alfred Hitchcock; and the peasant cooking of the Italian countryside. He connects them not only to each other but also to the thing that is most important to Freeman Thomas: cars.Freeman Thomas has designed two of the most distinctive cars of the ’90s. He is codesigner of VW’s New Beetle. He also designed the Audi TT — a sports car of such purity that a New York Times critic called it “historically significant” and nominated it for “car of the century.”For ordinary people, the Beetle and the TT share a slightly different quality: It’s hard to look at either one without smiling — and without itching to slide behind the wheel. That’s no accident. For a guy as cheerfully obsessed with cars as Freeman Thomas, the journey really is just as important as the destination. And it is a great sin to create a dull ride.This summer, Thomas made a move that may result in the addition of some distinctive shapes to American roads: He jumped from VW/Audi to DaimlerChrysler. As head of advanced product design, Thomas is in charge of three U.S. design studios. His main job is to keep DaimlerChrysler’s American cars from being dull. This afternoon, Thomas has been out driving through the streets of Detroit in a Plymouth Prowler, a low-slung concept car that is little more than fenders, seats, growling motor, and attitude. The Prowler is every hot rod ever built, distilled into a single package.advertisement“So I’m driving over here today in the Prowler, and I pass a car. There’s a man driving, a kid in the front passenger seat, and two more kids in the back. They see the Prowler, and they grin and give me a thumbs-up,” says Thomas. “And I give them a thumbs-up back. You only get one life; this life is not a rehearsal. So chances are, you want to have fun. You still want to act like a child. That spirit is a frame of mind, not an age. And the automobile gives you a chance to have an adventure every day. Say you drive 20 minutes to work every day. Your commute could be totally pragmatic, but it doesn’t have to be. Having a really nice car is like wearing a really nice suit. It’s like a role you play — a role you get to play. Who doesn’t want a thumbs-up experience?”Freeman Thomas on Cars and AmericaWhat would the 1950s have been like in America without the automobile? The automobile created restaurants, fashions, television programs. It gave us style. It gave us attitude.Driving across America is an adventure — the old “Route 66” idea.If you stop, there’s a TV in the motel room where you stay. And on the TV, there’s a show about people and cars.The stories on TV are about American life. They are optimized reflections of American life.Look at a show like “I Love Lucy.” Remember the episodes about the big car trip to California from New York? The car is there.advertisementThe late 1990s have not been a fecund era of car design. If anything, there has been a numbing convergence across brands and price ranges into a handful of looks. At a glance, it is difficult to distinguish a Honda Civic from a BMW, an Acura from an Audi, a Volvo from a Saab, a Mercedes SUV from a Lexus SUV from a Kia SUV. Infiniti? Century? Catera? If you’ve spent $40,000 on your car, shouldn’t someone be able to tell?Talking about specific cars with Freeman Thomas gives you an appreciation for how impoverished design has become, as well as a sense of the values that an innovative designer brings to the table.Thomas is out in the Detroit suburbs on this particular afternoon to attend an annual car event: the Woodward Dream Cruise. The Cruise is a weekend event that draws roughly 2 million spectators. Thousands of vintage-car owners in Detroit get their cars out of their garages and cruise down Woodward Avenue — one of Detroit’s main boulevards — into the city, showing off their wheels and ogling everyone else’s. On this one strip, every era of America’s infatuation with automobiles is represented.Thomas has come to the Catholic church as a rendezvous and a place to park his borrowed Prowler. Before he heads over to Woodward Avenue, he gives a brief lesson in design while standing in the parking lot of the church.“The Prowler makes you smile,” he says. “Why? Because it’s focused. It has a plot, a reason for being, a passion. It evokes the hot rod. It evokes the American Dream. This car is the human psyche.”He turns to an older green Chevy pickup parked nearby. The truck is all straight lines and smooth sides. It’s uninflected, with the utilitarian style of a washing machine. “It’s a bland architecture,” says Thomas, referring to the Chevy. “It’s very practical. What is its story? It’s very left brain. You buy it because you need it.”advertisementNot four spaces away is a new Dodge Ram pickup. Its nose is high, its hood cocky, its fenders bulging over its rear wheel wells. And it’s red.“This car is more true to what a truck is,” says Thomas. “It has a fender and a hood like a big truck. That’s the passion. A truck. The fenders have shape, they invite you to touch the truck. The Dodge Ram is like Frank Lloyd Wright’s famous Fallingwater house: It expresses its environment. The beds of these two pickups are the same. They’re both designed to hold a 4×8 sheet of plywood. It costs exactly the same to give the metal sides on the outside of the truck some shape as it does to leave them flat. If you get up to wash your truck on Saturday morning, of these two trucks, washing the Chevy is going to be a chore, and washing the Ram is going to be a pleasure.”Thomas walks over to a Buick Century. “This isn’t that much different from the Taurus or the Camry,” he says. “This is what I call ‘committee design.’ These cars are reliable. But they are not a forum for honesty. They are really just different sizes of the same car — the same shape, the same architecture.”The silhouette of a car is what first captures Thomas’s eye — both when he’s looking and when he’s drawing. A car reveals its personality through its silhouette: the stance, the position of the wheels, where people sit, the curve of the roofline, the balance between the windows and the body. “You can instantly tell the era of a car by its silhouette,” says Thomas.The New Beetle, in profile, has three arches: the roof and the front and back fenders. Why does that particular combination of shapes evoke good humor, friendliness? Thomas takes a pen out of his pocket and points to a tiny logo on its clip: It’s the ears and head of Mickey Mouse. He hasn’t answered the “why” question — only pointed out that the arch shapes you see when you look at the Beetle have the same appeal in other contexts. The Audi TT silhouette has oversize wheels dramatically positioned at the far reaches of the body. It’s a car that will grab the road and not let go. The roofline — which evokes the distinctive swoop of the TT’s cousin, the VW Passat — almost seems to be ducking to get out of the way of the wind. Even in a simple sketch by Thomas on a piece of notebook paper, the TT radiates energy and speed — but also conveys a heft that is often absent in sports cars.Thomas turns back to the Prowler for a minute, with its hooded roofline and its squinting side windows. “They look aggressive because they’re so small,” he says. “It’s an illusion of stealthiness. It’s like Alfred Hitchcock in that classic pose of his — in profile, partially in shadow. He’s trying to convey stealthiness — he’s creating a sense of mystery.” It’s a different way of envisioning cars — as a series of silhouettes. On a nearby street, an ordinary minivan pulls away from a stop sign, catching Thomas’s eye. “The minivan was a new silhouette when Chrysler invented it,” he says. “It had never been done before. The Jeep Cherokee was a new silhouette, too.” And it is in silhouette that the Accord and the Camry, the Taurus and the Century, and all of the other “committee” cars look so unoriginal.advertisementOut at Woodward Avenue, Thomas grins as a girl in a 1950s Corvette convertible cruises by. She’s got a video camera aimed at the passing parade. “Look at that!” he enthuses. “The 1950s designers were full of optimism, euphoria, motion. It was the age of the jet. The cars expressed that culture, and influenced that culture.”A VW Microbus putters by. It’s pale green. “Color is so important,” says Thomas, his voice drifting off. He returns with an odd, TV connection. “The show Rowan and Martin’s “Laugh-In” was part of that culture, part of the hippie culture. And the Microbus was part of the hippie culture.” And if you let your mind drift for a minute, you can see the same Microbus-color green in the background of the “Laugh-In” set.There is a whole parking lot filled with various versions of the Corvette. Thomas admires old dashboards, old convertibles. He comes upon a red 1978 Corvette, dating from the era of the molded plastic body. “It has a kind of sleazy feeling to it, doesn’t it?” he asks. “You can see the person driving it without the person being there. He’s headed to a brothel.”Thomas approaches an orange 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona. With its streamlined front end, muscled body, and sleek tail, it has the purity of an American icon. This is a car that knows what it’s about — and expresses it. “That’s just incredible, isn’t it?” says Thomas. “It encompasses all of the great things about America.”Freeman Thomas on Cars and the EnvironmentIf you’re driving a Prowler down Woodward Avenue in Detroit, you’re a part of the environment, but you’re also influencing the environment.There are two identical Picasso sculptures of a head that I’ve seen. One is in a California museum, one is in a French museum. You can touch the one in France, but you can’t touch the one in California.advertisementSo the one in France has this tactile emotion about it. It has smooth places, because it’s been touched. The one in California is more sterile.The sculpture in France is like Frank Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater house: It expresses the environment.I could see a whole TV show being created about the Prowler. Just the Prowler and a couple of guys doing something every week.The world of people who design cars for a living in the United States and Europe is small. There aren’t that many companies, there aren’t that many jobs, and there aren’t that many stars. Many car designers — including Freeman Thomas — have graduated from Pasadena’s Art Center College of Design. Designers tend to know each other, or at least know of each other.In that world, Freeman Thomas is known for a couple of quirks. He loves Porsches. Porsche was his first employer out of school — in Germany — and Grant Larson remembers that for a while, working at Porsche was a kind of exquisite torture. Thomas was working for his dream company, Larson says. “The poor guy was a total Porsche fanatic — but he couldn’t afford one.” (Thomas now owns two Porsches.)Thomas can talk about cars literally all the time. In 1989, he teamed up with Tom Kellogg and David Weston to form a three-man design firm. Says Kellogg of the experience: “We talked mostly about cars. I brought up a lot of other subjects, but he wasn’t really interested in anything else.”advertisementJesse Alexander, a photojournalist, documented some of the work that Thomas and his team did at VW/Audi in the company’s Simi Valley, California design studio. “We would drive to Los Angeles together,” says Alexander. “We would talk cars the whole way down, and the whole way back. We didn’t talk about politics, or the big issues of the day. Thomas just totally thinks about cars. I’m sure he dreams about them at night.”“I’m really into cars too,” says Larson, who now works for Porsche as a designer. “I’m, like, really into them. For a car nut to get tired of talking about cars, well, it could only happen if you’re with Freeman Thomas. It just shows his passion. He’s one of the most extreme car enthusiasts I’ve ever met.”Thomas is always sketching cars. He has a simple, rough, freehand style, using whatever ballpoint pen is around. He uses lots of lines and cross-hatching — capturing the mood and the shape, rather than the details. Sketching helps him think, helps him experiment, helps him explain.The Audi TT literally started out as a Freeman Thomas sketch on a cocktail napkin. “I have been drawing cars almost forever,” he says. “It’s my passion.” Thomas won his first car-drawing contest when he was in the first grade. “It was a drawing of a fire engine,” he says with residual pride.In college, Thomas would sit and do his drawings while listening to a Walkman. Coming through his headphones, according to a friend, were the sounds of cars at the racetrack. No commentary, no sportscasters calling the action — just the full-throated, full-throttle sounds of engines roaring by.This summer, DaimlerChrysler hired Thomas away from VW/Audi. At DaimlerChrysler, Thomas heads three of the company’s advanced product-design studios. After his first full week of work in Detroit — with his family still in California — Thomas stretched out on the bed in his room at the Residence Inn and reviewed his week: what he’d learned, what he’d seen, what inspirations he’d gotten from the designers. “I just made a series of sketches. I sketched my week by sketching cars,” he says. “Unfortunately, I can’t show them to you because they’re all top secret.”advertisementFreeman Thomas on Cars and CookingI’m not a workaholic. I make friends with my neighbors. At a certain point, you have to get away from work and look at as many different things as possible — then bring them back to work.Look at cooking, for instance. The great dishes have come out of peasant cooking — from Italy, France, Germany. In Italy, it’s just pasta and tomatoes. Look at all the different flavors made from those same ingredients.In the studio, we don’t want to homogenize cultures; we want to differentiate them.Freeman Thomas could not look more ordinary. Passing him at the mall, pulling up next to him at a stop light, you’d hardly give him a second glance. In California, while at VW/Audi, Thomas often came to work in shorts and a T-shirt.In the offices of DaimlerChrysler, where Thomas is one of four vice presidents who sit in a row of roomy glass boxes, he wears a coat and sometimes a tie. But he does almost nothing to draw attention to himself, contrary to what you might expect from a hip designer. No earrings, no shaggy hair, no all-black wardrobe, no outrageous fashions. His personal style is so unselfconscious, it’s almost a statement of its own — the absence of style.If this straightforward presentation isn’t exactly calculated, Thomas can nonetheless explain it. “A lot of people in the design world are full of BS,” he says. “They want to create the facade that there’s an extreme individual there. I don’t want to be someone who can’t be approached.”advertisementThomas is no longer a kid sitting with his sketch pad and his Walkman, drawing cars and listening to the sound of roaring engines. Modern car design is, by necessity, a thoroughly collaborative process. There are transmissions to consider, the quality of surface materials, costs, manufacturability, safety and other government regulations, and marketability.In that world, Thomas has evolved a role that serves both his artistic and his bureaucratic needs. “I’m a storyteller,” he says. “I think of a designer as a processor of information — like a scriptwriter or a novelist.” Thomas sees himself as a kind of cultural filter and architect: Listen carefully to what’s going on out in the world, consider history and context, and create a vehicle that matches the zeitgeist. The Microbus is an artifact of its era; so is the minivan.Thomas believes absolutely that every vehicle needs a story. “What’s the plot?” he asks of the Prowler, before answering his own question. Being able to communicate that story to consumers is one thing. But being able to articulate it to people inside the company is perhaps more important, if your designs are going to survive, and if they are going to transcend “committee-ization.”“It’s important to be able to communicate, not just to designers but also to nondesign people,” Thomas says. “If people don’t have a vision, you have to be able to walk them through what you’re talking about. You have to be able to connect equally with an engineer, with someone from marketing, and with someone from the fabrication shop. The question is, How do you get people to work together? Most companies have ‘committee design.’ That’s not what I like. I like ‘consensus design.’ In a committee, people don’t speak up. They don’t say what they think. Nothing is allowed to come out. Consensus design means that you all express yourselves, and your ideas, and at the end of the day, you all agree to do something. You might initially be against an idea, but if someone walks you through the thought process, you might then be able to say, ‘I see what you’re talking about.’ “One of the many projects that Thomas has worked on is a series of forklifts for the German manufacturer Linde AG. His forklifts have style and curves, including a sassy reverse curve along the back of the cab. “It’s like a little squirt, ” says Thomas. Indeed, he sketches a forklift, and below it, he sketches a cartoon character named Esso, an animated guy whose head is a drop of oil. (The character is used to market Esso products in Europe.) “That’s where the curve came from on the forklifts,” says Thomas. “From the curve of Esso’s head.”With all their functionality, the forklifts had that touch of whimsy that made some of Thomas’s colleagues certain that the design would never be approved.advertisementNot only did Thomas shepherd the forklifts along (they remain in production), but one customer also discovered that a cold-starting problem that had existed with the old forklifts did not exist with Thomas’s forklifts. No changes had been made to the starting mechanisms. “The company looked into it,” says Thomas, “and discovered that the drivers were parking these new forklifts inside at night. They liked these forklifts better, and because they liked them better, they were taking better care of them. The passion goes all the way through. You end up with something that is more than the sum of its parts.”Thomas strives for simplicity. The fewer the lines, he says, the clearer the story that a car tells. Beyond cars, his taste is a blend of simplicity and functionality. “I like the Weber grill: two sides, three legs. It’s a piece of Americana. I like the classic yellow school bus. I like the good old American postbox, with the red flag up. What is more exciting than getting mail?”Thomas never has trouble communicating his own passion. His ordinariness drops away when he starts talking, conveying not only his judgment but also his energy.“He generates so much enthusiasm and so much emotion in the studio,” says Jesse Alexander, the photojournalist who watched Thomas work for several months. “The people around him get caught up in it.”Frank Saucedo worked for Thomas at the VW/Audi studio in Simi Valley, and succeeded him as chief designer there this summer. “For Freeman, no idea was too crazy. Every idea was valid. The question was ‘How does the idea fit into the scenario?’ Freeman’s a storyteller. The Beetle speaks to the heritage of VW. Likewise, the TT is about Audi’s long history: It’s about racing; it’s about technology; it’s about Auto Union [the manufacturing conglomerate of the 1930s that Audi was a part of]. And it’s also totally original.”Thomas arrives at DaimlerChrysler with a fascinating pedigree for the job he’s taken. DaimlerChrysler is struggling with how to merge two very different corporate cultures: the very German Stuttgart and the very American Auburn Hills. Thomas is a product of those same two cultures: a German mother and an American dad. His father was an air-traffic controller for the U.S. Air Force, and he can tell you what cars his family had during postings in Oslo, Madrid, and Athens. Thomas — the same Thomas who had won a contest for drawing a fire engine — became a fireman in the U.S. Air Force after high school. He was crew chief of a crash rescue team assigned to a squadron of F-111s.advertisementHaving gone to school, lived, and worked in California, he is steeped in that state’s cruising culture. And he is steeped in the European auto culture, which he admires, having spent much of his professional career in Europe. This is the first time that Thomas has worked for one of the big American automakers, and the first time that he’s worked in Detroit.Thomas often speaks of “being willing to put my head on the chopping block” — not only to come up with unusual designs, like the forklifts, but to explain them until their stories make sense.“My job here is to encourage designers to take risks,” he says, “to look at what they are doing, and to help them bring greatness to the surface. Most important, my job is to help them create a story. Car designers need to create a story. Every car provides an opportunity to create an adventure.”Thomas likes the way that DaimlerChrysler is organized into product teams — an approach that means that designers work from the very beginning with engineering and marketing people. As a result, designs don’t develop in a vacuum, or get mugged later by technical problems. “I’ve been able to work at double speed here compared to what I was able to do at VW/Audi,” he says, just one month into the job.Some auto-industry observers have expressed concern over the course of the DaimlerChrysler combination, but Thomas thinks difficult corporate times often offer an opportunity for risky designs to surface. “I’m very comfortable with the future here,” he says. “I know what’s going on in the back of these design studios. There’s a lot of new stuff coming.”His role in the studio, he says, “is to scare the hell out of myself. That’s important. Because it doesn’t take long to get used to something once it’s on the street.”advertisementCharles Fishman (cnfish@mindspring.com), a senior editor at Fast Company, is thinking about replacing his 1986 Honda Accord (it has 189,500 miles on it). Learn more about DaimlerChrysler on the Web (www.daimlerchrysler.com).Sidebar: What’s FastWhat drives distinctive design? According to Freeman Thomas, who assisted in the creation of two of this decade’s most engaging cars — VW’s New Beetle and the Audi TT — it isn’t just one thing; it’s a combination of honesty, intuition, collaboration, and open-mindedness.Good design begins with honesty.“Honesty is my approach,” says Thomas. “That, and not being afraid to put my head on the chopping block to take a risk.” Honesty of design, for Thomas, means designing cars that know what they are trying to be. “Forms, shapes — they have a certain language. Either they are honest, or they feel contrived.” Honesty doesn’t mean designing cars that are purely utilitarian — Thomas views every car as a chance for fun. “Sometimes, you want to be lifted away from the ordinary. We’ve learned to make cars more and more efficient, but we need to learn to bring emotion back into them.”Good design asks tough questions.The next generation of cars will question assumptions, just as the current generation does: How will we use a car? How will we feel inside it? What technology will it offer? How will it function ecologically? And how safe is it?Good design comes from collaboration.“I want the most interactive team in the world. Part of that means exposing my own strengths and weaknesses.” Thomas often sketches while talking to his designers, something that not all managers are willing to do. “A car requires different talents to come together. But you have to have a conductor. At the end of the day, you want the product to say something polarized and distinctive.”Good design comes from trusting your intuition.Thomas’s own creative process, he says, “is very intuitive. Intuition is part experience and part talent. Your intuition — your ability to know what’s right — should become more and more sharp over time.”advertisementRelated StoriesIdeasCRISPR Pioneer Jennifer Doudna On Gene Editing’s Potential For Good And EvilIdeasThe Ethics Of CRISPRMagazineThe CEO Of Flywheel Sports Wants You To Celebrate Your FailuresadvertisementVideoIdeasIdeasNight Out For Safety and Liberation Asks How To Go Beyond Policing To Keep Communities SafeIdeasThis App Lets You Request Mental Health Help For A Homeless Person In DistressIdeasHow Sweden Is Fast Tracking Refugees Into The WorkforceEntertainmentEntertainmentNew Absolut Campaign Celebrates The Ongoing Fight For LGBTQ RightsEntertainment7 Times Obama’s Official Photographer Was Trump’s Classiest TrollEntertainment“Stranger Things 2” Thriller, Gucci Goes Trekkie: The Top 5 Ads Of The WeekCo.DesignCitiesThis Woman’s Travel Photos Are Better Than Yours — And She Never Leaves The HouseProductThis Airbnb For Great Architecture Is Curated By Two ArchitectsGraphicsThis Photo Captures Every Color In A Single Twinkling StarFast CompanyIdeasNight Out For Safety and Liberation Asks How To Go Beyond Policing To Keep Communities SafeIdeasThis App Lets You Request Mental Health Help For A Homeless Person In DistressTechnologyInside The ICO Bubble: Why Initial Coin Offerings Have Raised More Than $1 Billion Since January

Background[edit]
Thomas, the son of an American military air traffic controller and a German mother, traveled frequently around Europe during his childhood. This led to an early awareness of cars - in his own words, "a certain sense of automotive space."[1]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, Freeman worked as a senior designer at Porsche from 1983 to 1987.[2]
After leaving Porsche, he worked in consultancy, journalism and teaching, before joining Volkswagen of America in 1991.
Volkswagen Group[edit]
While at the Volkswagen Design Center in Simi Valley, California, he collaborated with fellow Art Center graduate J Mays on the design of the Volkswagen Concept 1 concept car, a modern re-interpretation of the original Volkswagen Beetle. This was first shown at the 1994 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS), and the positive response led to the car entering production as the Volkswagen New Beetle.[1] In 1994, he began the design of the acclaimed Audi TT concept car, which also led to a production model.[1]
From 1996 to 1999, Thomas was a member of J Mays' SHR Perceptual Management industrial design consultancy, before returning to Volkswagen of America as head of design.[1]
DaimlerChrysler[edit]
In 1999, Thomas was appointed vice president of DaimlerChrysler Advanced Product Design Strategy, later becoming head of their Pacifica Advanced Design Center in 2002.[2] At DaimlerChrysler he oversaw the design of several Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep concept cars and production models.
Ford[edit]
Thomas moved to the Ford Motor Company, taking up the role of Director, Strategic Design for North America on 1 June 2005. He is responsible for developing product design strategies and concept vehicles for the Ford (inclusive of the current Mustang design), Lincoln and Mercury marques.[2]
R Gruppe[edit]
Cris Huergas and Freeman Thomas of California founded R Gruppe, an early 911 Porsche sports club on May 15, 1999. They did so with the intention of bringing like-minded individual together to share technical and historical information related to their cars, as well as sharing views and ideas concerning the ownership, preparation, maintenance and operation of their cars.
Designs[edit]
Thomas is credited with the following designs:

Volkswagen New Beetle[1]
Audi TT[1]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

From 1996 to 1999, Thomas was a member of J Mays' SHR Perceptual Management industrial design consultancy, before returning to Volkswagen of America as head of design.[1]
DaimlerChrysler[edit]

R Gruppe[edit]
Cris Huergas and Freeman Thomas of California founded R Gruppe, an early 911 Porsche sports club on May 15, 1999.

Background[edit]
Thomas, the son of an American military air traffic controller and a German mother, traveled frequently around Europe during his childhood. This led to an early awareness of cars - in his own words, "a certain sense of automotive space."[1]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, Freeman worked as a senior designer at Porsche from 1983 to 1987.[2]
After leaving Porsche, he worked in consultancy, journalism and teaching, before joining Volkswagen of America in 1991.
Volkswagen Group[edit]
While at the Volkswagen Design Center in Simi Valley, California, he collaborated with fellow Art Center graduate J Mays on the design of the Volkswagen Concept 1 concept car, a modern re-interpretation of the original Volkswagen Beetle. This was first shown at the 1994 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS), and the positive response led to the car entering production as the Volkswagen New Beetle.[1] In 1994, he began the design of the acclaimed Audi TT concept car, which also led to a production model.[1]
From 1996 to 1999, Thomas was a member of J Mays' SHR Perceptual Management industrial design consultancy, before returning to Volkswagen of America as head of design.[1]
DaimlerChrysler[edit]
In 1999, Thomas was appointed vice president of DaimlerChrysler Advanced Product Design Strategy, later becoming head of their Pacifica Advanced Design Center in 2002.[2] At DaimlerChrysler he oversaw the design of several Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep concept cars and production models.
Ford[edit]
Thomas moved to the Ford Motor Company, taking up the role of Director, Strategic Design for North America on 1 June 2005. He is responsible for developing product design strategies and concept vehicles for the Ford (inclusive of the current Mustang design), Lincoln and Mercury marques.[2]
R Gruppe[edit]
Cris Huergas and Freeman Thomas of California founded R Gruppe, an early 911 Porsche sports club on May 15, 1999. They did so with the intention of bringing like-minded individual together to share technical and historical information related to their cars, as well as sharing views and ideas concerning the ownership, preparation, maintenance and operation of their cars.
Designs[edit]
Thomas is credited with the following designs:

Volkswagen New Beetle[1]
Audi TT[1]

Background[edit]
Thomas, the son of an American military air traffic controller and a German mother, traveled frequently around Europe during his childhood. This led to an early awareness of cars - in his own words, "a certain sense of automotive space."[1]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, Freeman worked as a senior designer at Porsche from 1983 to 1987.[2]
After leaving Porsche, he worked in consultancy, journalism and teaching, before joining Volkswagen of America in 1991.
Volkswagen Group[edit]
While at the Volkswagen Design Center in Simi Valley, California, he collaborated with fellow Art Center graduate J Mays on the design of the Volkswagen Concept 1 concept car, a modern re-interpretation of the original Volkswagen Beetle. This was first shown at the 1994 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS), and the positive response led to the car entering production as the Volkswagen New Beetle.[1] In 1994, he began the design of the acclaimed Audi TT concept car, which also led to a production model.[1]
From 1996 to 1999, Thomas was a member of J Mays' SHR Perceptual Management industrial design consultancy, before returning to Volkswagen of America as head of design.[1]
DaimlerChrysler[edit]
In 1999, Thomas was appointed vice president of DaimlerChrysler Advanced Product Design Strategy, later becoming head of their Pacifica Advanced Design Center in 2002.[2] At DaimlerChrysler he oversaw the design of several Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep concept cars and production models.
Ford[edit]
Thomas moved to the Ford Motor Company, taking up the role of Director, Strategic Design for North America on 1 June 2005. He is responsible for developing product design strategies and concept vehicles for the Ford (inclusive of the current Mustang design), Lincoln and Mercury marques.[2]
R Gruppe[edit]
Cris Huergas and Freeman Thomas of California founded R Gruppe, an early 911 Porsche sports club on May 15, 1999. They did so with the intention of bringing like-minded individual together to share technical and historical information related to their cars, as well as sharing views and ideas concerning the ownership, preparation, maintenance and operation of their cars.
Designs[edit]
Thomas is credited with the following designs:

Volkswagen New Beetle[1]
Audi TT[1]
Audi A4[3]
Audi A6[3]

Panoz Roadster

Chrysler Pacifica[3]
Dodge Super 8 Hemi concept[1]
Jeep Willys concept[1]
Jeep Treo concept[4][5]
Dodge Sling Shot concept
Jeep Rescue concept
Dodge Tomahawk concept motorcycle[2]
With Ralph Gilles

Chrysler 300[2]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Ford Realigns Global Design Talent





















 Ford Realigns Global Design TalentMay 2, 2006 12:00 pm  |  by Levent OzlerFord Motor Company has realigned key players within its global design team, more strategically leveraging the strengths of some of the industry's most talented design leaders. "We're changing up several leadership positions within our powerhouse of global design talent," said J Mays, group vice president, Design, and Chief Creative Officer. "These moves will help ensure that we further differentiate the designs of each our brands from their competitors' and will allow us to deliver even stronger, more emotional products throughout our brand portfolio." Supporting Americas Design Executive Director Peter Horbury in his bid to infuse the full North American vehicle lineup with "Red, White & Bold" style are:  - Moray Callum, who has been appointed Design director, Cars. Effective May 1, Callum returns to North America from Hiroshima, Japan, where he previously was General Manager, Design Division, Mazda Motor Corporation.  - Patrick Schiavone, who has been named Design director, Trucks, also effective May 1. Schiavone previously was Design director, Cars. - Freeman Thomas, who was named director of Strategic Design for North America Advanced Studios in California and Dearborn in June 2005, continues in that role."I can't think of a better creative team to help deliver vehicles that even more closely reflect the attitudes and values of our diverse customers in this market," Horbury said. "Moray, the man who defined 'Zoom-Zoom' design for the full Mazda lineup, will bring new energy to our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars. Pat, whose name is synonymous with 'Built Ford Tough' F-150 designs, is going to further push the needle on our pickups and strengthen SUVs and Crossovers. And Freeman, a world-class strategist, is poised to continue pushing our vision for new, white-space vehicle designs. "Working closely together as one creative team, we're going to help pave the Way Forward, delivering vehicle designs that are even more compelling for our customers," Horbury said. In a related move, Mazda has appointed Laurens van den Acker general manager of the company's Design Division. He is responsible for the overall design and styling of all of Mazda's global products, replacing Callum, and reports to Seita Kanai, senior managing executive officer in charge of Mazda ' s R&D as well as Mays. Before joining Mazda in January as deputy general manager, Design Division, van den Acker was chief designer of Strategic Design in the Dearborn Advanced Studio. Prior to that assignment, he held several different design positions during his seven years with Ford, including chief designer for the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner and chief designer of the Brand Imaging Group. "Laurens' global experience and strengths as a brand and product strategist make him uniquely qualified to take the already-strong lineup of Mazda designs to a new level," Mays said. "His contributions to key vehicles – including the Ford Model U, 427 and Bronco concepts – demonstrate his ability to imagine the future on our customers' behalf and pay that vision out in sheet metal." Elsewhere in the global lineup, Martin Smith, executive director, Design – Ford of Europe, has assumed additional responsibilities. Matrix-reporting to Smith is Scott Strong, director of Design – Ford Asia Pacific and Africa. Strong is responsible for developing vehicle designs for Australia-based product programs and oversees Ford's China and Asia-Pacific studios, reporting directly to Trevor Worthington, vice president – Ford Australia, and John Shelton, director of Product Development – Asia Pacific and Africa. "From a design perspective, we're more closely aligning these markets," Mays said. "We want to ensure we're more consistently delivering the Ford design DNA throughout our full range of products, but we also want to reflect each region's unique customer desires and aspirations. "This shift – combined with the new appointments – will help our world-class Design team continue pushing to create even more powerful vehicles that are true to the values of their respective brands, distinct from the competition and meaningful to customers," Mays said. Leading Design at Ford Motor Company's additional brands are: Ian Callum, Design director, Jaguar. Steve Mattin, Design director, Volvo. Gerry McGovern, Advanced Design director, Land Rover. Marek Reichman, Design director, Aston Martin.
