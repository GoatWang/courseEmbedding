But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Canada professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse Canada portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each Canada professional for more information. Check out the information in the specialized professional sections too for tips on how to hire the right professional for your project.  Professional Categories in Canada

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Saskatchewan professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse Saskatchewan portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each Saskatchewan professional for more information. Check out the information in the specialized professional sections too for tips on how to hire the right professional for your project.  Professional Categories in Saskatchewan

Canada's newest and northernmost arctic capital incorporates the traditional practices of its native Inuit communities into the fast-growing metropolitan infrastructure. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Nunavut’s Legislative Assembly building in downtown Iqaluit, a 3-story edifice that integrates Inuit motifs in its modern design, or the igloo-shaped Anglican cathedral. Stone monuments like inukshuks and inunnguaqs guide travelers to the spectacular tundra surrounding the city.

“Frobisher Inn”


Reviewed August 3, 2012




We needed four rooms, and this was the only hotel in town that could do that on the day we needed. Compared to mainstream Canadian or US hotels it is very tired with slowish internet. The food is OK and the bar quite local. Have also tried the Discovery Inn which had slightly better internet, much smaller rooms but a lower rate.

“Awesome Hotel”


Reviewed June 22, 2012




I recently traveled to Iqaluit on business for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of accommodation and service.    My room overlooked the town, it was clean and had all the amenities I needed.  The staff at the front desk were very helpful directing me to the government offices I needed to go to in town and I found all staff to be very helpful.  Their restaurant was the highlight of my trip, the food was totally awesome, the presentations were out of this world and I did not expect this in a remote location like this.  The food at the lobby café was as good as in the restaurant, it looked so fresh and tasted so yummy.    Did not frequent the Bar but I am told Wednesday evenings is a must when visiting Iqaluit, apparently the whole town is gathering there for Chicken Wings.    I would recommend to stay here, a very pleasant little hotel with all the amenities a traveler needs.


Room Tip: Ask for a room overlooking the town

via mobile




My partner stayed at the Frobisher Inn recently for business. All went well until the last night. She awoke in the night to find a man standing at the foot of her bed. She lept up screaming for the man to leave, which he did quickly. After gathering herself she called the front desk, wondering if perhaps the Inn had given her room to another guest. She was initially told by the font desk receptionist, no, of course not, then after a moment the receptionisst informed her that security had been doing "room checks". She found this unacceptable of course why would a male security guard come into a locked guest room, in the dark, then run when challenged.Since the episode she has written the hotel twice, requesting an explanation and weeks later they have not responded. We intend to follow up with the local RCMP detachment. This is definitely not a safe place for women to stay.

Thank you so much for taking the time to comment on your partners stay at the Frobisher Inn.Please be assured that safety and security of our guests is one of our number one priorities. In saying that, sometimes mistakes happen, and in this case after investigating, I found out that our security guard was checking vacant rooms, and entered your partners room by mistake. He was so startled by seeing someone he just ran off. It is very unfortunate that this happened, and I cannot begin to imagine how your partner felt. We take this very seriously, and rest assured this is definitely not a common occurrence. In response to writing the hotel, unfortunately I have had no emails, calls, or letters come across my desk or I would have surely responded. We value the safety and security of our guests and this would have not gone responded to. Again we apologize for this happening to your partner and hope we can welcome her back next time she is in Iqaluit and allow us to prove how safe the Frobisher Inn really is.

“Good hotel for business travel”


Reviewed June 9, 2012




This hotel is a hub for many community things such as the pool and the movie theatre as well as being one of the Iqaluit's main business hotels. It is not the cheapest in town but the beds are comfortable and the staff get the job done.

Clean, comfortable, safe. Housekeeping staff go the extra distance to make the rooms look fancy. Front desk staff are courteous and generally helpful.Local calls cost $1 - this is annoying.Checkout time is 11am -- too early.Airport shuttle is rarely available.

“A Fine Stay”


Reviewed April 23, 2012




I recently stayed here, on advice that it is the best place in Iqaluit. It was a good stay. The 'Frob', as the locals call it, is an average hotel (think Holiday Inn, Radisson etc.) with good amenities. The cost is high, but that is because most things are expensive there. My room was comfortable and fine, though I found it a bit too warm. I tried to sleep with the window open but that was hard with all the snowmobile sounds outside! Bathroom was well equipped though showing some wear and tear (a wobbly toilet, a hair dryer in its last days).Staff are great here. There is a variety store and coffee/cafeteria-like shop on the main level (Caribrew Cafe). The food there was not great. However, there are two other restaurant options. The pub was fine (if you go ther on Wednesday it's wing night and very crowded). Note that, fter 8, there is no access via the hotel lobby; instead you go out front door of both places. The upscale restaurant, the Gallery, was excellent with great service. Overall prices are high but that reflects the cost of living in the north. I had a very tasty muskox meal. That said, the Gallery had a modest but very reasonably priced wine list.Iqaluit is small so it's only a short walk or taxi ride to anywhere. The Frob is therefore in a fine location. Taxis routinely pull up so it's not hard to get around quickly.I have no problem recommending this place and will likely stay again. Worth more like 3 1/2 stars.

“I love the Frob”



Reviewed January 10, 2012






GM F, General Manager at Frobisher Inn, responded to this review,
April 23, 2012


Thank you for your comments..Guest concerns are always taken very seriously here at the Frobisher Inn, and the concern expressed below is no exception. Being told that change cannot be obtained from the Front Desk would be a unpleasant experience for any traveler, especially when they are trying to purchase a product from the establishments’ vending machine. Having said that, the Front Desk always maintains a sufficient cash/coin float to accommodate guest requests; like one mentioned. Situations like this may happen from time to time, and we are committed to ensuring they are not repeated. With regards to the local artisans circulating through the Dining Room during service and offering their Art for sale. This has been a long tradition of the Frobisher Inn. The Frobisher Inn enjoys a special relationship with the local Inuit community and these artisans are respectful of the fine dining atmosphere, and many of our patrons enjoy this aspect of their dining experience. Thank you for your comments, which give us an opportunity to improve..We hope you choose the Frobisher Inn again.
