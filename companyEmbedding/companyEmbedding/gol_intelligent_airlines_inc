Deloitte Brazil admits false auditing and obstructing investigations

Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Auditores Independentes knowingly issued materially false audit reports for carrier Gol Intelligent Airlines in 2010 said PCAOB 



The case involves some of the most serious misconduct the PCAOB has ever uncovered, agency enforcement chief Claudius Modesti said. 


Numerous Deloitte Brazil personnel then sought to obstruct a PCAOB inspection in 2012, with the knowledge and participation of senior firm leaders  

The United States accounting watchdog hit Deloitte's Brazil division with a record US$8 million fine for issuing false audits of a US-traded Brazilian airline and then doctoring papers to thwart an investigation, the agency said.
 Brazil-based Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Auditores Independentes knowingly issued materially false audit reports for Brazilian carrier Gol Intelligent Airlines in 2010, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board said in a statement.
Numerous Deloitte Brazil personnel then sought to obstruct a PCAOB inspection in 2012, directing junior staff to alter documents and taking other steps to conceal the paper trail with the knowledge and participation of senior firm leaders, the PCAOB said.
The case involves some of the most serious misconduct the PCAOB has ever uncovered, agency enforcement chief Claudius Modesti said.
Deloitte admitted to violating quality standards and to failing to cooperate with the investigation, the board said.
In addition to the fine, Deloitte Brazil is required to appoint an independent monitor and is barred from accepting new work in certain areas until the monitor confirms progress in addressing the problems.
The PCAOB also sanctioned a dozen former Deloitte Brazil officials, including the former audit practice leader, who was permanently barred from the industry. Others were fined sums of $10,000 or $20,000 and/or suspended or barred from practicing for one to five years.
The PCAOB is a nonprofit corporation established by the US Congress in 2002 to oversee audits of public companies. The agency has oversight of Gol because it trades on the New York Stock Exchange.

                    Statistics and Market Data about Transport & Logistics
                In this section, Statista presents the most relevant and up-to-date facts relating to the transportation and logistics industries. Today, there is a plethora of transport modes around the world, the most dominant ones being road  and rail transport, as well as ship transport and aviation. 

Global passenger demand is on the rise both in mature and emerging markets, where the population is becoming increasingly affluent and mobile. Despite the growing number of bicycles,  motorcycles, coaches, trains, planes and even cruise ships in use, the automobile is still the most popular form of passenger travel. Thanks to the car’s popularity, the automotive industry has made a strong comeback from the 2008 financial crisis; as of 2012, there are more than 800 million passenger cars in use globally - a figure that translates into an average rate of around 165 passenger vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants. Toyota, General Motors and VW are ranked as the largest passenger car manufacturers worldwide. The Volkswagen Group is also counted among the world’s leading truck manufacturers, trailing only Germany’s Daimler and China’s Dongfeng.
 
In terms of cargo transportation, trade relations between China, North America and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are forecast to drive up traffic demand over the coming years. While cargo aircraft are often used to transport mail, animals and dangerous items, bulk products are typically carried by railways, trucks and ships. In the logistics industry, intermodal freight traffic is the most common choice to move consumer goods. Intermodal transport facilitates and expedites cargo traffic because the freight is shipped in containers that move interchangeably by commercial vehicles, railroads and container ships.

                    Statistics and Market Data on Aviation & Aerospace
                In this section, Statista presents the most relevant and up-to-date facts relating to passenger and cargo air traffic. The aviation industry comprises passenger airlines, freight forwarders and related infrastructure such as airports and warehouses. 

In terms of brand value, the largest passenger airlines include Lufthansa, Emirates and Delta Air Lines. The latter is also the leading airline in terms of passenger traffic, while Emirates leads the list of cargo carriers, based on freight mileage. Ryanair and Southwest Airlines are the main players in the low-cost category, which is attracting a growing customer base. In this segment, many carriers charge for ancillary services to boost revenue.

The United States, Brazil, China and the European Union are ranked among the most important markets for air travel. The busiest airports are Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (IATA: ATL), handling over 90 million passengers annually, and Hong Kong International Airport (IATA: HKG), where about four million tons of freight is loaded and unloaded per year. Air freight chiefly refers to dangerous items, animals and mail. Although speed is the great advantage of flying, the dramatic increase in fuel prices has caused the air freight market to decline significantly, and forced forwarders to turn to sea vessels and railroads when shipping heavy cargo.

Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A ("Gol Intelligent Airlines S.A." also known as VRG Linhas Aéreas S/A) BM&F Bovespa: GOLL3, GOLL4 / NYSE: GOL is a Brazilian airline based in São Paulo, Brazil.[1] According to the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil (ANAC), between January and December 2015 Gol had 35.9% of the domestic and 13.6% of the international market shares in terms of passengers per kilometer flown,[2] making it the largest low-cost airline in South America and the second largest Brazilian airline company by market share and fleet size, after LATAM Brasil. Gol competes in Brazil and other South American countries with Chilean LATAM Airlines Group, Brazilian Azul and Colombia-based Avianca Holdings S.A. It also owns the brand Varig, although now that name refers to what is informally known as the "new" Varig, founded in 2006, not to the extinct "old" Varig airline, founded in 1927.
Gol operates a growing domestic and international scheduled network. Its main hubs are São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport, Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport and Tancredo Neves International Airport near Belo Horizonte. Gol also has focus operations at Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont Airport, São Paulo-Congonhas Airport, Salgado Filho International Airport in Porto Alegre Gol refers to itself as Gol Intelligent Airlines[3] (Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes in Portuguese) as a slogan. The company is traded on the New York Stock Exchange as "GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A."[4]
The company's name is a Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish word borrowing from the English word "goal" from Association football.[5]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]

The airline was established in 2000 and started operations on January 15, 2001 with a flight from Brasília to São Paulo.[6] It is a subsidiary of the Brazilian conglomerate Grupo Áurea, based in Minas Gerais state, which has other transportation interests, including Brazil's largest long-distance bus company. Grupo Áurea in turn is owned by the Constantino family. Constantino Júnior was responsible for building the business next to the vice president of the company, David Barioni.[7][8]
On June 24, 2004 Gol launched simultaneous initial public offerings on the New York and São Paulo stock exchanges. In 2007, Gol was owned by AeroPar Participações (75.5%), Venture (17.6%), American International Group (5.4%) and Air France-KLM (1,5%).[9] The growth in Gol's stock price made the Constantino family a member of the Forbes magazine billionaire list in 2005.
In 2007, Gol was supposed to begin a code-share agreement with TAP Portugal, opening the European market to the Brazilian airline, and the internal Brazilian market to the Portuguese airline (the largest foreign airline in Brazil). Instead, TAP Portugal chose to cooperate with TAM Airlines (TAM Linhas Aéreas).[10]
On February 24, 2010 Gol announced to be in "advanced talks" to join Oneworld alliance,[11] which would allow it to catch up with rival TAM, a recent member of Star Alliance. However, on October 6, 2010, the airline announced a change in position by denying any interest in joining an alliance, preferring to remain independent and to establish a "patchwork of code-sharing agreements."[12] Following this trend, on September 28, 2011 Gol and Aerolíneas Argentinas announced the intention to implement a codeshare, feeder and frequent flyer programs agreement on a date yet to be announced and pending approval from the governments of Brazil and Argentina.[13]
On March 18, 2010 Gol unveiled the expansion of its maintenance base located at Belo Horizonte/Confins - Tancredo Neves International Airport. Originally opened in 2006 with the capacity to service 60 aircraft per year (mainly Boeing 737 and 767), the expansion allowed Gol to increase the number to 120.[14] Gol later started also using the base to service aircraft from other airlines, and as of 2013 it also serviced airplanes from Azul Brazilian Airlines and Copa Airlines.[15][16]
On December 23, 2010, Gol Airlines started an operational partnership with Brazilian carrier Passaredo Linhas Aéreas. The agreement was rescinded on July 31, 2014, when Passaredo established a similar interline agreement with TAM Airlines instead.[17]
On December 7, 2011, Gol announced the intention of Delta Air Lines to purchase 3% of its shares.[18] The agreement also includes the creation of mutual code-share flights, alignment of frequent flyer benefits and transfer of Gol's Boeing 767s lease agreements to Delta.[19]
On October 1, 2012, Gol confirmed a firm order of 60 Boeing 737 MAXs. References did not specify the type of MAX aircraft.[20][21]
On October 6, 2012, Gol started seasonal operations to Miami and Orlando, available for Smiles account holders and originating in Brazil only. Technically, they are considered charter flights, although they are not necessarily part of an inclusive tour package; the use of miles or miles plus money is mandatory, as well as a minimum 7-day stay at the destination.[22]
On 23 January 2013, the Jet Airliner Crash Data Evaluation Centre (JACDEC) announced that Gol Airlines had the fourth worst safety record in the world. The ratings take into account the number and deadliness of the hull losses (destroyed airplanes) they have suffered in the past 30 years, how they have fared more recently, and how many flights they have flown without incident. The results do not take into account the cause of the hull losses, or whether the airline is at fault, so they are not a perfect measure of how safely an airline behaves. It should be noted that since Gol is a relatively young airline with only one hull loss, but with a large number of casualties (Flight 1907), that single fatal accident significantly affects the calculation.[23]
In February 2014, Air France–KLM announced it would invest $100 million in Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes in advance of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.[24]
Some disagreement exists as to whether Gol is a low-cost carrier. In 2014, Gol was ranked the second best low-cost airline in South America after Azul.[25] Gol refers to itself as a low-cost carrier, but it is increasingly not regarded as such. According to UFRJ specialist Elton Fernandes, "Gol's costs are not very different from those of TAM Airlines. People are accustomed to calling Gol low-cost, but Gol is not that. It is not even low-fare anymore."[26]
Purchase of Varig[edit]

On March 28, 2007 Gol officially purchased part of the assets of VARIG - VRG Linhas Aéreas, informally known as the "new Varig," a new company that owned the Varig brand, for US$320 million from Volo Group and MatlinPatterson Global Opportunies hedge fund. At that time, the "old Varig" was under bankruptcy protection.
Gol announced that the Varig brand would continue doing business operating as such, rather than its official name VRG Linhas Aéreas.[27] The transaction, via its GTI subsidiary, required a US$98 million cash payment, with the balance through the allocation of non-voting shares to VARIG Logística and Volo, which had acquired VARIG in June 2006 for US$24 million.[28] The transaction did not involve the original airline, informally known as "old Varig," which continued to exist until its own bankruptcy in mid-2010 under the name Flex Linhas Aéreas.
In 2009 Gol was merged into VRG Linhas Aéreas. VRG Linhas Aéreas thus became an airline that operates two brands: Gol and Varig, although in reality flights are operated only under Gol flight numbers. Initially, the Varig brand operated to medium-haul scheduled and charter international destinations within South America and to the Caribbean with Boeing 737-700's configured in two classes, and to long-haul charter international destinations in North America, Europe and Africa with Boeing 767-300ERs configured in economy only. The latter were also used in wet-lease operations.[29] This scheme was later dropped. The brand Gol operates most of the flights of the network, and had aircraft configured in all-economy class, used for scheduled domestic and international operations within South America.
Because of contractual obligations, between 2006 and 2009 the "new Varig" (VRG Linhas Aéreas) was obliged to purchase a minimum of 140 hours/month of services from the "old Varig" (Flex Linhas Aéreas). Therefore, at that time, some of VRG Linhas Aéreas flights operated with Gol flight numbers but were actually flown with chartered aircraft from Flex Linhas Aéreas. The agreement ceased before the bankruptcy of Flex on August 20, 2010.[30]

Purchase of Webjet Linhas Aéreas[edit]
On July 9, 2011, VRG Linhas Aéreas, owner of the brands Gol and Varig, announced the intention to purchase full control of WebJet Linhas Aéreas.[31] The purchase contract was signed on August 2, 2011.[32] On October 10, 2012 the purchase received its final approval with some operational restrictions from the Brazilian regulatory agency.[33] Services were integrated but both companies continued to operate independently for some weeks.[34][35] Integration started on October 17, 2012 when sales requested via Webjet's web-portal started to be redirected to Gol's site.[36] However, on November 23, 2012 Webjet abruptly ceased to operate and all services were incorporated by Gol. The Webjet brand ceased to exist.[34][35] Gol also announced its intention to return all of Webjet's Boeing 737-300s to lessors until the end of the first quarter of 2013. There was no mention to the fate of Webjet's 737-800s.[37]

Airline Affinity Program[edit]
Smiles is Gol/Varig's Frequent-flyer program since July 20, 2006. Points can be used for services from Gol/Varig, and partners Aerolíneas Argentinas, Air France, Delta Air Lines, Iberia, KLM and Qatar Airways including flights, upgrades, holidays, hotel stays and car rentals. Smiles was part of the "new Varig" package bought by Gol, which honored all miles and eventually became its own frequent-flyer program. Previously Gol had no such program.
On a study conducted in 2011, Smiles ranked third among 24 chosen frequent flyer programs, with 97.1% success of requests made.[44]
In 2013, Smiles was spun off as an independent company [45] eventually leading to its IPO at BOVESPA in April 2013.[46]
Incidents and accidents[edit]

On September 29, 2006, Flight 1907 operated by Boeing 737-800 SFP registration PR-GTD, disappeared from radar while flying over the central-western state of Mato Grosso en route from Manaus to Brasília and Rio de Janeiro-Galeão. The aircraft collided in mid-air with an Embraer Legacy 600 business jet, registration N600XL, near the town of Matupá, 470 miles (760 km) south of Manaus. The Gol aircraft crashed in the Amazon jungle, leaving no survivors among its 154 occupants. The wreckage was found a day later. The Legacy jet landed safely at Cachimbo Airport, part of the Brigadeiro Velloso Test Range of the Brazilian Air Force, with damage to the tail and left winglet.[47]

Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A ("Gol Intelligent Airlines S.A." also known as VRG Linhas Aéreas S/A) BM&F Bovespa: GOLL3, GOLL4 / NYSE: GOL is a Brazilian airline based in São Paulo, Brazil.[1] According to the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil (ANAC), between January and December 2015 Gol had 35.9% of the domestic and 13.6% of the international market shares in terms of passengers per kilometer flown,[2] making it the largest low-cost airline in South America and the second largest Brazilian airline company by market share and fleet size, after LATAM Brasil. Gol competes in Brazil and other South American countries with Chilean LATAM Airlines Group, Brazilian Azul and Colombia-based Avianca Holdings S.A. It also owns the brand Varig, although now that name refers to what is informally known as the "new" Varig, founded in 2006, not to the extinct "old" Varig airline, founded in 1927.
Gol operates a growing domestic and international scheduled network. Its main hubs are São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport, Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport and Tancredo Neves International Airport near Belo Horizonte. Gol also has focus operations at Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont Airport, São Paulo-Congonhas Airport, Salgado Filho International Airport in Porto Alegre Gol refers to itself as Gol Intelligent Airlines[3] (Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes in Portuguese) as a slogan. The company is traded on the New York Stock Exchange as "GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A."[4]
The company's name is a Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish word borrowing from the English word "goal" from Association football.[5]

The airline was established in 2000 and started operations on January 15, 2001 with a flight from Brasília to São Paulo.[6] It is a subsidiary of the Brazilian conglomerate Grupo Áurea, based in Minas Gerais state, which has other transportation interests, including Brazil's largest long-distance bus company. Grupo Áurea in turn is owned by the Constantino family. Constantino Júnior was responsible for building the business next to the vice president of the company, David Barioni.[7][8]
On June 24, 2004 Gol launched simultaneous initial public offerings on the New York and São Paulo stock exchanges. In 2007, Gol was owned by AeroPar Participações (75.5%), Venture (17.6%), American International Group (5.4%) and Air France-KLM (1,5%).[9] The growth in Gol's stock price made the Constantino family a member of the Forbes magazine billionaire list in 2005.
In 2007, Gol was supposed to begin a code-share agreement with TAP Portugal, opening the European market to the Brazilian airline, and the internal Brazilian market to the Portuguese airline (the largest foreign airline in Brazil). Instead, TAP Portugal chose to cooperate with TAM Airlines (TAM Linhas Aéreas).[10]
On February 24, 2010 Gol announced to be in "advanced talks" to join Oneworld alliance,[11] which would allow it to catch up with rival TAM, a recent member of Star Alliance. However, on October 6, 2010, the airline announced a change in position by denying any interest in joining an alliance, preferring to remain independent and to establish a "patchwork of code-sharing agreements."[12] Following this trend, on September 28, 2011 Gol and Aerolíneas Argentinas announced the intention to implement a codeshare, feeder and frequent flyer programs agreement on a date yet to be announced and pending approval from the governments of Brazil and Argentina.[13]
On March 18, 2010 Gol unveiled the expansion of its maintenance base located at Belo Horizonte/Confins - Tancredo Neves International Airport. Originally opened in 2006 with the capacity to service 60 aircraft per year (mainly Boeing 737 and 767), the expansion allowed Gol to increase the number to 120.[14] Gol later started also using the base to service aircraft from other airlines, and as of 2013 it also serviced airplanes from Azul Brazilian Airlines and Copa Airlines.[15][16]
On December 23, 2010, Gol Airlines started an operational partnership with Brazilian carrier Passaredo Linhas Aéreas. The agreement was rescinded on July 31, 2014, when Passaredo established a similar interline agreement with TAM Airlines instead.[17]
On December 7, 2011, Gol announced the intention of Delta Air Lines to purchase 3% of its shares.[18] The agreement also includes the creation of mutual code-share flights, alignment of frequent flyer benefits and transfer of Gol's Boeing 767s lease agreements to Delta.[19]
On October 1, 2012, Gol confirmed a firm order of 60 Boeing 737 MAXs. References did not specify the type of MAX aircraft.[20][21]
On October 6, 2012, Gol started seasonal operations to Miami and Orlando, available for Smiles account holders and originating in Brazil only. Technically, they are considered charter flights, although they are not necessarily part of an inclusive tour package; the use of miles or miles plus money is mandatory, as well as a minimum 7-day stay at the destination.[22]
On 23 January 2013, the Jet Airliner Crash Data Evaluation Centre (JACDEC) announced that Gol Airlines had the fourth worst safety record in the world. The ratings take into account the number and deadliness of the hull losses (destroyed airplanes) they have suffered in the past 30 years, how they have fared more recently, and how many flights they have flown without incident. The results do not take into account the cause of the hull losses, or whether the airline is at fault, so they are not a perfect measure of how safely an airline behaves. It should be noted that since Gol is a relatively young airline with only one hull loss, but with a large number of casualties (Flight 1907), that single fatal accident significantly affects the calculation.[23]
In February 2014, Air France–KLM announced it would invest $100 million in Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes in advance of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.[24]
Some disagreement exists as to whether Gol is a low-cost carrier. In 2014, Gol was ranked the second best low-cost airline in South America after Azul.[25] Gol refers to itself as a low-cost carrier, but it is increasingly not regarded as such. According to UFRJ specialist Elton Fernandes, "Gol's costs are not very different from those of TAM Airlines. People are accustomed to calling Gol low-cost, but Gol is not that. It is not even low-fare anymore."[26]
Purchase of Varig[edit]

On March 28, 2007 Gol officially purchased part of the assets of VARIG - VRG Linhas Aéreas, informally known as the "new Varig," a new company that owned the Varig brand, for US$320 million from Volo Group and MatlinPatterson Global Opportunies hedge fund. At that time, the "old Varig" was under bankruptcy protection.
Gol announced that the Varig brand would continue doing business operating as such, rather than its official name VRG Linhas Aéreas.[27] The transaction, via its GTI subsidiary, required a US$98 million cash payment, with the balance through the allocation of non-voting shares to VARIG Logística and Volo, which had acquired VARIG in June 2006 for US$24 million.[28] The transaction did not involve the original airline, informally known as "old Varig," which continued to exist until its own bankruptcy in mid-2010 under the name Flex Linhas Aéreas.
In 2009 Gol was merged into VRG Linhas Aéreas. VRG Linhas Aéreas thus became an airline that operates two brands: Gol and Varig, although in reality flights are operated only under Gol flight numbers. Initially, the Varig brand operated to medium-haul scheduled and charter international destinations within South America and to the Caribbean with Boeing 737-700's configured in two classes, and to long-haul charter international destinations in North America, Europe and Africa with Boeing 767-300ERs configured in economy only. The latter were also used in wet-lease operations.[29] This scheme was later dropped. The brand Gol operates most of the flights of the network, and had aircraft configured in all-economy class, used for scheduled domestic and international operations within South America.
Because of contractual obligations, between 2006 and 2009 the "new Varig" (VRG Linhas Aéreas) was obliged to purchase a minimum of 140 hours/month of services from the "old Varig" (Flex Linhas Aéreas). Therefore, at that time, some of VRG Linhas Aéreas flights operated with Gol flight numbers but were actually flown with chartered aircraft from Flex Linhas Aéreas. The agreement ceased before the bankruptcy of Flex on August 20, 2010.[30]

Purchase of Webjet Linhas Aéreas[edit]
On July 9, 2011, VRG Linhas Aéreas, owner of the brands Gol and Varig, announced the intention to purchase full control of WebJet Linhas Aéreas.[31] The purchase contract was signed on August 2, 2011.[32] On October 10, 2012 the purchase received its final approval with some operational restrictions from the Brazilian regulatory agency.[33] Services were integrated but both companies continued to operate independently for some weeks.[34][35] Integration started on October 17, 2012 when sales requested via Webjet's web-portal started to be redirected to Gol's site.[36] However, on November 23, 2012 Webjet abruptly ceased to operate and all services were incorporated by Gol. The Webjet brand ceased to exist.[34][35] Gol also announced its intention to return all of Webjet's Boeing 737-300s to lessors until the end of the first quarter of 2013. There was no mention to the fate of Webjet's 737-800s.[37]

Airline Affinity Program[edit]
Smiles is Gol/Varig's Frequent-flyer program since July 20, 2006. Points can be used for services from Gol/Varig, and partners Aerolíneas Argentinas, Air France, Delta Air Lines, Iberia, KLM and Qatar Airways including flights, upgrades, holidays, hotel stays and car rentals. Smiles was part of the "new Varig" package bought by Gol, which honored all miles and eventually became its own frequent-flyer program. Previously Gol had no such program.
On a study conducted in 2011, Smiles ranked third among 24 chosen frequent flyer programs, with 97.1% success of requests made.[44]
In 2013, Smiles was spun off as an independent company [45] eventually leading to its IPO at BOVESPA in April 2013.[46]
Incidents and accidents[edit]

On September 29, 2006, Flight 1907 operated by Boeing 737-800 SFP registration PR-GTD, disappeared from radar while flying over the central-western state of Mato Grosso en route from Manaus to Brasília and Rio de Janeiro-Galeão. The aircraft collided in mid-air with an Embraer Legacy 600 business jet, registration N600XL, near the town of Matupá, 470 miles (760 km) south of Manaus. The Gol aircraft crashed in the Amazon jungle, leaving no survivors among its 154 occupants. The wreckage was found a day later. The Legacy jet landed safely at Cachimbo Airport, part of the Brigadeiro Velloso Test Range of the Brazilian Air Force, with damage to the tail and left winglet.[47]

Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A ("Gol Intelligent Airlines S.A." also known as VRG Linhas Aéreas S/A) BM&F Bovespa: GOLL3, GOLL4 / NYSE: GOL is a Brazilian airline based in São Paulo, Brazil.[1] According to the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil (ANAC), between January and December 2015 Gol had 35.9% of the domestic and 13.6% of the international market shares in terms of passengers per kilometer flown,[2] making it the largest low-cost airline in South America and the second largest Brazilian airline company by market share and fleet size, after LATAM Brasil. Gol competes in Brazil and other South American countries with Chilean LATAM Airlines Group, Brazilian Azul and Colombia-based Avianca Holdings S.A. It also owns the brand Varig, although now that name refers to what is informally known as the "new" Varig, founded in 2006, not to the extinct "old" Varig airline, founded in 1927.
Gol operates a growing domestic and international scheduled network. Its main hubs are São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport, Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport and Tancredo Neves International Airport near Belo Horizonte. Gol also has focus operations at Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont Airport, São Paulo-Congonhas Airport, Salgado Filho International Airport in Porto Alegre Gol refers to itself as Gol Intelligent Airlines[3] (Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes in Portuguese) as a slogan. The company is traded on the New York Stock Exchange as "GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A."[4]
The company's name is a Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish word borrowing from the English word "goal" from Association football.[5]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]

The airline was established in 2000 and started operations on January 15, 2001 with a flight from Brasília to São Paulo.[6] It is a subsidiary of the Brazilian conglomerate Grupo Áurea, based in Minas Gerais state, which has other transportation interests, including Brazil's largest long-distance bus company. Grupo Áurea in turn is owned by the Constantino family. Constantino Júnior was responsible for building the business next to the vice president of the company, David Barioni.[7][8]
On June 24, 2004 Gol launched simultaneous initial public offerings on the New York and São Paulo stock exchanges. In 2007, Gol was owned by AeroPar Participações (75.5%), Venture (17.6%), American International Group (5.4%) and Air France-KLM (1,5%).[9] The growth in Gol's stock price made the Constantino family a member of the Forbes magazine billionaire list in 2005.
In 2007, Gol was supposed to begin a code-share agreement with TAP Portugal, opening the European market to the Brazilian airline, and the internal Brazilian market to the Portuguese airline (the largest foreign airline in Brazil). Instead, TAP Portugal chose to cooperate with TAM Airlines (TAM Linhas Aéreas).[10]
On February 24, 2010 Gol announced to be in "advanced talks" to join Oneworld alliance,[11] which would allow it to catch up with rival TAM, a recent member of Star Alliance. However, on October 6, 2010, the airline announced a change in position by denying any interest in joining an alliance, preferring to remain independent and to establish a "patchwork of code-sharing agreements."[12] Following this trend, on September 28, 2011 Gol and Aerolíneas Argentinas announced the intention to implement a codeshare, feeder and frequent flyer programs agreement on a date yet to be announced and pending approval from the governments of Brazil and Argentina.[13]
On March 18, 2010 Gol unveiled the expansion of its maintenance base located at Belo Horizonte/Confins - Tancredo Neves International Airport. Originally opened in 2006 with the capacity to service 60 aircraft per year (mainly Boeing 737 and 767), the expansion allowed Gol to increase the number to 120.[14] Gol later started also using the base to service aircraft from other airlines, and as of 2013 it also serviced airplanes from Azul Brazilian Airlines and Copa Airlines.[15][16]
On December 23, 2010, Gol Airlines started an operational partnership with Brazilian carrier Passaredo Linhas Aéreas. The agreement was rescinded on July 31, 2014, when Passaredo established a similar interline agreement with TAM Airlines instead.[17]
On December 7, 2011, Gol announced the intention of Delta Air Lines to purchase 3% of its shares.[18] The agreement also includes the creation of mutual code-share flights, alignment of frequent flyer benefits and transfer of Gol's Boeing 767s lease agreements to Delta.[19]
On October 1, 2012, Gol confirmed a firm order of 60 Boeing 737 MAXs. References did not specify the type of MAX aircraft.[20][21]
On October 6, 2012, Gol started seasonal operations to Miami and Orlando, available for Smiles account holders and originating in Brazil only. Technically, they are considered charter flights, although they are not necessarily part of an inclusive tour package; the use of miles or miles plus money is mandatory, as well as a minimum 7-day stay at the destination.[22]
On 23 January 2013, the Jet Airliner Crash Data Evaluation Centre (JACDEC) announced that Gol Airlines had the fourth worst safety record in the world. The ratings take into account the number and deadliness of the hull losses (destroyed airplanes) they have suffered in the past 30 years, how they have fared more recently, and how many flights they have flown without incident. The results do not take into account the cause of the hull losses, or whether the airline is at fault, so they are not a perfect measure of how safely an airline behaves. It should be noted that since Gol is a relatively young airline with only one hull loss, but with a large number of casualties (Flight 1907), that single fatal accident significantly affects the calculation.[23]
In February 2014, Air France–KLM announced it would invest $100 million in Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes in advance of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.[24]
Some disagreement exists as to whether Gol is a low-cost carrier. In 2014, Gol was ranked the second best low-cost airline in South America after Azul.[25] Gol refers to itself as a low-cost carrier, but it is increasingly not regarded as such. According to UFRJ specialist Elton Fernandes, "Gol's costs are not very different from those of TAM Airlines. People are accustomed to calling Gol low-cost, but Gol is not that. It is not even low-fare anymore."[26]
Purchase of Varig[edit]




Logo of the "new" VARIG brand


On March 28, 2007 Gol officially purchased part of the assets of VARIG - VRG Linhas Aéreas, informally known as the "new Varig," a new company that owned the Varig brand, for US$320 million from Volo Group and MatlinPatterson Global Opportunies hedge fund. At that time, the "old Varig" was under bankruptcy protection.
Gol announced that the Varig brand would continue doing business operating as such, rather than its official name VRG Linhas Aéreas.[27] The transaction, via its GTI subsidiary, required a US$98 million cash payment, with the balance through the allocation of non-voting shares to VARIG Logística and Volo, which had acquired VARIG in June 2006 for US$24 million.[28] The transaction did not involve the original airline, informally known as "old Varig," which continued to exist until its own bankruptcy in mid-2010 under the name Flex Linhas Aéreas.
In 2009 Gol was merged into VRG Linhas Aéreas. VRG Linhas Aéreas thus became an airline that operates two brands: Gol and Varig, although in reality flights are operated only under Gol flight numbers. Initially, the Varig brand operated to medium-haul scheduled and charter international destinations within South America and to the Caribbean with Boeing 737-700's configured in two classes, and to long-haul charter international destinations in North America, Europe and Africa with Boeing 767-300ERs configured in economy only. The latter were also used in wet-lease operations.[29] This scheme was later dropped. The brand Gol operates most of the flights of the network, and had aircraft configured in all-economy class, used for scheduled domestic and international operations within South America.
Because of contractual obligations, between 2006 and 2009 the "new Varig" (VRG Linhas Aéreas) was obliged to purchase a minimum of 140 hours/month of services from the "old Varig" (Flex Linhas Aéreas). Therefore, at that time, some of VRG Linhas Aéreas flights operated with Gol flight numbers but were actually flown with chartered aircraft from Flex Linhas Aéreas. The agreement ceased before the bankruptcy of Flex on August 20, 2010.[30]

Purchase of Webjet Linhas Aéreas[edit]
On July 9, 2011, VRG Linhas Aéreas, owner of the brands Gol and Varig, announced the intention to purchase full control of WebJet Linhas Aéreas.[31] The purchase contract was signed on August 2, 2011.[32] On October 10, 2012 the purchase received its final approval with some operational restrictions from the Brazilian regulatory agency.[33] Services were integrated but both companies continued to operate independently for some weeks.[34][35] Integration started on October 17, 2012 when sales requested via Webjet's web-portal started to be redirected to Gol's site.[36] However, on November 23, 2012 Webjet abruptly ceased to operate and all services were incorporated by Gol. The Webjet brand ceased to exist.[34][35] Gol also announced its intention to return all of Webjet's Boeing 737-300s to lessors until the end of the first quarter of 2013. There was no mention to the fate of Webjet's 737-800s.[37]

Airline Affinity Program[edit]
Smiles is Gol/Varig's Frequent-flyer program since July 20, 2006. Points can be used for services from Gol/Varig, and partners Aerolíneas Argentinas, Air France, Delta Air Lines, Iberia, KLM and Qatar Airways including flights, upgrades, holidays, hotel stays and car rentals. Smiles was part of the "new Varig" package bought by Gol, which honored all miles and eventually became its own frequent-flyer program. Previously Gol had no such program.
On a study conducted in 2011, Smiles ranked third among 24 chosen frequent flyer programs, with 97.1% success of requests made.[44]
In 2013, Smiles was spun off as an independent company [45] eventually leading to its IPO at BOVESPA in April 2013.[46]
Incidents and accidents[edit]

On September 29, 2006, Flight 1907 operated by Boeing 737-800 SFP registration PR-GTD, disappeared from radar while flying over the central-western state of Mato Grosso en route from Manaus to Brasília and Rio de Janeiro-Galeão. The aircraft collided in mid-air with an Embraer Legacy 600 business jet, registration N600XL, near the town of Matupá, 470 miles (760 km) south of Manaus. The Gol aircraft crashed in the Amazon jungle, leaving no survivors among its 154 occupants. The wreckage was found a day later. The Legacy jet landed safely at Cachimbo Airport, part of the Brigadeiro Velloso Test Range of the Brazilian Air Force, with damage to the tail and left winglet.[47]

Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A ("Gol Intelligent Airlines S.A." also known as VRG Linhas Aéreas S/A) BM&F Bovespa: GOLL3, GOLL4 / NYSE: GOL is a Brazilian airline based in São Paulo, Brazil.[1] According to the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil (ANAC), between January and December 2015 Gol had 35.9% of the domestic and 13.6% of the international market shares in terms of passengers per kilometer flown,[2] making it the largest low-cost airline in South America and the second largest Brazilian airline company by market share and fleet size, after LATAM Brasil. Gol competes in Brazil and other South American countries with Chilean LATAM Airlines Group, Brazilian Azul and Colombia-based Avianca Holdings S.A. It also owns the brand Varig, although now that name refers to what is informally known as the "new" Varig, founded in 2006, not to the extinct "old" Varig airline, founded in 1927.
Gol operates a growing domestic and international scheduled network. Its main hubs are São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport, Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport and Tancredo Neves International Airport near Belo Horizonte. Gol also has focus operations at Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont Airport, São Paulo-Congonhas Airport, Salgado Filho International Airport in Porto Alegre Gol refers to itself as Gol Intelligent Airlines[3] (Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes in Portuguese) as a slogan. The company is traded on the New York Stock Exchange as "GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A."[4]
The company's name is a Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish word borrowing from the English word "goal" from Association football.[5]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]

The airline was established in 2000 and started operations on January 15, 2001 with a flight from Brasília to São Paulo.[6] It is a subsidiary of the Brazilian conglomerate Grupo Áurea, based in Minas Gerais state, which has other transportation interests, including Brazil's largest long-distance bus company. Grupo Áurea in turn is owned by the Constantino family. Constantino Júnior was responsible for building the business next to the vice president of the company, David Barioni.[7][8]
On June 24, 2004 Gol launched simultaneous initial public offerings on the New York and São Paulo stock exchanges. In 2007, Gol was owned by AeroPar Participações (75.5%), Venture (17.6%), American International Group (5.4%) and Air France-KLM (1,5%).[9] The growth in Gol's stock price made the Constantino family a member of the Forbes magazine billionaire list in 2005.
In 2007, Gol was supposed to begin a code-share agreement with TAP Portugal, opening the European market to the Brazilian airline, and the internal Brazilian market to the Portuguese airline (the largest foreign airline in Brazil). Instead, TAP Portugal chose to cooperate with TAM Airlines (TAM Linhas Aéreas).[10]
On February 24, 2010 Gol announced to be in "advanced talks" to join Oneworld alliance,[11] which would allow it to catch up with rival TAM, a recent member of Star Alliance. However, on October 6, 2010, the airline announced a change in position by denying any interest in joining an alliance, preferring to remain independent and to establish a "patchwork of code-sharing agreements."[12] Following this trend, on September 28, 2011 Gol and Aerolíneas Argentinas announced the intention to implement a codeshare, feeder and frequent flyer programs agreement on a date yet to be announced and pending approval from the governments of Brazil and Argentina.[13]
On March 18, 2010 Gol unveiled the expansion of its maintenance base located at Belo Horizonte/Confins - Tancredo Neves International Airport. Originally opened in 2006 with the capacity to service 60 aircraft per year (mainly Boeing 737 and 767), the expansion allowed Gol to increase the number to 120.[14] Gol later started also using the base to service aircraft from other airlines, and as of 2013 it also serviced airplanes from Azul Brazilian Airlines and Copa Airlines.[15][16]
On December 23, 2010, Gol Airlines started an operational partnership with Brazilian carrier Passaredo Linhas Aéreas. The agreement was rescinded on July 31, 2014, when Passaredo established a similar interline agreement with TAM Airlines instead.[17]
On December 7, 2011, Gol announced the intention of Delta Air Lines to purchase 3% of its shares.[18] The agreement also includes the creation of mutual code-share flights, alignment of frequent flyer benefits and transfer of Gol's Boeing 767s lease agreements to Delta.[19]
On October 1, 2012, Gol confirmed a firm order of 60 Boeing 737 MAXs. References did not specify the type of MAX aircraft.[20][21]
On October 6, 2012, Gol started seasonal operations to Miami and Orlando, available for Smiles account holders and originating in Brazil only. Technically, they are considered charter flights, although they are not necessarily part of an inclusive tour package; the use of miles or miles plus money is mandatory, as well as a minimum 7-day stay at the destination.[22]
On 23 January 2013, the Jet Airliner Crash Data Evaluation Centre (JACDEC) announced that Gol Airlines had the fourth worst safety record in the world. The ratings take into account the number and deadliness of the hull losses (destroyed airplanes) they have suffered in the past 30 years, how they have fared more recently, and how many flights they have flown without incident. The results do not take into account the cause of the hull losses, or whether the airline is at fault, so they are not a perfect measure of how safely an airline behaves. It should be noted that since Gol is a relatively young airline with only one hull loss, but with a large number of casualties (Flight 1907), that single fatal accident significantly affects the calculation.[23]
In February 2014, Air France–KLM announced it would invest $100 million in Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes in advance of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.[24]
Some disagreement exists as to whether Gol is a low-cost carrier. In 2014, Gol was ranked the second best low-cost airline in South America after Azul.[25] Gol refers to itself as a low-cost carrier, but it is increasingly not regarded as such. According to UFRJ specialist Elton Fernandes, "Gol's costs are not very different from those of TAM Airlines. People are accustomed to calling Gol low-cost, but Gol is not that. It is not even low-fare anymore."[26]
Purchase of Varig[edit]




Logo of the "new" VARIG brand


On March 28, 2007 Gol officially purchased part of the assets of VARIG - VRG Linhas Aéreas, informally known as the "new Varig," a new company that owned the Varig brand, for US$320 million from Volo Group and MatlinPatterson Global Opportunies hedge fund. At that time, the "old Varig" was under bankruptcy protection.
Gol announced that the Varig brand would continue doing business operating as such, rather than its official name VRG Linhas Aéreas.[27] The transaction, via its GTI subsidiary, required a US$98 million cash payment, with the balance through the allocation of non-voting shares to VARIG Logística and Volo, which had acquired VARIG in June 2006 for US$24 million.[28] The transaction did not involve the original airline, informally known as "old Varig," which continued to exist until its own bankruptcy in mid-2010 under the name Flex Linhas Aéreas.
In 2009 Gol was merged into VRG Linhas Aéreas. VRG Linhas Aéreas thus became an airline that operates two brands: Gol and Varig, although in reality flights are operated only under Gol flight numbers. Initially, the Varig brand operated to medium-haul scheduled and charter international destinations within South America and to the Caribbean with Boeing 737-700's configured in two classes, and to long-haul charter international destinations in North America, Europe and Africa with Boeing 767-300ERs configured in economy only. The latter were also used in wet-lease operations.[29] This scheme was later dropped. The brand Gol operates most of the flights of the network, and had aircraft configured in all-economy class, used for scheduled domestic and international operations within South America.
Because of contractual obligations, between 2006 and 2009 the "new Varig" (VRG Linhas Aéreas) was obliged to purchase a minimum of 140 hours/month of services from the "old Varig" (Flex Linhas Aéreas). Therefore, at that time, some of VRG Linhas Aéreas flights operated with Gol flight numbers but were actually flown with chartered aircraft from Flex Linhas Aéreas. The agreement ceased before the bankruptcy of Flex on August 20, 2010.[30]

Purchase of Webjet Linhas Aéreas[edit]
On July 9, 2011, VRG Linhas Aéreas, owner of the brands Gol and Varig, announced the intention to purchase full control of WebJet Linhas Aéreas.[31] The purchase contract was signed on August 2, 2011.[32] On October 10, 2012 the purchase received its final approval with some operational restrictions from the Brazilian regulatory agency.[33] Services were integrated but both companies continued to operate independently for some weeks.[34][35] Integration started on October 17, 2012 when sales requested via Webjet's web-portal started to be redirected to Gol's site.[36] However, on November 23, 2012 Webjet abruptly ceased to operate and all services were incorporated by Gol. The Webjet brand ceased to exist.[34][35] Gol also announced its intention to return all of Webjet's Boeing 737-300s to lessors until the end of the first quarter of 2013. There was no mention to the fate of Webjet's 737-800s.[37]

Airline Affinity Program[edit]
Smiles is Gol/Varig's Frequent-flyer program since July 20, 2006. Points can be used for services from Gol/Varig, and partners Aerolíneas Argentinas, Air France, Delta Air Lines, Iberia, KLM and Qatar Airways including flights, upgrades, holidays, hotel stays and car rentals. Smiles was part of the "new Varig" package bought by Gol, which honored all miles and eventually became its own frequent-flyer program. Previously Gol had no such program.
On a study conducted in 2011, Smiles ranked third among 24 chosen frequent flyer programs, with 97.1% success of requests made.[44]
In 2013, Smiles was spun off as an independent company [45] eventually leading to its IPO at BOVESPA in April 2013.[46]
Incidents and accidents[edit]

On September 29, 2006, Flight 1907 operated by Boeing 737-800 SFP registration PR-GTD, disappeared from radar while flying over the central-western state of Mato Grosso en route from Manaus to Brasília and Rio de Janeiro-Galeão. The aircraft collided in mid-air with an Embraer Legacy 600 business jet, registration N600XL, near the town of Matupá, 470 miles (760 km) south of Manaus. The Gol aircraft crashed in the Amazon jungle, leaving no survivors among its 154 occupants. The wreckage was found a day later. The Legacy jet landed safely at Cachimbo Airport, part of the Brigadeiro Velloso Test Range of the Brazilian Air Force, with damage to the tail and left winglet.[47]

Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A ("Gol Intelligent Airlines S.A." also known as VRG Linhas Aéreas S/A) BM&F Bovespa: GOLL3, GOLL4 / NYSE: GOL is a Brazilian airline based in São Paulo, Brazil.[1] According to the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil (ANAC), between January and December 2015 Gol had 35.9% of the domestic and 13.6% of the international market shares in terms of passengers per kilometer flown,[2] making it the largest low-cost airline in South America and the second largest Brazilian airline company by market share and fleet size, after LATAM Brasil. Gol competes in Brazil and other South American countries with Chilean LATAM Airlines Group, Brazilian Azul and Colombia-based Avianca Holdings S.A. It also owns the brand Varig, although now that name refers to what is informally known as the "new" Varig, founded in 2006, not to the extinct "old" Varig airline, founded in 1927.
Gol operates a growing domestic and international scheduled network. Its main hubs are São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport, Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport and Tancredo Neves International Airport near Belo Horizonte. Gol also has focus operations at Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont Airport, São Paulo-Congonhas Airport, Salgado Filho International Airport in Porto Alegre Gol refers to itself as Gol Intelligent Airlines[3] (Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes in Portuguese) as a slogan. The company is traded on the New York Stock Exchange as "GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes S.A."[4]
The company's name is a Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish word borrowing from the English word "goal" from Association football.[5]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]

The airline was established in 2000 and started operations on January 15, 2001 with a flight from Brasília to São Paulo.[6] It is a subsidiary of the Brazilian conglomerate Grupo Áurea, based in Minas Gerais state, which has other transportation interests, including Brazil's largest long-distance bus company. Grupo Áurea in turn is owned by the Constantino family. Constantino Júnior was responsible for building the business next to the vice president of the company, David Barioni.[7][8]
On June 24, 2004 Gol launched simultaneous initial public offerings on the New York and São Paulo stock exchanges. In 2007, Gol was owned by AeroPar Participações (75.5%), Venture (17.6%), American International Group (5.4%) and Air France-KLM (1,5%).[9] The growth in Gol's stock price made the Constantino family a member of the Forbes magazine billionaire list in 2005.
In 2007, Gol was supposed to begin a code-share agreement with TAP Portugal, opening the European market to the Brazilian airline, and the internal Brazilian market to the Portuguese airline (the largest foreign airline in Brazil). Instead, TAP Portugal chose to cooperate with TAM Airlines (TAM Linhas Aéreas).[10]
On February 24, 2010 Gol announced to be in "advanced talks" to join Oneworld alliance,[11] which would allow it to catch up with rival TAM, a recent member of Star Alliance. However, on October 6, 2010, the airline announced a change in position by denying any interest in joining an alliance, preferring to remain independent and to establish a "patchwork of code-sharing agreements."[12] Following this trend, on September 28, 2011 Gol and Aerolíneas Argentinas announced the intention to implement a codeshare, feeder and frequent flyer programs agreement on a date yet to be announced and pending approval from the governments of Brazil and Argentina.[13]
On March 18, 2010 Gol unveiled the expansion of its maintenance base located at Belo Horizonte/Confins - Tancredo Neves International Airport. Originally opened in 2006 with the capacity to service 60 aircraft per year (mainly Boeing 737 and 767), the expansion allowed Gol to increase the number to 120.[14] Gol later started also using the base to service aircraft from other airlines, and as of 2013 it also serviced airplanes from Azul Brazilian Airlines and Copa Airlines.[15][16]
On December 23, 2010, Gol Airlines started an operational partnership with Brazilian carrier Passaredo Linhas Aéreas. The agreement was rescinded on July 31, 2014, when Passaredo established a similar interline agreement with TAM Airlines instead.[17]
On December 7, 2011, Gol announced the intention of Delta Air Lines to purchase 3% of its shares.[18] The agreement also includes the creation of mutual code-share flights, alignment of frequent flyer benefits and transfer of Gol's Boeing 767s lease agreements to Delta.[19]
On October 1, 2012, Gol confirmed a firm order of 60 Boeing 737 MAXs. References did not specify the type of MAX aircraft.[20][21]
On October 6, 2012, Gol started seasonal operations to Miami and Orlando, available for Smiles account holders and originating in Brazil only. Technically, they are considered charter flights, although they are not necessarily part of an inclusive tour package; the use of miles or miles plus money is mandatory, as well as a minimum 7-day stay at the destination.[22]
On 23 January 2013, the Jet Airliner Crash Data Evaluation Centre (JACDEC) announced that Gol Airlines had the fourth worst safety record in the world. The ratings take into account the number and deadliness of the hull losses (destroyed airplanes) they have suffered in the past 30 years, how they have fared more recently, and how many flights they have flown without incident. The results do not take into account the cause of the hull losses, or whether the airline is at fault, so they are not a perfect measure of how safely an airline behaves. It should be noted that since Gol is a relatively young airline with only one hull loss, but with a large number of casualties (Flight 1907), that single fatal accident significantly affects the calculation.[23]
In February 2014, Air France–KLM announced it would invest $100 million in Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes in advance of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.[24]
Some disagreement exists as to whether Gol is a low-cost carrier. In 2014, Gol was ranked the second best low-cost airline in South America after Azul.[25] Gol refers to itself as a low-cost carrier, but it is increasingly not regarded as such. According to UFRJ specialist Elton Fernandes, "Gol's costs are not very different from those of TAM Airlines. People are accustomed to calling Gol low-cost, but Gol is not that. It is not even low-fare anymore."[26]
Purchase of Varig[edit]




Logo of the "new" VARIG brand


On March 28, 2007 Gol officially purchased part of the assets of VARIG - VRG Linhas Aéreas, informally known as the "new Varig," a new company that owned the Varig brand, for US$320 million from Volo Group and MatlinPatterson Global Opportunies hedge fund. At that time, the "old Varig" was under bankruptcy protection.
Gol announced that the Varig brand would continue doing business operating as such, rather than its official name VRG Linhas Aéreas.[27] The transaction, via its GTI subsidiary, required a US$98 million cash payment, with the balance through the allocation of non-voting shares to VARIG Logística and Volo, which had acquired VARIG in June 2006 for US$24 million.[28] The transaction did not involve the original airline, informally known as "old Varig," which continued to exist until its own bankruptcy in mid-2010 under the name Flex Linhas Aéreas.
In 2009 Gol was merged into VRG Linhas Aéreas. VRG Linhas Aéreas thus became an airline that operates two brands: Gol and Varig, although in reality flights are operated only under Gol flight numbers. Initially, the Varig brand operated to medium-haul scheduled and charter international destinations within South America and to the Caribbean with Boeing 737-700's configured in two classes, and to long-haul charter international destinations in North America, Europe and Africa with Boeing 767-300ERs configured in economy only. The latter were also used in wet-lease operations.[29] This scheme was later dropped. The brand Gol operates most of the flights of the network, and had aircraft configured in all-economy class, used for scheduled domestic and international operations within South America.
Because of contractual obligations, between 2006 and 2009 the "new Varig" (VRG Linhas Aéreas) was obliged to purchase a minimum of 140 hours/month of services from the "old Varig" (Flex Linhas Aéreas). Therefore, at that time, some of VRG Linhas Aéreas flights operated with Gol flight numbers but were actually flown with chartered aircraft from Flex Linhas Aéreas. The agreement ceased before the bankruptcy of Flex on August 20, 2010.[30]

Purchase of Webjet Linhas Aéreas[edit]
On July 9, 2011, VRG Linhas Aéreas, owner of the brands Gol and Varig, announced the intention to purchase full control of WebJet Linhas Aéreas.[31] The purchase contract was signed on August 2, 2011.[32] On October 10, 2012 the purchase received its final approval with some operational restrictions from the Brazilian regulatory agency.[33] Services were integrated but both companies continued to operate independently for some weeks.[34][35] Integration started on October 17, 2012 when sales requested via Webjet's web-portal started to be redirected to Gol's site.[36] However, on November 23, 2012 Webjet abruptly ceased to operate and all services were incorporated by Gol. The Webjet brand ceased to exist.[34][35] Gol also announced its intention to return all of Webjet's Boeing 737-300s to lessors until the end of the first quarter of 2013. There was no mention to the fate of Webjet's 737-800s.[37]

Airline Affinity Program[edit]
Smiles is Gol/Varig's Frequent-flyer program since July 20, 2006. Points can be used for services from Gol/Varig, and partners Aerolíneas Argentinas, Air France, Delta Air Lines, Iberia, KLM and Qatar Airways including flights, upgrades, holidays, hotel stays and car rentals. Smiles was part of the "new Varig" package bought by Gol, which honored all miles and eventually became its own frequent-flyer program. Previously Gol had no such program.
On a study conducted in 2011, Smiles ranked third among 24 chosen frequent flyer programs, with 97.1% success of requests made.[44]
In 2013, Smiles was spun off as an independent company [45] eventually leading to its IPO at BOVESPA in April 2013.[46]
Incidents and accidents[edit]

On September 29, 2006, Flight 1907 operated by Boeing 737-800 SFP registration PR-GTD, disappeared from radar while flying over the central-western state of Mato Grosso en route from Manaus to Brasília and Rio de Janeiro-Galeão. The aircraft collided in mid-air with an Embraer Legacy 600 business jet, registration N600XL, near the town of Matupá, 470 miles (760 km) south of Manaus. The Gol aircraft crashed in the Amazon jungle, leaving no survivors among its 154 occupants. The wreckage was found a day later. The Legacy jet landed safely at Cachimbo Airport, part of the Brigadeiro Velloso Test Range of the Brazilian Air Force, with damage to the tail and left winglet.[47]
