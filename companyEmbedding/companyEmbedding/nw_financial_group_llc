Underwriting
Our trading desk is managed by a 30- year veteran of the municipal bond industry with vast experience in the distribution of State, authority, and local government bonds. Our desk maintains trading relationships with dozens of institutional and retail customers. As an active underwriter in the Northeast, NW commits its capital to purchase each and every transaction. NW sells bonds and notes directly as a manager or co-manager on negotiated transactions and we are a very active bidder on competitive bond transactions. We also buy and trade everyday for our own account in the secondary market.
The utilization of today’s high tech, internet based communications allows us to distribute bonds through electronic platforms and communications to a multitude of buyers thus avoiding the high overhead and distribution costs associated with operating satellite offices. This allows us to pass these savings back to the issuer in the form of lower interest rates or lower underwriting spreads.

Structured Products
The use of derivatives in the municipal finance sector  has moved well beyond traditional synthetic fixed rate financings to complex structures that require more than the ability to input a structure into pricing models.
NW Financial has served as Financial Advisor on over $5 billion in notional value of swap transactions. We have advised clients on a broad variety of swaps and our ability to model market sensitive conditions has resulted in millions of dollars of savings for our governmental clients.
The types of transactions on which we have advised include:

Replacement swaps, including upfront termination payments made by the new provider;
Constant maturity swaps, including terminations for a profit;
Trigger swaps, where the client selects one percentage of LIBOR until LIBOR reaches a target rate and then converts to a different percentage; a useful tool in rising interest rate environments;
Dual index swaps, where the client is paid the higher of SIFMA or LIBOR indexed amount;
Swap termination negotiations;
Forward starting swaps;
Swaptions;
Forward bond refundings, with upfront savings payments; and
Renegotiated swaps to shorten or lengthen the tenor.

We have also assisted our swap clients in analyzing and evaluating their swap portfolio including:
Swap Termination Opportunity
NW Financial was among the first to identify a swap termination opportunity that resulted in savings on interest costs by choosing to issue fixed rate debt to replace the SWAP rather than to renew high cost letters of credit that supported variable rate demand bonds on the short end of the yield curve. NW Financial’s constant market monitoring identified this opportunity early, including pricing the cost of terminating related swap transactions, which helped our client not only achieve debt service savings but also improves its credit rating profile from a swap exposure and rate risk point of view.
Swap Payment Suspension
NW Financial recently assisted a client’s staff in their evaluation of the benefits of suspending payments on their constant maturity swaps, which had a significant positive mark to market, in order to capture that benefit and reduce risk for a period of years.
NW Financial has extensive experience with complex derivative products.
NW Financial has extensive experience with complex derivative products
NW Financial has executed over $2.5 billion of swaps and derivatives on behalf of its clients, but has also rejected over $10 billion in proposed transactions that were not in the client’s best interest. We have also undertaken extensive sensitivity analysis for our clients on market movements and basis risk prior to recommending a particular product. NW Financial utilizes both proprietary and non-proprietary models to test trade pricing and assure market transparency. Our software includes the Black 76 model for pricing products such as options and swaptions. As a result of our in-depth analysis we have been able to identify “hidden” profit components in the proposals that were not known to the proposers investment banking staff, including internally adjusted “vol” pricing and off market discount rates. We have also been able to negotiate flexibility into trades, such as “greater than” payments when leaving one index and moving to another (e.g. monthly to constant maturity). As part of our advisory role we provide a Fairness Opinion, analysis of impact on bond yield, post pricing report and monthly portfolio monitoring.

Stern Brothers & Co., founded in 1917, is a national investment bank headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri.  The firm is wholly woman owned and certified as a Woman Business Enterprise (WBE).  Stern Brothers is committed to having a team of experienced bankers who have expertise in structuring innovative financings that serve client needs. Stern Brothers is the largest woman owned remarketing agent in the U.S. with a portfolio of over $3.5 Billion.
The agreement in principal calls for the professionals of NW Capital Markets and NW Financial to become employees of Stern Brothers & Co.  Dennis Enright, Principal of NW will be named Vice Chairman and have a seat on the Stern Brothers & Co. Board of Directors. NW's other Principals -- Dan Mariniello, Michael Hanley and Doug Bacher-- will be Managing Directors and serve on the firm's management committee.
The combination is subject to due diligence and final documentation.  Both firms will continue to serve their clients independently until the combination is finalized.
