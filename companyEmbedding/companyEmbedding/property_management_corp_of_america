ABOUT
OUR FOCUS IS TO PROVIDE EXCEPTIONAL, PERSONALIZED SERVICES




    Realty Advisors, Ltd. and Property Corporation of America’s background stems from the experiences of its founder and President, Howard Silver. 
    Mr. Silver’s background stems from real estate finance and development.  After graduating college, he became a CPA with his first experience being at a public accounting firm that specialized in real estate.   
From there he went into the real estate development field, where he was a corporate officer for a premier Chicago area developer having major commercial projects in the suburbs and with it’s crowning development being a 58-story mixed use building at Michigan and Oak Streets in Chicago.  With the upper floors as luxury condominium units, he had his first experience at setting up and running an association.  Given the price-points of the units and the renown of the residents, it was there that he learned about the importance of pleasing owners.
Mr. Silver then became a corporate officer of what was then the second largest homebuilder in the Midwest.  With that company, he developed entire single-family communities in the Chicago suburbs and condominiums in the South Loop.  The company also owned and managed other residential and commercial properties.
It was in 1990 that Realty Advisors, Ltd. was formed; that is the parent company of Property Corporation of America.  Since then, our company has been managing associations and rental properties.    We currently have properties in our management portfolio with locations from the Chicago lakefront and north side to the near west and north suburbs.
Howard Silver also has another real estate related job.  For the past twenty-four years, Howard has been a member of the Glenview Plan Commission, having been its chairman for the past seven years.  He was also chairman of the Glenview Naval Air Station [a/k/a “The Glen”] Redevelopment Commission.  With this continuing service, Howard brings a keen knowledge of community development to the company’s professional management abilities.  He understands well the workings of municipal government and is able to be a liaison between residents and their town in matters of development and village services.  
In addition, his chairmanship requires him to run effective meetings with, in many of our cases, having to balance the desires of two groups of diverse opinions while still following the requirements of the established ordinances and laws.  This might sound like a familiar scenario for anyone that has ever attended association meetings.  His experience enables him to coordinate a consensus based on laws, regulations, and mutual fairness.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including, without limitation, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains "forward-looking statements." The forward-looking information is based on various factors and was derived using numerous assumptions. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that we intend, expect, project, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based upon certain assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of their experience and their perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors they believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are usually accompanied by words such as "believe," "anticipate," "plan," "seek," "expect," "intend" and similar expressions.  Forward-looking statements necessarily involve risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. These factors as well as other cautionary statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, should be read and understood as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear herein. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent our judgment as of the date hereof. We encourage you to read those descriptions carefully. We caution you not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this report. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of the date of this report (unless an earlier date is indicated) and we undertake no obligation to update or revise the statements except as required by federal securities law. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results will likely differ, perhaps materially, from those suggested by such forward-looking statements. In this report, the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Property Management Corporation of America.  Overview  Property Management Corporation of America offers management and consulting services to residential and commercial real estate property owners who rent or lease their property to third party tenants. The Company currently has two management services agreements, one with Marsh Road LLC (Bealeton, Virginia) and one with Main Street Heritage LLC (Marshall, Virginia), both residential and commercial properties. Our two executive officers and directors together have a 55% ownership interest in these initial properties.  We intend to expand our services in 2015 and 2016 and execute additional management services agreements with other residential and commercial property owners over the next several months. Our initial expansion and growth plans include establishing satellite offices in counties contiguous with Fauquier County, Virginia and eventually statewide.  We offer exceptional customer service and very competitive pricing, which we believe sets us apart from other property management companies. As we grow, we plan to add additional employees with specific skills to enhance our service offerings. We believe the in-house skill set will enable us to enhance our profitability as we will not need to sub-contract these services.  Additionally, management has been reviewing and considering other business opportunities in industries outside of the property management industry.  Results of Operations  Three Month Period Ended August 31, 2015 Compared to the Three Month Period Ended August 31, 2014  Revenue  We recorded $3,607 in revenue from operations for the three month period ended August 31, 2015 compared to $3,586 for the three month period ended August 31, 2014. The increase of $21 reflects our higher management fee as a result of increased rents at the properties under management.  Our main source of revenue is derived from our management service agreements, currently with two clients, both of which are affiliated with our directors and officers. It is our intention in the short term to seek to add additional third party clients. Management believes the local market is underserved and property management companies such as ours can successfully add new clients.  Cost of revenue  We recorded $1,623 in cost of revenue for the three month period ended August 31, 2015 compared to $1,614 for the three month period ended August 31, 2014. The increase of $9 reflects increased fees for our sub-contracted services.  Since our inception, cost of revenue has consisted of direct costs associated with the delivery of services under our management service agreements, primarily sub-contractor costs. Other costs that will be associated with our cost of revenue in the future are materials needed to freshen up rentable space, printing, equipment rental such as carpet cleaning devices, and insurance.  Operating expenses  We recorded $11,833 in operating expenses for the three month period ended August 31, 2015 compared to $28,396 for the three month period ended August 31, 2014. The decrease of $16,563 reflects the normalizing of operating expenses after our initial public filing.  Our startup phase operating expenses consisted primarily of professional fees and administrative expenses. Future operating expenses will consist of indirect personnel costs, including fringe benefits, insurance and facility costs, travel and entertainment, depreciation and amortization, marketing and sales, professional services such as legal and accounting, and other general and administrative costs.  Six Month Period Ended August 31, 2015 Compared to the Six Month Period Ended August 31, 2014  Revenue  We recorded $7,271 in revenue from operations for the six month period ended August 31, 2015 compared to $7,173 for the six month period ended August 31, 2014. The increase of $98 reflects our higher management fee as a result of increased rents at the properties under management.  Our main source of revenue is derived from our management service agreements, currently with two clients, both of which are affiliated with our directors and officers. It is our intention in the short term to seek to add additional third party clients. Management believes the local market is underserved and property management companies such as ours can successfully add new clients.  Cost of revenue  We recorded $3,231 in cost of revenue for the six month period ended August 31, 2015 compared to $3,228 for the six month period ended August 31, 2014. The increase of $3 reflects increased fees for our sub-contracted services.  Since our inception, cost of revenue has consisted of direct costs associated with the delivery of services under our management service agreements, primarily sub-contractor costs. Other costs that will be associated with our cost of revenue in the future are materials needed to freshen up rentable space, printing, equipment rental such as carpet cleaning devices, and insurance.  Operating expenses  We recorded $19,312 in operating expenses for the six month period ended August 31, 2015 compared to $57,940 for the six month period ended August 31, 2014. The decrease of $38,628 reflects the normalizing of operating expenses after our initial public filing.  Our startup phase operating expenses consisted primarily of professional fees and administrative expenses. Future operating expenses will consist of indirect personnel costs, including fringe benefits, insurance and facility costs, travel and entertainment, depreciation and amortization, marketing and sales, professional services such as legal and accounting, and other general and administrative costs.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  From January 23, 2014 (inception) through August 31, 2015, we relied on funds loaned to us by Washington Capital Advisors LLC, a company controlled by C. Thomas McMillen, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Those loans were in the cumulative amount of $63,500 and were used to fund our working capital requirements. On July 29, 2014, we repaid Washington Capital Advisors $40,000, including interest and principal, from funds received from the sale of our common stock, which totaled $50,350 (see below). At August 31, 2015, the outstanding loan amount due Washington Capital Advisors was $23,959, including accrued interest of $459.  Washington Capital Advisors has agreed to loan us additional amounts of up to a total of $50,000 (inclusive of the currently outstanding loan amount). See Note  We completed our public offering on July 28, 2014. We used the proceeds of this offering, after the repayment of a portion of our working capital loans, to expand our company, primarily in our marketing efforts and for general working capital purposes. We will need to raise additional capital to carry out our business plan. We believe that our additional capital needs will be approximately $150,000 over the next 18 months to fully carry out our business plan. We expect to raise these additional funds through the issuance of debt obligations and private placements of our Common Stock; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or if we are able to raise additional capital that the terms will be acceptable to us. We do not currently have any agreements or understandings with any potential financing sources, other than Washington Capital Advisors, and we have not identified any other potential lenders to provide capital.  On June 22, 2015, the Company completed the sale of 300,000 shares of its Common Stock through three (3) private placements of 100,000 shares each. The Company received $15,000 dollars in proceeds from this sale ($0.05/share). The shares were sold privately as unregistered shares, subject to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  Our current expansion and growth plans include establishing satellite offices in counties contiguous to Fauquier County, Virginia during 2015 and eventually statewide throughout 2016. Initially, we will seek to establish these offices in properties that we manage or alternatively focus on geographic areas we identify as in need of our services. This expansion will require additional capital. We plan to raise this additional capital through debt obligations and private placements of our Common Stock. Failure to raise additional capital will lengthen the time and decrease the scope of our expansion and growth plans.  Also, management has considered exploring businesses opportunities outside of our current industry focus. If the Company were to find a business opportunity outside of the property management industry, management believes that additional funding would still be necessary in order for the Company to take advantage of any given opportunity.  The Company had cash on hand of $1,652 at August 31, 2015. Our primary needs for cash are to fund and grow our ongoing operations. However, we will require additional capital to fully carry out our business plan.  During the six months ended August 31, 2015, the Company had a net increase in cash of $622. The Company's sources and uses of cash were as follows:  Cash Flows From Operating Activities  We used net cash of $20,378 in our operating activities during the six months ended August 31, 2015, consisting of a net loss of $6,971, increased by net uses of cash totaling $13,407 due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities.  Cash Flows From Financing Activities  We provided net cash of $21,000 in our financing activities during the six months ended August 31, 2015 consisting of the proceeds from the sale of our common stock of 15,000 increased by proceeds from loans to us from Washington Capital Advisors of $6,000.  As of August 31, 2015, the Company had negative working capital of $31,494.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  The Company was not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements during the six months ended August 31, 2015.  Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices  The Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application. Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company's significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles.  Fiscal Year End  The Company elected February 28th as its fiscal year end date upon its formation.  Use of Estimates and Assumptions and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date(s) of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period(s).  Critical accounting estimates are estimates for which: a. the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and b. the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. The Company's critical accounting estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements were:  (i) Assumption as a going concern: Management assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  These significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.  Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Related Parties  The Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.  Pursuant to Section 850-10-20 the related parties include (a.) affiliates of the Company; (b.) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825-10-15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; (c.) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; (d.) principal owners of the Company; (e.) management of the Company; (f.) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and (g.) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.  The financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: (a.) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; (b.) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; (c.) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and (d.) amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.  Commitment and Contingencies  The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.  If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company's financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.  Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.  Revenue Recognition  The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.  Earnings per Share  Earnings per share ("EPS") is the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience, the term is used to refer to either earnings or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16 Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options or warrants.  Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-45-21 through 260-10-45-45-23 Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and their equivalents) issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method unless the provisions of paragraphs 260-10-45-35 through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied. Equivalents of options and warrants include non-vested stock granted to employees, stock purchase contracts, and partially paid stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260-10-55-23). Anti-dilutive contracts, such as purchased put options and purchased call options, shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the treasury stock method:  There were no potentially dilutive common shares outstanding for the reporting period ended November 30, 2014.  Cash Flows Reporting  The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method ("Indirect Method") as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a.) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b.) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  Subsequent Events  The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" ("ASU 2014-09").  This guidance amends the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification, creating a new Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customer.The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps:  1. Identify the contract(s) with the customer,  2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract,  3. Determine the transaction price,  4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and  5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligations.  The ASU also provides guidance on disclosures that should be provided to enable financial statement users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue recognition and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative information is required about the following:  1. Contracts with customers - including revenue and impairments recognized, disaggregation of revenue, and information about contract balances and performance obligations (including the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations),  2. Significant judgments and changes in judgments - determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations (over time or at a point in time), and determining the transaction price and amounts allocated to performance obligations, and  3. Assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period for all public entities. Early application is not permitted.  In August 2014, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 "Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40):  In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity's management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Management's evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are . . .

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following information should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and the Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operation and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute "forward-looking statements."  Recent Developments  In April, May and December 2015 and in February 2016, we entered into discussions to provide property management services to six (6) additional properties consisting of a total of three (3) commercial units and three (3) properties with fifty eight (58) residential units. All the additional properties under discussion are properties that are owned, in part, by Messer's McMillen and Brigante. Four (4) of these properties are located in Warren County, Virginia and two (2) of the properties is located in Fauquier County, Virginia. As of the date of this filing final agreements have not yet been reached.  In September 2015, Mr. McMillen, our then President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors resigned his positions of President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. McMillen's resignations as an officer of the Company had the effect of removing him for the daily operations of the Company. Mr. McMillen remains the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Also in September 2015, Mr. Brigante, our current Chief Financial Officer, was appointed to the position of President and is the acting Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  In January 2016, the Company initiated a Private Placement of up to 500,000 Units consisting of two (2) shares of the Company's Common Stock and a Common Stock warrant to purchase one share of the Company's Common Stock. The Units are priced at $0.50 each and the warrant is exercisable for three (3) years after the subscription date for $0.75. The Company hopes to raise up to $250,000 to investigate the possibility of entering the on-line real estate investment industry. This industry, known to some as real estate crowd funding, has been popularized over the last couple of years and has attracted a just few companies. Management believes this sector is underserved and lacks a regional company to consolidate funding opportunities. Additionally, management believes it can use its property management services to serve properties acquired through on-line funding.  Overview  Property Management Corporation of America was incorporated in Delaware on January 23, 2014. Our principal executive office is located at 4174 Old Stockyard Road, Suite F, Marshall, Virginia 20115. Our main telephone number is  We offer management and consulting services to residential and commercial real estate property owners who rent or lease their property to third party tenants. Our services are currently offered in Fauquier County, Virginia, but it is our intention to expand our services statewide. We currently manage two properties in Fauquier County, Virginia, which include residential and commercial space, and our recurring monthly revenues from these properties are approximately $1,120. Messer's McMillen and Brigante, our Chairman, and President and CFO, respectively, and our two directors, have a combined 55% ownership interest in these properties. We expect to sign management services and consulting contracts with other, non-affiliated, residential and commercial property owners over the next several months.  Our expansion and growth plans for the future include establishing satellite offices in counties contiguous with Fauquier County, Virginia and eventually statewide. We offer exceptional customer service and very competitive pricing, which we believe sets us apart from other property management companies. As we grow, we plan to add additional employees with specific skills to enhance our service offerings. We believe the in-house skill set will enable us to enhance our profitability as we will not have to sub-contract any off our services.  Results of Operations  The discussion below compares the Company's results for the periods ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015. These results reflect the normal operations of our business. Although we offer various services under our management services agreements, we do not believe these services are unique enough in nature within the property management industry to warrant reporting their results separately. Therefore, the results below are inclusive of all the services offered to our customers under our management services agreements.  The Company has measured the impact of inflation and changing prices on operating expenses and net income for periods included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have concluded that there has not been a material impact to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows from inflation or changing prices this period.  Years Ended February 29, 2016 compared to year ended February 28, 2015  Revenue  We recorded $14,558 and $14,259 in revenue from operations, respectively, for the years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015. The increase of $299 reflects rent adjustments on the properties under management.  Our main source of revenue is derived from our management service agreements, currently with two clients, both of which are affiliated with our directors and officers. It is our intention in the short term to seek to add additional third party clients. Management believes the local market is underserved and property management companies such as ours can successfully add new clients.  Cost of revenue  We recorded $6,551 and $6,906 in cost of revenue, respectively, for the years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015. The decrease of $355 is a result of adjustments in the consulting fee of the subcontractor managing the properties.  Cost of revenue consists of direct costs associated with the delivery of services under our management service agreements, primarily sub-contractor costs. Other costs that will be associated with our cost of revenue in the future are materials needed to freshen up rentable space, printing, equipment rental such as carpet cleaning devices, and insurance.  Operating expenses  We recorded $20,797 and $83,121 in operating expenses, respectively, for the years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015. The decrease of $62,324 reflects the normalization of operating expenses, primarily professional fees, post our initial public offering.  Our operating expenses consist of professional fees, administrative expenses and rent. It is possible our future operating expenses will consist of indirect personnel costs, including fringe benefits, insurance and facility costs, travel and entertainment, depreciation and amortization, marketing and sales, professional services such as legal and accounting, and other general and administrative costs.  Net loss  We recognized $13,133 and $76,023 in net losses, respectively, for the years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015. The decrease of $62,890 reflects the normalization of operating expenses, primarily professional fees, post our initial public offering.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, during the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $13,133, used cash in operations of $23,876, and at February 29, 2016, the Company had a stockholders' deficit of $37,656. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  From January 23, 2014 (inception) through February 29, 2016, we have relied on funds loaned to us by Washington Capital Advisors LLC, a company controlled by C. Thomas McMillen, our Chairman. Those loans were in the cumulative amount of $68,144, including interest, and together with operating cash flow, were used to fund our working capital requirements. On July 29, 2014, we repaid Washington Capital Advisors $40,037 from funds received from the sale of our common stock, which totaled $50,350 (see below). At February 29, 2016, the outstanding loan amount due Washington Capital Advisors was $27,500 and accrued interest was $644.  Washington Capital Advisors has agreed to loan us amounts of up to a total of $50,000 (inclusive of the currently outstanding loan amount). See Note 5 "Related Party Transactions" for the terms of these loans. Additionally, Mr. McMillen and Michael T. Brigante, our Chief Financial Officer and a director, purchased shares of common stock from us at a price of $900 in fiscal 2014 and these funds have also been used in our operations.  We completed the minimum requirement of our public offering on July 28, 2014. We used the remaining net proceeds of this offering, after the repayment of a portion of our working capital loans, for general working capital purposes. We will need to raise additional capital to carry out our business plan. We believe that our additional capital needs will be approximately $75,000 over the next 12 months to fully carry out our business plan. We expect to raise these additional funds through the issuance of debt obligations and/or private placement of our Common Stock; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or if we are able to raise additional capital that the terms will be acceptable to us. We do not currently have any agreements or understandings with any potential debt financing sources, other than Washington Capital Advisors, and we have not identified any other potential lenders to provide capital.  In January 2016, the Company initiated a Private Placement of up to 500,000 Units, each Unit consisting of two (2) shares of the Company's Common Stock and a Common Stock warrant, to purchase one share of the Company's Common Stock. The Units are priced at $0.50 each and the warrant is exercisable for three (3) years after the subscription date for $0.75. The Company hopes to raise up to $250,000 for general working capital purposes and to investigate the possibility of entering the on-line real estate investment industry. This industry, known to some as real estate crowd funding, has been popularized over the last couple of years and has attracted a just few companies. Management believes this sector is underserved and lacks a regional company to consolidate funding opportunities. Additionally, management believes it can use its property management services to serve properties acquired through on-line funding.  Our current property management expansion and growth plans include establishing satellite offices in counties contiguous to Fauquier County, Virginia during 2016 and eventually statewide throughout 2017 and 2018. Initially, we will seek to establish these offices in properties that we manage or alternatively focus on geographic areas we identify as in need of our services. This expansion will require additional capital. We plan to raise this additional capital through debt obligations and private placement of our stock. Failure to raise additional capital will lengthen the time and decrease the scope of our expansion and growth plans.  The Company had cash on hand of $2,154 at February 29, 2016. Our primary needs for cash are to fund and grow our ongoing operations. However, we will require additional capital to fully carry out our business plan.  During the twelve months ended February 29, 2016, the Company had a net increase in cash of $1,124. The Company's sources and uses of cash were as follows:  Cash Flows From Operating Activities  We used net cash of $23,876 in our operating activities during the twelve months ended February 29, 2016, consisting of a net loss of $13,133 increased by $10,743 due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. We used net cash in operating activities the twelve months ended February 28, 2015, consisting of a net loss of $76,032 increased by $6,250 due to changes in our prepaid expenses and $23,053 due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities.  Cash Flows From Financing Activities  We provided net cash of $25,000 in our financing activities during the twelve months ended February 29, 2016 consisting of the sale of 300,000 of our common shares in the amount of $15,000, increased by loans from affiliates in the amount of $10,000. We provided net cash of $45,313 in our financing activities during the twelve months ended February 28, 2015 consisting of the sale of 1,007,000 of our common shares in the amount of $50,350, increased by loans from affiliates in the amount of $35,000 and decreased by payment of loans to affiliates in the amount of $40,037.  As of February 29, 2016, the Company had negative working capital of $37,656.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  The Company was not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements during the year ended February 29, 2016.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Use of Estimates  The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include accounting for potential liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  A discussion with respect to recently issued accounting standards is provided at Note 2 to the Company's financial statements.

	On April 28, 2017,


	Property Management Corporation of America (the “Company”) entered into a Software License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Finger Motion Company Limited, a Hong Kong corporation (the “Licensor”), that provides the Company the worldwide license to market and sell several role-playing video games. Role playing video games (RPGs) are a specific video game genre in which the player controls the actions of a game character (and/or several characters) that are immersed in a well-defined world. The Licensor has developed and/or acquired the rights to at least three such RPGs, currently marketed, or soon to be marketed, in the People’s Republic of China. The license is for an initial term of 10 years with subsequent 5-year extensions at the option of the parties. The Company shall assume all cost and expenses incurred with the acquisition, registration of, and performance of this license. As consideration for the license, the Company has agreed to issue to Licensor’s designees, Cheong Chee Ming, Cheong Leong Foong and Liew Siew Chin, a total of 100,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock.




	 




	The License Agreement contains other provisions customary to transactions of this nature. The foregoing descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the License Agreement, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

	The Company claims an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Act”), for the private placement of these securities pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act since, among other things, the transaction did not involve a public offering, that each of Licensor’s designees is an accredited investor, that each of the designees resides outside of the United States, and that each designee had access to information about the Company, accepted the securities for investment and not resale, and the Company took appropriate measures to restrict the transfer of the securities.

Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall have 200 votes. The voting rights of the Series A Preferred Stock shall apply regardless of whether the Company has a sufficient number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock then available for conversion.

Before any Holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he, she or it shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, to the Company or to the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the Company at its principal corporate office, of any election to convert such shares and shall state therein the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. This Company shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such Holder of Series A Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled. Such conversion shall occur on the same business day as such surrender of Series A Preferred Stock shares occurs, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record Holder or Holders of such shares of Common Stock on that date.




	 




	(c)     Conversion Adjustments of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The Conversion Prices of each series of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:




	 




	i.     If the Company should at any time after the date on which shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were first issued (the “Purchase Date”) fix a record date for a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or determine holders of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend, other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock


	, or other securities or rights convertible into, or entitling the holder thereof to receive directly or indirectly, additional shares of Common Stock (hereinafter referred to as “Common Stock Equivalents”) without payment of any consideration by such holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock Equivalents (including the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Ratio of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be increased in proportion to such increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and those issuable with respect to such Common Stock Equivalents.




	ii.     If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time after the Purchase Date is decreased by a combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Ratio for each series of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.




	 




	iii.     Other Distributions. If the Company shall declare a distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by this Company or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in Section 4(b), then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 4(c), the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of this Company into which their shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of this Company entitled to receive such distribution.




	 




	(d)      Recapitalizations. If at any time after the Purchase Date there is a recapitalization of the Common Stock, provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or property of this Company or otherwise, to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder would have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 4(d) with respect to the rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 4(d)(including adjustment of the Conversion Ratio then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.




	 




	 




	 


	 




	 




	 




	(e)      Taxes.   The Company shall not be required to pay any tax that may apply to any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion in a name other than that in which the shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock so converted were registered, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue or delivery has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax, or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid.




	 




	(f)     No Impairment. The Company will not through any reorganization, transfer of assets, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock against impairment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 4 shall prohibit the Company from amending its Articles or Certificate of Incorporation with the requisite consent of its stockholders and the Board of Directors.




	 




	(g)     Fractional Shares.    If any conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock would result in the issuance of a fractional share of Common Stock, such fractional share shall be rounded to one whole share of Common Stock.




	 




	(h)     Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall reserve sufficient authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to enable conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.




	 





	SECTION 5.  VOTING.  

	The Series A Preferred Stock will vote together with the Common Stock and not as a separate class except as specifically provided herein or as otherwise required by law. Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall vote as two hundred (200) Common Shares.


	The voting rights of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall apply regardless of whether the Company has a sufficient number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock then available to effect a conversion.




	 





	SECTION 6.  DIVIDENDS.

	  The holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to receive dividends paid on the Common Stock (unless converted to Common Stock in accordance with Section 4) and the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall not accrue any dividends.




	 





	SECTION 7.  REDEMPTION RIGHTS.

	  The shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall not have or be subject to any redemption rights.




	 





	SECTION 8.  PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS.





	 




	Subject to the rights of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that may from time to time come into existence, so long as any shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company shall not without first obtaining the approval (by written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a class:




	 




	(a)           Increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the total number of authorized shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock;




	 




	(b)           Exchange, reclassify, or cancel all or a part of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, including a reverse stock split (other than the Reverse Split), but excluding a stock split, so long as the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock’s conversion rights are not diminished in connection therewith;




	 




	(c)           Exchange, or create a right of exchange, of all or part of the shares of another class of shares into shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock other than as provided herein, or in any share exchange agreement or related document entered into between the Company and the Holders; or




	 




	(d)           Alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect adversely the shares of such series, including the rights set forth in this Designation.




	 





	SECTION 9.  PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS. 

	Holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to any preemptive, subscription or similar rights in respect to any securities of the Company, except as specifically set forth herein or in any other document agreed to by the Company.




	 





	SECTION 10. REPORTS. 

	The Company shall mail to all Holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock those reports, proxy statements, and other materials that it mails to all of its Common Stock holders.




	 





	SECTION 11. NOTICES. 

	In addition to any other means of notice allowed by law or the Company's Bylaws, any notice required by this Certificate of Designation shall be deemed effective if given by U.S. mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Holder of record at such Holder's address as it appears on the Company’s records.




	 




	 




	 


	 




	 




	 




	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Certificate of Designation is executed on behalf of the Company this 14th day of April 2017.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 02/01/2012
            

                BBB has determined that Property Corporation of America meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










Business Profile














BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review

The
accompanying interim condensed financial statements and notes to
the condensed financial statements for the interim period ended May
31, 2016, are unaudited. The accompanying interim unaudited
financial statements have been prepared by Property Management
Corporation of America (the “Company”) in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America for interim financial statements and pursuant to the
requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, these interim
unaudited financial statements do not include all the information
and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included. Operating results for the three months ended
May 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
be expected for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2017. The
condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and notes thereto included in the
Company’s Annual Report, filed on Form 10-K with the SEC on

  Property
Management Corporation of America

Three
Months ended May 31, 2016 and 2015 

Notes to
the Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

 

Note 1 -
Organization and Operations

 

Property
Management Corporation of America (the “Company”) was
incorporated on January 23, 2014 under the laws of the State of
Delaware. The Company offers management and consulting services to
residential and commercial real estate property owners who rent or
lease their property to third party tenants.

 

Going
Concern

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of
business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements,
during the three months ended May 31, 2016, the Company incurred a
net loss of $6,233, used cash in operations of $1,680, and at May
31, 2016, had a stockholders' deficit of $43,889. These factors
raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as
a going concern. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to
continue as a going concern.

 

The
Company is attempting to generate sufficient revenue; however, the
Company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support its
daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of
its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue
and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no
assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further
implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and in
its ability to raise additional funds.

 

Note 2
– Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of
contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.
Significant estimates include accounting for potential liabilities.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 

Basic and
diluted loss per share

 

Basic loss
per share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common
shares during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed by
dividing the net loss applicable to common stockholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the
number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding
if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued. For the
three months ended May 31, 2016 the basic and diluted shares
outstanding were the same, as there were no potentially dilutive
shares outstanding.

 

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments

 

Under
current accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the price at
which an asset could be exchanged or a liability transferred in a
transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties in the principal
or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Where
available, fair value is based on observable market prices or
parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where
observable prices or parameters are not available, valuation models
are applied. A fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in
measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows:

 

Level 1
– Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities.

 

 




 



F- 
5



 




  

  

Level 2
– Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, are
observable either directly or indirectly.

Level 3
– Unobservable inputs based on the Company's
assumptions.

 

The
Company is required to use observable market data if such data is
available without undue cost and effort. As of May 31, 2016, the
amounts reported for cash, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, and notes payable approximated fair value because of
their short-term maturities.

 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 

In May
2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue
recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing
revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it
with a principle based approach for determining revenue
recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize
revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they
occur in the contract. The ASU also will require additional
disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of
revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including
significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets
recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU
2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods therein. Entities will be able to transition to the
standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect
adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is in the
process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the
Company’s financial statements and disclosures.

 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
No. 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a
right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the
balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU
2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A
modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees
for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into
after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented
in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients
available. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact
that the standard could have on its financial statements and
related disclosures.

 

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its
Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did
not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on
the Company's present or future consolidated financial
statements.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
