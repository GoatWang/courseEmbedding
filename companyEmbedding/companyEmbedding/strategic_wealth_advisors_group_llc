Our Company





Welcome to Strategic Wealth Advisory! We are a family-owned and independent financial advisory and planning firm serving the Birdsboro, Allentown and Greater Reading PA Area and specializing in the area of retirement planning. We understand that investing is only a “portion” of a comprehensive financial plan, which is why we are so much more involved and intimate with the planning process than your typical product salesman or wealth manager. We firmly believe that financial education needs to come first and foremost, and we spend the time necessary to make sure each client understands the concepts and strategies inherent within a successful plan. We work with our clients to develop comprehensive financial plans. Then, and only then, will we suggest the investment products that we believe are best to implement that plan. Financial education and comprehensive planning are at the core of every step we take in the planning process. It brings us great satisfaction to serve our clients with those principles at the forefront of everything that we do.
Please take some time to browse through our website. We hope that you will join our family of “more-than-satisfied” clients and we look forward to partnering with you to build a lifelong rewarding relationship.

Why Use Our Firm
We believe that today, more than ever, people are looking for “educated” advisors; not just financial investment salespersons for help with their retirement planning. 


  
Getting Started
We believe that a comprehensive plan is critical to reaching your goals, and that true financial planning must involve much more than just investment advice and the selling of an investment product portfolio.

Client Focus & Attention
The founders of The Strategic Wealth Group felt there was a great opportunity and need for a financial services firm that focused solely on the client and that has been & will always be the foundation of the firm.  Our success is tied directly to the focus & attention we pay to our client and to the success of those relationships. This results in making each and every one of our clients valuable to SWG and its success.


Transparency and Independence
Our partnership with LPL Financial, the largest independent broker-dealer in the US*, allows us to maintain our independence and remain true to our beliefs.  Since LPL Financial does not offer any proprietary products, we are not encouraged to place our clients in specific products.  This allows us to offer unbiased and objective advice based on our clients specific financial goals.  This also enables us to be completely transparent when it comes to our fees; you will never be surprised by hidden fees when you work with us.

Comprehensive Approach
We value the relationship we have with our clients, and to protect that relationship we offer one point of contact for all your finance needs.  Like any successful partnership, we serve our clients and their advisory teams in a variety of roles.

Estate Planning


We do not offer estate planning nor do we provide any legal advice at Strategic Wealth Advisors Group, Inc., but we can refer you to an attorney that can take care of your estate planning needs:
Here are some misconceptions about Estate Planning:

I have a will so my family will avoid probate when I die.
I don’t have a will, so my family will not have to go through probate.
If I become incapacitated, my executor will be able to handle my financial affairs.
Joint ownership is a good way to avoid probate.
I don’t need to do any estate planning because I own much less than the federal estate tax exemption.

Most people do not know that a will only works if your property goes through probate after you die. Probate is the legal process through which the court makes sure that after your death your debts are paid, that your will is legally valid, and then that your assets are distributed according to the instructions in your will. So that rather than avoiding probate a will is really a set of instructions to the probate court and only works if there is a probate. Probate can be time consuming and very costly to an estate.
These are some of the questions and concerns that our clients have had over the years. This is why we have strategically aligned ourselves with an attorney that can answer all of your questions and help you out with the proper legal documents that you may need.

BREXIT


          Submitted by Strategic Wealth Advisory | Reading PA Financial Advisor on July 6th, 2016        


The UK voted to leave the European Union (EU). This came as quite a surprise to much of the world as many thought it would never happen. Perhaps it should not be such a great surprise however. If we look back at the formation of the European Union we see that Britain, unlike other nations, kept their own currency instead of converting to the euro. They never seemed to totally buy into the EU.

Getting Started





We believe that a comprehensive plan is critical to reaching your goals, and that true financial planning must involve much more than just investment advice and the selling of an investment product portfolio. Financial planning also includes the education that is necessary to help you navigate through what we refer to as “the Seven Unique Financial Challenges” that you will likely face in retirement. We will take the time to provide the necessary education through discussion of these challenges and how they can best be handled to provide you with a higher degree of certainty that the income and security you seek in retirement will be attained.
Investment management on its own is not financial planning but only a small part of the overall planning puzzle. And, it is important to understand that a financial product portfolio is not a financial plan. We have found that many firms only want to provide investment sales and management. When you work with Strategic Wealth Advisory, you benefit from a more comprehensive approach.
Interested in learning more about how Strategic Wealth Advisory works? We walk through the following process with those who are considering our services:
Step 1: Introductory Meeting
We start by asking you to complete our confidential profile. We ask that you complete this profile so that we can better understand your current situation and your financial goals and objectives. We will then invite you to a complimentary introductory meeting to which you can bring the completed profile.
In this meeting we will:

Discuss important topics such as proper beneficiary designations, the pros and cons of passing assets via the will vs by beneficiaries
Discuss the seven unique financial challenges you will face in retirement and how they can be destructive to your wealth if appropriate actions are not taken within a plan
Determine the specific strengths and weaknesses of your current financial status and plan
Determine what services may be of greatest benefit to you
Provide you with an understanding of how we work and are compensated
Answer any questions you may have

For all introductory meetings, we require that each financial decision maker be present. Introductory meetings are held at one of our two locations—either the Reading or Allentown areas. We also ask that you bring the following financial information for review:

Tax return for the past year
Investment and retirement account statements
Brokerage statements
Social Security statements
Pension plan investment options and statements
Variable life insurance investment options and statements
Other insurance information documents (non-variable life, disability, long-term care, auto, home and umbrella)
Estate planning documents
Any other financial information that you would like us to review

Step 2: We Create a Financial Plan
If you like what you hear during the introductory meeting, our next step is to create your personal financial plan. The financial plan provides detailed information regarding how you may be able to have the income you seek in retirement as well as how to and from where you should take required minimum distributions. It will effectively assign a “job description” to each investment asset you have so that you know exactly why you own each investment and how and when each will be utilized to provide you with a greater degree of confidence in your future income.
Minimizing taxes, both during your retirement as well as when transferring wealth to your children, will also be addressed. At the fore of the planning process is of course choosing the right social security strategy. We have the ability to analyze up to all 81 ways of claiming your social security to provide you with the most beneficial recommendation as part of your plan.
Step 3: We Help You Implement Your Plan
Choosing someone to help you manage your wealth is a big decision. We will review with you our recommendations of investment management strategies to bring your plan to fruition. We look forward to assisting you with your wealth management, investments, and all of your major decisions and transitions, while working in a mutually satisfying relationship.

Why Use Our Firm





Our Belief
We believe that today, more than ever, people are looking for “educated” advisors; not just financial investment salespersons for help with their retirement planning. While much of the financial industry is focused on selling financial portfolios without having a “plan” in place, we believe that education and a comprehensive plan must precede the financial portfolio you establish for retirement. It is important to remember that “a product portfolio is not a financial plan!”
Our Commitment to Our Own Education
To provide you with the best and most comprehensive financial planning solutions we realize that it is imperative to continue with our own education. As such, Earl D Schultz participates actively in numerous career educational memberships and spends many hours in personal study along with formal continuing education.  Earl is also a long-standing member of Ed Slott’s Master Elite Advisor Group through which he has gained specialized knowledge in IRA and other asset distribution strategies and associated tax planning techniques.
Our Fiduciary Promise
At Strategic Wealth Advisory we are held to a legal fiduciary standard. What does this mean? Consider the difference between your physician and your financial professional.  Your physician has a legal, moral, and ethical obligation to always put your interests and needs ahead of all else in working with you.
Only a financial advisor who is an Investment Advisor Representative has that same type of legally binding fiduciary duty to put your interests first. That means that our recommendations must be what will benefit you the most. In other words, you can know that we are acting in good faith and in your best interests at all times. Furthermore, we are a fee-based company as opposed to a commission-based company which means our focus is on maintaining a strong, long term relationship with our clients.
Access to Additional Trusted Resources
Strategic Wealth Advisory is constantly working to provide the best and most complete range of financial solutions for our clients. To ensure we provide quality resources we also work closely with hand-picked trusted professionals such as:

CPA’s
 Estate Planning Attorneys
 Elder Care Attorneys

We will also work with your CPA and/or attorney to make sure that all advisors are on the same page in providing the best services for your particular situation.
