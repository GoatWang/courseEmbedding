P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

	Ellomay is an Israeli based company whose shares are registered under the trading symbol “ELLO” with the NYSE MKT, and with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Since 2009, Ellomay Capital focuses its business in the energy and infrastructure sectors worldwide. Ellomay (formerly Nur Macroprinters Ltd.) previously was a supplier of wide format and super-wide format digital printing systems and related products worldwide, and sold this business to Hewlett-Packard Company during 2008 for more than $100 million.









	To date, Ellomay has evaluated numerous opportunities and invested significant funds in the renewable, clean energy and natural resources industries in Israel, Italy and Spain, including:












	 







	·








	Approximately 22.6MW of photovoltaic power plants in Italy and approximately 7.9MW of photovoltaic power plants in Spain; and













	 







	·








	Approximately 9.2% indirect interest, with an option to increase its holdings to 9.375%, in Dorad Energy Ltd., which owns and operates Israel’s largest private power plant with production capacity of approximately 850 MW, representing about 6%-8% of Israel’s total current electricity consumption.

Raphael and Fridrich both have vast experience in financial and industrial businesses. These controlling shareholders, along with Ellomay’s dedicated professional management, accumulated extensive experience in recognizing suitable business opportunities worldwide. The expertise of Ellomay’s controlling shareholders and management enables the company to access the capital markets, as well as assemble global institutional investors and other potential partners. As a result, we believe Ellomay is capable of considering significant and complex transactions, beyond its immediate financial resources.

	A form of proxy for use at the Meeting and a return envelope for the proxy are enclosed.  Upon the receipt of a properly signed and dated proxy in the form enclosed, which is received in time and not revoked prior to the Meeting, either of the proxies, with full power of substitution, will vote, as proxy, the ordinary shares represented thereby at the Meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxy, or, if no direction is indicated, in accordance with the recommendation of our Board of Directors.

	If your ordinary shares are held through a member of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Clearinghouse, and you intend to vote your shares at the Meeting in person or by proxy you must deliver to us, via messenger, registered mail or the electronic voting system of the Israel Securities Authority, a confirmation of ownership (

You are entitled to receive confirmation of ownership in the branch of the exchange member or by mail to your address (in consideration of mailing fees only), if you so requested in advance for a particular securities account.

You should receive instructions about electronic voting from the TASE member through which you hold your shares.




	 




	RECORD DATE; QUORUM







	Only shareholders of record at the close of business on May 23, 2016 are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting or any adjournment(s) or postponement(s) thereof. As of May 15, 2016, we had 10,677,595 issued and outstanding ordinary shares (this number does not include 255,959 ordinary shares all of which were repurchased by us, that were held by us at that date by us as treasury shares under Israeli law). Each ordinary share, other than ordinary shares held by us as treasury shares, is entitled to be counted for purposes of a quorum and to one vote on each matter to be voted on at the Meeting. Our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Association, or the Articles, do not provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors or for any other purpose.







	The presence at the Meeting, in person or by proxy, of two or more shareholders holding more than 25% of the voting rights of the Company, will constitute a quorum. All ordinary shares represented in person or by proxy (including broker non-votes and shares that abstain or do not vote with respect to one or more of the matters to be voted upon) will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. If within half an hour from the time appointed for the Meeting a quorum is not present, the meeting shall stand adjourned on the same day, in the next week, at the same time and place. The requisite quorum at an adjourned meeting shall be any two or more members, present in person or by proxy at the meeting.







	VOTING RIGHTS; REQUIRED VOTES







	The votes of all shareholders voting on a proposal are counted. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be treated as either a vote “for” or “against” a proposal. “Broker non-votes” are shares held by brokers or other nominees which are present in person or represented by proxy, but which are not voted on a particular matter because instructions have not been received from the beneficial owner of the shares. Brokers and other nominees have discretionary voting authority under the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange to vote on “routine” matters. Please note that the uncontested election of directors and the approval of the updated compensation policy and extension of the management services agreement are not considered “routine” matters under such rules. This means that if a brokerage firm holds your shares on your behalf, those shares will not be voted in the election of directors, or with respect to the other non-routine matters on the agenda of the Meeting, unless you provide voting instructions to your brokerage firm or obtain a proxy from your brokerage firm and vote the shares yourself, in person or by proxy.







	Each of the resolutions to be presented at the Meeting requires the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the ordinary shares voted in person or by proxy at the Meeting on the matter presented for passage. However, the approval of the proposals under Items 2 and 3 is required to comply with additional special “disinterested” voting requirements as set forth herein.  Item 5 does not require a shareholder vote.

	TERMS OF SERVICE AND EMPLOYMENT OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS







	For information concerning the terms of service and employment of our five most highly compensated office holders during or with respect to the year ended December 31, 2015 see “Item 6.B: Directors, Senior Management and Employees – Compensation” of our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on March 23, 2016. An “office holder” is defined under the Israeli Companies Law, 1999, or, as amended from time to time, the Companies Law, as a general manager, chief business manager, vice general manager, any other person assuming the responsibilities of any of the foregoing positions without regard to such person’s title, and a director, or manager directly subordinate to the general manager.







	PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS







	The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares as of May 15, 2016, by each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of 5.0% or more of our ordinary shares. Each of our shareholders has identical voting rights with respect to its shares. All of the information with respect to beneficial ownership of the ordinary shares is given to the best of our knowledge based on public filings by the shareholders (the most recent is a Schedule 13D/A filed on September 3, 2013) and on information provided by them.







	To our knowledge, except as otherwise indicated in the footnotes to this table, each shareholder in the table has sole voting and investment power for the ordinary shares shown as beneficially owned by them.

	(1)






	As used in this table, “beneficial ownership” means the sole or shared power to vote or direct the voting or to dispose or direct the disposition of any security as determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For purposes of this table, a person is deemed to be the beneficial owner of securities that can be acquired within 60 days from May 15, 2016 through the exercise of any option or warrant. Ordinary shares subject to options or warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days are deemed outstanding for computing the ownership percentage of the person holding such options or warrants, but are not deemed outstanding for computing the ownership percentage of any other person. The amounts and percentages are based on a total of 10,677,595 ordinary shares outstanding as of May 15, 2016. This number of outstanding ordinary shares does not include a total of 255,959 ordinary shares held at that date as treasury shares under Israeli law, all of which were repurchased by us. For so long as such treasury shares are owned by us they have no rights and, accordingly, are neither eligible to participate in or receive any future dividends which may be paid to our shareholders nor are they entitled to participate in, be voted at or be counted as part of the quorum for, any meetings of our shareholders.







	 







	(2)






	The 4,016,842 ordinary shares beneficially owned by Mr. Nehama consist of: (i) 3,551,869 ordinary shares held by S. Nechama Investments (2008) Ltd., or Nechama Investments, which constitute approximately 33.3% of our outstanding ordinary shares and (ii) 464,973 ordinary shares and held directly by Mr. Nehama, which constitute approximately 4.4% of our outstanding ordinary shares. Mr. Nehama, as the sole officer, director and shareholder of Nechama Investments, may be deemed to indirectly beneficially own any ordinary shares owned by Nechama Investments, which constitute (together with his shares) approximately 37.6% of our outstanding ordinary shares.







	 







	(3)






	Kanir Joint Investments (2005) Limited Partnership, or Kanir, is an Israeli limited partnership. Kanir Ltd., in its capacity as the general partner of Kanir, has the voting and dispositive power over the ordinary shares directly beneficially owned by Kanir. As a result, Kanir Ltd. may be deemed to indirectly beneficially own the ordinary shares beneficially owned by Kanir. Messrs. Hemi Raphael and Ran Fridrich, who are members of our Board of Directors, are the sole directors of Kanir Ltd. and Mr. Raphael is a majority shareholder of Kanir Ltd. As a result, Messrs. Raphael and Fridrich may be deemed to indirectly beneficially own the ordinary shares beneficially owned by Kanir, which constitute, together with their holdings as set forth in footnote (4), 30.4% and 27.2%, respectively, of our outstanding ordinary shares. Kanir Ltd. and Messrs. Raphael and Fridrich disclaim beneficial ownership of such ordinary shares except to the extent of their respective pecuniary interest therein, if any.







	 





	 






	- 3 -










	 










	(4)






	Mr. Raphael beneficially owns 454,524 ordinary shares, consisting of: (i) 314,514 ordinary shares held by a BVI private company wholly-owned by Mr. Raphael, which constitute approximately 2.9% of our outstanding shares and (ii) 140,010 ordinary shares held directly by Mr. Raphael, which constitute approximately 1.3% of our outstanding shares. Mr. Raphael, as the sole officer, director and shareholder of such private company, may be deemed to indirectly beneficially own any ordinary shares beneficially owned by such private company, which constitute (together with the shares held directly by him) approximately 4.3% of our outstanding ordinary shares. Mr. Fridrich directly owns 116,787 ordinary shares, which constitute approximately 1.1% of our outstanding shares.







	 







	(5)






	On March 24, 2008, Kanir and Nechama Investments entered into a shareholders agreement, or the 2008 Shareholders Agreement. By virtue of the 2008 Shareholders Agreement, Mr. Nehama, Nechama Investments, Kanir, Kanir Ltd., and Messrs. Raphael and Fridrich may be deemed to be members of a group that holds shared voting power with respect to 6,338,266 ordinary shares, which constitute approximately 59.4% of our outstanding ordinary shares, and holds shared dispositive power with respect to 5,349,475 ordinary shares, which constitute 50.1% of the outstanding ordinary shares. Accordingly, taking into account the shares directly held by Messrs. Nehama, Raphael (taking into account also shares held by the private company wholly-owned by him) and Fridrich, they may be deemed to beneficially own approximately 63.7%, 63.6% and 60.5%, respectively, of our outstanding ordinary shares. Each of Mr. Nehama and Nechama Investments disclaims beneficial ownership of the ordinary shares beneficially owned by Kanir. Each of Kanir, Kanir Ltd. and Messrs. Raphael and Fridrich disclaims beneficial ownership of the ordinary shares beneficially owned by Nechama Investments. A copy of the 2008 Shareholders Agreement was filed with the SEC on March 31, 2008 as Exhibit 14 to an amendment to a Schedule 13D and is not incorporated by reference herein.







	 







	(6)






	Bonstar Investments Ltd., or Bonstar, an Israeli company, holds 233,258 ordinary shares, which constitute approximately 2.2% of the outstanding ordinary shares. Bonstar is a limited partner of Kanir and assisted Kanir in the financing of the purchase of some of its ordinary shares. Accordingly, Bonstar may be deemed to be a member of a group with Kanir and its affiliates, although there are no agreements between Bonstar and either of such persons and entities with respect to the ordinary shares beneficially owned by each of them. Mr. Joseph Mor and Mr. Ishay Mor are the sole shareholders of Bonstar and Mr. Joseph Mor serves as the sole director of Bonstar. Messrs.

	ITEM 2








	APPROVAL OF UPDATED DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS COMPENSATION POLICY







	Background







	The Companies Law requires that a public company, such as Ellomay, adopt and implement a compensation policy with respect to the terms of service or employment, including the grant of an exemption, insurance, undertaking to indemnify or indemnification, retirement bonuses and any other benefit, payment or undertaking to pay any such amounts, given due to service or employment, or, together, Terms of Service and Employment, of its “office holders.” The Companies Law provides that the compensation policy should be approved by the board of directors, after taking into consideration the recommendation of the compensation committee. The Companies Law further provides for the approval of the compensation policy by the company’s shareholders with the “special majority” requirement set forth below.







	Our current compensation policy was approved by our shareholders at the annual general meeting held on June 18, 2013.







	General







	The Companies Law provides that a compensation policy for a period exceeding three years is required to go through the complete approval process once every three years. In addition, the board of directors is required to periodically examine the compensation policy and the need for adjustments in the event of a material change in the circumstances prevailing during the adoption of the compensation policy or for other reasons. We are therefore proposing the approval of an updated compensation policy, or the Updated Compensation Policy, attached hereto as

	Exhibit A

	.







	The compensation policy is required to be determined and reevaluated, among other things, in accordance with the following considerations: (i) the advancement of the company’s goals, its work plan and its policy with a long term view; (ii) the creation of appropriate incentives for the office holders of the company, considering, among other things, the risk management policy of the company; (iii) the size of the company and the nature of its operations; and (iv) in connection with the Terms of Service and Employment that include variable components – the contribution of the office holder to the achievement of the company’s goal and to the maximization of its profits, all with a long term view and in accordance with the position of the office holder. In addition, the Companies Law requires that a Compensation Policy include, among other things, consideration of certain issues and include certain instructions.








	At meetings held on March 21, 2016 and May 5, 2016, our Compensation Committee, after reviewing a current benchmark study and taking into account the considerations required by the Companies Law, discussed the proposed Updated Compensation Policy and recommended its approval by our Board of Directors. At a meeting held on May 8, 2016, our Board of Directors approved the Updated Compensation Policy and recommended that our shareholders approve it.











	The main amendments implemented in the Updated Compensation Policy are:











	 





	·







	Updates based on revisions to the Companies Law adopted since the initial approval of our compensation policy as follows:

















	 





	o







	Elimination of the requirement to review the ratio between the

	cost of employment

	of an office holder and the average and median

	salary

	of the rest of the employees (including contractors), but maintaining the requirement to review the ratio between the

	cost of employment

	of an office holder and the average and median

	cost of employment

	of the rest of the employees (including contractors;










	 





	o







	Permitting the Company to base the annual bonuses of directors and CEO on non-measurable criteria up to the cap determined in the Companies Law;










	 





	o







	Permitting the Company to base the bonuses of officers (other than the CEO) on non-measurable criteria;

















	 





	·







	Reduction of the non-compete period required from the Company’s officers to six months.















	 






	- 8 -










	 








	The description of the main amendments does not purport to be a complete summary of the amendments included in the Updated Compensation Policy and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Updated Compensation Policy and proposed amendments set forth in 

	Exhibit A

	. The words proposed to be added are 

	underlined

	 and the words proposed to be deleted are presented by “

	strikethrough

	”.








	The Companies Law provides that a company’s board of directors may approve a compensation policy even in the event it was not approved by the shareholders; provided that the compensation committee and thereafter the board of directors resolved, based on reasons that will be set forth in the resolutions and after an additional discussion concerning the compensation policy, that the approval of the compensation policy despite of the objection of the company’s shareholders is for the benefit of the company.







	Required Vote







	The approval of the Updated Compensation Policy by our shareholders requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present, in person or by proxy, and voting on the matter; provided that at least one of the following “special majority” requirements is met: (i) the shares voting in favor of the matter include at least a majority of the shares voted by shareholders who are not controlling shareholders and who do not have a personal interest in the approval of the Updated Compensation Policy or (ii) the total number of shares voted against the approval of the Updated Compensation Policy by shareholders referenced under (i) does not exceed 2% of our outstanding voting rights.



	 



	A “controlling shareholder” for purposes of the requisite majority is defined as a shareholder that has the ability to direct the activity of the company, other than an ability resulting only from serving as a director or having another position in the company. A person is deemed to control a company if he holds, alone or together with others, one half or more of the “means of control” in the company. Based, among other things, on their holdings in our shares and the 2008 Shareholders Agreement, Mr. Shlomo Nehama, our Chairman of the Board and a director nominee, Nechama Investments and Kanir, and Messrs. Fridrich and Raphael, who are members of our Board of Directors and director nominees, are each deemed to be our “controlling shareholders” for purposes of the required “special majority” and may also be deemed to have a “personal interest” in the approval of the Updated Compensation Policy due to the positions they hold.



	 



	The Companies Law requires that each shareholder voting on the proposal indicate whether or not the shareholder is a “controlling shareholder” or has a “personal interest” in the approval of the Updated Compensation Policy. Otherwise, the shareholder is not eligible to vote on this proposal. 







	Under the Companies Law, a “personal interest” of a shareholder (i) includes a personal interest of any member of the shareholder’s family or of the shareholder’s spouse’s family (or a spouse thereof) or a personal interest of a company with respect to which the shareholder (or any of the aforementioned family members) serves as a director or chief executive officer, owns at least 5% of the shares or has the right to appoint a director or chief executive officer, and (ii) excludes an interest arising solely from the ownership of our ordinary shares. Under the Companies Law, in the case of a person voting by proxy for another person, “personal interest” includes a personal interest of either the proxy holder or the shareholder granting the proxy, whether or not the proxy holder has discretion how to vote. 







	Proposal







	At the Meeting, our Board of Directors will propose that the following resolution be adopted:







	“RESOLVED, to approve the Updated Compensation Policy attached to the Proxy Statement as

	Exhibit A

	.”







	Upon the receipt of a properly signed and dated proxy, which includes an indication as to whether or not the shareholder is a controlling shareholder or has a “personal interest” in the approval of the proposal as explained above, and unless otherwise instructed in the proxy, either of the persons named in the enclosed proxy will vote the shares represented thereby “

	FOR

	” the above-mentioned proposal.

	EXTENSION OF THE MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT AMONG THE COMPANY, MEISAF BLUE




	& WHITE HOLDINGS LTD. AND KANIR JOINT INVESTMENTS (2005) LIMITED PARTNERSHIP







	Background







	Since March 31, 2008, Meisaf, an Israeli company wholly-owned by Mr. Shlomo Nehama, our Chairman of the Board, a controlling shareholder and a director nominee, and Kanir (another controlling shareholder, controlled by Messrs. Hemi Raphael, a director nominee, and Ran Fridrich, our CEO and a director nominee) have been providing us management and board services in accordance with a management services agreement, or, as amended, the Management Services Agreement. The Management Services Agreement was attached as Exhibit A to the proxy statement filed with the SEC on Form 6-K on December 1, 2008 and an amendment to the Management Services Agreement was attached as Exhibit 4.23 to our annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2013.







	Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement, Meisaf and Kanir provide management services and board services and advise and provide assistance to our management concerning our affairs and business. These services have been, and are expected to continue to be, provided by Mr. Nehama, who also serves as the Chairman of our Board or Directors, Mr. Fridrich, who also serves as our CEO, and Mr. Raphael, who serves as an active director and as a member of the board of directors of Dorad Energy Ltd.



	 



	In consideration for the performance of the management services and the service of their representatives as members of our Board of Directors, Meisaf and Kanir are paid an aggregate annual fee in the amount of $400,000, in equal parts and quarterly payments. Meisaf and Kanir are also entitled to receive reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket business expenses borne by them in connection with the provision of the services, as customary in the Company. We also provide Messrs. Nehama, Fridrich and Raphael, with office space and secretarial and office services in connection with their services to us. The Management Services Agreement includes a waiver by the Board of Directors representatives of Meisaf and Kanir of any director fees and options to purchase our ordinary shares that they may be entitled to as a result of their service on our Board of Directors, and Kanir and Mr. Fridrich have also waived any additional fees or benefits in connection with the provision of CEO services by Mr. Ran Fridrich since January 2009.







	The original term of the Management Services Agreement was until March 31, 2010. At each of the annual general meetings of our shareholders held on December 30, 2009, December 22, 2010, December 20, 2011 and June 18, 2013, our shareholders approved extensions to the term of the Management Services Agreement and accordingly the Management Services Agreement is currently in effect until the earlier of: (i) June 17, 2016, (ii) the termination of service of either of the Kanir and Nechama Investments affiliates on our Board of Directors, or (iii) a date that is six (6) months following the delivery of a written termination notice by Meisaf and Kanir to the Company or by the Company to Meisaf and Kanir.







	General







	At meetings held by our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee on March 21, 2016 and on May 5, 2016, and by our Board of Directors on May 8, 2016, the members of such committees and our Board of Directors (excluding Messrs. Nehama, Fridrich and Raphael) deliberated and discussed the proposed extension of the Management Services Agreement by a three-year term, commencing June 18, 2016. In their deliberations, our Compensation Committee, Audit Committee and Board of Directors contemplated, among other things, the considerations and issues as required by the Companies Law, including such considerations and issues required in connection with the approval of the Terms of Service and Employment of office holders. Our Compensation Committee and Audit Committee and our Board of Directors considered, among other things:











	 







	o







	The alternative cost of obtaining the services of an active chairman of the board and active director and of employing a chief executive officer, based on the Updated Compensation Policy as recommended by our Compensation Committee and approved by our Board of Directors and on the compensation terms for similar positions held in Israeli public companies with similar features;















	 







	o







	The extent of time, scope and nature of services provided by Meisaf’s and Kanir’s representatives, including, among other things, the provision of CEO, active chairman and active director services (which includes Mr. Raphael’s active participation as a board member of Dorad Energy Ltd.), the ongoing management of our operations, evaluating, negotiating and consummating business acquisitions, the management of our funds and financial affairs, discussions with potential investors and the management of our investor relations activities and of our financing activities;













	 






	- 10 -










	 










	 







	o







	The waiver by Messrs. Nehama, Fridrich and Raphael of director fees and options that they would otherwise have been entitled to receive under our Updated Compensation Policy;











	In addition, on March 21, 2016 our Audit Committee resolved that under the circumstances and given the experience of the representatives of Meisaf and Kanir in our field of operations, the positions held by such representatives in our company and our subsidiaries and affiliates, their in-depth knowledge and familiarity with our business, including our business prospects, business plans and ongoing projects and the nature of the services provided under the Management Services Agreement, a ‘competitive procedure’ is not appropriate for a proper examination of the extension of the Management Services Agreement. In light of the above, our Audit Committee determined that the ‘other procedures’ that should be undertaking in order to properly examine the proposed extension of the Management Services Agreement are a review of the proposed aggregate consideration under the Management Services Agreement compared to our compensation policy and our Updated Compensation Policy and to the alternative compensation that would have been paid by us for similar services.







	In light of the ongoing and expected future contribution and involvement of Messrs. Nehama, Fridrich and Raphael to and in our business and operations, our Compensation Committee, Audit Committee and Board of Directors discussed and approved, and recommend that our shareholders approve, the extension of the Management Services Agreement by a three-year term commencing June 18, 2016 and determined that the extension is for the benefit of the Company and does not involve a distribution (as such term is defined in the Companies Law). Should the three-year extension be approved by our shareholders, the Management Services Agreement will expire on the earlier of: (i) June 17, 2019, (ii) the termination of service of either of the Kanir and Nechama Investments affiliates on our Board of Directors, or (iii) a date that is six (6) months following the delivery of a written termination notice by Meisaf and Kanir to the Company or by the Company to Meisaf and Kanir.







	Required Vote







	Mr. Shlomo Nehama, our Chairman of the Board and a director nominee, Nechama Investments and Kanir, and Messrs. Fridrich and Raphael, who are members of our Board of Directors and director nominees, are each deemed to be our “controlling shareholders” for purposes of Section 268 of the Companies Law

	 

	due to their holdings as set forth above, their respective positions with such entities and the 2008 Shareholders Agreement.  Pursuant to Sections 270(4) and 275 of the Companies Law, the receipt of services from a controlling shareholder, including through an entity such controlling shareholder controls, and the Terms of Service and Employment of a controlling shareholder, requires the approval, in the following order, of: our Audit Committee (or Compensation Committee with respect to Terms of Service and Employment of a controlling shareholder), our Board of Directors and the affirmative vote of a majority of our ordinary shares voted in person or by proxy at the Shareholders’ Meeting, which is also required to satisfy at least one of the following “special majority” conditions: (i) the shares voting in favor of the matter include at least a majority of the shares voted by shareholders who do not have a personal interest in the approval of the transaction or (ii) the total number of shares voted against the approval of the transaction by shareholders referenced under (i) does not exceed 2% of our outstanding voting rights.







	The Companies Law requires that each shareholder voting on the proposal indicate whether or not the shareholder has a “personal interest” in the approval of the proposal. Otherwise, the shareholder is not eligible to vote on this proposal. For a detailed explanation of the term “personal interest,” see “Item 2: Required Vote.”







	Proposal







	At the Shareholders’ Meeting, our Board of Directors will propose that the following resolution be adopted:







	“RESOLVED, to approve the extension of the Management Services Agreement among the Company, Meisaf and Kanir by a three-year term and that this resolution is for the benefit of the Company.”







	Upon the receipt of a properly signed and dated proxy, which includes an indication as to whether or not the shareholder has a “personal interest” in the approval of the proposal as explained above, and unless otherwise instructed in the proxy, either of the persons named in the enclosed proxy will vote the shares represented thereby “

	FOR

	” the above-mentioned proposal.

	Exhibit A








	Ellomay Capital Ltd.



	 



	Directors and Officers Compensation Policy



	 



	As approved on June 18, 2013 and updated on [_____]



	 







	1.







	Objectives & Content








	 



	In this document we will define and detail Ellomay Capital Ltd.’s (the “Company” or “Ellomay”) compensation policy regarding the Company’s Directors and Officers (CEO, CEO's direct reports) (the “Compensation Policy”).



	 



	The publication of the Compensation Policy is intended to increase the transparency and visibility of Ellomay's activities regarding all aspects of its Directors’ and Officers’ compensation and to enhance its shareholders' ability to influence the compensation of the Company's Directors and Officers.



	 




	The

	Compensation


	p


	P

	olicy is worded in the masculine form only for purposes of convenience and is designated for equal and identical application to women and men, without any difference or change.



	 



	It is stressed that this

	c


	C

	ompensation

	p


	P

	olicy does not grant any rights to the Company’s Directors and Officers, and the adoption of this

	c


	C

	ompensation

	p


	P

	olicy per se will not grant any of the Company’s Directors and Officers a right to receive any component of compensation set forth in this

	c


	C

	ompensation

	p


	P

	olicy. The components of compensation to which a Director or Officer will be entitled will be exclusively those that are determined specifically in relation to him in accordance with the requirements of the Israeli Companies Law, 1999 and the regulations promulgated thereunder (together, the “Companies Law”).



	 



	It is clarified that in the event a Director or Officer receives compensation that is less than the compensation in accordance with this

	c


	C

	ompensation

	p


	P

	olicy, it will not be regarded as a deviation from this

	c


	C

	ompensation

	p


	P

	olicy, and such terms of his service or employment will not necessitate the approval of the General Meeting that is required in the event of approval of terms of service and employment that deviate from the compensation policy.



	 








	2.







	General








	 







	 






	2.1.






	Compensation Policy Purposes:







	 



	The Compensation Policy is designed to support the achievement of the Company's long term work plan goals and ensure that:



	 







	 






	 2.1.1.






	Officers' interests are as closely as possible aligned with the interests of Ellomay's shareholders;







	 







	 






	 2.1.2.






	The correlation between pay and performance will be enhanced;







	 





	 






	 










	 









	 







	 






	 2.1.3.






	Ellomay will be able to recruit and retain top level senior managers capable of leading the Company to further business success and facing the challenges ahead;







	 







	 






	 2.1.4.





	Company


	Ellomay’s

	Officers will be motivated to achieve a high level of business performance without taking unreasonable risks;





	 







	 






	 2.1.5.






	An appropriate balance will be established between different compensation elements – fixed vs. variable, short term vs. long term and cash payments vs. equity based compensation.







	 







	 






	2.2.






	The organs involved in the determination of the Compensation Policy are:







	 







	  






	 2.2.1.







	Compensation Committee


	– Provides the BOD (as hereinafter defined) with recommendations regarding the appropriate Compensation Policy, the required updates to the Compensation Policy and its renewal and approves Directors' and Officers' service and employment terms and conditions.








	 







	 






	 2.2.2.







	Board of Directors (“BOD”)

	– Approves the Compensation Policy for Directors and Officers and is responsible for periodical reviews of the Compensation Policy and its updating if necessary.







	 







	 






	 2.2.3.







	The General Meeting of Shareholders

	– Approves the Compensation Policy for Directors and Officers to the extent that such an approval is required by law.







	 







	 






	2.3.






	Business environment and its impact on Company Officers' compensation:







	 



	Ellomay is in the business of energy and infrastructure with operations that currently mainly include production of renewable and clean energy. The Compensation Policy is intended to ensure the Company’s ability to retain and recruit a dedicated and experienced professional management that will be able to successfully promote the Company’s interests and manage its business, operations and assets.



	 







	3.







	Compensation of Directors and Officers in view of the Company's Values and Strategy








	 







	 






	3.1.






	The connection between the Company's results and Officers' compensation:







	 



	We believe the total compensation of our Officers should be influenced by our business results as well as each Officer's individual contribution to the achievement of these results.



	 





	 






	A - 2










	 









	 







	 






	3.2.







	The ratio between the compensation of


	Directors


	 


	and


	 


	Officers and the other employees of the Company (including contractors):








	 





	The Compensation Committee and the BOD will review, from time to time,

	the ratio between the total cost of employment of each of Officers and theaverage and median salaries of the rest of the employees (includingcontractors), as well as

	the ratio between the total cost of employment of each of the

	Directors and

	Officers and the average and median cost of employment of the rest of the employees (including contractors) and discuss its possible impact on labor relations within the Company.



	 





	In the opinion of the Compensation Committee and BOD members, the current ratio is appropriate and reasonable in view of the nature of the Company, its size, the mixture of manpower and its field of operation and has no negative impact on the labor relations within the Company.



	 







	4.







	Basic Concepts of the Company's Compensation Policy








	 



	Directors’ and Officers' compensation should include a number of elements so that each of these elements rewards a different aspect of their overall contribution to the Company’s success:



	 







	 







	·








	Fixed Base Salary, Director Fees or Management Service Fee

	– Compensates Directors and Officers for the time they devote to performing their roles in the Company and for the daily performance of their tasks. The fixed base salary correlates to the Officer's skills (such as: experience, position knowledge, expertise, education, professional qualifications, etc.), on the one hand, and to the job requirements as well as the authority and responsibilities the job caries, on the other hand.







	 







	 







	·








	Social and Incidental Benefits

	–Several of the social benefits are mandatory according to different local legislation (such as: pension and long term savings, severance pay, vacation, sick leave, etc.), others are provided according to market specific conventions and enable the Company to compete in the working environment (such as education funds and company cars in Israel) and the remainder are meant to complement the Fixed Base Salary and compensate the Officers for expenses incurred in connection with their job requirements (such as: travel expenses or allowances).







	 







	 







	·








	Variable, Performance Based Rewards (Annual Bonus, Commissions and


	Grants)

	– Reward Directors and Officers for their contributions to the Company’s success and achievement of business goals during a

	pre

	defined timeframe.







	 







	 







	·








	Equity Based Compensation

	– Designed to strengthen the link between long term shareholders’ returns and the Company’s Directors’ and Officers’ rewards. This type of reward creates a stronger correlation between Directors’ and Officers’ motivation and interest and the interests of the Company’s shareholders. Another significant effect of Equity Based compensation is its contribution to retention, due to its inherent long term characteristics.







	 





	 






	A - 3










	 











	 




	To ensure an adequate fit of all reward elements and the appropriate construction of the Total Compensation Package, all compensation elements of a Company Director or Officer will be presented to the approving organ prior to approval of any specific payment or reward.



	 







	5.







	Compensation Elements








	 







	 







	5.1.








	Fixed Compensation

	:







	 






	Fixed Compensation (base salary and benefits ) for the Company’s

	Directors and

	Officers

	(other than non


	‐


	employee and external Directors)

	will be as detailed in the following table



	 









	Position






	Total Fixed Compensation monthly maximum  in NIS** and USD***








	Chairman*








	Up to 88,000 NIS (

	23,250

	17,370


	17,437

	USD)









	 



	* The Company’s Chairman of the BOD, CEO and Active Director are currently representatives of the Company’s controlling shareholders and are compensated for their BOD services and for management services based on a management services agreement. Should the Company resolve to retain the services of Directors or Officers performing similar functions who are not representatives of controlling shareholders, this policy will apply.



	 



	** These amounts will be linked to increases in the Israeli CPI



	 





	*** USD rate of 3.

	A deviation of up to 10% above these amounts will not be deemed to deviate from the terms of this Compensation Policy.



	 





	 






	A - 4










	 








	 







	 






	5.2.






	Fixed Base Salary:







	 






	 




	5.2.1.






	Determining the Fixed Base Salary of the Company’s Officers








	 



	The Fixed Base Salary for the Company’s Officers is first determined based on a pre-defined salary range. The range for each position will be based on:



	 







	 







	·








	Relevant peer group benchmark data


	.








	 







	 







	·








	Job requirements, authority and responsibilities the job caries and prior agreements executed with the Officer.








	 







	 







	·








	Education, skills, expertise, professional experience and achievements of the Officer.








	 







	 







	·








	Internal ratios between positions and between the Officer and the other employees (including contractors) of the Company


	.








	 







	 







	·








	The Company's financial situation, business challenges and goals


	.








	 



	The pay grade, approved within said range, will reflect the Officer's skills and fit into the intended position.



	 



	In Israel, the Company’s Officers are naturally exempt from the provisions of the Israeli Working and Rest Hours Law, as they hold senior managerial positions as defined in such Law. Therefore, they are not entitled to any additional compensation for overtime.



	 






	 




	5.2.1.1.






	Market Comparisons (Benchmark):








	 



	In order to set the Fixed Base Salary (and other compensation elements) ranges for recruitment of Officers to the Company, a comparative compensation study maybe conducted in the relevant market, reviewing similar position holders in comparable companies in the relevant geographies. The comparative study will cover companies meeting as many criteria as possible from the following list:



	 







	 







	·







	Holding companies, preferably in the areas of renewable and clean energy, life science and hi-tech ;







	 







	 







	·








	Publicly traded companies whose shares are traded on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange or Israeli companies whose shares are traded on the NASDAQ or NYSE markets and their market cap and/or shareholders' equity are close to that of Ellomay;








	 







	 







	·







	Companies competing with Ellomay for managerial talent and for potential Company Officers in particular;







	 



	Companies for which no reliable data can be collected will not be included in the comparison, even if they meet many or even all other criteria.



	 



	The comparative study will cover all compensation elements and will present (if data availability allows) the following:



	 







	 







	·







	Customary Fixed Base Salary range for similar roles (including data distribution);







	 





	 






	A - 5










	 








	 







	 







	·







	Customary range for Annual Bonus (in terms of percentage of annual salary);







	 







	 







	·







	Customary range for Equity Based Compensation economic value on the date of grant (in terms of percentage of annual salary);







	 







	 







	·







	Customary fringe and other benefits.







	 






	 




	5.2.1.2.






	Internal comparison – gaps between Officers' compensation and between the Officer and the rest of the employees:








	 



	Before determining a Company Officer's pay, the following considerations, including their impact on labor relations in the Company, in general, and within the management team in particular, will be taken into account:



	 







	 







	·







	The ratio between the Officer's compensation and the compensation of all other Company Officers at the same level;







	 







	 







	·







	The ratio between the Officer's cost of employment and the  

	salaryand 

	cost   of   employment   of   all   other   Company   employees (including contractors).








	 




	These amounts will be reviewed from time to time, compared to prevailing relevant market conditions and cost of living and updated if necessary.



	 






	 




	5.2.2.






	Annual salary review principles and indexing:








	 



	In order to retain Company Officers for long periods, their Fixed Base Salary will be reviewed from time to time in comparison to similar roles in the relevant market, taking into consideration the Company's financial situation. If necessary, a pay increase request will be presented to the relevant organs for approval. Automatic indexing mechanism (to the relevant CPI) may apply to the Officers' pay

	.




	 







	 






	5.2.3






	Directors Cash Compensation:







	 



	The cash compensation of non-employee and external Directors will be determined in accordance with the Compensation Regulations for External Directors and/or the Companies Regulations (Relief for Public Companies whose Shares are Traded in a Stock Exchange Outside Israel), as the case may be, and shall not exceed the maximum compensation permitted by these regulations.



	 



	In addition, Directors will be entitled to reimbursement for expenses incurred in the performance of their work, including trips overseas for work purposes.



	 





	 






	A - 6










	 








	 







	 






	5.3.






	Variable compensation:







	 



	Variable compensation elements are intended to achieve the following goals:



	 







	 







	 ·







	Linking part of the Company’s Officers' compensation to the achievement of business goals and targets which will, in the long term, maximize shareholders’ return and create a joint interest between Company Officers and shareholders;







	 







	 







	 ·







	Increasing Company Officers' motivation to achieve long term Company goals; and







	 







	 







	 ·







	Correlating part of the Company's pay expenses with its business performance and increasing financial and operational flexibility.







	 






	 




	5.3.1.






	Ratio between elements of the compensation package








	 



	The appropriate ratio between the fixed components of Directors' and Officers' compensation and their variable compensation are as follows:

	 ·







	The financial measure for calculating the bonus for a Director or Officer shall be chosen from between the Market Cap, Operating Income or Equity;







	 







	 







	 ·







	The percentage from the selected measure that will be paid to each Director or Officer as a bonus;







	 







	 







	 ·







	The threshold condition for the payment of the bonus will be the existence of operating profit during the plan period;







	 







	 







	 ·

	 ·







	The measures and their weights used to assess the Directors' or Officers' success and calculate the bonus.







	 







	 







	 ·

	5.3.2.1.

	Company Measures – Financial measures for Company performance such as: Market Cap, Operating Income, Equity, etc. These measures will be the same for all Company Officers and Directors and will have a weight of between 80%-100% of the total bonus.







	 







	 







	 

	·








	Managerial Appraisal – An evaluation of the performance of each Officer in non-quantitative aspects of their contribution to the Company’s long term success. The managerial appraisal score will have a weight of up to 20% of the total bonus.







	 



	The Bonus of the CEO and Directors, to the extent it does not exceed the amounts set forth in the Companies Law (currently three monthly salaries per year for all variable compensation), may be based entirely on non-measurable criteria taking into account the contribution of the director or CEO to the Company.



	 




	●

	  



	Bonuses for Officers other than the CEO may be based entirely on non-measurable criteria, subject to the ranges determined in Section 5.3.1.




	 





	 






	A - 8










	 









	 






	 




	5.3.2.2.






	Setting the Bonus budget; reviewing and reducing bonuses








	 



	The total annual bonus budget will be calculated according to the sum of the Maximum Bonuses of all Company Officers participating in the plan.



	 



	Following the approval of the bonus plans and of the annual financial reports for the relevant fiscal year, the recommended bonuses will be presented to the Compensation Committee and the BOD.



	 



	The Compensation Committee and the BOD will have the authority to reduce the Annual Bonus based on their discretion considering the following aspects:



	 







	 







	 ·







	The recipient’s contribution to the development of Company's business beyond the recipient’s direct responsibility;







	 







	 







	 ·







	The Quality and speed of the recipient’s reaction to crises and other unexpected events;







	 







	 







	 ·

	Grant payment and refunding mechanism








	 



	The Annual Bonuses will be paid with the first monthly salary following the review by the BOD, usually immediately following the approval of the annual financial reports.



	 




	Each Director and Officer will sign a document committing to refund any part of the annual bonus paid based on financial measures that may in the future prove to be based on a mistake which will require a restatement of the financial statements during the 3 years following the mistaken report

	or based on any claw


	‐

	. Such refund will be made within 6 months of publication of the restated financial statements.




	 






	 




	5.3.3.






	Equity Based Compensation








	 



	As part of the overall Directors and Officers compensation package in public companies, it is standard practice to offer a component of equity based compensation, which aims to establish proximity of interest between the relevant Directors and Officers and the shareholders of the Company.  Given the long term nature of the equity compensation plans, they support the ability of the Company to retain its senior managers in their positions for a long period.
