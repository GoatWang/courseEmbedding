Company Overview

                                    A leader in the global ICT industry, MiTAC International Corp. was founded in 1982. The company began operations in the Hsinchu Science Park (HCSP), Taiwan, and was the HCSP’s first system manufacturer. By 1990, MiTAC was listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Shifting global industrial trends, the proliferation of smartphones and tablet products, the emergence big data and the growth of cloud computing have prompted MiTAC Group to devote its resources to transforming business, enhancing our core competence, planning for the key businesses to independently operate in specialization, and to seek a broader development outlook. Therefore, MiTAC Holdings Corporation (MHC), through a stock swap from MiTAC International Corp. (MIC), was established on September 12, 2013 and listed and traded on Taiwan Stock Exchange under stock code 3706, company code ¨MiTAC〃. In the meantime, MiTAC Group was also implementing restructuring to meet the future operational direction of the group. And after, the Group separated the original MiTAC cloud computing business group to establish an independent MiTAC Computing Technology Corporation(MCT) on September 1, 2014.

These include joint development management and manufacturing (JDM), original design manufacturing (ODM), original equipment manufacturing (OEM) and original product manufacturing (OPM).
                                

                                    With its global brands—Mio, Magellan, Navman, and TYAN —MiTAC distributes GPS and server products worldwide. To meet the demands of today’s ‘cloud’, MiTAC has developed a comprehensive range of cloud services and cloud computing products with a focus on enterprise and terminal products, as well as smart handheld devices.
