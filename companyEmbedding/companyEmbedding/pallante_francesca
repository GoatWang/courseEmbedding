The previous complaints about the shoelaces are valid. They will not stay tied and the 30 inch replacement cement lace is very hard to find! VERY frustrating! Other than that, these shoes are OK.

These are great shoes. They are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn for work. I walk on hard marble floors all day long. These shoes make me feel like I'm walking on air.
I'd also recommend:  Rose Petals by Walking Cradles

I love, love these shoes. I have a wide foot and narrow heel as well as knee problems that are exacerbated by poorly supporting shoes! These are perfect!

I bought these for my mom. She needed a shoe that she felt safe walking in that was more dressy than a gym shoe. She loves them and they look cute on her.
