The Peacemaker: A Biblical Guide to Resolving Personal Conflict, 3rd ed. by Ken Sande
Resolving Everyday Conflict by Ken Sande and Kevin Johnson







The Peacemaker: A Biblical Guide to Resolving Personal Conflict

Author: Ken Sande
Edition: 3rd
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2006
Pages: 320

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Jesus said, “Blessed are the peacemakers.” But it often seems like conflict and disagreement are unavoidable. Serious, divisive conflict is everywhere—within families, in the church, and out in the world. And it can seem impossible to overcome its negative force in our lives.
In The Peacemaker, Ken Sande presents a comprehensive and practical theology for conflict resolution designed to bring about not only a cease-fire but also unity and harmony. Sande takes readers beyond resolving conflicts to true, life-changing reconciliation with family members, coworkers, and fellow believers.
Biblically based, The Peacemaker is full of godly wisdom and useful suggestions that are easily applied to any relationship needing reconciliation. Sande’s years of experience as an attorney and as president of Peacemaker Ministries will strengthen readers’ confidence as they stand in the gap as peacemakers.


‘Blessed are the peacemakers,’ said Jesus. With crystal clarity this manual lays before us the wisdom that leads humble souls into that blessing.
—J.I. Packer, Board of Governors’ Professor of Theology, Regent College
Of people alive and writing today, I know of no more reliable guide for peacemaking in church and family than Ken Sande.
—John Piper, associate pastor for preaching and vision, Bethlehem Baptist Church
The Peacemaker is a practical and faithful primer for how obedience to God’s Word can change deadlock into restoration in families, churches, workplaces, neighborhoods, and even prisons.
—Charles W. Colson, founder, Prison Fellowship
Ken Sande challenges us to act redemptively in a culture of enmity and shows us how to do this in our relationships with one another. A modern classic!
—Timothy George, executive editor, Christianity Today
The Peacemaker is a rich source of practical, biblical guidance for resolving every type of conflict.
—Tony Evans, senior pastor, Oak Cliff Bible Church
It is the sort of book that will remind every Christian reader that God, before all, is in the business of reconciliation, and that the servant is not greater than the master.
—D. James Kennedy, pastor, Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church
The best guidebook I’ve ever seen on how Christians should resolve conflicts. Every pastor ought to read this book and share it with the leaders of the church. It ought to be a textbook in every Bible school and seminary.
—Warren Wiersbe, author, Be Series
When The Peacemaker was first published in 1991, it set the standard for biblical, God-honoring conflict resolution. Now in its third edition, [it] freshly presents the fruit of [Sande’s] 20-plus years of faithful conflict resolution ministry within the Christian community. The choicest of that fruit is to be found in chapters 5 through 7, which have been updated and reworked, as well as a new appendix on how to create a ‘culture of peace’ in the local church. Here you will find a theology of conflict resolution even richer than that presented in the previous editions. . . . he illustrates with fresh examples of resolving conflict in the family, church, and workplace. . . . provides additional helpful insights into how we can gently and lovingly help others see their part in conflict situations and lead them to forgiveness and reconciliation. . . . the new appendix on developing a ‘culture of peace’ is an article that every church and Christian should read and heed if they want to be blessed. I highly recommend this ‘new and improved’ version as a staple in the theological arsenal of every believer, particularly those in church and ministry leadership.
—Dennis Rainey, president, FamilyLife

Nevada Attorney – John Sande

 




John’s practice specializes in all levels of interaction with state and local governments. As a licensed attorney in Nevada John has extensive experience representing clients before the executive branch of government, including administrative agencies, city and county boards, and planning departments. John’s unique talents and relationships with decision makers permit him to continue to achieve outstanding results for his clients.



 


For the last ten years he has successfully represented a vast array of industries and clients before the Nevada Legislature, including banking, gaming, energy, health care, education, motor vehicle franchise, liquor distribution, and local governments. John’s interest in government affairs began at a very young age. His father, a Nevada attorney and lobbyist for over 35 years, introduced him to the art of lobbying when John was a young boy. Frequently John’s father would invite legislators to family dinners at John’s house. The fascinating policy discussions John was exposed to during these dinners, in part, inspired him to devote his education to the law and policy. A scholar athlete and four-year letter winner at Stanford University, John led the Cardinal football team in the 2000 Rose Bowl as the team’s long snapper. His father, John P. Sande III, also attended Stanford, making them the only father son combination in Stanford history to play in the Rose Bowl.

 


John graduated from Stanford University with a BA in both Economics and Political Science. While attending Santa Clara University law school, John served as the senior comments editor for the award winning Santa Clara Law Review and published “A River Runs to It: Can the Public Trust Doctrine Save Walker Lake?”, 44 Santa Clara L. Rev. 831 (2004). After law school, John returned to Nevada to pursue his legal and government affairs career in the state he loves. Active in the community, John continues to serve his community, and has been a board member for several non-profit organizations including the Reno-Tahoe Young Professionals Network, an organization that named him one of the top 20 professionals under the age of 40 in the Reno -Tahoe area.
