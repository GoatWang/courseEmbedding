Publisher's Description▼▲
Every month 1,500 pastors burn out and leave the church. Learn how to beat the odds. The majority of pastors are not truly knownby anyone. They subconsciously isolate themselves from both staff and congregation so their insecurities, doubts, and failures arent exposed. Yet confiding in the wrong person can be a dead end at best and disastrous at worst. Former pastor Jimmy Dodd reveals how those in pastoral ministry can receive ongoing support, accountability, and restoration from relationships with a boss, counselor, trainer, mentor, coach, and good friend. Discover how you can move from surviving to thriving with the six relationships every pastor needs.

                This review was written for Survive or Thrive: 6 Relationships Every Pastor Needs.
            
 
            Jimmy Dodd in his new book, Survive Or Thrive Book One in the PastorServe series published by David C Cook gives 6 Relationships Every Pastor Needs.


From the back cover:  Every month 1,500 pastors burn out and leave the Church. Learn how to beat the odds.


The majority of pastors are not truly knownby anyone. They subconsciously isolate themselves from both staff and congregation so their insecurities, doubts, and failures arent exposed.


Yet confiding in the wrong person can be a dead-end at best and disastrous at worst. Former pastor Jimmy Dodd reveals how those in pastoral ministry can receive ongoing support, accountability, and restoration from relationships with a boss, counselor, trainer, mentor, coach, and good friend.


Discover how you can move from surviving to thriving with the six relationships every pastor needs.


Pastors everywhere are struggling with ever-increasing challenges in their ministry and personal lives. Upwards of 1,500 pastors leave pastoral ministry every monthnot to retire, but because they have finally given up. Many of those who remain in ministry struggle with deep-seated insecurities or carry secrets that threaten to overwhelm them. This book, grounded in Scripture, is for these pastors, church leaders, staff and anyone serving pastors through coaching, training, counseling or mentoring. Jimmy Dodd is the Founder and President of PastorServe, a ministry passionate about helping pastors thrive. In this book he wants to do it in three parts. Part One:  Survive:  The Heart Of The ProblemHow Did We Arrive Here?  Part Two:  Thrive:  The Six Relationships Every Pastor Needs and Part Three:  Gospel Transformation:  Taking The All-Important Next Steps. Pastor Dodd tells us, When the six relationships are absent, a pastor is on the verge of a crumbling cliff. If nothing changes, the pastor will certainly fall. The question is not if, but when. The truths taught here need to be embraced not only by each pastor but also by each congregation so that there can be an atmosphere of ongoing support, accountability and restoration.  If our pastors and ministry leaders remain healthy then we benefit all around.


Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Hoganson Media Relations.   I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commissions 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.

                This review was written for Survive or Thrive: 6 Relationships Every Pastor Needs.
            
 
            TIMELY!  With stories in the news so frequently about church leaders who have been caught in moral failures, we need this book!  We need men and women in church leadership who are willing to invest in the 6 key relationships that are identified.  


Just as importantly, we need people who are willing to fulfill each of these 6 key relationship roles for those they love in church ministry.  We need non-church leaders who are willing to be coaches and mentors.  We need lay individuals to serve as trainers and friends for pastors.  And thats not an indictment against pastors.  Its simply a call back to the important structures of a community.


Survive or Thrive is a highly valuable resource for all who are in church leadership or who care for those leading churches.  It has the potential to greatly improve the spiritual help of your churchs staff and leadership teams.  I highly recommend it!
