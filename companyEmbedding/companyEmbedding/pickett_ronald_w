Pickett, the President, CEO and Chairman of Solar Wind Energy Tower, Inc. (SWET), Interviews with The Wall Street TranscriptWall Street TranscriptAugust 19, 2013ReblogShareTweetShare67 WALL STREET, New York - August 19, 2013 - The Wall Street Transcript has just published its Alternative Energy Report offering a timely review of the sector to serious investors and industry executives. This special feature contains expert industry commentary through in-depth interviews with public company CEOs and Equity Analysts. The full issue is available by calling (212) 952-7433 or via The Wall Street Transcript Online.Topics covered: Grid Parity Timelines for Alternative Energy - Asia Pacific Demand for Solar Energy - Alternative Energy Generation - Solar Energy Pricing - Government Subsidies and Regulation - Solar Growth Drivers and Headwinds - Regulatory Headwinds for U.S. UtilitiesCompanies include: Solar Wind Energy Tower, Inc. (SWET) and many more.In the following excerpt from the Alternative Energy Report, the President, CEO and Chairman of Solar Wind Energy Tower, Inc. (SWET) discusses company strategy and the outlook for this vital industry:TWST: What is your proprietary Energy Calculator program?Mr. Pickett: That's something that we developed with Dr. Straka, from University of Oklahoma and Dr. Sankar, from Georgia Tech. It evaluates the weather condition at a certain area, taking the latitude and longitude coordinates. It takes a local weather data from an airport within just 100 miles, and for the last 10 years or so all airports have been carrying that data almost on an hourly basis. You take that weather data, which is temperature and relative humidity, then you cross that with the weather data from the satellites today, you feed that into our program that we have developed over the last several years, and then that will tell you how tall, how wide the tower needs to be at that location, how much water you need to interject at right intervals and how much electricity, how many kilowatts per hour it will make 24/7/365.TWST: Obama recently announced some measures to reduce carbon emissions and increase funding for clean energy. How much do you expect those measures to benefit Solar Wind Energy Tower?Mr. Pickett: I think there is a possibility that will benefit us. We certainly are in the front end of that, and we do exactly what they are proposing, with a zero-carbon footprint, and we make the tower abundant and affordable and predictable. Now whether or not the government will consider giving us a loan guarantee on the Arizona project or not, that remains to be seen. When we've gotten together a firm date for that, and we do intend to ask the Department of Energy if they'll consider that. We spoke with them on a number of occasions, and we told them that all along.Years ago when we first started, that would be our request; I don't think it's essential that they do that to get the tower built. That certainly will be helpful on the first project to mitigate the risk of the first development in terms of its financing, but I certainly hope that our government will take an interest in it. We've made some overtures there, we've had several meetings and I'm not making any predictions right now, because who can predict what our government's going to do these days. But I certainly hope that they will take an interest in it, and I'm proud that first project we're targeting is in the United States. There may well be a tower some place else by that time - by the time we finish all the work, one of the other countries may...For more of this interview and many others visit the Wall Street Transcript - a unique service for investors and industry researchers - providing fresh commentary and insight through verbatim interviews with CEOs, portfolio managers and research analysts.

Pickett, the President, CEO and Chairman of Solar Wind Energy Tower, Inc. (SWET)Wall Street TranscriptAugust 19, 2013ReblogShareTweetShare67 WALL STREET, New York - August 19, 2013 - The Wall Street Transcript has just published its Alternative Energy Report offering a timely review of the sector to serious investors and industry executives. This special feature contains expert industry commentary through in-depth interviews with public company CEOs and Equity Analysts. The full issue is available by calling (212) 952-7433 or via The Wall Street Transcript Online.Topics covered: Grid Parity Timelines for Alternative Energy - Asia Pacific Demand for Solar Energy - Alternative Energy Generation - Solar Energy Pricing - Government Subsidies and Regulation - Solar Growth Drivers and Headwinds - Regulatory Headwinds for U.S. UtilitiesCompanies include: Solar Wind Energy Tower, Inc. (SWET) and many more.In the following excerpt from the Alternative Energy Report, the President, CEO and Chairman of Solar Wind Energy Tower, Inc. (SWET) discusses company strategy and the outlook for this vital industry:TWST: What is your proprietary Energy Calculator program?Mr. Pickett: That's something that we developed with Dr. Straka, from University of Oklahoma and Dr. Sankar, from Georgia Tech. It evaluates the weather condition at a certain area, taking the latitude and longitude coordinates. It takes a local weather data from an airport within just 100 miles, and for the last 10 years or so all airports have been carrying that data almost on an hourly basis. You take that weather data, which is temperature and relative humidity, then you cross that with the weather data from the satellites today, you feed that into our program that we have developed over the last several years, and then that will tell you how tall, how wide the tower needs to be at that location, how much water you need to interject at right intervals and how much electricity, how many kilowatts per hour it will make 24/7/365.TWST: Obama recently announced some measures to reduce carbon emissions and increase funding for clean energy. How much do you expect those measures to benefit Solar Wind Energy Tower?Mr. Pickett: I think there is a possibility that will benefit us. We certainly are in the front end of that, and we do exactly what they are proposing, with a zero-carbon footprint, and we make the tower abundant and affordable and predictable. Now whether or not the government will consider giving us a loan guarantee on the Arizona project or not, that remains to be seen. When we've gotten together a firm date for that, and we do intend to ask the Department of Energy if they'll consider that. We spoke with them on a number of occasions, and we told them that all along.Years ago when we first started, that would be our request; I don't think it's essential that they do that to get the tower built. That certainly will be helpful on the first project to mitigate the risk of the first development in terms of its financing, but I certainly hope that our government will take an interest in it. We've made some overtures there, we've had several meetings and I'm not making any predictions right now, because who can predict what our government's going to do these days. But I certainly hope that they will take an interest in it, and I'm proud that first project we're targeting is in the United States. There may well be a tower some place else by that time - by the time we finish all the work, one of the other countries may...For more of this interview and many others visit the Wall Street Transcript - a unique service for investors and industry researchers - providing fresh commentary and insight through verbatim interviews with CEOs, portfolio managers and research analysts.
