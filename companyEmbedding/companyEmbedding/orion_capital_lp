Euromar LLC[edit]
In 2010 Rhone Capital made their first direct investment in the shipping industry. Euromar LLC, formed on March 25, 2010, is a joint venture of the Greek ship owner and operator Euroseas with Rhone Capital and Eton Park Capital Management, two recognized private investment firms. The partnership formed Euromar LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company. Pursuant to the terms of the Joint Venture, Rhone and Eton Park would each invest up to $75 million, equating to having a 42.86% interest each in the joint venture, whereas Euroseas would invest up to $25 million for a 14.28% interest in the Joint Venture, equating to a total investment of $175 million.[71] Euroseas operates small and medium-sized container ships as well as dry bulk ships.[72]
Liverpool F.C.[edit]
In March 2010, English Premier League football club Liverpool F.C. revealed that Rhône were in exclusive negotiations to potentially buy the football club.[73] Rhône made a bid of £118.5 million for a controlling 40 percent stake in the Anfield club with an additional £25 million infusion of funds for transfers.[74] Liverpool F.C's managing director Christian Purslow and manager Rafael Benitez both gave Tom Hicks and George N. Gillett, Jr. their recommendations to go ahead with the deal however Hicks and Gillett failed to meet the April 6th 2010 deadline set by Rhône. As a result, Liverpool F.C's £237 million debt to the Royal Bank of Scotland [74] is still outstanding and lack of fresh investment has meant plans for work to begin on a new £350 million stadium have stalled.[73]
In August 2010, Rhône re-emerged as a rival bidder in the takeover of Liverpool. Among other involved parties were Chinese businessman Kenny Huang, Yahya Kirdi's Syrian consortium, the Kuwaiti Al Kharafi family and Subrata Roy's Indian Sahara conglomerate. Liverpool's chairman, Martin Broughton, appointed by Barclays Capital, had hoped to identify a preferred bidder before the end of the transfer window, September 1, 2010.[75] As a result of not having achieved this investment, George N. Gillett, Jr. and Tom Hicks were obliged to pay a £20 million penalty to the Royal Bank of Scotland.[76]
Quiksilver Inc.[edit]
In 2009, Rhône loaned Quiksilver $150 million over five years to help the company refinance a U.S. line of credit and consolidate its European debt.[77] The deal included $25.6 million in warrants which allowed Rhône to buy 30% of Quiksilver's shares making Rhône own over half the company.[78][79] Rhône also assigned two new directors for Quiksilver's board.[80] The deal was described by the Orange County Business Journal as a potential "lifesaver" for Quiksilver, which was initially struggling under the weight of their $560 million acquisition of French ski maker Rossignol. As a result, Quiksilver announced it no longer planned to sell its DC Shoes unit or any other brands it owned. Surfer Kelly Slater also signed a five-year extension of his endorsement deal with Quiksilver, and accepted a significant portion of his compensation in the form of the company's stock.[81] In August 2010, Quiksilver completed an exchange of 31.1 million shares worth about $140 million for the debt, held by Rhone.[82] At the time, Moody's stated that it could raise the debt rating on Quiksilver if the deal went through.[83] Rhone has since exited their position making a return in excess of 22% on their investment.[84]
Almatis[edit]
In 2007, Rhône sold Almatis, a producer of specialty alumina, to Dubai International Capital (DIC), the international investment arm of Dubai Holding, for $1.2 billion.[85] DIC retained the existing management team and further supported the global growth strategy pursued by Almatis.[86]
LWB Refractories[edit]
In 2007, Rhône bought LWB Refractories, described by the magazine Industrial Minerals as "the worlds leading refractory dolomite producer",[87] from Lhoist Group S.A. for an undisclosed amount.[88] In 2008, Rhône then sold LWB Refractories for $938 million.[89] to Brazilian manufacturer Magnesita Refratarios S.A.[90] The deal created what is now one of the world largest refractory manufacturers.[91] Clifford Chance advised Rhône in connection with the combination of RHI AG and Magnesita to create a leading refractory company named RHI Magnesita, established in the Netherlands and listed on the London Stock Exchange, Rhone would remain the controlling shareholder.[92]
InfOTE[edit]
In 2007, Rhône won the auction for the Greek Yellow Pages directories business InfOTE. Rhône acquired the business in partnership with buyout group Zarkona Trading for $450 million giving Rhône an 85% holding of the company and Zarkona with 15%. Rhône outbid rival US media-focused buyout group Veronis Suhler Stevenson, UK-based private equity house Bridgepoint, and DLJ Merchant Banking, the buyout arm of Credit Suisse, as well as Greek media group Antenna.[93]
Fraikin[edit]
In 2007, Rhône together with Eurazeo[94] sold truck rental company Fraikin to CVC Capital Partners for €1.35 billion.[95] Eurazeo owned 55%, and Rhône owned 20%.[96] The remaining percentage is owned by other minority shareholders and management.[97]
Arizona Chemical[edit]
In 2006, Rhône bought Arizona Chemical for $485 million.[98] The deal officially closed in the first quarter of 2007. Arizona Chemical is the world's largest producer of oleochemicals and specialty resins based on crude tall oil, a by-product of wood pulping.[99] Arizona Chemical manufactures pine tree-based chemicals, such as fatty acids, rosin esters, and terpenes. These chemicals are used to manufacture products including adhesives, household cleaners, hydraulic fluids, inks, paints, personal care products, and plastics. Arizona Chemical was formed in 1930 by paper products maker International Paper and American Cyanamid and is now owned by Rhône. Arizona Chemical filed for an IPO in 2010.[100] Arizona Chemical has been a leader in pine chemistry for more than 75 years.[101]
UniEuro[edit]
In 2001, the UK's largest electronics retailer, Dixons bought Italy's most profitable chain of domestic appliance stores, UniEuro[102] from Rhône and JP Morgan for €368 million [103] to take controlling interest of nearly 96% of the company with an option to buy the remaining 4% for €30 million.[104] UniEuro employs over 3,000 people and as of 2006 had a turnover of €1 billion.[105]

The partnership formed Euromar LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company.

Liverpool F.C.[edit]
In March 2010, English Premier League football club Liverpool F.C. revealed that Rhône were in exclusive negotiations to potentially buy the football club.[73] Rhône made a bid of £118.5 million for a controlling 40 percent stake in the Anfield club with an additional £25 million infusion of funds for transfers.[74] Liverpool F.C's managing director Christian Purslow and manager Rafael Benitez both gave Tom Hicks and George N. Gillett, Jr. their recommendations to go ahead with the deal however Hicks and Gillett failed to meet the April 6th 2010 deadline set by Rhône. As a result, Liverpool F.C's £237 million debt to the Royal Bank of Scotland [74] is still outstanding and lack of fresh investment has meant plans for work to begin on a new £350 million stadium have stalled.[73]
In August 2010, Rhône re-emerged as a rival bidder in the takeover of Liverpool. Among other involved parties were Chinese businessman Kenny Huang, Yahya Kirdi's Syrian consortium, the Kuwaiti Al Kharafi family and Subrata Roy's Indian Sahara conglomerate. Liverpool's chairman, Martin Broughton, appointed by Barclays Capital, had hoped to identify a preferred bidder before the end of the transfer window, September 1, 2010.[75] As a result of not having achieved this investment, George N. Gillett, Jr. and Tom Hicks were obliged to pay a £20 million penalty to the Royal Bank of Scotland.[76]
Quiksilver Inc.[edit]
In 2009, Rhône loaned Quiksilver $150 million over five years to help the company refinance a U.S. line of credit and consolidate its European debt.[77] The deal included $25.6 million in warrants which allowed Rhône to buy 30% of Quiksilver's shares making Rhône own over half the company.[78][79] Rhône also assigned two new directors for Quiksilver's board.[80] The deal was described by the Orange County Business Journal as a potential "lifesaver" for Quiksilver, which was initially struggling under the weight of their $560 million acquisition of French ski maker Rossignol. As a result, Quiksilver announced it no longer planned to sell its DC Shoes unit or any other brands it owned. Surfer Kelly Slater also signed a five-year extension of his endorsement deal with Quiksilver, and accepted a significant portion of his compensation in the form of the company's stock.[81] In August 2010, Quiksilver completed an exchange of 31.1 million shares worth about $140 million for the debt, held by Rhone.[82] At the time, Moody's stated that it could raise the debt rating on Quiksilver if the deal went through.[83] Rhone has since exited their position making a return in excess of 22% on their investment.[84]
Almatis[edit]
In 2007, Rhône sold Almatis, a producer of specialty alumina, to Dubai International Capital (DIC), the international investment arm of Dubai Holding, for $1.2 billion.[85] DIC retained the existing management team and further supported the global growth strategy pursued by Almatis.[86]
LWB Refractories[edit]
In 2007, Rhône bought LWB Refractories, described by the magazine Industrial Minerals as "the worlds leading refractory dolomite producer",[87] from Lhoist Group S.A. for an undisclosed amount.[88] In 2008, Rhône then sold LWB Refractories for $938 million.[89] to Brazilian manufacturer Magnesita Refratarios S.A.[90] The deal created what is now one of the world largest refractory manufacturers.[91] Clifford Chance advised Rhône in connection with the combination of RHI AG and Magnesita to create a leading refractory company named RHI Magnesita, established in the Netherlands and listed on the London Stock Exchange, Rhone would remain the controlling shareholder.[92]
InfOTE[edit]
In 2007, Rhône won the auction for the Greek Yellow Pages directories business InfOTE. Rhône acquired the business in partnership with buyout group Zarkona Trading for $450 million giving Rhône an 85% holding of the company and Zarkona with 15%. Rhône outbid rival US media-focused buyout group Veronis Suhler Stevenson, UK-based private equity house Bridgepoint, and DLJ Merchant Banking, the buyout arm of Credit Suisse, as well as Greek media group Antenna.[93]
Fraikin[edit]
In 2007, Rhône together with Eurazeo[94] sold truck rental company Fraikin to CVC Capital Partners for €1.35 billion.[95] Eurazeo owned 55%, and Rhône owned 20%.[96] The remaining percentage is owned by other minority shareholders and management.[97]
Arizona Chemical[edit]
In 2006, Rhône bought Arizona Chemical for $485 million.[98] The deal officially closed in the first quarter of 2007. Arizona Chemical is the world's largest producer of oleochemicals and specialty resins based on crude tall oil, a by-product of wood pulping.[99] Arizona Chemical manufactures pine tree-based chemicals, such as fatty acids, rosin esters, and terpenes. These chemicals are used to manufacture products including adhesives, household cleaners, hydraulic fluids, inks, paints, personal care products, and plastics. Arizona Chemical was formed in 1930 by paper products maker International Paper and American Cyanamid and is now owned by Rhône. Arizona Chemical filed for an IPO in 2010.[100] Arizona Chemical has been a leader in pine chemistry for more than 75 years.[101]
UniEuro[edit]
In 2001, the UK's largest electronics retailer, Dixons bought Italy's most profitable chain of domestic appliance stores, UniEuro[102] from Rhône and JP Morgan for €368 million [103] to take controlling interest of nearly 96% of the company with an option to buy the remaining 4% for €30 million.[104] UniEuro employs over 3,000 people and as of 2006 had a turnover of €1 billion.[105]

The partnership formed Euromar LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company. Pursuant to the terms of the Joint Venture, Rhone and Eton Park would each invest up to $75 million, equating to having a 42.86% interest each in the joint venture, whereas Euroseas would invest up to $25 million for a 14.28% interest in the Joint Venture, equating to a total investment of $175 million.[71] Euroseas operates small and medium-sized container ships as well as dry bulk ships.[72]
Liverpool F.C.[edit]
In March 2010, English Premier League football club Liverpool F.C. revealed that Rhône were in exclusive negotiations to potentially buy the football club.[73] Rhône made a bid of £118.5 million for a controlling 40 percent stake in the Anfield club with an additional £25 million infusion of funds for transfers.[74] Liverpool F.C's managing director Christian Purslow and manager Rafael Benitez both gave Tom Hicks and George N. Gillett, Jr. their recommendations to go ahead with the deal however Hicks and Gillett failed to meet the April 6th 2010 deadline set by Rhône. As a result, Liverpool F.C's £237 million debt to the Royal Bank of Scotland [74] is still outstanding and lack of fresh investment has meant plans for work to begin on a new £350 million stadium have stalled.[73]
In August 2010, Rhône re-emerged as a rival bidder in the takeover of Liverpool. Among other involved parties were Chinese businessman Kenny Huang, Yahya Kirdi's Syrian consortium, the Kuwaiti Al Kharafi family and Subrata Roy's Indian Sahara conglomerate. Liverpool's chairman, Martin Broughton, appointed by Barclays Capital, had hoped to identify a preferred bidder before the end of the transfer window, September 1, 2010.[75] As a result of not having achieved this investment, George N. Gillett, Jr. and Tom Hicks were obliged to pay a £20 million penalty to the Royal Bank of Scotland.[76]
Quiksilver Inc.[edit]
In 2009, Rhône loaned Quiksilver $150 million over five years to help the company refinance a U.S. line of credit and consolidate its European debt.[77] The deal included $25.6 million in warrants which allowed Rhône to buy 30% of Quiksilver's shares making Rhône own over half the company.[78][79] Rhône also assigned two new directors for Quiksilver's board.[80] The deal was described by the Orange County Business Journal as a potential "lifesaver" for Quiksilver, which was initially struggling under the weight of their $560 million acquisition of French ski maker Rossignol. As a result, Quiksilver announced it no longer planned to sell its DC Shoes unit or any other brands it owned. Surfer Kelly Slater also signed a five-year extension of his endorsement deal with Quiksilver, and accepted a significant portion of his compensation in the form of the company's stock.[81] In August 2010, Quiksilver completed an exchange of 31.1 million shares worth about $140 million for the debt, held by Rhone.[82] At the time, Moody's stated that it could raise the debt rating on Quiksilver if the deal went through.[83] Rhone has since exited their position making a return in excess of 22% on their investment.[84]
Almatis[edit]
In 2007, Rhône sold Almatis, a producer of specialty alumina, to Dubai International Capital (DIC), the international investment arm of Dubai Holding, for $1.2 billion.[85] DIC retained the existing management team and further supported the global growth strategy pursued by Almatis.[86]
LWB Refractories[edit]
In 2007, Rhône bought LWB Refractories, described by the magazine Industrial Minerals as "the worlds leading refractory dolomite producer",[87] from Lhoist Group S.A. for an undisclosed amount.[88] In 2008, Rhône then sold LWB Refractories for $938 million.[89] to Brazilian manufacturer Magnesita Refratarios S.A.[90] The deal created what is now one of the world largest refractory manufacturers.[91] Clifford Chance advised Rhône in connection with the combination of RHI AG and Magnesita to create a leading refractory company named RHI Magnesita, established in the Netherlands and listed on the London Stock Exchange, Rhone would remain the controlling shareholder.[92]
InfOTE[edit]
In 2007, Rhône won the auction for the Greek Yellow Pages directories business InfOTE. Rhône acquired the business in partnership with buyout group Zarkona Trading for $450 million giving Rhône an 85% holding of the company and Zarkona with 15%. Rhône outbid rival US media-focused buyout group Veronis Suhler Stevenson, UK-based private equity house Bridgepoint, and DLJ Merchant Banking, the buyout arm of Credit Suisse, as well as Greek media group Antenna.[93]
Fraikin[edit]
In 2007, Rhône together with Eurazeo[94] sold truck rental company Fraikin to CVC Capital Partners for €1.35 billion.[95] Eurazeo owned 55%, and Rhône owned 20%.[96] The remaining percentage is owned by other minority shareholders and management.[97]
Arizona Chemical[edit]
In 2006, Rhône bought Arizona Chemical for $485 million.[98] The deal officially closed in the first quarter of 2007. Arizona Chemical is the world's largest producer of oleochemicals and specialty resins based on crude tall oil, a by-product of wood pulping.[99] Arizona Chemical manufactures pine tree-based chemicals, such as fatty acids, rosin esters, and terpenes. These chemicals are used to manufacture products including adhesives, household cleaners, hydraulic fluids, inks, paints, personal care products, and plastics. Arizona Chemical was formed in 1930 by paper products maker International Paper and American Cyanamid and is now owned by Rhône. Arizona Chemical filed for an IPO in 2010.[100] Arizona Chemical has been a leader in pine chemistry for more than 75 years.[101]
UniEuro[edit]
In 2001, the UK's largest electronics retailer, Dixons bought Italy's most profitable chain of domestic appliance stores, UniEuro[102] from Rhône and JP Morgan for €368 million [103] to take controlling interest of nearly 96% of the company with an option to buy the remaining 4% for €30 million.[104] UniEuro employs over 3,000 people and as of 2006 had a turnover of €1 billion.[105]

Eden Springs[edit]
In June 2013, Rhône acquired Mayanot Eden best known for its Eden Springs office water-cooler brand for $93.5 million. Eden is one of Europe's largest suppliers of watercoolers and the UK's market leader, distributing more than 450 million litres of water yearly to 600,000 customers in 15 countries and a player in the coffee and coffee machine business.[58] In June 2016 Eden Springs was acquired by Cott Corporation for $525 million.[59]
ASK Chemicals[edit]
In April 2014, Rhône Group acquired ASK Chemicals from German Ashland Inc. and Swiss based Clariant. The deal was valued at about $350 million.[60] ASK Chemicals is a leading foundry chemicals manufacturer with nearly 2,000 employees in 25 countries. Its portfolio encompasses an exceptionally broad and innovative range of foundry resources such as binders, coatings, feeders, filters and release agents, as well as metallurgical products including inoculants, inoculation wires and master alloys for iron casting. In 2013, ASK Chemicals generated annual revenues of €513 million.[61]
CSM Global[edit]
In March 2013, Rhône Capital purchased CSM Bakery Product for $1.4 billion. The business is made up of the European Bakery Supplies and North American Bakery Products businesses, as well as the international Bakery Supplies activities. Rhône Capital will also acquire the CSM brand name. In 2012 these businesses had aggregate sales of $3.3 Billion and aggregate EBITA of $140 million. Total staff comprised 8,220 employees at the end of 2012. CSM shares rose nearly 8% following the announcement. Morgan Stanley and Price Waterhouse Coopers were joint advisers to Rhone. Rothschild and Rabobank acted for CSM.[62]
Utex Industries[edit]
In March 2013, Rhône Capital sold one of its portfolio companies, Utex Industries, to Riverstone Holdings for approximately $800 million. KKR, First Reserve, and Ares Management were some of the companies considering bids.[63] Utex CEO, Mike Balas announced "...I’d also like to thank the Rhône team for being great partners to Utex over the past few years, fully supporting our business plan and helping us select the perfect partner for the next phase of our growth and development as a company. We look forward to the next phase of Utex’s development with Riverstone as our partner.”.[2] Rhone had previously acquired UTEX Industries in 2010 from the Audax Group, where they were advised by Lazard.[64][65]
Orion Engineered Carbons[edit]
In April 2011, Rhône Capital purchased the Carbon Black unit from Evonik Industries AG for in-excess of $1.3 billion.[66] At the time, Evonik described Carbon Black as the third largest in the world, including 16 production facilities in 11 countries with over 1,650 employees including 500 in Germany.[67] Evonik was advised by Barclays Capital and Rhône was advised by Morgan Stanley.[68] In July 2014 Rhone Capital filled for an IPO valuing the company at $1.36 billion.[69][70]
Euromar LLC[edit]
In 2010 Rhone Capital made their first direct investment in the shipping industry. Euromar LLC, formed on March 25, 2010, is a joint venture of the Greek ship owner and operator Euroseas with Rhone Capital and Eton Park Capital Management, two recognized private investment firms. The partnership formed Euromar LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company. Pursuant to the terms of the Joint Venture, Rhone and Eton Park would each invest up to $75 million, equating to having a 42.86% interest each in the joint venture, whereas Euroseas would invest up to $25 million for a 14.28% interest in the Joint Venture, equating to a total investment of $175 million.[71] Euroseas operates small and medium-sized container ships as well as dry bulk ships.[72]
Liverpool F.C.[edit]
In March 2010, English Premier League football club Liverpool F.C. revealed that Rhône were in exclusive negotiations to potentially buy the football club.[73] Rhône made a bid of £118.5 million for a controlling 40 percent stake in the Anfield club with an additional £25 million infusion of funds for transfers.[74] Liverpool F.C's managing director Christian Purslow and manager Rafael Benitez both gave Tom Hicks and George N. Gillett, Jr. their recommendations to go ahead with the deal however Hicks and Gillett failed to meet the April 6th 2010 deadline set by Rhône. As a result, Liverpool F.C's £237 million debt to the Royal Bank of Scotland [74] is still outstanding and lack of fresh investment has meant plans for work to begin on a new £350 million stadium have stalled.[73]
In August 2010, Rhône re-emerged as a rival bidder in the takeover of Liverpool. Among other involved parties were Chinese businessman Kenny Huang, Yahya Kirdi's Syrian consortium, the Kuwaiti Al Kharafi family and Subrata Roy's Indian Sahara conglomerate. Liverpool's chairman, Martin Broughton, appointed by Barclays Capital, had hoped to identify a preferred bidder before the end of the transfer window, September 1, 2010.[75] As a result of not having achieved this investment, George N. Gillett, Jr. and Tom Hicks were obliged to pay a £20 million penalty to the Royal Bank of Scotland.[76]
Quiksilver Inc.[edit]
In 2009, Rhône loaned Quiksilver $150 million over five years to help the company refinance a U.S. line of credit and consolidate its European debt.[77] The deal included $25.6 million in warrants which allowed Rhône to buy 30% of Quiksilver's shares making Rhône own over half the company.[78][79] Rhône also assigned two new directors for Quiksilver's board.[80] The deal was described by the Orange County Business Journal as a potential "lifesaver" for Quiksilver, which was initially struggling under the weight of their $560 million acquisition of French ski maker Rossignol. As a result, Quiksilver announced it no longer planned to sell its DC Shoes unit or any other brands it owned. Surfer Kelly Slater also signed a five-year extension of his endorsement deal with Quiksilver, and accepted a significant portion of his compensation in the form of the company's stock.[81] In August 2010, Quiksilver completed an exchange of 31.1 million shares worth about $140 million for the debt, held by Rhone.[82] At the time, Moody's stated that it could raise the debt rating on Quiksilver if the deal went through.[83] Rhone has since exited their position making a return in excess of 22% on their investment.[84]
Almatis[edit]
In 2007, Rhône sold Almatis, a producer of specialty alumina, to Dubai International Capital (DIC), the international investment arm of Dubai Holding, for $1.2 billion.[85] DIC retained the existing management team and further supported the global growth strategy pursued by Almatis.[86]
LWB Refractories[edit]
In 2007, Rhône bought LWB Refractories, described by the magazine Industrial Minerals as "the worlds leading refractory dolomite producer",[87] from Lhoist Group S.A. for an undisclosed amount.[88] In 2008, Rhône then sold LWB Refractories for $938 million.[89] to Brazilian manufacturer Magnesita Refratarios S.A.[90] The deal created what is now one of the world largest refractory manufacturers.[91] Clifford Chance advised Rhône in connection with the combination of RHI AG and Magnesita to create a leading refractory company named RHI Magnesita, established in the Netherlands and listed on the London Stock Exchange, Rhone would remain the controlling shareholder.[92]
InfOTE[edit]
In 2007, Rhône won the auction for the Greek Yellow Pages directories business InfOTE. Rhône acquired the business in partnership with buyout group Zarkona Trading for $450 million giving Rhône an 85% holding of the company and Zarkona with 15%. Rhône outbid rival US media-focused buyout group Veronis Suhler Stevenson, UK-based private equity house Bridgepoint, and DLJ Merchant Banking, the buyout arm of Credit Suisse, as well as Greek media group Antenna.[93]
Fraikin[edit]
In 2007, Rhône together with Eurazeo[94] sold truck rental company Fraikin to CVC Capital Partners for €1.35 billion.[95] Eurazeo owned 55%, and Rhône owned 20%.[96] The remaining percentage is owned by other minority shareholders and management.[97]
Arizona Chemical[edit]
In 2006, Rhône bought Arizona Chemical for $485 million.[98] The deal officially closed in the first quarter of 2007. Arizona Chemical is the world's largest producer of oleochemicals and specialty resins based on crude tall oil, a by-product of wood pulping.[99] Arizona Chemical manufactures pine tree-based chemicals, such as fatty acids, rosin esters, and terpenes. These chemicals are used to manufacture products including adhesives, household cleaners, hydraulic fluids, inks, paints, personal care products, and plastics. Arizona Chemical was formed in 1930 by paper products maker International Paper and American Cyanamid and is now owned by Rhône. Arizona Chemical filed for an IPO in 2010.[100] Arizona Chemical has been a leader in pine chemistry for more than 75 years.[101]
UniEuro[edit]
In 2001, the UK's largest electronics retailer, Dixons bought Italy's most profitable chain of domestic appliance stores, UniEuro[102] from Rhône and JP Morgan for €368 million [103] to take controlling interest of nearly 96% of the company with an option to buy the remaining 4% for €30 million.[104] UniEuro employs over 3,000 people and as of 2006 had a turnover of €1 billion.[105]

London Office[edit]
In 2011, Rhône Group moved from their Knightsbridge office to Mayfair's 40 Bruton Street, signing a 10-year lease for the top 3 floors[15] covering 8,000 square feet, at £105 per sq ft. This marked the highest rent achieved in the West End.[16]

WeWork[edit]
In 2016, Rhône Group partnered with WeWork to raise several hundred million dollars for a real estate investment fund. The partners have already approached New York City landlords about buying properties where the coworking company is a tenant. Fundraising for the vehicle, dubbed WeWork Property Investors, is still ongoing. Buying into its properties would allow the co-working company to benefit from property appreciation it says it creates as a tenant. On March 9, the company filed offering documents for four private equity funds. WeWork Property Investors and WeWork Property Investors Funds A, B and B1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The filings list several WeWork and Rhone Group executives as fund directors.[17]

In 2010 Rhone Capital made their first direct investment in the shipping industry. Euromar LLC, formed on March 25, 2010, is a joint venture of the Greek ship owner and operator Euroseas with Rhone Capital and Eton Park Capital Management, two recognized private investment firms. The partnership formed Euromar LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company. Pursuant to the terms of the Joint Venture, Rhone and Eton Park would each invest up to $75 million, equating to having a 42.86% interest each in the joint venture, whereas Euroseas would invest up to $25 million for a 14.28% interest in the Joint Venture, equating to a total investment of $175 million.[71] Euroseas operates small and medium-sized container ships as well as dry bulk ships.[72]
Liverpool F.C.[edit]
In March 2010, English Premier League football club Liverpool F.C. revealed that Rhône were in exclusive negotiations to potentially buy the football club.[73] Rhône made a bid of £118.5 million for a controlling 40 percent stake in the Anfield club with an additional £25 million infusion of funds for transfers.[74] Liverpool F.C's managing director Christian Purslow and manager Rafael Benitez both gave Tom Hicks and George N. Gillett, Jr. their recommendations to go ahead with the deal however Hicks and Gillett failed to meet the April 6th 2010 deadline set by Rhône. As a result, Liverpool F.C's £237 million debt to the Royal Bank of Scotland [74] is still outstanding and lack of fresh investment has meant plans for work to begin on a new £350 million stadium have stalled.[73]
In August 2010, Rhône re-emerged as a rival bidder in the takeover of Liverpool. Among other involved parties were Chinese businessman Kenny Huang, Yahya Kirdi's Syrian consortium, the Kuwaiti Al Kharafi family and Subrata Roy's Indian Sahara conglomerate. Liverpool's chairman, Martin Broughton, appointed by Barclays Capital, had hoped to identify a preferred bidder before the end of the transfer window, September 1, 2010.[75] As a result of not having achieved this investment, George N. Gillett, Jr. and Tom Hicks were obliged to pay a £20 million penalty to the Royal Bank of Scotland.[76]
Quiksilver Inc.[edit]
In 2009, Rhône loaned Quiksilver $150 million over five years to help the company refinance a U.S. line of credit and consolidate its European debt.[77] The deal included $25.6 million in warrants which allowed Rhône to buy 30% of Quiksilver's shares making Rhône own over half the company.[78][79] Rhône also assigned two new directors for Quiksilver's board.[80] The deal was described by the Orange County Business Journal as a potential "lifesaver" for Quiksilver, which was initially struggling under the weight of their $560 million acquisition of French ski maker Rossignol. As a result, Quiksilver announced it no longer planned to sell its DC Shoes unit or any other brands it owned. Surfer Kelly Slater also signed a five-year extension of his endorsement deal with Quiksilver, and accepted a significant portion of his compensation in the form of the company's stock.[81] In August 2010, Quiksilver completed an exchange of 31.1 million shares worth about $140 million for the debt, held by Rhone.[82] At the time, Moody's stated that it could raise the debt rating on Quiksilver if the deal went through.[83] Rhone has since exited their position making a return in excess of 22% on their investment.[84]
Almatis[edit]
In 2007, Rhône sold Almatis, a producer of specialty alumina, to Dubai International Capital (DIC), the international investment arm of Dubai Holding, for $1.2 billion.[85] DIC retained the existing management team and further supported the global growth strategy pursued by Almatis.[86]
LWB Refractories[edit]
In 2007, Rhône bought LWB Refractories, described by the magazine Industrial Minerals as "the worlds leading refractory dolomite producer",[87] from Lhoist Group S.A. for an undisclosed amount.[88] In 2008, Rhône then sold LWB Refractories for $938 million.[89] to Brazilian manufacturer Magnesita Refratarios S.A.[90] The deal created what is now one of the world largest refractory manufacturers.[91] Clifford Chance advised Rhône in connection with the combination of RHI AG and Magnesita to create a leading refractory company named RHI Magnesita, established in the Netherlands and listed on the London Stock Exchange, Rhone would remain the controlling shareholder.[92]
InfOTE[edit]
In 2007, Rhône won the auction for the Greek Yellow Pages directories business InfOTE. Rhône acquired the business in partnership with buyout group Zarkona Trading for $450 million giving Rhône an 85% holding of the company and Zarkona with 15%. Rhône outbid rival US media-focused buyout group Veronis Suhler Stevenson, UK-based private equity house Bridgepoint, and DLJ Merchant Banking, the buyout arm of Credit Suisse, as well as Greek media group Antenna.[93]
Fraikin[edit]
In 2007, Rhône together with Eurazeo[94] sold truck rental company Fraikin to CVC Capital Partners for €1.35 billion.[95] Eurazeo owned 55%, and Rhône owned 20%.[96] The remaining percentage is owned by other minority shareholders and management.[97]
Arizona Chemical[edit]
In 2006, Rhône bought Arizona Chemical for $485 million.[98] The deal officially closed in the first quarter of 2007. Arizona Chemical is the world's largest producer of oleochemicals and specialty resins based on crude tall oil, a by-product of wood pulping.[99] Arizona Chemical manufactures pine tree-based chemicals, such as fatty acids, rosin esters, and terpenes. These chemicals are used to manufacture products including adhesives, household cleaners, hydraulic fluids, inks, paints, personal care products, and plastics. Arizona Chemical was formed in 1930 by paper products maker International Paper and American Cyanamid and is now owned by Rhône. Arizona Chemical filed for an IPO in 2010.[100] Arizona Chemical has been a leader in pine chemistry for more than 75 years.[101]
UniEuro[edit]
In 2001, the UK's largest electronics retailer, Dixons bought Italy's most profitable chain of domestic appliance stores, UniEuro[102] from Rhône and JP Morgan for €368 million [103] to take controlling interest of nearly 96% of the company with an option to buy the remaining 4% for €30 million.[104] UniEuro employs over 3,000 people and as of 2006 had a turnover of €1 billion.[105]

Euromar LLC[edit]
In 2010 Rhone Capital made their first direct investment in the shipping industry. Euromar LLC, formed on March 25, 2010, is a joint venture of the Greek ship owner and operator Euroseas with Rhone Capital and Eton Park Capital Management, two recognized private investment firms. The partnership formed Euromar LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company. Pursuant to the terms of the Joint Venture, Rhone and Eton Park would each invest up to $75 million, equating to having a 42.86% interest each in the joint venture, whereas Euroseas would invest up to $25 million for a 14.28% interest in the Joint Venture, equating to a total investment of $175 million.[71] Euroseas operates small and medium-sized container ships as well as dry bulk ships.[72]
Liverpool F.C.[edit]
In March 2010, English Premier League football club Liverpool F.C. revealed that Rhône were in exclusive negotiations to potentially buy the football club.[73] Rhône made a bid of £118.5 million for a controlling 40 percent stake in the Anfield club with an additional £25 million infusion of funds for transfers.[74] Liverpool F.C's managing director Christian Purslow and manager Rafael Benitez both gave Tom Hicks and George N. Gillett, Jr. their recommendations to go ahead with the deal however Hicks and Gillett failed to meet the April 6th 2010 deadline set by Rhône. As a result, Liverpool F.C's £237 million debt to the Royal Bank of Scotland [74] is still outstanding and lack of fresh investment has meant plans for work to begin on a new £350 million stadium have stalled.[73]
In August 2010, Rhône re-emerged as a rival bidder in the takeover of Liverpool. Among other involved parties were Chinese businessman Kenny Huang, Yahya Kirdi's Syrian consortium, the Kuwaiti Al Kharafi family and Subrata Roy's Indian Sahara conglomerate. Liverpool's chairman, Martin Broughton, appointed by Barclays Capital, had hoped to identify a preferred bidder before the end of the transfer window, September 1, 2010.[75] As a result of not having achieved this investment, George N. Gillett, Jr. and Tom Hicks were obliged to pay a £20 million penalty to the Royal Bank of Scotland.[76]
Quiksilver Inc.[edit]
In 2009, Rhône loaned Quiksilver $150 million over five years to help the company refinance a U.S. line of credit and consolidate its European debt.[77] The deal included $25.6 million in warrants which allowed Rhône to buy 30% of Quiksilver's shares making Rhône own over half the company.[78][79] Rhône also assigned two new directors for Quiksilver's board.[80] The deal was described by the Orange County Business Journal as a potential "lifesaver" for Quiksilver, which was initially struggling under the weight of their $560 million acquisition of French ski maker Rossignol. As a result, Quiksilver announced it no longer planned to sell its DC Shoes unit or any other brands it owned. Surfer Kelly Slater also signed a five-year extension of his endorsement deal with Quiksilver, and accepted a significant portion of his compensation in the form of the company's stock.[81] In August 2010, Quiksilver completed an exchange of 31.1 million shares worth about $140 million for the debt, held by Rhone.[82] At the time, Moody's stated that it could raise the debt rating on Quiksilver if the deal went through.[83] Rhone has since exited their position making a return in excess of 22% on their investment.[84]
Almatis[edit]
In 2007, Rhône sold Almatis, a producer of specialty alumina, to Dubai International Capital (DIC), the international investment arm of Dubai Holding, for $1.2 billion.[85] DIC retained the existing management team and further supported the global growth strategy pursued by Almatis.[86]
LWB Refractories[edit]
In 2007, Rhône bought LWB Refractories, described by the magazine Industrial Minerals as "the worlds leading refractory dolomite producer",[87] from Lhoist Group S.A. for an undisclosed amount.[88] In 2008, Rhône then sold LWB Refractories for $938 million.[89] to Brazilian manufacturer Magnesita Refratarios S.A.[90] The deal created what is now one of the world largest refractory manufacturers.[91] Clifford Chance advised Rhône in connection with the combination of RHI AG and Magnesita to create a leading refractory company named RHI Magnesita, established in the Netherlands and listed on the London Stock Exchange, Rhone would remain the controlling shareholder.[92]
InfOTE[edit]
In 2007, Rhône won the auction for the Greek Yellow Pages directories business InfOTE. Rhône acquired the business in partnership with buyout group Zarkona Trading for $450 million giving Rhône an 85% holding of the company and Zarkona with 15%. Rhône outbid rival US media-focused buyout group Veronis Suhler Stevenson, UK-based private equity house Bridgepoint, and DLJ Merchant Banking, the buyout arm of Credit Suisse, as well as Greek media group Antenna.[93]
Fraikin[edit]
In 2007, Rhône together with Eurazeo[94] sold truck rental company Fraikin to CVC Capital Partners for €1.35 billion.[95] Eurazeo owned 55%, and Rhône owned 20%.[96] The remaining percentage is owned by other minority shareholders and management.[97]
Arizona Chemical[edit]
In 2006, Rhône bought Arizona Chemical for $485 million.[98] The deal officially closed in the first quarter of 2007. Arizona Chemical is the world's largest producer of oleochemicals and specialty resins based on crude tall oil, a by-product of wood pulping.[99] Arizona Chemical manufactures pine tree-based chemicals, such as fatty acids, rosin esters, and terpenes. These chemicals are used to manufacture products including adhesives, household cleaners, hydraulic fluids, inks, paints, personal care products, and plastics. Arizona Chemical was formed in 1930 by paper products maker International Paper and American Cyanamid and is now owned by Rhône. Arizona Chemical filed for an IPO in 2010.[100] Arizona Chemical has been a leader in pine chemistry for more than 75 years.[101]
UniEuro[edit]
In 2001, the UK's largest electronics retailer, Dixons bought Italy's most profitable chain of domestic appliance stores, UniEuro[102] from Rhône and JP Morgan for €368 million [103] to take controlling interest of nearly 96% of the company with an option to buy the remaining 4% for €30 million.[104] UniEuro employs over 3,000 people and as of 2006 had a turnover of €1 billion.[105]
