Adoption of Updated EDGAR Filer Manual



Document Number: 2017-15862    

Type: Rule    

Date: 2017-07-28    

Agency: Securities and Exchange Commission, Agencies and Commissions    


    The Securities and Exchange Commission (``the Commission'') is adopting revisions to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (``EDGAR'') Filer Manual and related rules to reflect updates to the EDGAR system. The updates are being made primarily to reflect amendments made to several forms under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to effectuate inflation adjustments and other technical amendments required under Titles I and III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (``JOBS'') Act; support recent updates to Form C and Form D; includes instructions for hyperlinking to exhibits included with certain Securities Act and Exchange Act forms and makes certain corrective changes to previously revised sections. The revised EDGAR Filer Manual also announces updates to the technical specifications for the ABS-EE schema and terminates support for US-GAAP-2015, EXCH-2015, CURRENCY-2014, and COUNTRY-2013 taxonomies. The EDGAR system is scheduled to be upgraded on July 17, 2017.

jstallworth on DSK7TPTVN1PROD with NOTICES

requiring price improvement before the
order can receive priority over other
orders[,]’’ 28 the Exchange believes the
procedures governing the execution of
fully hedged complex orders serve to
reduce the risk of incomplete or
inadequate executions while increasing
efficiency and competitive pricing by
requiring price improvement before the
order can receive priority over other
orders.
In addition, making explicit the open
outcry priority applicable when there
are other complex orders or quotes
represented at the same net price,
whether such other orders or quotes are
in the COB or being represented in open
outcry, provides added clarity to the
rule text in a manner that is consistent
with the existing methodology
applicable for prioritizing multiple
simple orders for open outcry trading
and how the Exchange has interpreted
and applied complex order priority. The
Exchange notes that it is not proposing
to amend how complex orders are
allocated or the priority afforded to
complex orders in open outcry; it is
merely modifying the requirements for a
complex order to be eligible for the
existing open outcry complex order
priority.
The Exchange notes that TPHs may
continue to represent and execute in
open outcry a complex order with any
number of legs and in any ratio.
However, if a complex order does not
satisfy the applicable ratio requirements
as set forth above, then it will not be
eligible for the complex order benefits
listed in Table 1. Additionally, even if
a complex order is fully hedged market
participants do not have to utilize the
complex order benefits listed in Table 1
if they choose not to. The Exchange
believes the proposed changes will
increase opportunities for execution of
complex orders and lead to tighter
spreads on CBOE, which will benefit
investors. The Exchange also believes
that the proposed rule change is
designed to not permit unfair
discrimination among market
participants, as all market participants
may trade complex orders, and the
priority eligibility requirements apply to
complex orders of all market
participants.
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement on Burden on Competition
The Exchange does not believe that
the proposed rule change will impose
any burden on competition that is not
necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act. The
Exchange believes that simplifying and
28 See

expanding its rules related to complex
orders helps provide clarity with
regards to the execution of complex
orders and increases the likelihood that
market participants will execute bonafide complex orders on CBOE. This
proposal promotes fair and orderly
markets as well as assists the Exchange
in its ability to effectively attract order
flow and liquidity to its market, which
ultimately benefits all TPHs and all
investors. Complex orders are available
to all TPHs (and all non-TPH market
participants through TPHs), and the

Summary of the Application
1. The Adviser serves as the
investment adviser to the Subadvised
Series pursuant to an investment
advisory agreement with the Trust (the
‘‘Investment Management
Agreement’’).1 The Adviser will provide
the Subabvised Series with continuous
and comprehensive investment
management services subject to the
supervision of, and policies established
by, the Subabvised Series’ board of
trustees (‘‘Board’’).2 The Investment
Management Agreement permits the
Adviser, subject to the approval of the
Board, to delegate to one or more subadvisers (each, a ‘‘Sub-Adviser’’) the
responsibility to provide the day-to-day
portfolio investment management of the
Subabvised Series, subject to the
supervision and direction of the
Adviser. The primary responsibility for
managing the Subabvised Series will
remain vested in the Adviser. The
Adviser will hire, evaluate, allocate
assets to and oversee the Sub-Advisers,
including determining whether a SubAdviser should be terminated, at all
times subject to the authority of the
Board.
2. Applicants request an exemption to
permit the Adviser, subject to Board
approval, to hire certain Sub-Advisers
pursuant to sub-advisory agreements
and materially amend existing subadvisory agreements without obtaining
the shareholder approval required under
Section 15(a) of the Act and Rule 18f2 under the Act.3 Applicants also seek
an exemption from the Disclosure
Requirements to permit a Subabvised
Series to disclose (as both a dollar
1 The initial Subadvised Series is the Vivaldi
Multi-Strategy Fund. Applicants request relief with
respect to the named Applicants, as well as to any
future series of the Trust and any other existing or
future registered open-end management company or
series thereof that: (a) Is advised by the Adviser; (b)
uses the manager of managers structure described
in the application; and (c) complies with the terms
and conditions of the application (collectively with
the initial Subadvised Series, the ‘‘Subadvised
Series’’). The term ‘‘Adviser’’ includes (i) the
Adviser, (ii) its successors, and (iii) any entity
controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with, the Adviser or its successors. For
purposes of the requested order, ‘‘successor’’ is
limited to an entity resulting from a reorganization
into another jurisdiction or a change in the type of
business organization.
2 The term ‘‘Board’’ includes the board of trustees
or directors of a future Subadvised Series, if
different.
3 The requested relief will not extend to any subadviser that is an affiliated person, as defined in
Section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of a Subadvised Series
or the Adviser, other than by reason of serving as
a sub-adviser to one or more of the Subadvised
Series (‘‘Affiliated Sub-Adviser’’).

amount and a percentage of the
Subadvised Series’ net assets): (a) The
aggregate fees paid to the Adviser; and
(b) the aggregate fees paid to SubAdvisers; and (c) the fee paid to each
Affiliated Sub-Adviser (collectively,
‘‘Aggregate Fee Disclosure’’).
3. Applicants agree that any order
granting the requested relief will be
subject to the terms and conditions
stated in the Application. Such terms
and conditions provide for, among other
safeguards, appropriate disclosure to
Subadvised Series shareholders and
notification about sub-advisory changes
and enhanced Board oversight to protect
the interests of the Subadvised Series’
shareholders.
4. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that
the Commission may exempt any
person, security, or transaction or any
class or classes of persons, securities, or
transactions from any provisions of the
Act, or any rule thereunder, if such
relief is necessary or appropriate in the
public interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and purposes
fairly intended by the policy and
provisions of the Act. Applicants
believe that the requested relief meets
this standard because, as further
explained in the application, the
Investment Management Agreement will
remain subject to shareholder approval,
while the role of the Sub-Advisers is
substantially similar to that of
individual portfolio managers, so that
requiring shareholder approval of SubAdvisory Agreements would impose
unnecessary delays and expenses on the
Subadvised Series. Applicants believe
that the requested relief from the
Disclosure Requirements meets this
standard because it will improve the
Adviser’s ability to negotiate fees paid
to the Sub-Advisers that are more
advantageous for the Subadvised Series.
For the Commission, by the Division of
Investment Management, under delegated
authority.

Assistant Secretary.

Summary of the Application

    1. The Adviser serves as the investment adviser to the Subadvised 
Series pursuant to an investment advisory agreement with the Trust (the 
``Investment Management Agreement'').\1\ The Adviser will provide the 
Subabvised Series with continuous and comprehensive investment 
management services subject to the supervision of, and policies 
established by, the Subabvised Series' board of trustees 
(``Board'').\2\ The Investment Management Agreement permits the 
Adviser, subject to the approval of the Board, to delegate to one or 
more sub-advisers (each, a ``Sub-Adviser'') the responsibility to 
provide the day-to-day portfolio investment management of the 
Subabvised Series, subject to the supervision and direction of the 
Adviser. The primary responsibility for managing the Subabvised Series 
will remain vested in the Adviser. The Adviser will hire, evaluate, 
allocate assets to and oversee the Sub-Advisers, including determining 
whether a Sub-Adviser should be terminated, at all times subject to the 
authority of the Board.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The initial Subadvised Series is the Vivaldi Multi-Strategy 
Fund. Applicants request relief with respect to the named 
Applicants, as well as to any future series of the Trust and any 
other existing or future registered open-end management company or 
series thereof that: (a) Is advised by the Adviser; (b) uses the 
manager of managers structure described in the application; and (c) 
complies with the terms and conditions of the application 
(collectively with the initial Subadvised Series, the ``Subadvised 
Series''). The term ``Adviser'' includes (i) the Adviser, (ii) its 
successors, and (iii) any entity controlling, controlled by, or 
under common control with, the Adviser or its successors. For 
purposes of the requested order, ``successor'' is limited to an 
entity resulting from a reorganization into another jurisdiction or 
a change in the type of business organization.
    \2\ The term ``Board'' includes the board of trustees or 
directors of a future Subadvised Series, if different.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. Applicants request an exemption to permit the Adviser, subject 
to Board approval, to hire certain Sub-Advisers pursuant to sub-
advisory agreements and materially amend existing sub-advisory 
agreements without obtaining the shareholder approval required under 
Section 15(a) of the Act and Rule 18f-2 under the Act.\3\ Applicants 
also seek an exemption from the Disclosure Requirements to permit a 
Subabvised Series to disclose (as both a dollar amount and a percentage 
of the Subadvised Series' net assets): (a) The aggregate fees paid to 
the Adviser; and (b) the aggregate fees paid to Sub-Advisers; and (c) 
the fee paid to each Affiliated Sub-Adviser (collectively, ``Aggregate 
Fee Disclosure'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The requested relief will not extend to any sub-adviser that 
is an affiliated person, as defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the Act, 
of a Subadvised Series or the Adviser, other than by reason of 
serving as a sub-adviser to one or more of the Subadvised Series 
(``Affiliated Sub-Adviser'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3. Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief 
will be subject to the terms and conditions stated in the Application. 
Such terms and conditions provide for, among other safeguards, 
appropriate disclosure to Subadvised Series shareholders and 
notification about sub-advisory changes and enhanced Board oversight to 
protect the interests of the Subadvised Series' shareholders.
    4. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt 
any person, security, or transaction or any class or classes of 
persons, securities, or transactions from any provisions of the Act, or 
any rule thereunder, if such relief is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and 
purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. 
Applicants believe that the requested relief meets this standard 
because, as further explained in the application, the Investment 
Management Agreement will remain subject to shareholder approval, while 
the role of the Sub-Advisers is substantially similar to that of 
individual portfolio managers, so that requiring shareholder approval 
of Sub-Advisory Agreements would impose unnecessary delays and expenses 
on the Subadvised Series. Applicants believe that the requested relief 
from the Disclosure Requirements meets this standard because it will 
improve the Adviser's ability to negotiate fees paid to the Sub-
Advisers that are more advantageous for the Subadvised Series.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
under delegated authority.

Series Trust Services




The Investment Managers Series Trusts provide a simple, cost-efficient means of starting and operating a mutual fund - ideal for advisors who wish to offer a mutual fund to enhance their product line.
UMB Fund Services and Mutual Fund Administration, LLC (MFAC) co-sponsor two series trusts. The Investment Managers Series Trust II was established in 2013 due to the success of the original trust and is currently open to new advisors.
The Investment Managers Series Trusts combine UMB’s experience as a fund service provider with the specialized expertise of MFAC in fund formation and series trust administration.
UMB acts as lead service provider, serving as fund accountant, transfer agent and custodian* as well as co-administrator with MFAC.
MFAC takes the lead on general fund oversight, post-trade compliance, handling board and Chief Compliance Officer matters/communication, corporate secretarial services, regulatory compliance, Securities and Exchange Commission registration/reporting, and budgeting.






Benefits and Highlights

A cost-effective means to manage smaller funds – minimal initial capital required
Lower overhead due to sharing a board of trustees, fund officers, a CCO, etc.
Shorter start-up time (roughly half the time needed to start an independent fund)
Lower fund break-even points than an independent fund
Board of trustees, fund auditors, legal counsel and other service providers are already in place
A vehicle for multiple types of accounts – retirement accounts, 401(k)s, etc.
Each fund maintains its own branding/identity
Allows advisors to focus their efforts on managing money and growing assets


Key Services

Fund administration
Fund accounting
Transfer agency and investor services
Custody*
Distribution services**



A multiple series trust (or umbrella trust) is an open-end mutual fund authorized to create an unlimited number of series – or separate portfolios – within the trust. Portfolios in the trust enjoy a variety of benefits compared to stand-alone mutual funds, as summarized above.
*Custody services provided by UMB Bank, n.a.

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        March 20, 2017.
        
          AGENCY:
Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”).
ACTION:
Notice.
Notice of an application under Section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Act”) for an exemption from Section 15(a) of the Act and Rule 18f-2 under the Act, as well as from certain disclosure requirements in Rule 20a-1 under the Act, Item 19(a)(3) of Form N-1A, Items 22(c)(1)(ii), Start Printed Page 1509122(c)(1)(iii), 22(c)(8) and 22(c)(9) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 6-07(2)(a), (b), and (c) of Regulation S-X (“Disclosure Requirements”). The requested exemption would permit an investment adviser to hire and replace certain sub-advisers without shareholder approval and grant relief from the Disclosure Requirements as they relate to fees paid to the sub-advisers.
Applicants:
 Investment Managers Series Trust II (the “Trust”), a Delaware statutory trust registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company with multiple series, and Vivaldi Asset Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Adviser,” and, collectively with the Trust, the “Applicants”).
Filing Dates:
 The application was filed on October 21, 2016, and amended on March 2, 2017.
Hearing or Notification of Hearing:
 An order granting the application will be issued unless the Commission orders a hearing. Interested persons may request a hearing by writing to the Commission's Secretary and serving applicants with a copy of the request, personally or by mail. Hearing requests should be received by the Commission by 5:30 p.m. on April 14, 2017, and should be accompanied by proof of service on the applicants, in the form of an affidavit or, for lawyers, a certificate of service. Pursuant to Rule 0-5 under the Act, hearing requests should state the nature of the writer's interest, any facts bearing upon the desirability of a hearing on the matter, the reason for the request, and the issues contested. Persons who wish to be notified of a hearing may request notification by writing to the Commission's Secretary.
ADDRESSES:
Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE., Washington, DC 20549-1090. Applicants: Trust: 235 West Galena Street, Milwaukee, WI 53212, and Adviser: 225 West Wacker, Suite 2100, Chicago, IL 60606.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

End Preamble
Start Supplemental Information
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Summary of the Application 
1. The Adviser serves as the investment adviser to the Subadvised Series pursuant to an investment advisory agreement with the Trust (the “Investment Management Agreement”).[1] 
           The Adviser will provide the Subabvised Series with continuous and comprehensive investment management services subject to the supervision of, and policies established by, the Subabvised Series' board of trustees (“Board”).[2] 
           The Investment Management Agreement permits the Adviser, subject to the approval of the Board, to delegate to one or more sub-advisers (each, a “Sub-Adviser”) the responsibility to provide the day-to-day portfolio investment management of the Subabvised Series, subject to the supervision and direction of the Adviser. The primary responsibility for managing the Subabvised Series will remain vested in the Adviser. The Adviser will hire, evaluate, allocate assets to and oversee the Sub-Advisers, including determining whether a Sub-Adviser should be terminated, at all times subject to the authority of the Board.
2. Applicants request an exemption to permit the Adviser, subject to Board approval, to hire certain Sub-Advisers pursuant to sub-advisory agreements and materially amend existing sub-advisory agreements without obtaining the shareholder approval required under Section 15(a) of the Act and Rule 18f-2 under the Act.[3] 
           Applicants also seek an exemption from the Disclosure Requirements to permit a Subabvised Series to disclose (as both a dollar amount and a percentage of the Subadvised Series' net assets): (a) The aggregate fees paid to the Adviser; and (b) the aggregate fees paid to Sub-Advisers; and (c) the fee paid to each Affiliated Sub-Adviser (collectively, “Aggregate Fee Disclosure”).
3. Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the terms and conditions stated in the Application. Such terms and conditions provide for, among other safeguards, appropriate disclosure to Subadvised Series shareholders and notification about sub-advisory changes and enhanced Board oversight to protect the interests of the Subadvised Series' shareholders.
4. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions from any provisions of the Act, or any rule thereunder, if such relief is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants believe that the requested relief meets this standard because, as further explained in the application, the Investment Management Agreement will remain subject to shareholder approval, while the role of the Sub-Advisers is substantially similar to that of individual portfolio managers, so that requiring shareholder approval of Sub-Advisory Agreements would impose unnecessary delays and expenses on the Subadvised Series. Applicants believe that the requested relief from the Disclosure Requirements meets this standard because it will improve the Adviser's ability to negotiate fees paid to the Sub-Advisers that are more advantageous for the Subadvised Series.

Footnotes

1.
     The initial Subadvised Series is the Vivaldi Multi-Strategy Fund. Applicants request relief with respect to the named Applicants, as well as to any future series of the Trust and any other existing or future registered open-end management company or series thereof that: (a) Is advised by the Adviser; (b) uses the manager of managers structure described in the application; and (c) complies with the terms and conditions of the application (collectively with the initial Subadvised Series, the “Subadvised Series”). The term “Adviser” includes (i) the Adviser, (ii) its successors, and (iii) any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, the Adviser or its successors. For purposes of the requested order, “successor” is limited to an entity resulting from a reorganization into another jurisdiction or a change in the type of business organization.

2.
     The term “Board” includes the board of trustees or directors of a future Subadvised Series, if different.

3.
     The requested relief will not extend to any sub-adviser that is an affiliated person, as defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of a Subadvised Series or the Adviser, other than by reason of serving as a sub-adviser to one or more of the Subadvised Series (“Affiliated Sub-Adviser”).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
