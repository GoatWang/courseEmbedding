Method and structure for reducing contact aspect ratios



Patent number:  7268072
                                            

Abstract:  An intermediate metal plug is used to raise the platform to which contact is to be made. In the illustrated process, a partial bit line plug is formed adjacent a stacked capacitor, and an interlevel dielectric formed over the capacitor. The bit line contact is completed by extending a via from the bit line, formed above the interlevel dielectric, down to the level of the intermediate plug, and the via is filled with metal. The height of the via to be filled is thus reduced by the height of the intermediate plug. In one embodiment, the intermediate plug is slightly shorter than an adjacent container-shaped capacitor. In another embodiment, the intermediate plug is about as high as an adjacent stud capacitor.

Methods for forming a high dielectric film



Patent number:  7192889
                                            

Abstract:  A method of forming a high dielectric oxide film conventionally formed using a post formation oxygen anneal to reduce the leakage current of such film includes forming a high dielectric oxide film on a surface. The high dielectric oxide film has a dielectric constant greater than about 4 and includes a plurality of oxygen vacancies present during the formation of the film. The high dielectric oxide film is exposed during the formation thereof to an amount of atomic oxygen sufficient for reducing the number of oxygen vacancies and eliminating the post formation oxygen anneal of the high dielectric oxide film. Further, the amount of atomic oxygen used in the formation method may be controlled as a function of the amount of oxygen incorporated into the high dielectric oxide film during the formation thereof or be controlled as a function of the concentration of atomic oxygen in a process chamber in which the high dielectric oxide film is being formed.

Method of fabricating a semiconductor device with a wet oxidation with steam process



Patent number:  7176079
                                            

Abstract:  A method of fabricating a semiconductor device includes depositing a dielectric film and subjecting the dielectric film to a wet oxidation in a rapid thermal process chamber. The technique can be used, for example, in the formation of various elements in an integrated circuit, including gate dielectric films as well as capacitive elements. The tight temperature control provided by the RTP process allows the wet oxidation to be performed quickly so that the oxidizing species does not diffuse significantly through the dielectric film and diffuse into an underlying layer. In the case of capacitive elements, the technique also can help reduce the leakage current of the dielectric film without significantly reducing its capacitance.

The first electrode also includes an interface layer extending from a first surface of the bulk layer to the insulating layer. The interface layer is heavily doped with phosphorus so that the depletion region of the first electrode is confined substantially within the interface layer. The method of forming the interface layer comprises depositing a layer of hexamethldisilazane (HMDS) material over the first surface of the bulk layer so that HMDS molecules of the HMDS material chemically bond to the first surface of the bulk layer. The method further comprises annealing the layer of HMDS material in a phosphine ambient so as to replace CH3 methyl groups with PH3 molecules.

Method of processing a transistor gate dielectric film with stem



Patent number:  7064052
                                            

Abstract:  A method of fabricating a semiconductor device includes depositing a dielectric film and subjecting the dielectric film to a wet oxidation in a rapid thermal process chamber. The technique can be used, for example, in the formation of various elements in an integrated circuit, including gate dielectric films as well as capacitive elements. The tight temperature control provided by the RTP process allows the wet oxidation to be performed quickly so that the oxidizing species does not diffuse significantly through the dielectric film and diffuse into an underlying layer. In the case of capacitive elements, the technique also can help reduce the leakage current of the dielectric film without significantly reducing its capacitance.

Methods and apparatus for forming a high dielectric film and the dielectric film formed thereby



Patent number:  6927179
                                            

Abstract:  A method of forming a high dielectric oxide film conventionally formed using a post formation oxygen anneal to reduce the leakage current of such film includes forming a high dielectric oxide film on a surface. The high dielectric oxide film has a dielectric constant greater than about 4 and includes a plurality of oxygen vacancies present during the formation of the film. The high dielectric oxide film is exposed during the formation thereof to an amount of atomic oxygen sufficient for reducing the number of oxygen vacancies and eliminating the post formation oxygen anneal of the high dielectric oxide film. Further, the amount of atomic oxygen used in the formation method may be controlled as a function of the amount of oxygen incorporated into the high dielectric oxide film during the formation thereof or be controlled as a function of the concentration of atomic oxygen in a process chamber in which the high dielectric oxide film is being formed.

Residue free overlay target



Patent number:  6914017
                                            

Abstract:  The present invention includes a residue-free overlay target, as well as a method of forming a residue-residue free overlay target. The residue-free overlay target of the present invention is defined by trenches or pads including a series of raised lines. The raised lines included in the overlay target of the present invention substantially eliminate any surface topography, such as depressions, at the top surface of overlying material layers, and, thereby, prevent accumulation of process residue which may obscure the overlay target and inhibit further processing. The method of the present invention may be accomplished and modified using process technology known in the semiconductor fabrication art and includes providing a semiconductor substrate, depositing a resist layer, patterning the resist, and executing a wet or dry etch to create at least one overlay target according to the present invention.

Method and structure for reducing contact aspect ratios



Patent number:  6878587
                                            

Abstract:  An intermediate metal plug is used to raise the platform to which contact is to be made. In the illustrated process, a partial bit line plug is formed adjacent a stacked capacitor, and an interlevel dielectric formed over the capacitor. The bit line contact is completed by extending a via from the bit line, formed above the interlevel dielectric, down to the level of the intermediate plug, and the via is filled with metal. The height of the via to be filled is thus reduced by the height of the intermediate plug. In one embodiment, the intermediate plug is slightly shorter than an adjacent container-shaped capacitor. In another embodiment, the intermediate plug is about as high as an adjacent stud capacitor.

Method of forming a capacitor dielectric layer



Patent number:  6875707
                                            

Abstract:  A method of forming a capacitor includes forming first and second capacitor electrodes over a substrate. A capacitor dielectric region is formed intermediate the first and second capacitor electrodes, and includes forming a silicon nitride comprising layer over the first capacitor electrode. A silicon oxide comprising layer is formed over the silicon nitride comprising layer. The silicon oxide comprising layer is exposed to an activated nitrogen species generated from a nitrogen-containing plasma effective to introduce nitrogen into at least an outermost portion of the silicon oxide comprising layer. Silicon nitride is formed therefrom effective to increase a dielectric constant of the dielectric region from what it was prior to said exposing. Capacitors and methods of forming capacitor dielectric layers are also disclosed.

Fabrication of semiconductor devices with transition metal boride films as diffusion barriers



Patent number:  6872639
                                            

Abstract:  An integrated circuit has a multi-layer stack such as a gate stack or a digit line stack disposed on a layer comprising silicon. A conductive film is formed on the transition metal boride layer. A process for fabricating such devices can include forming the conductive film using a vapor deposition process with a reaction gas comprising fluorine. In the case of a gate stack, the transition metal boride layer can help reduce or eliminate the diffusion of fluorine atoms from the conductive film into a gate dielectric layer. Similarly, in the case of digit line stacks as well as gate stacks, the transition metal boride layer can reduce the diffusion of silicon from the polysilicon layer into the conductive film to help maintain a low resistance for the conductive film.

Capacitor electrode having an interface layer of different chemical composition formed on a bulk layer



Patent number:  6825522
                                            

Abstract:  An improved capacitor that is less susceptible to the depletion effect and methods for providing the same. The capacitor comprises a first and second electrode and an insulating layer interposed therebetween. The first electrode includes a bulk layer comprising n-doped polysilicon. The first electrode also includes an interface layer extending from a first surface of the bulk layer to the insulating layer. The interface layer is heavily doped with phosphorus so that the depletion region of the first electrode is confined substantially within the interface layer. The method of forming the interface layer comprises depositing a layer of hexamethldisilazane (HMDS) material over the first surface of the bulk layer so that HMDS molecules of the HMDS material chemically bond to the first surface of the bulk layer. The method further comprises annealing the layer of HMDS material in a phosphine ambient so as to replace CH3 methyl groups with PH3 molecules.

Raised-lines overlay semiconductor targets and method of making the same



Patent number:  6822342
                                            

Abstract:  The present invention includes a residue-free overlay target, as well as a method of forming a residue-free overlay target. The residue-free overlay target of the present invention is defined by trenches or pads including a series of raised lines. The raised lines included in the overlay target of the present invention substantially eliminate any surface topography, such as depressions, at the top surface of overlying material layers and, thereby, prevent accumulation of process residue which may obscure the overlay target and inhibit further processing. The method of the present invention may be accomplished and modified using process technology known in the semiconductor fabrication art and includes providing a semiconductor substrate, depositing a resist layer, patterning the resist, and executing a wet or dry etch to create at least one overlay target according to the present invention.
