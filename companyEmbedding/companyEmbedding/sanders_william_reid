Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksMedical Alert SystemsNeed a Medical Alert System?See The #1 Rated Company Near Youbestcompany.com/medical-alertAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. Reid William S MD - CLOSED1932 Alcoa Hwy Ste C280Knoxville, TN 37920(865) 329-40031.6 milesPhysicians & Surgeons, NeurologyAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. Reid, William S, MD266 Joule StAlcoa, TN 37701(865) 329-400313.4 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Reid, William S, MD744 Middle Creek Rd Ste 208Sevierville, TN 37862(865) 329-400323.7 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection4. Williams S Reid MD501 19th St Ste 509Knoxville, TN 37916(865) 329-40030.1 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection5. Reid Elizabeth A MD1451 Dowell Springs BlvdKnoxville, TN 37909(865) 970-98005.1 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection6. Bell, W Reid, MD100 Vermont AveOak Ridge, TN 37830(865) 482-177718.1 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection7. Reid Francis R Md Facs90 Vermont AveOak Ridge, TN 37830(865) 482-889018.1 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection8. Reid, Francis R, MD132 Amanda DrOak Ridge, TN 37830(865) 483-308015.8 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection9. Casey, Robert Reid, MD801 Oak Ridge TpkeOak Ridge, TN 37830(865) 483-317217.6 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection10. High, William R, DDS, MD248 N Peters RdKnoxville, TN 37923(865) 691-09189.1 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection11. Gabbard, William A, MD2001 Laurel Ave Ste 202Knoxville, TN 37916(865) 637-84850.2 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection12. Robinson, William D MD501 20th StKnoxville, TN 37916(865) 546-80400.2 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection13. Terry, William F MD2201 W Clinch AveKnoxville, TN 37916(865) 525-02850.3 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsClinicsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection14. Holmes, William S MD2001 Laurel AveKnoxville, TN 37916(865) 595-41000.2 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection15. Oros William R MD1926 Alcoa Highway, Suite 210.

Purpose of Amendment No. 1            

This Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 13D relating to the common stock               

(the "Securities") of Killearn Properties, Inc.  (the "Issuer")                 

attributable to the filing parties is being made to amend and                   

restate the information contained in the original filing on                     

Schedule 13D with respect to ITEMS 2,  5, and 6.                                

ITEM 2.  The address of Southeastern Asset Management, Inc.,                    

("Southeastern"), the employer of Messrs. Hawkins and Sanders, is               

now 6075 Poplar Ave., Suite 900, Memphis, TN 38119.  Mr. O. Mason               

Hawkins is a Director and is Chairman of the Board and Chief                    

Executive Officer of Southeastern.                                              

ITEM 5.  The number of shares of the Securities of the Issuer                   

presently outstanding have declined from the number outstanding at              

the time of the original filing on Schedule 13D, thereby increasing             

the ownership percentages of the filing parties as originally                   

reported, with the new percentages being as follows:                            

(a) and (b) (i).  Mr. O. Mason Hawkins and his wife, Mrs. Ann         

B. Hawkins: 40,500 shares, or approximately 4.6% of the       

shares outstanding.                                           

(a) and (b) (ii).  Mr. O. Mason Hawkins, individually: 41,500         

shares, or approximately 4.7% of the shares outstanding.
