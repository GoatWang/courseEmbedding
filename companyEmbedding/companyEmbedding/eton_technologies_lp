BE RED CROSS READY
The American Red Cross encourages everyone to be prepared for emergencies and disasters.  Since these events can strike suddenly, individuals and families can make a difference by gathering important emergency supplies, making a plan and being informed. 
Being Red Cross Ready is to join the ranks of the millions of people who are preparing themselves today to face and overcome tomorrow’s emergencies.  Simple preparedness actions can equip people with the necessities that can make all the difference should an emergency occur.
Safe and sound
This all-purpose, rechargeable weather alert radio with solar panel and hand turbine power generator will keep you in the know, on alert, and well connected. No emergency kit is complete without it.
Stay alert
When the “Alert” function is on, the radio will automatically broadcast emergency weather alerts for your area such as hurricanes, tornadoes and severe storms.
Listen up
Stay in tune and up to date with this AM/FM/NOAA weather band digital radio with display and alarm clock. If you want more than just the radio, there’s an AUX-input to play your own tunes. And, when you want to listen alone, just plug in your favorite headphones.
More power to you
The FRX3 powers up in multiple ways—via solar panel, hand crank, built-in rechargeable battery, or traditional batteries.
Ready, set, go
Crank the hand turbine for one minute and you’ll produce enough power for 15-20 minutes of music, news and weather. Or simply charge it in the sun using the built- in solar panel. You can also use the mini USB cable to charge the FRX3’s built-in rechargeable battery or pop in a couple of AAA batteries.
Say hello
To charge your smartphone, simply plug it into the USB port. Power will automatically “dump charge” to your phone, just like plugging into the wall.
Light the way
The bright LED flashlight is always handy…at home, at the office, or even in the car. And the red flashing beacon is ideal for emergencies. Thanks to the glow-in-the-dark locator, the FRX3 is always easy to find.
Award winner!
2012 GOOD DESIGN Award for Etón FRX Field Radio Line. The oldest and world's most recognized program for design excellence worldwide. All awards and winners are posted on the Museum's website at chi-athenaeum.org

  5.0 out of 5 stars
By Dutchy down under (Down under) - See all my reviews
I have been getting into solar stuff some time ago, seeing I reside in Australia it just makes sense, sun is something we have plenty of! and it is free power. I knew the weather station function on this great gadget is not functional here down under, but I just wanted this great little unit. I won't go into the details of all the functions as it explains that well enough on here, but it is very well made, does not feel or look cheap, and the dynamo has that real solid feel to it, I did not buy it via Amazon as they won't ship it down under (why Amazon why?) so I bought it from Cabela's, and their price and shipping cost were really competitive, I even wrote a very positive review and praised Cabela, but for some reason they did not publish the review, so hence I did it via Amazon.
Anyway, great little unit, lots of real usable functions, 5 out of 5 stars for me! would I recommend it? damn yeah, get one you will love it.

By Buschchris1 - See all my reviews
This is a good gift idea for nayonewho spebds time outdoor or has the Zombie Appocolypse in mind. I would like to see a water proof version that is boyant for those who go sailing or fishing or anything were it may get dowsed with water. The cell phone charger was what sold me on it since being able to do that opens up a range of options in an emergency like GPS, maps and even a call to 911 may be possible.
I think this is a great gift idea and good to just have around. Cheers.

 What is the lifetime for my radio's internal battery? 

The internal battery is a Ni-MH battery.  Under normal use conditions the battery can be charged and discharged 500 times or more.  However, if the battery is left to sit completely discharged for more than a couple of months the chemistry in the battery will be altered permanently causing the battery to lose the ability to store a significant amount of charge.  It is best for you to service your device regularly, meaning that they should take the radio out and charge it completely using the USB cable at least once every 6 months, or better, once every quarter.



 How is the FRX3 alert procedure activated? 

Alert
With the antenna pulled up all the way, tune to the strongest of the 7 NOAA weather frequencies and go back to the strongest one. While listening to it, press the ALERT button. The audio goes off, but the radio is still on, constantly monitoring for alerts. When one comes in, it will automatically turn the radio on and you’ll hear the alert.

Integrated, highly customized services for a limited number of clients. 
Highly credentialed team of professionals who understand the unique needs of family clients and the complex environment in which decisions must be considered.

Access to services and benefits through group purchasing power.
Works in tandem with and coordinates the family's other advisers.










								 
	The Business Principles of Eton Advisors were born through collaboration with the Family Office Exchange and through interviews with our clients to confirm the important factors they look for in an advisor firm.

							







Eton only provides unbiased advice, and we partner with high quality specialist providers to bring a full service offering to our clients. We believe that this virtual boutique approach allows our clients to access high quality providers, and reduces the conflict of interest among all involved.

Our firm is 100% Employee Owned with a team average of 30 years of industry experience.
