        investing easy. We’ll be providing you with access to a broader capital pool made up of investors that
        want to participate in projects like yours. We’ll come to you as a single investor, in a manner that is

        efficient.
RealtyShares can become your company’s capital-raising partner. Please contact us at raise@realtyshares.com to discuss your particular project.
What kind of real estate investments can be listed on RealtyShares?
RealtyShares lists investment opportunities involving a variety of real estate property types, including
        multi-family residential, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, and hospitality facilities.
        Single-family residences being used for investment purposes (not owner-occupied) are also the subject of
        many investment opportunities. We generally prefer to finance properties in or near a significant
        metropolitan area, but it all depends on the particular situation.
RealtyShares also offers several different types of financing options. We can do secured real estate
        loans (both first- or second-lien positions); equity financing, usually for properties involving in-place
        cash flow that provide an income component to the investment; and/or “preferred equity” investments
        involving a preferential position in the equity capital structure but with only limited potential upside
        (so that sponsors retain most of the appreciation). If there is a specific property or financing type you
        might be interested in, let us know
        here.
What criteria does RealtyShares have for debt financing?
RealtyShares, through its lending subsidiary RS Lending, Inc., provides business-purposes loans (i.e., no
        owner-occupied properties) secured by both conventional residential properties (such as single-family
        residences) as well as commercial properties (e.g., larger apartment buildings, retail centers, office
        buildings, etc.). We can provide both short-term (usually, 36 months or less) 1st-lien and 2nd-lien debt
        financing on residential properties. We can also provide both bridge or permanent debt financing on
        commercial properties.
RealtyShares looks at a number of criteria in underwriting potential loan opportunities. Generally, we
        look for certain minimum loan-to-cost (LTC) or loan-to-after-repair-value (ARV) criteria. We also like to
        understand the operating plan for the project, and we verify borrower credit and background history.
Each of these criteria vary slightly by situation and loan product; please contact us here to discuss your particular project.
How do you keep my personal information secure?
We go to great lengths to ensure the security of all of our members and our data and use Secure Sockets
        Layer. SSL is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and
        a browser. We use 128-bit encryption, which is the same level of encryption used by top national banks. We
        are also regularly audited by third party security firms to ensure compliance with the most rigorous
        security standards.
For added protection, we never store your banking information on our servers and we automatically log you
        out of your account after 30 minutes of inactivity.
How do you choose which real estate companies can raise money through RealtyShares?
We’re looking for companies with a knowledgeable team and a proven strategy and track record. Among other
        diligence inquiries, we will run background and credit checks on the principals of your company, and will
        perform a more thorough review of each project that is initially thought to be a suitable fit for our
        platform. Once we are comfortable with your team and the investment, we can proceed to the details of
        getting your project listed on our platform.
Currently, we list only a relatively small percentage of all of the prospective projects that are
        brought to us.

* The Class F performance for Cohen & Steers Real Estate Securities Fund and Cohen & Steers Preferred Securities and Income Fund are cumulative since their inception 4/3/17.

1 12-Month Distribution Yield is calculated by adding each fund’s trailing 12-month income distributions, and dividing the sum by the fund’s most recent month ended NAV. Note that the number of income distributions is based on the fund’s distribution payment frequency (i.e., monthly, quarterly or semi-annually) as disclosed in the fund’s prospectus. A fund may pay distributions in excess of its net investment company taxable income and, to the extent this occurs, the distribution yield quoted will include a return of capital. The estimated return of capital for each distribution is  available on this Web site by clicking on the fund’s 12-Month Distribution Yield. However, please note that distributions are subject to recharacterization for tax purposes and the final tax treatment of these distributions will be reported to shareholders after the close of each calendar year on form 1099-DIV. 

2 The SEC yield is calculated by dividing annualized net investment income per share during a 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share as of the close of that period. SEC yield reflects the rate at which the fund is earning income on its current portfolio of securities. Since certain distributions received by the funds from real estate investment trusts (REITs) and master limited partnerships (MLPs) may consist of dividend income, return of capital and capital gains, and the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the year, the SEC yield has been adjusted for the funds that invest significantly in REITs based on estimates of return of capital and capital gains. The SEC 30-Day Yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and is based on the maximum offer price per share. Subsidized (Sub.) yields reflect fee waivers in effect. Without such waivers, yields would be reduced. Unsubsidized (Unsub.) yields do not reflect fee waivers in effect. 

3 12-Month Distribution Yield will fluctuate from month to month, and is not equivalent to the subsidized or unsubsidized 30-day SEC yield of the fund. You should consult each fund’s prospectus for additional information about the Fund’s dividends and distributions policy. 

4 12-Month Distribution Yield for the global and international funds may vary significantly year-over-year due to tax adjustments, and are subject to change from the yields quoted.

5 Cohen & Steers Realty Shares and Cohen & Steers Real Estate Securities Fund  do not currently have a fee waiver in effect. 

The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, if redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Annualized total returns of the open-end funds current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by clicking on the fund name above. 

Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of any U.S. Registered open-end fund carefully before investing. A summary prospectus and prospectus containing this and other information may be obtained by calling 1-800-330-7348 or clicking here. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

P/CF Ratio
The price to cash flow ratio (P/CF) is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. Each holding&#39;s P/CF is the latest closing price divided by the latest fiscal year&#39;s cash flow per share. Negative P/CF ratios are excluded from this calculation.

as of 26-Jul-2017



18.26




P/B Ratio
The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. The book value of a company is a measure of how much a company&#39;s assets are worth assuming the company&#39;s debts are paid off. Each holding&#39;s P/B is the latest closing price divided by the latest fiscal year&#39;s book value per share. Negative book values are excluded from this calculation.

as of 26-Jul-2017

Equity Beta
Beta is a measure of the tendency of securities to move with the market as a whole. A beta of 1 indicates that the security&#39;s price will move with the market. A beta less than 1 indicates the security tends to be less volatile than the market, while a beta greater than 1 indicates the security is more volatile than the market.<br/><br/>Calculated vs. S&amp;P 500

3.05%




12m Trailing Yield
The yield an investor would have received if they had held the fund over the last twelve months assuming the most recent NAV.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.


Funds that concentrate investments in specific industries, sectors, markets or asset classes may underperform or be more volatile than other industries, sectors, markets or asset classes and than the general securities market.


Real estate investment trusts ("REITs") are subject to changes in economic conditions, credit risk and interest rate fluctuations.


Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, a person must receive a copy of "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." Copies of this document may be obtained from your broker, from any exchange on which options are traded or by contacting The Options Clearing Corporation, One North Wacker Dr., Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60606 (1-888-678-4667). The document contains information on options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation. The document discusses exchange traded options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation and is intended for educational purposes. No statement in the document should be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell a security or to provide investment advice. If you need further information, please feel free to call the Options Industry Council Helpline. They will be able to provide you with balanced options education and tools to assist you with your iShares options questions and trading. The Options Industry Council Helpline phone number is 1-888-Options (1-888-678-4667) and its website is www.888options.com.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

4 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 4 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 181 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

 funds
                       




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Below Average because they fall between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks total return through investment in global real estate equity securities.




Strategy



The fund invests at least 80%, and usually substantially all, of its total assets in common stocks and other equity securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S. real estate companies, including real estate investment trusts and similar REIT-like entities. It will invest significantly (at least 40%-unless market conditions are not deemed favorable by the advisor, in which case the fund would invest at least 30%) in real estate companies organized or located outside the U.S. or doing a substantial amount of business outside the U.S. It is non-diversified.


Risk



Real Estate is a cyclical industry that is sensitive to interest rates, economic conditions (both nationally and locally), property tax rates, and other factors. Changes in real estate values or economic downturns can have a significant negative effect on issuers in the real estate industry. Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

� 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
10. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
11. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 6/30/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

We have purchased over 1,700 properties in the last 10 years, but raising capital has always been one of the hardest, most time-intensive things we had to do. RealtyShares has made raising capital basically an afterthought – it is simple, streamlined, and FAST.Alex SifakisPresident, JWB Real Estate CapitalCommon QuestionsWhy should I raise money through RealtyShares?
RealtyShares makes raising capital for your investment much easier. Submitting your investment
        opportunity, receiving approval, listing and funding can all be completed in a fraction of the time
        required to deal with banks or institutional funding channels.
We’ll present your opportunity to investors across the country; investors for whom we make real estate
        investing easy. We’ll be providing you with access to a broader capital pool made up of investors that
        want to participate in projects like yours. We’ll come to you as a single investor, in a manner that is
        legally compliant. We’ll take over all the investor communications chores for our investor pool, while at
        the same time your corporate brand is being elevated through its access to this much broader group. And
        our experience will give you the comfort you want that the funding process is going to be smooth and
        efficient.
RealtyShares can become your company’s capital-raising partner. Please contact us at raise@realtyshares.com to discuss your particular project.
What kind of real estate investments can be listed on RealtyShares?
RealtyShares lists investment opportunities involving a variety of real estate property types, including
        multi-family residential, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, and hospitality facilities.
        Single-family residences being used for investment purposes (not owner-occupied) are also the subject of
        many investment opportunities. We generally prefer to finance properties in or near a significant
        metropolitan area, but it all depends on the particular situation.
RealtyShares also offers several different types of financing options. We can do secured real estate
        loans (both first- or second-lien positions); equity financing, usually for properties involving in-place
        cash flow that provide an income component to the investment; and/or “preferred equity” investments
        involving a preferential position in the equity capital structure but with only limited potential upside
        (so that sponsors retain most of the appreciation). If there is a specific property or financing type you
        might be interested in, let us know
        here.
What criteria does RealtyShares have for debt financing?
RealtyShares, through its lending subsidiary RS Lending, Inc., provides business-purposes loans (i.e., no
        owner-occupied properties) secured by both conventional residential properties (such as single-family
        residences) as well as commercial properties (e.g., larger apartment buildings, retail centers, office
        buildings, etc.). We can provide both short-term (usually, 36 months or less) 1st-lien and 2nd-lien debt
        financing on residential properties. We can also provide both bridge or permanent debt financing on
        commercial properties.
RealtyShares looks at a number of criteria in underwriting potential loan opportunities. Generally, we
        look for certain minimum loan-to-cost (LTC) or loan-to-after-repair-value (ARV) criteria. We also like to
        understand the operating plan for the project, and we verify borrower credit and background history.
Each of these criteria vary slightly by situation and loan product; please contact us here to discuss your particular project.
How do you keep my personal information secure?
We go to great lengths to ensure the security of all of our members and our data and use Secure Sockets
        Layer. SSL is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and
        a browser. We use 128-bit encryption, which is the same level of encryption used by top national banks. We
        are also regularly audited by third party security firms to ensure compliance with the most rigorous
        security standards.
For added protection, we never store your banking information on our servers and we automatically log you
        out of your account after 30 minutes of inactivity.
How do you choose which real estate companies can raise money through RealtyShares?
We’re looking for companies with a knowledgeable team and a proven strategy and track record. Among other
        diligence inquiries, we will run background and credit checks on the principals of your company, and will
        perform a more thorough review of each project that is initially thought to be a suitable fit for our
        platform. Once we are comfortable with your team and the investment, we can proceed to the details of
        getting your project listed on our platform.
Currently, we list only a relatively small percentage of all of the prospective projects that are
        brought to us.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
