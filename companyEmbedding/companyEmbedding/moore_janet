We had a previous attorney for a grandparents visitation case with whom we had not been entirely happy. We decided to look for a new attorney with whom we would be more satisfied. I met Heather and felt at ease with her. She is very friendly and courteous but also very professional. We decided to hire her as our attorney and it was a decision that we have not regretted in the least. Her communication and response time was excellent. Our previous attorney had left us in the dark about a lot of case information, but Heather made sure to keep us up to date on anything of importance. She was prompt in responding to all of my many emails and returning any calls that might have been made as well. Many attorneys take on too many cases and then cannot differentiate the details of any of them this was not the case with Heather. I could tell that she had taken the time to familiarize herself with our information to the point that a conversation would be from off the hand knowledge and not a file. I also felt that she truly cared about our desires in our cases and knew what we hoped for as far as the outcome of each. Heather did an excellent job and was very professional in her legal procedure. I have found that many attorneys do not follow procedure anymore but this was not the case with Heather. In doing her job correctly and diligently she forced the opposing counsel to take notice of the facts and information that was laid in front of them as well. Heather was successful in winning both cases for us in the end and helping to allow us to keep the well being of our family at heart. She was pleasant, professional, and prompt which are qualities that many today have lost touch with. I would highly recommend her to any who want or need to have a positive outcome in any litigation. Thank You Heather for the hard work and dedication you have given our family. Law Office of Kathryn L Hudsonkassandra.bibas.7 ratedKathie is the best attorney I'...Kathie is the best attorney I've ever worked with.  Her level of support, care, knowledge, expertise, and delivery of results is uncomparable to any of the 4 attorneys I worked with prior to her.  Engaged in an out-of-state custody battle for my 3 children, I was able to call Kathie's office, have an initial consultation with her same day, and retain an attorney who REALLY advocated on behalf of my children.  She understood my case.  She knew what needed to be done.  She stayed on top of the case every second of the way and kept me informed via communication ALL  of the time.  I've never had an attorney experience like this and Kathie is the entire reason that I was given custody of my 3 children.  I couldn't have done it without her help.  She is, by far, one of the best (if not THE best) attorney I know of and she is worth every bit of time and money invested.  If you want a legal affair handled correctly the first time, call Kathie.  Most importantly, she cares and her care makes her a fierce advocate of your needs as a person dealing with a legal issue that you probably never thought you'd have to deal with.  She's AMAZING! Tripcony May & Associatessimontaylor ratedWell my dealings have been wit...Well my dealings have been with Heather May , and I rarely write reviews BUT i have to make an exception here .Heather May is EXCEPTIONAL as an attorneyAbsolutely exceptional .

I could go on and on and on.i am an English guy and i came across Heather through a surrogacy arrangement i had . She was just amazing . NOTHING was too much trouble for Heather . She went far far beyond doing the law side of the role and helped me immensely . I couldnt have managed in Arkansas without her and i mean that .i am a business man with my own business in the UK . I employ 80 staff of my own but i can say , with my heart on my heart , that Heather May is one on her ownI would RECOMMEND her as a lawyer , without any hesitation .IF YOU NEED AN ATTORNEY in Arkansas, in my opinion , look no further . You have found the best .I wont ever lose contact with Heather and i am happy for anyone to contact me to discuss further why i recommend Heather May and Tripcony, May and Associates of Little Rock, ArkansasSimon Taylor, UKFiles JasonAmy G. ratedMr. Files represented me as the defendant and custodial parent in my paternity, custody, and child support case. I found him to be patient, collected, thorough, and attentive in his legal counsel. He was quick to respond to my emails when needed. I always felt that he was on my team. He is not one of these lawyers who will fill my head with what I wanted to hear just to make a buck, but what I needed to hear to be reasonably prepared for this process. I found him to be very rational, honest and upfront. In the end he helped to represent my position with the judge regarding my ability to protect my child from her father's alcoholism and general unfitness while still allowing for an opportunity for him to have the healthiest possible relationship with her as I requested. His thoughtful counsel and representation earned us a very satisfactory final ruling to meet my family's needs despite having three different judges presiding over our case. Collins, Collins, and Ray Law Firm PAMichael T. ratedThe best word I can use to describe this firm is victorious. This group of attorneys have developed the scientific and legal knowledge essential to challenging the legitimacy of a  DWI case. In addition, John Collins' skill set in the trial arena is second to none. Very impressive!!! Finally, their professionalism is unremarkable. Always punctual and consistently send upcoming court/trial dates in a timely manner months in advance. Although pricey, the results they deliver for many individuals such as myself, are priceless!!! I myself had significant skepticism, however, after witnessing this firm in action, I can honestly say that they are the best around for delivering efficient and effective legal representation for DWI cases.Tripcony May & AssociatesStephanie H. ratedIf you are looking for a great group of attorneys then Tripcony, May, and Associates is the place to go.  We have had representation by Mr. Tripcony, and couldn't have been more pleased.  He has put in so much of his time.  He and his staff are all very meticulous, ethical, well-organized attorneys.  Mr. Tripcony is a lawyer that will assist you in what is best or what would be in your best interest.  He has no problem being upfront and honest with his clients.  Their office staff is all down to earth and the legal assistants in this office know their stuff.  You would be making a wise choice retaining any of these attorneys.  Tripcony May & Associatesmyfirstreview ratedHeather M May was our surrogac...Heather M May was our surrogacy attorney and we could not have been any happier!  We did a LOT of research and after interviewing several other firms it was clear she is in a league of her own! Her extensive experience is invaluable and she was always very prompt in ALL of  the legal aspects of surrogacy. She is professional, timely, helpful, and exceeded our expectations!  She went far beyond her commitments as our attorney to accommodate so many questions that arose.  She is simply exceptional and we HIGHLY recommend her!Dodds, Kidd Ryan Attorneys at LawThuy T. ratedThank you very much Mr Brannon Sloan, he has had such a wonderful heart very helpful to help me with my questions about my brother case. If anyone need lawyer Mr Brannon Sloan he is the one can help you with his experience and loving heart I am very sure he can help in any law matter. They have tons of lawyers out there, but help you and your family get the right one. Again thank you very much for your help Mr Brannon Sloan. Terry NguyenTraylor Daniel MKerry M. ratedThe only lawyer I have ever met that listens. Most lawyers starting nodding and interrupt you before you have even finished asking the question or explaining. And so often they have misjudged what you are about to say. In addition, I find many lawyers are hostile and want to stick it to the other person, when actually you just want a fair settlement with as few hard feelings as possible.Wren Law FirmHouston N. ratedI had a personal injury car wreck claim and they far exceeded my expections! The entire staff is so very friendly and professional. Will definitely use them again if I ever need to.   I highly reccomend them to anyone who needs help with their car accident injury claim,  workers comp hurt on the job claim or a social seciurity claim.  They truly are the best!Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
