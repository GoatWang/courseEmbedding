Opening the door to the best local experiences for travelers since 1959, Red Lion has built a legacy on paving the way to great adventures on the West Coast. Never forfeiting service or convenience for the sake of status or over-the-top luxury, we pride ourselves on knowing the best mom n’ pop diner and the most delicious burger nearby, where to get a local brew and catch the sports game, that secret fishing spot only the locals know about and the kind of hiking trail that natives only whisper about. After a day of adventure, retreat to an inviting guest room with comfortable beds and free Wi-Fi, and hotel features that support your unique pursuits. Whether you are staying in one of our affordable hotels in British Columbia or the Pacific Northwest for leisure or business, you can count on warm service, restful sleep and the kind of local knowledge you simply won’t find elsewhere. A stay at a RLH Corporation hotel will guarantee you many things, but this most of all — local wisdom. So play, rest, work, do it all, or do nothing at all, but be sure to do so with great rates and friendly service at RLH Corporation.

FAQ


1. When was Hello Rewards launched?
Hello Rewards was launched on December 15, 2014 for Red Lion Hotels. As of January 1, 2016 GuestHouse and Settle Inn properties were added to the program and as of May 1, 2017 all Economy Brands were added to the program.
2. How do I enroll in Hello Rewards?
The easiest way to enroll in Hello Rewards and start earning your perks is by going to our Sign Up page. You can also enroll through our 24-hour Member Service Center at 888-606-0563
3. Is Hello Rewards a stay based or points based program? What benefits do members earn?


                        RLHC introduced Hello Rewards, our stay based guest recognition program, to reward and knowingly recognize our members with more perks and benefits than a traditional points-based loyalty program. Not only do members earn free stays quicker with Hello Rewards --a Free Night is earned after every 7 qualified stays-- you’ll, be surprised and delighted with special perks curated just for you. Even better, you don't have to be an “elite member” to be rewarded for your membership.
                    
Membership benefits include

A Free Night every 7 qualified stays 
Express check-in and check-out
Late check-out (when available)
Room upgrades (when available)
Exclusive Hello Rewards member-only offers


4. Will I get a membership card after enrolling?
In order to make membership as simple as possible (not to mention  more green), Hello Rewards members do not need a physical membership card in order to receive any membership perks and thus will not be sent membership cards after enrollment. Should you need any of your membership information, simply visit your online Member Portal.
5. I can’t remember my password to the member portal. How do I get into my account?

                    Click the Forgot Password link on the Member Portal sign in page to have a password reset link sent to your email address on file.
                
6. I have a past stay that is not on my account. How do I get credit for that?

                    Hello Rewards members can request a review of past stays from up to six months prior by visiting the Member Portal and we will be happy to help you.
                
7. Do my stay credits expire?
Stay credits will expire if your account is inactive for 18 months. You must have at least one (1) stay associated with your account within a consecutive, 18-month time period to keep your Hello Rewards account active.
8. What brands are considered Economy Brand or Mid-Scale and Full Service?

                    Please refer to the Terms & Conditions to review the individual brands that are designated as Economy Brand or Mid-Scale and Full Service.

Once two (2) Tokens are earned, you can choose to redeem that for a Mid-Scale and Full Service Free Night. Simply call our 24-hour Member Service Center at 888-606-0563 to redeem Token(s) for Free Night(s).

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.91      Net Money Flow ($)  -2,458    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.







2



Followed by a trip
When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.







3



And finally, a review
After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.




If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.

Booking.com is part of The Priceline Group, the world leader in online travel & related services.




























Verified reviews from real guests.We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from real, verified guests.


How does it work?




1



It starts with a booking
The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.







2



Followed by a trip
When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.







3



And finally, a review
After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.




If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.

History[edit]
Establishment and diversification[edit]
The company originated as a property management and commercial development company when it was founded in Spokane, Washington in 1937 under the name Goodale & Barbieri Company. In 1976, Goodale & Barbieri acquired the River Inn in Spokane, launching the company into the hotel business.[2] The Cavanaughs brand name was later created in 1980 for its hotel operations. By 1987, the company established a computerized event ticketing company, G&B Select A Seat, which is now known as TicketsWest.
1990s–2000s: IPO, acquisitions, and rebranding[edit]




Red Lion Hotels Corporation headquarters


Preparing for an Initial Public Offering, Goodale & Barbieri Company adopted its hotel brand into its corporate identity in 1997, changing its name to Cavanaughs Hospitality Corporation. The IPO was completed in April 1998, and Cavanaughs began trading under the ticker CVH.[3] By the end of 1999,[4] Cavanaughs announced it would acquire its regional rival, Seattle-based WestCoast Hotels, Inc. with transaction closing on January 7, 2000.[5] On March 1, 2000, the combined company began trading under the new ticker, WEH.[6] Recognizing the broader geographic reach of the WestCoast name, Cavanaughs also changed its name to WestCoast Hospitality Corporation with the launch of its new stock ticker and announced plans to rebrand its hotels into the WestCoast name.[7]
In addition to the expanded hotel portfolio following the acquisition of WestCoast, the company also announced plans to franchise properties under its brand.[8]
By 2001, the company grew again; this time by announcing it would acquire the Red Lion Hotels and Inns brand and properties (along with several other DoubleTree properties) from Hilton Hotels.[9] Capitalizing on the Red Lion brand, a majority of the company's WestCoast Hotels properties were rebranded to the Red Lion name within the two years following the acquisition. In September 2005, further realizing the revitalization of the Red Lion name, WestCoast Hospitality Corporation assumed its present-day name, Red Lion Hotels Corporation.
In 2006, RLHC divested its property development operations by spinning-off that segment into an independent entity, G&B Real Estate Companies.
2010s: Acquisitions and major expansion[edit]
Red Lion Hotels Corporation further expanded its hotel operations. In October 2014, RLHC announced a new upscale conversion brand, Hotel RL. In April 2015, RLHC acquired GuestHouse International, LLC and its two brands, GuestHouse International and Settle Inn & Suites, from Boomerang Hotels in a deal with up to $10 million.[10][11] The acquisition more than doubled Red Lion's size from 57 properties to 130[12] properties and added 5,187 rooms to its portfolio.[13]
In September 2016, RLHC acquired Vantage Hospitality Group and its brands Vantage Hotels, Americas Best Value Inn, Canadas Best Value Inn, Lexington by Vantage, America's Best Inns and Suites, Country Hearth Inns, Jameson Inns, Signature Inn, and 3 Palms Hotels & Resorts.[14][15]
Following up on its acquisition of Vantage and its nine brands, RLHC pared down its brand lineup and positioning in May 2017 to eliminate market position overlaps and provide its franchisees the flexibility to move between brands. In addition to retiring the Vantage name, the announcement eliminated five of the nine Vantage brands — keeping only Signature Inn, Americas Best Value Inn, Canadas Best Value Inn, and Country Hearth Inn & Suites. All five of Red Lion's pre-acquisition brands were maintained.[16] The eliminated Vantage brands competed directly with Red Lion's existing brands and/or had a very small footprint. With the brand realignment, RLHC also subdivided its economy segment into three tiers — upper economy, economy, and lower economy — and promoted its existing GuestHouse brand to the upper economy segment.
Red Lion brands[edit]
Hotels[edit]
Red Lion Hotels Corporation operates nine hotel brands[17], covering a broad range of market segments from economy to upscale:
Upscale[edit]

Hotel RL

Upper midscale[edit]

Red Lion Hotels

Midscale select service[edit]

Red Lion Inn & Suites

Midscale extended stay[edit]

Settle Inn Extended Stay

Affordable boutique[edit]

Signature Inn

Upper economy[edit]

Guest House Inn and Suites

Economy[edit]

Americas Best Value Inn
Canadas Best Value Inn

Lower economy[edit]

Country Hearth Inn & Suites

Franchising[edit]
The Franchise Segment licenses the Red Lion brand to third-party hotel owners. As of 2009 there were approximately 17 franchised Red Lion hotels. Hotel owners can franchise as either a full service Red Lion Hotel, which offer restaurant and banquet meeting space; a limited service Red Lion Inn & Suites; or under the Leo Hotel Collection, for unique, boutique or historic hotels.[18] The Las Vegas Hotel & Casino was the first hotel to join the Leo Collection in February 2013.[19]
Entertainment Segment (TicketsWest)[edit]
Founded in 1987 as G&B Select-A-Seat, TicketsWest offers a state of the art ticketing solution that includes a robust website, a point and click single event and season/subscription ticketing system with added functionality for integrated group sales, secondary sales, added-value item sales, access control and fund raising management. All of these features, combined with the unique flexibility to allow patrons to print their tickets in the convenience of their home or office define TicketsWest as the leader in computerized ticketing. TicketsWest has developed a reputation for being the most dynamic and versatile computerized ticketing system in the United States. TicketsWest, on average, accounts for approximately 9% of revenue.[20]
Loyalty program[edit]
RLHC operates a loyalty program called Hello Rewards.
Controversies[edit]
In mid-2008 Columbia Pacific Opportunity Fund, an investment manager for the Baty family, the Seattle founders of Emeritus Corporation, submitted an unsolicited acquisition offer of $9.50 per share to acquire Red Lion.[21] At the time, Columbia Pacific held 12.7 percent of Red Lion.
By October Columbia Pacific had withdrawn its offer and, shortly thereafter, the Red Lion board of directors enacted a poison pill plan, drawing the ire of Columbia Pacific who stated its belief that Red Lion should be liquidated because company-owned assets were in "excess of Red Lion's market capitalization."[22]
Later that year, after the share price increased significantly, Red Lion removed its poison pill.

History[edit]
Establishment and diversification[edit]
The company originated as a property management and commercial development company when it was founded in Spokane, Washington in 1937 under the name Goodale & Barbieri Company. In 1976, Goodale & Barbieri acquired the River Inn in Spokane, launching the company into the hotel business.[2] The Cavanaughs brand name was later created in 1980 for its hotel operations. By 1987, the company established a computerized event ticketing company, G&B Select A Seat, which is now known as TicketsWest.
1990s–2000s: IPO, acquisitions, and rebranding[edit]




Red Lion Hotels Corporation headquarters


Preparing for an Initial Public Offering, Goodale & Barbieri Company adopted its hotel brand into its corporate identity in 1997, changing its name to Cavanaughs Hospitality Corporation. The IPO was completed in April 1998, and Cavanaughs began trading under the ticker CVH.[3] By the end of 1999,[4] Cavanaughs announced it would acquire its regional rival, Seattle-based WestCoast Hotels, Inc. with transaction closing on January 7, 2000.[5] On March 1, 2000, the combined company began trading under the new ticker, WEH.[6] Recognizing the broader geographic reach of the WestCoast name, Cavanaughs also changed its name to WestCoast Hospitality Corporation with the launch of its new stock ticker and announced plans to rebrand its hotels into the WestCoast name.[7]
In addition to the expanded hotel portfolio following the acquisition of WestCoast, the company also announced plans to franchise properties under its brand.[8]
By 2001, the company grew again; this time by announcing it would acquire the Red Lion Hotels and Inns brand and properties (along with several other DoubleTree properties) from Hilton Hotels.[9] Capitalizing on the Red Lion brand, a majority of the company's WestCoast Hotels properties were rebranded to the Red Lion name within the two years following the acquisition. In September 2005, further realizing the revitalization of the Red Lion name, WestCoast Hospitality Corporation assumed its present-day name, Red Lion Hotels Corporation.
In 2006, RLHC divested its property development operations by spinning-off that segment into an independent entity, G&B Real Estate Companies.
2010s: Acquisitions and major expansion[edit]
Red Lion Hotels Corporation further expanded its hotel operations. In October 2014, RLHC announced a new upscale conversion brand, Hotel RL. In April 2015, RLHC acquired GuestHouse International, LLC and its two brands, GuestHouse International and Settle Inn & Suites, from Boomerang Hotels in a deal with up to $10 million.[10][11] The acquisition more than doubled Red Lion's size from 57 properties to 130[12] properties and added 5,187 rooms to its portfolio.[13]
In September 2016, RLHC acquired Vantage Hospitality Group and its brands Vantage Hotels, Americas Best Value Inn, Canadas Best Value Inn, Lexington by Vantage, America's Best Inns and Suites, Country Hearth Inns, Jameson Inns, Signature Inn, and 3 Palms Hotels & Resorts.[14][15]
Following up on its acquisition of Vantage and its nine brands, RLHC pared down its brand lineup and positioning in May 2017 to eliminate market position overlaps and provide its franchisees the flexibility to move between brands. In addition to retiring the Vantage name, the announcement eliminated five of the nine Vantage brands — keeping only Signature Inn, Americas Best Value Inn, Canadas Best Value Inn, and Country Hearth Inn & Suites. All five of Red Lion's pre-acquisition brands were maintained.[16] The eliminated Vantage brands competed directly with Red Lion's existing brands and/or had a very small footprint. With the brand realignment, RLHC also subdivided its economy segment into three tiers — upper economy, economy, and lower economy — and promoted its existing GuestHouse brand to the upper economy segment.
Red Lion brands[edit]
Hotels[edit]
Red Lion Hotels Corporation operates nine hotel brands[17], covering a broad range of market segments from economy to upscale:
Upscale[edit]

Hotel RL

Upper midscale[edit]

Red Lion Hotels

Midscale select service[edit]

Red Lion Inn & Suites

Midscale extended stay[edit]

Settle Inn Extended Stay

Affordable boutique[edit]

Signature Inn

Upper economy[edit]

Guest House Inn and Suites

Economy[edit]

Americas Best Value Inn
Canadas Best Value Inn

Lower economy[edit]

Country Hearth Inn & Suites

Franchising[edit]
The Franchise Segment licenses the Red Lion brand to third-party hotel owners. As of 2009 there were approximately 17 franchised Red Lion hotels. Hotel owners can franchise as either a full service Red Lion Hotel, which offer restaurant and banquet meeting space; a limited service Red Lion Inn & Suites; or under the Leo Hotel Collection, for unique, boutique or historic hotels.[18] The Las Vegas Hotel & Casino was the first hotel to join the Leo Collection in February 2013.[19]
Entertainment Segment (TicketsWest)[edit]
Founded in 1987 as G&B Select-A-Seat, TicketsWest offers a state of the art ticketing solution that includes a robust website, a point and click single event and season/subscription ticketing system with added functionality for integrated group sales, secondary sales, added-value item sales, access control and fund raising management. All of these features, combined with the unique flexibility to allow patrons to print their tickets in the convenience of their home or office define TicketsWest as the leader in computerized ticketing. TicketsWest has developed a reputation for being the most dynamic and versatile computerized ticketing system in the United States. TicketsWest, on average, accounts for approximately 9% of revenue.[20]
Loyalty program[edit]
RLHC operates a loyalty program called Hello Rewards.
Controversies[edit]
In mid-2008 Columbia Pacific Opportunity Fund, an investment manager for the Baty family, the Seattle founders of Emeritus Corporation, submitted an unsolicited acquisition offer of $9.50 per share to acquire Red Lion.[21] At the time, Columbia Pacific held 12.7 percent of Red Lion.
By October Columbia Pacific had withdrawn its offer and, shortly thereafter, the Red Lion board of directors enacted a poison pill plan, drawing the ire of Columbia Pacific who stated its belief that Red Lion should be liquidated because company-owned assets were in "excess of Red Lion's market capitalization."[22]
Later that year, after the share price increased significantly, Red Lion removed its poison pill.

History[edit]
Establishment and diversification[edit]
The company originated as a property management and commercial development company when it was founded in Spokane, Washington in 1937 under the name Goodale & Barbieri Company. In 1976, Goodale & Barbieri acquired the River Inn in Spokane, launching the company into the hotel business.[2] The Cavanaughs brand name was later created in 1980 for its hotel operations. By 1987, the company established a computerized event ticketing company, G&B Select A Seat, which is now known as TicketsWest.
1990s–2000s: IPO, acquisitions, and rebranding[edit]




Red Lion Hotels Corporation headquarters


Preparing for an Initial Public Offering, Goodale & Barbieri Company adopted its hotel brand into its corporate identity in 1997, changing its name to Cavanaughs Hospitality Corporation. The IPO was completed in April 1998, and Cavanaughs began trading under the ticker CVH.[3] By the end of 1999,[4] Cavanaughs announced it would acquire its regional rival, Seattle-based WestCoast Hotels, Inc. with transaction closing on January 7, 2000.[5] On March 1, 2000, the combined company began trading under the new ticker, WEH.[6] Recognizing the broader geographic reach of the WestCoast name, Cavanaughs also changed its name to WestCoast Hospitality Corporation with the launch of its new stock ticker and announced plans to rebrand its hotels into the WestCoast name.[7]
In addition to the expanded hotel portfolio following the acquisition of WestCoast, the company also announced plans to franchise properties under its brand.[8]
By 2001, the company grew again; this time by announcing it would acquire the Red Lion Hotels and Inns brand and properties (along with several other DoubleTree properties) from Hilton Hotels.[9] Capitalizing on the Red Lion brand, a majority of the company's WestCoast Hotels properties were rebranded to the Red Lion name within the two years following the acquisition. In September 2005, further realizing the revitalization of the Red Lion name, WestCoast Hospitality Corporation assumed its present-day name, Red Lion Hotels Corporation.
In 2006, RLHC divested its property development operations by spinning-off that segment into an independent entity, G&B Real Estate Companies.
2010s: Acquisitions and major expansion[edit]
Red Lion Hotels Corporation further expanded its hotel operations. In October 2014, RLHC announced a new upscale conversion brand, Hotel RL. In April 2015, RLHC acquired GuestHouse International, LLC and its two brands, GuestHouse International and Settle Inn & Suites, from Boomerang Hotels in a deal with up to $10 million.[10][11] The acquisition more than doubled Red Lion's size from 57 properties to 130[12] properties and added 5,187 rooms to its portfolio.[13]
In September 2016, RLHC acquired Vantage Hospitality Group and its brands Vantage Hotels, Americas Best Value Inn, Canadas Best Value Inn, Lexington by Vantage, America's Best Inns and Suites, Country Hearth Inns, Jameson Inns, Signature Inn, and 3 Palms Hotels & Resorts.[14][15]
Following up on its acquisition of Vantage and its nine brands, RLHC pared down its brand lineup and positioning in May 2017 to eliminate market position overlaps and provide its franchisees the flexibility to move between brands. In addition to retiring the Vantage name, the announcement eliminated five of the nine Vantage brands — keeping only Signature Inn, Americas Best Value Inn, Canadas Best Value Inn, and Country Hearth Inn & Suites. All five of Red Lion's pre-acquisition brands were maintained.[16] The eliminated Vantage brands competed directly with Red Lion's existing brands and/or had a very small footprint. With the brand realignment, RLHC also subdivided its economy segment into three tiers — upper economy, economy, and lower economy — and promoted its existing GuestHouse brand to the upper economy segment.
Red Lion brands[edit]
Hotels[edit]
Red Lion Hotels Corporation operates nine hotel brands[17], covering a broad range of market segments from economy to upscale:
Upscale[edit]

Hotel RL

Upper midscale[edit]

Red Lion Hotels

Midscale select service[edit]

Red Lion Inn & Suites

Midscale extended stay[edit]

Settle Inn Extended Stay

Affordable boutique[edit]

Signature Inn

Upper economy[edit]

Guest House Inn and Suites

Economy[edit]

Americas Best Value Inn
Canadas Best Value Inn

Lower economy[edit]

Country Hearth Inn & Suites

Franchising[edit]
The Franchise Segment licenses the Red Lion brand to third-party hotel owners. As of 2009 there were approximately 17 franchised Red Lion hotels. Hotel owners can franchise as either a full service Red Lion Hotel, which offer restaurant and banquet meeting space; a limited service Red Lion Inn & Suites; or under the Leo Hotel Collection, for unique, boutique or historic hotels.[18] The Las Vegas Hotel & Casino was the first hotel to join the Leo Collection in February 2013.[19]
Entertainment Segment (TicketsWest)[edit]
Founded in 1987 as G&B Select-A-Seat, TicketsWest offers a state of the art ticketing solution that includes a robust website, a point and click single event and season/subscription ticketing system with added functionality for integrated group sales, secondary sales, added-value item sales, access control and fund raising management. All of these features, combined with the unique flexibility to allow patrons to print their tickets in the convenience of their home or office define TicketsWest as the leader in computerized ticketing. TicketsWest has developed a reputation for being the most dynamic and versatile computerized ticketing system in the United States. TicketsWest, on average, accounts for approximately 9% of revenue.[20]
Loyalty program[edit]
RLHC operates a loyalty program called Hello Rewards.
Controversies[edit]
In mid-2008 Columbia Pacific Opportunity Fund, an investment manager for the Baty family, the Seattle founders of Emeritus Corporation, submitted an unsolicited acquisition offer of $9.50 per share to acquire Red Lion.[21] At the time, Columbia Pacific held 12.7 percent of Red Lion.
By October Columbia Pacific had withdrawn its offer and, shortly thereafter, the Red Lion board of directors enacted a poison pill plan, drawing the ire of Columbia Pacific who stated its belief that Red Lion should be liquidated because company-owned assets were in "excess of Red Lion's market capitalization."[22]
Later that year, after the share price increased significantly, Red Lion removed its poison pill.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
