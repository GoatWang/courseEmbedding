                    In June 2003, Truett Craft purchased a 150-acre agricultural tract near the southwest corner of Frankford and 98th Street located in the Lubbock-Cooper Independent School District.  The initial Master Plan called for 470 single-family residences and 88 garden homes.  Truett designed the location for the garden homes in the center of the subdivision with only one entrance.  It was his expectation to have an ideal quiet location with rear entry garages for retirees. 

Truett wanted the subdivision to be complete with an elementary school and a church.  Truett was the son of a Methodist preacher and he donated the southwest corner of 98th and Frankford to St. Luke's Methodist Church.  

Lakewood Estates was built in a series of cul-de-sacs that includes triple cul-de-sacs that give an added measure of security to the addition.
The main builders in the subdivision for single-family homes are: Creative Homes, David Rogers Homes, Gerald Long Builders, Kim Craig Construction, and Art Cuevas.  Garden home builders include: Joanie Coles, Truett Craft, and Art Cuevas

                    Atascadero has the charm and history of the early 1900's. When you pull into town you instantly feel the "small town" feel. A great place to raise your kids and centrally located between Paso Robles and San Luis Obispo. Just miles away from the coast as well. Take a step back in time and visit the Historic City Hall.

                    Drive-Thru Pickup
                

                    This option is available for our in-stock and special order items.  Simply order online and drive to one of our store/warehouse locations to pick up your order.  Due to the limited availability and specific qualities of our special order products, NFM must assess a 25% non-refundable deposit.  This deposit must be made with a major credit or debit card.  We offer an option that allows you to use your Nebraska Furniture Mart Card for the remainder of the balance.  To complete an order this way, please call our Phone Sales Team at 800-336-9136.
                



                    Driveway Delivery
                

                    On your scheduled delivery date, you’ll be given a 2-hour time window that you can expect to receive your delivery. Our drivers can also call ahead of time if it has been requested. With Driveway Delivery, our delivery drivers will place your items on the nearest sidewalk, driveway, or inside your garage. The items will be left in their factory packaging. If you live in an apartment or if you cannot safely move the items into your home, you should consider upgrading to In-Home Delivery.
                



                    In-Home Delivery
                

                    With this White Glove Delivery Service, you will receive a phone call 48 hours prior to your delivery that will set up and confirm a two hour window for your item’s scheduled arrival.  At that time, delivery agents will bring the product(s) into your home, uncrate them, and place them in the area of your choice. They will also remove any of the packaging material from your home. However, this does not include the setup of Ready to Assemble products. For guidelines and what to expect, please see our Home Delivery FAQ  page.  If you have any questions about assembly please call our Phone Sales Team at 800-336-9136.
In-Home Gun Safe Delivery 
Because of the size and weight of gun safes there is an additional charge of $99 for in home delivery that will be added to the price of the regular in home delivery at the time of purchase.  Any additional installation including the removal of legs is not included in Gun Safe Delivery and cannot be performed by NFM Delivery Teams.
                



                    Next Day In-Home Delivery
                

                    With Next-Day Delivery, you will receive a call that will set up and confirm a two-hour window for your item’s scheduled arrival. At that time, delivery agents will bring the product(s) into your home, uncrate them, and place them in the area of your choice. They will also remove any of the packaging material from your home. However, this does not include Flooring or the setup of Ready to Assemble products. Purchases made from Midnight to 9:00 PM are eligible for Next Day Delivery. Any purchase made after the 9:00 PM cutoff time will be added to the following day’s queue. For guidelines and what to expect, please see our Home Delivery FAQ  page. If you have any questions about assembly, please call our Phone Sales Team at 800-336-9136.
