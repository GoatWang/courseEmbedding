About Methanol
 








Methanol is an essential ingredient used to produce hundreds of everyday industrial and consumer items. It is also a clean-burning, cost-competitive alternative fuel.
What is methanol?
Also known as methyl alcohol, methanol is a clear liquid chemical that is water soluble and readily biodegradable.
A clean and economic alternative fuel
Methanol is a clean-burning, biodegradable fuel. Increasingly, methanol's environmental and economic advantages are making it an attractive alternative fuel for powering vehicles and ships, cooking food and heating homes.
It’s in everyday products
Methanol is used to produce other chemical derivatives, which in turn are used to produce everyday products, such as building materials, foams, resins, plastics, paints, polyester and a variety of health and pharmaceutical products.

Methanex Corporation is a Canadian company that supplies, distributes and markets methanol worldwide. Methanol is an essential ingredient used to produce hundreds of everyday industrial and consumer items. It is also a clean-burning, cost-competitive alternative fuel. [1]
Methanex is the world’s largest producer and supplier of methanol to major international markets in North America, Asia Pacific, Europe and South America.  Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, Methanex currently operates production sites in Canada, Chile, Egypt, New Zealand, the United States and Trinidad and Tobago.  Its global operations are supported by an extensive global supply chain of terminals, storage facilities and the world’s largest dedicated fleet of methanol ocean tankers. [1]
Methanex Corporation challenged California's plan to eliminate methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) from gasoline on grounds of water pollution prevention, claiming protection under Chapter 11 of NAFTA and demanding $970 million in compensation from the state.[2]
In January 2012, Methanex announced it would move one of its idle Chilean plants to the United States.[3] Methanex later confirmed that they acquired land in Geismar, LA and Geismar would be the site in the United States where the idle Chilean plant would be moved to.[4] Methanex CEO, Bruce Aitken, confirmed in a press release on January 17, 2012 that the reason Methanex was shifting a methanol production plant from Chile to North America, specifically Louisiana, is due to the low price of natural gas available in North America and Louisiana.[5]
Regional marketing offices are located in Belgium, Chile, China, Egypt, Korea, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Waterfront Shipping Ltd.[edit]
Methanex's wholly owned subsidiary, Waterfront Shipping Limited, is a global marine transportation company that operates a fleet of 28 ocean tankers. [6] In 2016, the company announced the delivery of seven first Korean and Japanese built methanol-fueled ocean tankers. [7]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
