SDC Nutrition and Reaction Nutrition Close on Statutory Merger

Mar 17, 2016, 08:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   SDC Nutrition, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


PITTSBURGH, March 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- SDC Nutrition, Inc., a premier nutritional and supplement health supplement manufacturing and brand marketing company specializing in sports nutrition, functional foods, and health and wellness supplements announced their merger with Reaction Nutrition. Reaction Nutrition specializes in sports nutrition and health and wellness capsule manufacturing and brand marketing.  SDC Nutrition said it is building on an existing relationship between two companies with complementary capabilities, personnel and vision. The merger will align 5 major brands and contract manufacturing under SDC Nutrition. The combined company will operate as SDC Nutrition, Inc. located in Pittsburgh, PA.
"Throughout 2015, SDC Nutrition was expanding the infrastructure for powder, capsule and tablet manufacturing and packaging capabilities while simultaneously looking for a strategic acquisition," remarked SDC's CEO, Sean Marszalek. "This was a classic build or buy scenario. The merger aligns with SDC' strategy to accelerate scalability and capability in the business model and support our manufacturing and packaging capabilities across powder, capsule tablet delivery forms. There were many aspects that attracted us to Reaction Nutrition, particularly their management team, revenue and margins, capsule manufacturing capabilities, and their rapidly growing brand, RECOR," says SDC CEO, Sean Marszalek.
"The merger provides significant synergies including enhanced powder, tablet, capsule manufacturing and packaging capabilities, leadership, improved efficiency and capability, as well as an expanded distribution and fulfillment operations. The merger was a logical step in the evolution and development of the business that creates substantial value for customers and stockholders of both SDC Nutrition and Reaction Nutrition. The merger will benefit customers through new services, broader product offerings, expanded service and quality capabilities," remarked SDC's COO, Dan Kohler. 
"This is an exciting time in our industry. In my view this is a perfect merger, the combination of these two companies are clearly complementary to each other. The combined team is truly extraordinary and deep with experience. We are fortunate to have an executive team that works well together and shares the same vision and goals. With our aggressive growth strategy and increased capacity, we are looking forward to creating more jobs in the Greater Pittsburgh community," says Reaction Nutrition CEO, Frank Bedoloto. 
"At SDC, we continue to pursue company growth organically and through strategic acquisition.  The merger with Reaction Nutrition accelerates SDC Nutrition's capsule manufacturing capability and efficiency; and the Reaction Nutrition executive and operating staff strengthens SDC Nutrition's sales, marketing, capsule manufacturing, and business systems expertise to effectively grow the company at a significant pace.  Our common vision and goals of growing as a leading manufacturer and brand marketing company in the nutritional supplement industry, by leading with quality and service, was very apparent when we began discussions several months ago," indicated Ray Boyer, SDC's CFO. 
Financing for the merger was led by First Commonwealth Bank through Pat Fusco, Vice President and Senior Business Banking Officer. Reed Smith acted as the legal advisor and CliftonLarsonAllen (CLA) served as financial advisor for the merger. 
About SDC NutritionSDC Nutrition, Inc. is a health supplement manufacturing company specializing in sports nutrition products. SDC Nutrition's flagship Brand, About Time, is sold in over 3,000 retailers around the world including GNC, Vitamin Shoppe and Sam's Club. In addition, they continue to expand their brand offerings to meet the needs of different consumer lifestyles as well as contract manufacture for over 40 companies around the world.  More information can be found at www.SDCnutrition.com.

  Department of Health and Human ServicesPublic Health ServiceFood and Drug Administration College Park, MD  20740  NOV 30, 2015WARNING LETTER VIA OVERNIGHT DELIVERYRETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED Sean MarszalekSDC Nutrition, Inc.d/b/a NVIE Nutrition170 Industry DrivePittsburgh, PA 15275 Re: 483183 Dear Mr. Marszalek: This letter concerns your product NVIE Edge Pro, which is labeled and/or offered for sale as a dietary supplement. Your product labeling lists the substance Picamilon as a dietary ingredient. This ingredient is also called, among other names, pikatropin, pikamilon, nicotinyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid, and nicotinoyl-GABA (hereinafter referred to as picamilon). Under section 201(ff)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)], a dietary ingredient is a vitamin; mineral; herb or other botanical; amino acid; dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of the preceding substances. Picamilon is not a vitamin, a mineral, an herb or other botanical, or an amino acid. In addition, according to our research, picamilon is not a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake. Finally, picamilon is not a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of a vitamin; mineral; herb or other botanical; amino acid; or dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake. Rather, picamilon is a unique chemical entity synthesized from the dietary ingredients niacin and gamma-aminobutyric acid.  As such, it is absorbed into the body, crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in the brain as a separate chemical entity. Because picamilon does not fit in any of the dietary ingredient categories under section 201(ff)(1) of the Act, it is not a dietary ingredient as defined in the Act. Declaring picamilon in your product labeling as a dietary ingredient causes your products marketed as dietary supplements to be misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)] in that the labeling is false or misleading in any particular.  We request that you take prompt action to correct the violation cited above, as well as any other violations associated with your NVIE edge pro product or other products marketed by your firm that list picamilon as a dietary ingredient in the labeling.  It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations. Failure to immediately cease distribution of your NVIE edge pro product, and any other products you market that list picamilon as a dietary ingredient in the labeling, could result in enforcement action by FDA without further notice.  Sections 302 and 304 of the Act provide for seizure of violative  products and injunction against the manufacturers and distributors of violative products [21 U.S.C. §§ 332 and 334].  Additionally, picamilon is not approved as a food additive or prior sanctioned for use in dietary supplements. Further, FDA's review of this substance does not identify a basis to conclude the substance is GRAS for use in food. If you contend that this substance is GRAS for use in food, please provide your basis for concluding that picamilon is GRAS for use in dietary supplements, including supporting data or other documentation. We request that you advise us in writing, within 15 days of receipt of this letter, as to the specific steps that have been or will be taken to correct these violations, including any steps taken with respect to product currently in the marketplace. Your response should also include an explanation of each step taken to ensure that similar violations do not recur, as well as documentation to support your response. Your written reply should be directed to Aaron Dotson, United States Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, Office of Compliance (HFS-608), Division of Enforcement, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835. If you have any questions, please contact Aaron Dotson at aaron.dotson@fda.hss.gov. Sincerely, /S/                                                                        William A. CorrellDirectorOffice of ComplianceCenter for Food Safety    and Applied Nutrition

We offer these same services and turn key manufacturing practices that we take pride in for our own products for you as well. We know how important it is to deal with business partners and manufacturers you can trust who do what they say they will do and that’s the core of what we deliver.

We offer low, minimum order quantities
These dietary supplement formulations have been time tested, refined, and polished to offer the best quality available. Whereas most companies require large initial orders to “qualify” for custom formulating, SDC Nutrition offers low, minimum order quantities per item under your own label. This allows you to get started with your custom formulation without having to incur a large, upfront fee.
Establishing your own brand name of products!
Custom Formulations can be an important step in establishing and maintaining your account base. Marketing products with your name, logo, design, and address on the packaging helps to ensure that customers identify with your company both for initial and repeat purchases.
Custom Formulating is a service that is offered by SDC Nutrition. You may choose to apply your own label or you may elect to establish your own brand name on one or more custom formulations that are exclusive to your company.











Need artwork for your custom formulation?
At SDC Nutrition, it’s no problem!
SDC Nutrition employs a dedicated art department that can design custom labels around your brand. SDC Nutrition also uses a state-of-the-art print department that can facilitate the fulfillment of your custom labels and packaging.
Do you already have artwork or labels for your products? Not a problem, SDC Nutrition can take your pre-designed artwork, pre-printed labels or pre-printed packaging and integrate them seamlessly into our production line. This gives all our customers the maximum amount of flexibility while eliminating extra and un-needed steps.
What about fulfillment and turnaround?
Combine over 100 stock formulations, professional and eye-catching artwork and you’ll find that SDC Nutrition can take your custom formulation quote from inception to quote completion – in as little as 7 to 10 days!
What about support?
When you call SDC Nutrition, don’t be surprised when a real life person answers the phone. And when you become a SDC Nutrition customer, you can expect a dedicated account representative to manage your account personally. We believe in superior customer service and strive to ensure our customer’s needs are always top priority.


3 Step Custom Formulation Process


Step 1: Choose your products
With many forms of delivery systems from protein or pre workout powders to capsules… you may or may not know the specifics of what makes a top selling, top performing formula – but why bother? SDC Nutrition can assist you with your custom formulations to be sure your project is the best quality and value available.
The only thing you need to do is choose which ingredients you’d like to label with your brand. And – our formulation experts will design a perfect dietary supplement product directly to your specifications.
Step 2: Establish your brand
Whether you are a long standing supplement supplier with a well established brand or a start-up company – SDC Nutrition is designed to offer you the ultimate flexibility and artistic quality. With our dedicated, state-of-the-art department – SDC Nutrition can take your design from concept to completion.
If you are looking to mass produce your labels, SDC Nutrition has established long term vendor relationships with massive print houses that can produce anywhere from one hundred thousand to well over a million labels in just a few days.
Step 3: Fulfillment
You can rest easy knowing that SDC Nutrition can fulfill your dietary supplement orders both accurately and efficiently. Utilizing multiple quality checkpoints and a trained staff of over 90 – our facility is always running top notch. Our extensive resources and time tested logistical methodologies allow us to offer complete product fulfillment in as little as 5 business days.

Our art department will work hand-in-hand with you to create an eye-catching label for each dietary supplement product you choose to market.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
