Harsco ended its merger with Brand Energy. That was smart of Harsco. Now, they should look to recover money from Brand’s ex-CEO and the ex-GE people he brought in with him.
The CEO of Brand was negligent. He didn’t act in good faith. He brought in his friends from GE and didn’t fire them no matter what. The ex-GE guy in Houston had to be shuffled all over the country because he was despised. He was called President of Business Development. The former head of Brand Energy Solutions went on crazy twitter rants on politics and religion. He wasn’t fired either because the CEO wouldn’t fire his friends. That’s not good for business. The ex-CEO of Brand should be held liable for this. 
Harsco needs to recover money from the ex-CEO of Brand and ALL of the ex-GE people he brought in with him, especially the ex-GE guy in Houston. They were committed to themselves and not the merger with Harsco. Clayton, Dubilier, and Rice owns Brand Energy. Harsco can work with them to recover money from the ex-CEO and all of the ex-GE people he brought in with him.

HSC Retail Services
HSC offers retail technology services to Retail Technology companies and Retailers in the following areas:

How HSC Engages with customers
HSC's retail engagements center around two key models:

Innovation/Proof of Concepts: These are time limited projects ranging from a few weeks to months, where HSC experts work with our customers (Retail technology ISVs and/or digital innovation teams of retailers) to demonstrate cutting edge concepts. Examples include:
 
Image Analytics to automatically identify shelf product inventory
Customer Analytics via image classification/labeling for the purposes of understanding customers better
Correlation of purchase trends to inventory stocking
Integrating AI chatbots for customer engagements


Product Development 
 
We work with Retail technology ISVs/OEMs to develop/extend/maintain their existing product lines in the areas of:
  
mPOS 
Embedded engineering
Mobility Applications
Analytics and Machine Learning
Testing and Test Automation





Reducing Time to Market with HSC's retail solution components
Acknowleding the gap between what retailers need (custom solutions to meet specific purposes) and what existing products offer (monolithic solutions), HSC took a completely different approach – it worked on developing ‘pluggable components’ that could be customized (added to/skinned down) as much as required for special retailer needs and be put together to offer exactly what the retailer needs, with an open platform for API based upgrades to functionality.
HSC has combined its decade’s worth of experience in wireless, beacons, mobile and machine learning into a seamless customer experience platform. This platform enables retail and hospitality industries to deliver contextual services to consumers as they shop. This platform incorporates advanced image recognition, beaconing, triangulation and WiFi/NFC/BT-LE positioning to be able to accurately locate customers whilst indoor including their orientation.
HSC’s pluggable component based system includes:

A white labelled mobile app,  with ready features like push, shopping cart, contextualized services based on user location
Image Analytics for customer demographics (age/gender/etc) & realtime inventory analysis
Data Analytics for customer behavior, purchase patterns, cross-sell/up-sell, heat maps etc.
Rich visualization dashboards
