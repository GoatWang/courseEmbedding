ClimateStore Could be Your Next One-Stop Shop to Help Save the Earth 
September  6, 2016
The Online store looks to add 1,000 sustainable products with its Indiegogo campaign. Global climate change can often appear as an issue too big for the individual to tackle. Sure, you can reuse your water bottle and bike to work, but these feel like small drops in an all-too-large pond that is growing every day.

Eco startup aims to offer 1000 vetted low-carbon solutions 
March 14, 2016
ClimateStore wants to make choosing low-carbon products simple and easy by curating and vetting each product for its carbon impact. When it comes to reducing the climate impacts of our daily lives, some of the solutions are easy and free (such as turning off lights when you leave the room, or choosing to ride your bike instead of drive), while others will require a bit more effort and money (such as replacing lightbulbs with LEDs, installing low-flow showerheads).

People Want to Stop Climate Change
It’s true. People want to stop climate change. But the problem is many don't know where to start. Our mission is to make it easy. We're building a one-stop-shop for climate change that integrates products, educational resources and more. Our goal is to help people achieve the future we all desire.




























The Movement Is Growing
With each passing year more and more people are convinced that climate change is real. They are realizing that climate friendly living is essential to preserve the natural world we have all come to know. They are searching for solutions and taking positive action. And the good news is – there’s still time to act.



















WE MAKE IT EASY
It's what people want. No more endless searching on the web bouncing from resource to resource. At ClimateStore you can learn about climate change, shop for solutions and make a personal plan. Our core mission is to make it easy to live a climate friendly lifestyle - and we're just getting started.
















Low Carbon Products From Mission Aligned Suppliers
To date we've sourced over 400 low carbon products from 30 suppliers. We organized them into over 40 categories integrating them in blog posts and action plans. We're extremely excited about the pipeline of products from new and existing suppliers who are expanding their eco-friendly offerings.

















Fully Reviewed for Climate Impact
We rank all of our products based on impact. To help sort things out, we developed icons we hope will make things easier. We review all our products for carbon impact and award icons to those that produce fewer greenhouse gases (GHGs) in either the production, use and/or disposal phases of their lifecycle. We also award icons when products produce their own renewable (green) energy, save money or have educational content. And just for fun, we have an icon for staff favorites!



















A Growing Community
We're just starting to grow our community, in the short time short time we've been active on social media, we've grown to a community of ~25K followers, newsletter subscribers and customers. But we're most excited about the quality of mission climate change aligned institutions that are following us.













Long Term Potential & Growth
We believe that ClimateStore has broad potential as a multichannel brand. The five year business model includes revenue streams from direct website and mobile sales, e-mail remarketing, affiliate programs and marketplaces. Affiliate revenues through partnerships are possible with membership driven environmentalorganizations, home energy audit contractors and possibly utilities. Additional could come from referral relationships (e.g. home solar and wind), carbon offset relationships, rewards marketplaces and catalog sales.













How Your Investment Will Help Us
Great content, products and user experience are critical to becoming a world class resource for climate consumers. As such, content generation is our near term focus and what your investment will support. Reaching the target will support product sourcing, curation, and expansion of the ‘take action’ portion of our website. We plan on relaunching our blog, weekly newsletter and primary social media channels. To gain the most impact from the investment, we plan on using a lean model which leverages a network of freelance content experts. Funds in excess of the target we will accelerate content generation using this scalable approach. Marketing efforts will focus on newsletter and community growth on social media channels. With great products, growing awareness and relaunched e-mail marketing we anticipate growing sales momentum. The attached ‘use of funds’ document provides additional details.




































OUR NEXT STEPS: BUILD DEEP CONTENT AND COMMUNITY

       We've been making steady process since founding, but now it's time to notch things up. The first two years were focused more on developing our brand message and early community. We've build a robust Ecommerce site, developed our brand persona and done some test marketing to get feedback. We've learned a lot and gotten some great feedback along the way. With this phase complete, we're excited about deepining our offerings and with enough resources kicking off our go-to-market strategy.

Let's address climate change together


November 18, 2016We're excited to be part of the Wefunder community and to offer this investment to people concerned about climate change.
Climate change is a HUGE issue. People are frustrated with the pace of top down solutions and starting to ask what they can do at home.

We believe retail represents a significant untapped opportunity to support consumers in the coming transition to a more sustainable economy.

Sure, we know shopping isn’t the answer. We need government, businesses, faith communities and more, including a price on carbon. But we also need home energy conservation, products from upcycled materials, smart home tech, sustainably made clothes, and a climate-focused brand for the 1000’s of small companies seeking to bring sustainable products to market. We also need to use the power of brands to build a desirable vision of what a sustainable lifestyle looks like. 

A mission-aligned brand that supports and models better living for the climate has great potential.

If successful, as an early investor you’ll have the opportunity to benefit from a first-in-class direct-to-consumer business with an ambitious goal. You’ll be leveraging the next mega-trend through support of a company focused on solutions to an issue with real implications for current and future generations.

Climate change has been described as the greatest breakdown in science communication in human history. By building a world class brand with educational information, low carbon products and strong community, ClimateStore is positioned to accelerate the transition to a sustainable future.

We hope you'll join us on the journey.

Sincerely,


            Steven Bushnell

                  What is your traction to date?
                  



Even with minimal advertising and an early version of the website, there is early evidence of traction and reception for the brand. This can be seen through growth on social media channels, early sales, robust brand association and customer/follower feedback from primary market research.The brand currently has ~30,000 followers across social media channels and a growing mailing list of ~4,000. With modest effort, the company was attracting 1000-1200 followers a month on twitter and 500/mo on Instagram. Aside from a few pilots, the company has not executed a robust marketing effort to date.We are extremely pleased with the quality of organizations 'following' our social media channels which includes a broad range of environmental, green business, educational, government and international organizations. These have included progressive brands like Ben & Jerry’s, Unilever, Audubon, Treehugger, Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Earth Institute, MIT CoLab, US Fish and Wildlife Service, NASA Goddard Institute, KQEDScience, CeresNews, CarbonBrief, NetImpact, OceanWire and many more.Quarterly sales growth hit a peak of ~28% (12-15% ave mo/mo sales), with only pilot advertising and a non-optimized website. As of 12/31 the company had ~500 orders with $42,000 in revues from ~400 customers. Average order value was $96 for a 12 month period in 2015 and about 5% of customers were repeat buyers without any remarketing. Optimization of the site and implementation of the go-to-market strategy, including professional PR, should accelerate revenue and growth on social media channels.




                  How are you going to make money?
                  



Revenues in the next 18 months will come from direct website sales of products, e-mail marketing,  affiliate partnerships/programs, and 1-2 marketplaces.  Future channels include catalog sales, direct B2B, stores-within stores and brick and mortar stores.  Starting average margins are 46% with a plan to increase to 55% in 4-5 yrs. The current mix of products is 50/50 warehouse/dropship network with a goal of increasing the ratio over time. Use of social media and inbound will decrease % paid ad spend over time.



                  How do you acquire customers?
                  



Our go to market strategy leverages 1.5 years experience with targeted digital advertising, primary market research and social engagement. We have experience reaching out to target customers and the climate community. Tactics include: 1) targeted marketing on social media channels, 2) search engine marketing at the product, category, and issue level, 3) issue display ads on targeted websites, 4) professional PR, 5) low cost sponsorships and 6) affiliate relationships with mission aligned organizations. KPIs include email signups, remarketing lists, orders and conversion rates.




                  Does ClimateStore have international potential?
                  



Climate change is a global issue. We're already seeing customer interest from around the world. With additional resources we look forward to expanding in North America and will certainly consider international opportunities through partnerships and other mechanisms.




                  How will you have social and environmental impact?
                  



Climate change has been described as the greatest breakdown is scientific communication in human history. There is also a false perception that low carbon living is about giving things up. Our goal is to build a positive stylish vision of a climate friendly lifestyle. Sure, we don’t have Exxon's PR budget, but through creative content and community engagement, over time we seek to have a positive impact on social behavior – supporting, educating and encouraging sustainable living in all aspects. The resulting impact will be tangible reductions in carbon emissions through the products and information we offer, and by building and important sales channel for low carbon start-ups seeking to bring products to market.




                  Are you selling any private label products?
                  



No. But we hope to in the future and think the ClimateStore brand will work well in some categories.




                  Why should I invest?
                  



The timing for a climate focused brand couldn't be better.Despite recent political events in the US, climate change is a mega trend with rapidly growing public and media focus. With the recent adoption of the COP21 agreement, focus will now turn to the important task of actionable steps to rapidly reduce emissions to meet challenging goals.Individuals will be looking to do their part.There is a timely opportunity for a broad-based omni-channel brand that will serve consumers who are either considering, starting down, or well along the path of low carbon living. ClimateStore is a first-in-class brand which has never wavered from its low carbon mission and commitment to serving customers interested in protecting the climate.For the climate conscious impact investor, the company has significant potential to drive the climate conversation, raise public awareness about sustainable living, and be a leading channel for the many innovative companies developing consumer facing low-carbon products.

Location


City:Walpole                            

State:MA

The ClimateStore is a direct-to-consumer business with a mission to provide high quality products to consumers interested in mitigating human caused climate change through personal action. Founded in 2013, the company’s mission is to make fun, easy, and rewarding to find, purchase and use products that reduce your carbon footprint. The company is novel as a retailer focused entirely on sustainable living in the era of anthropogenic climate change.
The company’s online brand, ClimateStore.com, contains summaries of the latest climate science, issues an urgent call for action, provides step-by-step instructions to lower personal carbon emissions, and carries products to help people achieve a lower carbon footprint. The website offers quality products that will make an impact and promote lower carbon living, including: energy efficient lighting, water saving devices, smart home technology, home décor, laundry items, travel gear and accessories. For every product, the ClimateStore staff identifies exactly how it saves carbon – including the production, use, and disposal phases of its lifecycle – and communicate their findings with a simple icon system and detailed product descriptions.



Environmental Commitment
At the ClimateStore, we think the evidence for human caused climate change is overwhelming. We trust the scientific experts who have painstakingly assessed the evidence and shown an indisputable link between our use of fossil fuels, greenhouse gas emissions, and the risk of irreversible global warming. We also believe individuals can make a difference in the future of the planet.
Consistent with our mission, we run our operations in a carbon neutral manner. Carbon offsets are an important part of our sustainability strategy, which also includes sourcing policies, energy efficiency programs, web servers powered by renewable energy, mass transit benefits for employees, and carbon neutral operations achieved though purchasing carbon offsets. We also engage in partnerships with like-minded organizations, like CarbonFund.org and 1% for the Planet, to support climate change awareness programs and forest conservation initiatives.
Visit us at ClimateStore.com or reach out with thoughts and questions to ideas@climatestore.com.


“With the recent release of the latest UN IPCC report and U.S. National Climate Assessment, there can be no doubt this is a critical issue current for future generations. More people are asking what they can do to reduce their carbon impact” says Steven E. Bushnell, Ph.D., Founder and CEO of ClimateStore Inc. “There is a false perception that moving to a lower carbon economy will require giving things up or need extra effort. We take the opposite view; lowering one’s carbon footprint should be fun, easy and rewarding as we collectively secure the stable climate we all hope to live in.”

About ClimateStore






Welcome!
We're a new start-up retailer - dedicated to helping people live better for a healthy planet.
We think the evidence for human caused climate change is overwhelming and it's time to take action.
We trust the scientific experts
 who have painstakingly assessed the evidence and shown an indisputable link between our use of fossil fuels, greenhouse gas emissions, and the risk of irreversible climate change.

We also believe individuals can make a difference!
 The problem seems large, but if we start taking small steps to reduce our carbon footprint, collectively we can contribute to the reductions the experts say are required
 to mitigate climate change.







Our Mission
Our mission is to make it easy for people to reduce their carbon footprint
.
We seek to do this by....







Helping people learn about climate change







Promoting new ideas for sustainable living





Finding great products that reduce fossil fuel use





Sharing success stories as we work together to achieve needed greenhouse gas reductions


Our Store







We built our store to pull together all the things you need to begin low carbon ideas.
We're a work in progress so love new ideas..
If you have an idea about how to reduce your carbon footprint, we'd love to hear from you. Drop us a line at ideas@climatestore.com.


Our Story




ClimateStore was founded in 2013 by Dr. Steven Bushnell
A scientist by training, Steve switched careers to start ClimateStore after reading the consensus reports and learning about the urgent need to reduce our collective emissions from fossil fuels.
The son of an artist, husband, father of three and an avid hiker, he was struck by the lack of a 'one-stop-shop' for people interested in taking personal action.
The company was started in his attic, is powered by renewable solar and excited about providing high quality resources, products and science based information. As a trained Climate Reality Project leader (class of '13), and advocate for Citizens Climate Lobby, Steve actively supports COP21 goals, broad fact-based climate education, and carbon fee and dividend programs.
The Boston area start-up is actively adding low carbon products, DIY guides, resources and forming early partnerships.

Our Carbon Icons
















Our Carbon Footprint Icons




We appreciate it can be difficult to sort out the carbon-lowering impact of products and activities; and for good reason, as there are lots of factors that go into evaluating a products' impact on our atmosphere.
 To help sort things out, we developed icons we hope will make things easier. We review all our products for carbon impact and award icons to those that produce fewer greenhouse gases (GHGs) in either the production, use and/or disposal phases of their lifecycle. We also award icons when products produce their own renewable (green) energy, save money or have educational content. And just for fun, we have an icon for staff favorites!
Ideally, there would be an industry standard for things like this - and not just ClimateStore's view -  but until then, we spend a lot of time researching and analyzing whether products can be awarded icons and which ones. It's not a perfect process, but it's critical to our mission and one we will continually improve over time. It also goes without saying, that if a product can't earn an icon, we won't carry it in our store.
To understand our thinking for each product, look for the information on each product's detail page. If you have questions about a product's icon, feel free to call us at 1-888-320-7806, or e-mail us at customerservice@climatestore.com. If you have suggestions on how to improve our icons, we'd love to hear from you at ideas@climatestore.com. And thanks!







Production
Products with our production icon are made and distributed in a way that has a significantly lower carbon impact than its alternatives. Lower carbon impacts during the production of a product can be achieved with the following:

Made in the USA or North America (USA, Mexico, or Canada).
Sustainable shipping, storage, and distribution practices.
Energy efficient manufacturing and facilities that use renewable energy.
Made from rapidly renewable materials, recycled materials, and other sustainable sources.
Made with greener, nontoxic, or less energy intense chemicals.
Reusable or encourages the reuse of other products.
Reduced packing or packaged with climate friendly materials.
Unique and effective brand-wide sustainability initiatives.

Search by Production Icon









Energy Efficiency
This icon is awarded to products that require substantially less energy to use or operate. This includes:

Devices that save energy indirectly, like a shower timer, a smart power strip, or weatherization materials.
Devices that run on significantly less carbon power.
Devices that use less to energy, like LED light bulbs.

Energy Efficient Products









Saves Water (and energy too!)
This icon is awarded to products that save water, including:

Devices that save water directly through more efficient design - like a smart shower head, smart washer designs or thermal shut offs.
Products that save water indirectly like a shower timer or a water usage meter.
Devices that save water through substitution - for example, changing to to landscaping that doesn't require outdoor sprinklers.

Water Saving Ideas









Disposal
This icon goes to products that take less energy to throw out, dispose, and decompose. Municipal waste often heads to landfills or is incinerated, which contributes to carbon dioxide emissions. There are a number of factors that go into determining the carbon cost of a product end of life. We consider products that are:

Recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable.
Reusable or encourage the reuse of other products.
Requires less processing, chemical treatments, or disposal shipping.

Recyclable, Compostable and Biodegradable









Green Savings
These products mitigate climate change while also saving you money. They have low payback periods, are affordable, or operate with significantly less costs to the user. Good deals on these great products can save you money every time you use them.
Search for Money Savings









Renewable Energy
These products are self-powered or even power other devices. They generate, store, or capture energy that would otherwise come from unrenewable sources. By generating and using renewable power, these products and those who use them are able to cut emissions and work towards mitigating climate change.
Products That are Self Powered or Generate Energy









Gives Back
This icon is awarded to products, that through their purchase, also result in additional positive actions for the climate. This includes:

Made by companies that give a % of revenues to environmental projects related to climate - like conservation, environmental protection, and/or additional carbon offsets.
Companies that do direct volunteering linked to products sales or revenues - with a related climate benefit.
Products that give back to non-profits (e.g. NGO's and foundations), which have a climate focus.

Products that Give Back - or Forward!









Learn
These products aim to help people become more aware of how their actions affect the planet. They:

Educate people about climate change
Gather information on your personal carbon impact
Discuss science, sustainability, and how to get your community involved in the fight against climate change.

These items make great gifts and will help grow an interest in climate change and the future of the planet.
Education, Action and Awareness









Staff Favorites
These products are the ClimateStore team’s favorites. We either use them at home or in the office or find their carbon impact or value proposition compelling. Although we love all the products we carry, we only allow staff picks for a few and they change from month to month.
Staff Picks





3rd Party Icons
When available, we include icons from trusted 3rd party organizations - that provide value when evaluating products. We're adding more all the time so if you see one you'd like us to consider, please drop us a line at ideas@climatestore.com

Our old familiar globe is suddenly melting, drying, acidifying, flooding, and burning in ways that no human has ever seen. We've created, in very short order, a new planet, still recognizable but fundamentally different. We may as well call it Eaarth.

Polar Bears
















Polar Bears and Climate Change





Simply Amazing

Polar Bears are amazing. They're perfectly designed for the Arctic, one of the coldest places on earth. They have two layers of fur that keep them warm at -50&degF, have furred feet that keep them from slipping on ice, have an incredible sense of smell to direct them to food in a large landscape, and are strong enough to pull a large seal from the sea for food.
The mother bear is masterful at taking care of her cubs. She dens in the fall after building fat reserves and nurses her newborns to strength in the dead of winter. The cubs comes out of the den in the early spring and head out on the ice for food. They rumble and play, explore new smells, learn to forage, and play with a growing understanding of the world around them. In the first couple of years they are completely dependent on the protection and skills of their mother. She, in turn, depends on the predictable rhythms of nature and the food it provides.
Her world is unique.


The Arctic Is Changing

She doesn't know what life is like in mega cities like Chicago or Shanghai where the lights are on 24 hours a day and traffic jams are a daily occurrence. She doesn't know what an SUV is, or how much coal it takes to do your laundry, or to heat and cool your home. She doesn't know about exhaust from gas powered lawnmowers and leaf blowers, or how much carbon it takes to heat the water in your backyard pool. She doesn't know about vampire power, escalators, neon signs, or power plants; all of which rely on coal, gas and oil, and that send greenhouse warming gases into the atmosphere.
What she does know is that it's getting harder to find food. During the summer months, when she's hunting for her cubs, the ice she relies on to hunt for seals is further and further from land, retreating more each year as the arctic warms, requiring her to swim longer and longer distances to find the seals on which she relies. She knows the harshness of her hunger, and that of her cubs, when her fat reserves have dwindled following summers where she has not found enough to eat.
She knows an environment that is changing ....making it more difficult to survive.


The Arctic is a Special Place

At the ClimateStore, we understand the link
 between fossil fuel use, climate change, and the very survival of polar bears. We trust the scientific community which has painstakingly shown that climate change is real and that the most dramatic changes are taking place in the arctic. We also believe there is still time to act.

We're committed to providing products and ideas so you can reduce your energy use, live sustainably, and ultimately, help the polar bears. Maybe not these polar bears, but others like them, by protecting the ecosystem on which they depend.


Reducing Our Carbon Footprint will Help Save the Polar Bears
Scientists say the single most important thing we can do to save the polar bears is to reduce our carbon emissions...
...Let's Get Started!
