On the Passover - Melito of Sardis - Kerux 4:1 (May 1989)



[K:NWTS 4/1 (May 1989) 5-35]

On the Passover
Melito of Sardis


Introduction (1-10)

1. First of all, the Scripture about the Hebrew Exodus has been
  read and the words of the mystery have been explained as to how the sheep was
  sacrificed and the people were saved.
2. Therefore, understand this, O beloved: The mystery of the
  passover is new and old, eternal and temporal, corruptible and incorruptible,
  mortal and immortal in this fashion: 
3. It is old insofar as it concerns the law, but new insofar
  as it concerns the gospel; temporal insofar as it concerns the type, eternal
  because of grace; corruptible because of the sacrifice of the sheep, incorruptible
  because of the life of the Lord; mortal because of his burial in the earth,
  immortal because of his resurrection from the dead. 
4. The law is old, but the gospel is new; the type was for a
  time, but grace is forever. The sheep was corruptible, but the Lord is incorruptible,
  who was crushed as a lamb, but who was resurrected as God. For although he was
  led to sacrifice as a sheep, yet he was not a sheep; and although he was as
  a lamb without voice, yet indeed he was not a lamb. The one was the model; the
  other was found to be the finished product.
5. For God replaced the lamb, and a man the sheep; but in the
  man was Christ, who contains all things.
6. Hence, the sacrifice of the sheep, and the sending of the
  lamb to slaughter, and the writing of the law�each led to and issued in Christ,
  for whose sake everything happened in the ancient law, and even more so in the
  new gospel.
7. For indeed the law issued in the gospel�the old in the new,
  both coming forth together from Zion and Jerusalem; and the commandment issued
  in grace, and the type in the finished product, and the lamb in the Son, and
  the sheep in a man, and the man in God.
8. For the one who was born as Son, and led to slaughter as
  a lamb, and sacrificed as a sheep, and buried as a man, rose up from the dead
  as God, since he is by nature both God and man.
9. He is everything: in that he judges he is law, in that he
  teaches he is gospel, in that he saves he is grace, in that he begets he is
  Father, in that he is begotten he is Son, in that he suffers he is sheep, in
  that he is buried he is man, in that he comes to life again he is God.
10. Such is Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever. Amen.

I. The Meaning of the OT Passover (11-71)
A. The Biblical Setting�Exodus 12:11-30 (11-15)

11. Now comes the mystery of the passover, even as it stands
  written in the law, just as it has been read aloud only moments ago. But I will
  clearly set forth the significance of the words of this Scripture, showing how
  God commanded Moses in Egypt, when he had made his decision, to bind Pharaoh
  under the lash, but to release Israel from the lash through the hand of Moses.
12. For see to it, he says, that you take a flawless and perfect
  lamb, and that you sacrifice it in the evening with the sons of Israel, and
  that you eat it at night, and in haste. You are not to break any of its bones.
13. You will do it like this, he says: In a single night you
  will eat it by families and by tribes, your loins girded, and your staves in
  your hands. For this is the Lord's passover, an eternal reminder for the sons
  of Israel.
14. Then take the blood of the sheep, and anoint the front door
  of your houses by placing upon the posts of your entrance-way the sign of the
  blood, in order to ward off the angel. For behold I will strike Egypt, and in
  a single night she will be made childless from beast to man.
15. Then, when Moses sacrificed the sheep and completed the
  mystery at night together with the sons of Israel, he sealed the doors of their
  houses in order to protect the people and to ward off the angel.

B. Egypt's Calamities (16-29)

16. But when the sheep was sacrificed, and the passover consumed,
  and the mystery completed, and the people made glad, and Israel sealed, then
  the angel arrived to strike Egypt, who was neither initiated into the mystery,
  participant of the passover, sealed by the blood, nor protected by the Spirit,
  but who was the enemy and the unbeliever. 
17. In a single night the angel struck and made Egypt childless.
  For when the angel had encompassed Israel, and had seen her sealed with the
  blood of the sheep, he advanced against Egypt, and by means of grief subdued
  the stubborn Pharaoh, clothing him, not with a cloak of mourning, nor with a
  torn mantle, but with all of Egypt, torn, and mourning for her firstborn.
18. For all Egypt, plunged in troubles and calamities, in tears
  and lamentations, came to Pharaoh in utter sadness, not in appearance only,
  but also in soul, having torn not only her garments but her tender breasts as
  well.
19. Indeed it was possible to observe an extraordinary sight:
  in one place people beating their breasts, in another those wailing, and in
  the middle of them Pharaoh, mourning, sitting in sackcloth and cinders, shrouded
  in thick darkness as in a funeral garment, girded with all Egypt as with a tunic
  of grief.
20. For Egypt clothed Pharaoh as a cloak of wailing. Such was
  the mantle that had been woven for his royal body. With just such a cloak did
  the angel of righteousness clothe the self-willed Pharaoh: with bitter mournfulness,
  and with thick darkness, and with childlessness. For that angel warred against
  the firstborn of Egypt. Indeed, swift and insatiate was the death of the firstborn.
21. And an unusual monument of defeat, set up over those who
  had fallen dead in a moment, could be seen. For the defeat of those who lay
  dead became the provisions of death.
22. If you listen to the narration of this extraordinary event
  you will be astonished. For these things befell the Egyptians: a long night,
  and darkness which was touchable, and death which touched, and an angel who
  oppressed, and Hades which devoured their firstborn.
23. But you must listen to something still more extraordinary
  and terrifying: in the darkness which could be touched was hidden death which
  could not be touched. And the ill-starred Egyptians touched the darkness, while
  death, on the watch, touched the firstborn of the Egyptians as the angel had
  commanded.
24. Therefore, if anyone touched the darkness he was led out
  by death. Indeed one firstborn, touching a dark body with his hand, and utterly
  frightened in his soul, cried aloud in misery and in terror: What has my right
  hand laid hold of? At what does my soul tremble? Who cloaks my whole body with
  darkness? If you are my father, help me; if my mother, feel sympathy for me;
  if my brother, speak to me; if my friend, sit with me; if my enemy, go away
  from me since I am a firstborn son!
25. And before the firstborn was silent, the long silence held
  him in its power, saying: You are mine, O firstborn! I, the silence of death,
  am your destiny.
26. And another firstborn, taking note of the capture of the
  firstborn, denied his identity, so that he might not die a bitter death: I am
  not a firstborn son; I was born like a third child. But he who could not be
  deceived touched that firstborn, and he fell forward in silence. In a single
  moment the firstborn fruit of the Egyptians was destroyed. The one first conceived,
  the one first born, the one sought after, the one chosen was dashed to the ground;
  not only that of men but that of irrational animals as well.
27. A lowing was heard in the fields of the earth, of cattle
  bellowing for their nurslings, a cow standing over her calf, and a mare over
  her colt. And the rest of the cattle, having just given birth to their offspring
  and swollen with milk, were lamenting bitterly and piteously for their firstborn.
28. And there was a wailing and lamentation because of the destruction
  of the men, because of the destruction of the firstborn who were dead. And all
  Egypt stank, because of the unburied bodies.
29. Indeed one could see a frightful spectacle: of the Egyptians
  there were mothers with dishevelled hair, and fathers who had lost their minds,
  wailing aloud in terrifying fashion in the Egyptian tongue: O wretched persons
  that we are! We have lost our firstborn in a single moment! And they were striking
  their breasts with their hands, beating time in hammerlike fashion to the dance
  for their dead.

C. Israel's Safety (30-33)

 30. Such was the misfortune which encompassed Egypt. In
  an instant it made her childless. But Israel, all the while, was being protected
  by the sacrifice of the sheep and truly was being illumined by its blood which
  was shed; for the death of the sheep was found to be a rampart for the people.
31. O inexpressible mystery! the sacrifice of the sheep was
  found to be the salvation of the people, and the death of the sheep became the
  life of the people. For its blood warded off the angel. 
32. Tell me, O angel, At what were you turned away? At the sacrifice
  of the sheep, or the life of the Lord? At the death of the sheep, or the type
  of the Lord? At the blood of the sheep, or the Spirit of the Lord? Clearly,
  you were turned away 
33. because you saw the mystery of the Lord taking place in
  the sheep, the life of the Lord in the sacrifice of the sheep, the type of the
  Lord in the death of the sheep. For this reason you did not strike Israel, but
  it was Egypt alone that you made childless.

D. Model versus Finished Product (34-38)

34. What was this extraordinary mystery? It was Egypt struck
  to destruction but Israel kept for salvation. Listen to the meaning of this
  mystery:
35. Beloved, no speech or event takes place without a pattern
  or design; every event and speech involves a pattern�that which is spoken, a
  pattern, and that which happens, a prefiguration�in order that as the event
  is disclosed through the prefiguration, so also the speech may be brought to
  expression through its outline.
36. Without the model, no work of art arises. Is not that which
  is to come into existence seen through the model which typifies it? For this
  reason a pattern of that which is to be is made either out of wax, or out of
  clay, or out of wood, in order that by the smallness of the model, destined
  to be destroyed, might be seen that thing which is to arise from it�higher than
  it in size, and mightier than it in power, and more beautiful than it in appearance,
  and more elaborate than it in ornamentation.
37. So whenever the thing arises for which the model was made,
  then that which carried the image of that future thing is destroyed as no longer
  of use, since it has transmitted its resemblance to that which is by nature
  true. Therefore, that which once was valuable, is now without value because
  that which is truly valuable has appeared.
38. For each thing has its own time: there is a distinct time
  for the type, there is a distinct time for the material, and there is a distinct
  time for the truth. You construct the model. You want this, because you see
  in it the image of the future work. You procure the material for the model.
  You want this, on account of that which is going to arise because of it. You
  complete the work and cherish it alone, for only in it do you see both type
  and the truth.

E. Relationship Between OT and NT (39-45)

39. Therefore, if it was like this with models of perishable
  objects, so indeed will it also be with those of imperishable objects. If it
  was like this with earthly things, so indeed also will it be with heavenly things.
  For even the Lord's salvation and his truth were prefigured in the people, and
  the teaching of the gospel was proclaimed in advance by the law. 
40. The people, therefore, became the model for the church,
  and the law a parabolic sketch. But the gospel became the explanation of the
  law and its fulfillment, while the church became the storehouse of truth. 
41. Therefore, the type had value prior to its realization,
  and the parable was wonderful prior to its interpretation. This is to say that
  the people had value before the church came on the scene, and the law was wonderful
  before the gospel was brought to light.
42. But when the church came on the scene, and the gospel was
  set forth, the type lost its value by surrendering its significance to the truth,
  and the law was fulfilled by surrendering its significance to the gospel. Just
  as the type lost its significance by surrendering its image to that which is
  true by nature, and as the parable lost its significance by being illumined
  through the interpretation, 
43. so indeed also the law was fulfilled when the gospel was
  brought to light, and the people lost their significance when the church came
  on the scene, and the type was destroyed when the Lord appeared. Therefore,
  those things which once had value are today without value, because the things
  which have true value have appeared.
44. For at one time the sacrifice to the sheep was valuable,
  but now it is without value because of the life of the Lord. The death of the
  sheep once was valuable, but now it is without value because of the salvation
  of the Lord. The blood of the sheep once was valuable, but now it is without
  value because of the Spirit of the Lord. The silent lamb once was valuable,
  but now it has no value because of the blameless Son. The temple here below
  once was valuable, but now it is without value because of the Christ from above.
45. The Jerusalem here below once had value, but now it is without
  value because of the Jerusalem from above. The meager inheritance once had value;
  now it is without value because of the abundant grace. For not in one place
  alone, nor yet in narrow confines, has the glory of God been established, but
  his grace has been poured out upon the uttermost parts of the inhabited world,
  and there the almighty God has taken up his dwelling place through Jesus Christ,
  to whom be the glory for ever. Amen.

F. Components of the Mystery of the Passover
  (46-71)
1. The Passover (46-47a)

46. Now that you have heard the explanation of the type and
  of that which corresponds to it, hear also what goes into making up the mystery.
  What is the passover? Indeed its name is derived from that event�"to celebrate
  the passover" (to paschein) is derived from "to suffer" (tou pathein).
  Therefore, learn who the sufferer is and who he is who suffers along with the
  sufferer.
47. Why indeed was the Lord present upon the earth? In order
  that having clothed himself with the one who suffers, he might lift him up to
  the heights of heaven.  

2. The Creation and Fall of Man (47b-48)

In the beginning, when God made heaven and earth, and everything
  in them through his word, he himself formed man from the earth and shared with
  that form his own breath, he himself placed him in paradise, which was eastward
  in Eden, and there they lived most luxuriously.
Then by way of command God gave them this law: For your food
  you may eat from any tree, but you are not to eat from the tree of the one who
  knows good and evil. For on the day you eat from it, you most certainly will
  die.
48. But man, who is by nature capable of receiving good and
  evil as soil of the earth is capable of receiving seeds from both sides, welcomed
  the hostile and greedy counselor, and by having touched that tree transgressed
  the command, and disobeyed God. As a consequence, he was cast out into this
  world as a condemned man is cast into prison. 

3. Consequences of the Fall (49-56)

49. And when he had fathered many children, and had grown very
  old, and had returned to the earth through having tasted of the tree, an inheritance
  was left behind by him for his children. Indeed, he left his children an inheritance�not
  of chastity but of unchastity, not of immortality but of corruptibility, not
  of honor but of dishonor, not of freedom but of slavery, not of sovereignty
  but of tyranny, not of life but of death, not of salvation but of destruction.
50. Extraordinary and terrifying indeed was the destruction
  of men upon the earth. For the following things happened to them: They were
  carried off as slaves by sin, the tyrant, and were led away into the regions
  of desire where they were totally engulfed by insatiable sensual pleasures�by
  adultery, by unchastity, by debauchery, by inordinate desires, by avarice, by
  murders, by bloodshed, by the tyranny of wickedness, by the tyranny of lawlessness.
51. For even a father of his own accord lifted up a dagger against
  his son; and a son used his hands against his father; and the impious person
  smote the breasts that nourished him; and brother murdered brother; and host
  wronged his guest; and friend assassinated friend; and one man cut the throat
  of another with his tyrannous right hand.
52. Therefore all men on the earth became either murderers,
  or parricides, or killers of their children. And yet a thing still more dreadful
  and extraordinary was to be found: A mother attacked the flesh which she gave
  birth to, a mother attacked those whom her breasts had nourished; and she buried
  in her belly the fruit of her belly. Indeed, the ill-starred mother became a
  dreadful tomb, when she devoured the child which she bore in her womb.
53. But in addition to this there were to be found among men
  many things still more monstrous and terrifying and brutal: father cohabits
  with his child, and son and with his mother, and brother with sister, and male
  with male, and each man lusting after the wife of his neighbor.
54. Because of these things sin exulted, which, because it was
  death's collaborator, entered first into the souls of men, and prepared as food
  for him the bodies of the dead. In every soul sin left its mark, and those in
  whom it placed its mark were destined to die.
55. Therefore, all flesh fell under the power of sin, and every
  body under the dominion of death, for every soul was driven out from its house
  of flesh. Indeed, that which had been taken from the earth was dissolved again
  into earth, and that which had been given from God was locked up in Hades. And
  that beautiful ordered arrangement was dissolved, when the beautiful body was
  separated (from the soul).
56. Yes, man was divided up into parts by death. Yes, an extraordinary
  misfortune and captivity enveloped him: he was dragged away captive under the
  shadow of death, and the image of the Father remained there desolate. For this
  reason, therefore, the mystery of the passover has been completed in the body
  of the Lord. 

4. Predictions of Christ's Sufferings (57-65)

57. Indeed, the Lord prearranged his own sufferings in the patriarchs,
  and in the prophets, and in the whole people of God, giving his sanction to
  them through the law and the prophets. For that which was to exist in a new
  and grandiose fashion was pre-planned long in advance, in order that when it
  should come into existence one might attain to faith, just because it had been
  predicted long in advance. 
58. So indeed also the suffering of the Lord, predicted long
  in advance by means of types, but seen today, has brought about faith, just
  because it has taken place as predicted. And yet men have taken it as something
  completely new. Well, the truth of the matter is the mystery of the Lord is
  both old and new�old insofar as it involved the type, but new insofar as it
  concerns grace. And what is more, if you pay close attention to this type you
  will see the real thing through its fulfillment.
59. Accordingly, if you desire to see the mystery of the Lord,
  pay close attention to Abel who likewise was put to death, to Isaac who likewise
  was bound hand and foot, to Joseph who likewise was sold, to Moses who likewise
  was exposed, to David who likewise was hunted down, to the prophets who likewise
  suffered because they were the Lord's anointed.
60. Pay close attention also to the one who was sacrificed as
  a sheep in the land of Egypt, to the one who smote Egypt and who saved Israel
  by his blood.
61. For it was through the voice of prophecy that the mystery
  of the Lord was proclaimed. Moses, indeed, said to his people: Surely you will
  see your life suspended before your eyes night and day, but you surely will
  not believe on your Life.     Deut. 28:66.
62. And David said: Why were the nations haughty and the people
  concerned about nothing? The kings of the earth presented themselves and the
  princes assembled themselves together against the Lord and against his anointed.
      Ps. 2:1-2.
63. And Jeremiah: I am as an innocent lamb being led away to
  be sacrificed. They plotted evil against me and said: Come! let us throw him
  a tree for his food, and let us exterminate him from the land of the living,
  so that his name will never be recalled.     Jer. 11:19.
64. And Isaiah: He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and, as
  a lamb is silent in the presence of the one who shears it, he did not open his
  mouth. Therefore who will tell his offspring?     Isa. 53:7
  
65. And indeed there were many other things proclaimed by numerous
  prophets concerning the mystery of the passover, which is Christ, to whom be
  the glory forever. Amen.

5. Deliverance of Mankind through Christ (66-71)

66. When this one came from heaven to earth for the sake of
  the one who suffers, and had clothed himself with that very one through the
  womb of a virgin, and having come forth as man, he accepted the sufferings of
  the sufferer through his body which was capable of suffering. And he destroyed
  those human sufferings by his spirit which was incapable of dying. He killed
  death which had put man to death.
67. For this one, who was led away as a lamb, and who was sacrificed
  as a sheep, by himself delivered us from servitude to the world as from the
  land of Egypt, and released us from bondage to the devil as from the hand of
  Pharaoh, and sealed our souls by his own spirit and the members of our bodies
  by his own blood. 
68. This is the one who covered death with shame and who plunged
  the devil into mourning as Moses did Pharaoh. This is the one who smote lawlessness
  and deprived injustice of its offspring, as Moses deprived Egypt. This is the
  one who delivered us from slavery into freedom, from darkness into light, from
  death into life, from tyranny into an eternal kingdom, and who made us a new
  priesthood, and a special people forever.
69. This one is the passover of our salvation. This is the one
  who patiently endured many things in many people: This is the one who was murdered
  in Abel, and bound as a sacrifice in Isaac, and exiled in Jacob, and sold in
  Joseph, and exposed in Moses, and sacrificed in the lamb, and hunted down in
  David, and dishonored in the prophets. 
70. This is the one who became human in a virgin, who was hanged
  on the tree, who was buried in the earth, who was resurrected from among the
  dead, and who raised mankind up out of the grave below to the heights of heaven.
71. This is the lamb that was slain. This is the lamb that was
  silent. This is the one who was born of Mary, that beautiful ewe-lamb. This
  is the one who was taken from the flock, and was dragged to sacrifice, and was
  killed in the evening, and was buried at night; the one who was not broken while
  on the tree, who did not see dissolution while in the earth, who rose up from
  the dead, and who raised up mankind from the grave below.

II. The Death of Christ and Israel's Sin (72-99)
A. Place and Cause of Christ's Death (72-86)
72. This one was murdered. And where was he murdered? In the
  very center of Jerusalem! Why? Because he had healed their lame, and had cleansed
  their lepers, and had guided their blind with light, and had raised up their
  dead. For this reason he suffered. Somewhere it has been written in the law
  and prophets,

"They paid me back evil for good, and my soul with barrenness     Ps.
    34:12

    plotting evil against me     Ps. 34:4; 40:8

    saying, Let us bind this just man because he is troublesome to us."     Isa.
    3:10 (LXX).


73. Why, O Israel did you do this strange injustice? You dishonored
  the one who had honored you. You held in contempt the one who held you in esteem.
  You denied the one who publicly acknowledged you. You renounced the one who
  proclaimed you his own. You killed the one who made you to live. Why did you
  do this, O Israel?
74. Hast it not been written for your benefit: "Do not shed
  innocent blood lest you die a terrible death"? Nevertheless, Israel admits,
  I killed the Lord! Why? Because it was necessary for him to die. You have deceived
  yourself, O Israel, rationalizing thus about the death of the Lord. 
75. It was necessary for him to suffer, yes, but not by you;
  it was necessary for him to be dishonored, but not by you; it was necessary
  for him to be judged, but not by you; it was necessary for him to be crucified,
  but not by you, nor by your right hand.
76. O Israel! You ought to have cried aloud to God with this
  voice: "O Lord, if it was necessary for your Son to suffer, and if this was
  your will, let him suffer indeed, but not at my hands. Let him suffer at the
  hands of strangers. Let him be judged by the uncircumcised. Let him be crucified
  by the tyrannical right hand, but not by mine."
77. But you, O Israel, did not cry out to God with this voice,
  nor did you absolve yourself of guilt before the Lord, nor were you persuaded
  by his works. 
78. The withered hand which was restored whole to its body did
  not persuade you; nor did the eyes of the blind which were opened by his hand;
  nor did the paralyzed bodies restored to health again through his voice; nor
  did that most extraordinary miracle persuade you, namely, the dead man raised
  to life from the tomb where already he had been lying for four days. Indeed,
  dismissing these things, you, to your detriment, prepared the following for
  the sacrifice of the Lord at eventide: sharp nails, and false witnesses, and
  fetters, and scourges,
79. and vinegar, and gall, and a sword, and affliction, and
  all as though it were for a blood-stained robber. For you brought to him scourges
  for his body, and the thorns for his head. And you bound those beautiful hands
  of his, which had formed you from the earth. And that beautiful mouth of his,
  which had nourished you with life, you filled with gall. And you killed your
  Lord at the time of the great feast.
80. Surely you were filled with gaiety, but he was filled with
  hunger; you drank wine and ate bread, but he vinegar and gall; you wore a happy
  smile, but he had a sad countenance; you were full of joy, but he was full of
  trouble; you sang songs, but he was judged; you issued the command, he was crucified;
  you danced, he was buried; you lay down on a soft bed, but he in a tomb and
  coffin.
81. O lawless Israel, why did you commit this extraordinary
  crime of casting your Lord into new sufferings�your master, the one who formed
  you, the one who made you, the one who honored you, the one who called you Israel?
82. But you were found not really to be Israel, for you did
  not see God, you did not recognize the Lord, you did not know, O Israel, that
  this one was the firstborn of God, the one who was begotten before the morning
  star, the one who caused the light to shine forth, the one who made bright the
  day, the one who parted the darkness, the one who established the primordial
  starting point, the one who suspended the earth, the one who quenched the abyss,
  the one who stretched out the firmament, the one who formed the universe, 
83. the one who set in motion the stars of heaven, the one who
  caused those luminaries to shine, the one who made the angels in heaven, the
  one who established their thrones in that place, the one who by himself fashioned
  man upon the earth. This was the one who chose you, the one who guided you from
  Adam to Noah, from Noah to Abraham, from Abraham to Isaac and Jacob and the
  Twelve Patriarchs.
84. This was the one who guided you into Egypt, and guarded
  you, and himself kept you well supplied there. This was the one who lighted
  your route with a column of fire, and provided shade for you by means of a cloud,
  the one who divided the Red Sea, and led you across it, and scattered your enemy
  abroad.
85. This is the one who provided you with manna from heaven,
  the one who gave you water to drink from a rock, the one who established your
  laws in Horeb, the one who gave you an inheritance in the land, the one who
  sent out his prophets to you, the one who raised up your kings.
86. This is the one who came to you, the one who healed your
  suffering ones and who resurrected your dead. This is the one whom you sinned
  against. This is the one whom you wronged. This is the one whom you killed.
  This is the one whom you sold for silver, although you asked him for the didrachma.

B. Israel Brought to Trial (87-93)

87. O ungrateful Israel, come here and be judged before me for
  your ingratitude. How high a price did you place on being created by him? How
  high a price did you place on the discovery of your fathers? How high a price
  did you place on the descent into Egypt, and the provision made for you there
  through the noble Joseph? 
88. How high a price did you place on the ten plagues? How high
  a price did you place on the nightly column of fire, and the daily cloud, and
  the crossing of the Red Sea? How high a price did you place on the gift of manna
  from heaven, and the gift of water from the rock, and the gift of law in Horeb,
  and the land as an inheritance, and the benefits accorded you there? 
89. How high a price did you place on your suffering people
  whom he healed when he was present? Set me a price on the withered hand, which
  he restored whole to its body.
90. Put me a price on the men born blind, whom he led into light
  by his voice. Put me a price on those who lay dead, whom he raised up alive
  from the tomb. Inestimable are the benefits that come to you from him. But you,
  shamefully, have paid him back with ingratitude, returning to him evil for good,
  and affliction for favor and death for life�
91. a person for whom you should have died. Furthermore, if
  the king of some nation is captured by an enemy, a war is started because of
  him, fortifications are shattered because of him, cities are plundered because
  of him, ransom is sent because of him, ambassadors are commissioned because
  of him in order that he might be surrendered, so that either he might be returned
  if living, or that he might be buried if dead.
92. But you, quite to the contrary, voted against your Lord,
  whom indeed the nations worshipped, and the uncircumcised admired, and the foreigners
  glorified, over whom Pilate washed his hands. But as for you�you killed this
  one at the time of the great feast.
93. Therefore, the feast of unleavened bread has become bitter
  to you just as it was written: "You will eat unleavened bread with bitter herbs."
  Bitter to you are the nails which you made pointed. Bitter to you is the tongue
  which you sharpened. Bitter to you are the false witnesses whom you brought
  forward. Bitter to you are the fetters which you prepared. Bitter to you are
  the scourges which you wove. Bitter to you is Judas whom you furnished with
  pay. Bitter to you is Herod whom you followed. Bitter to you is Caiaphas whom
  you obeyed. Bitter to you is the gall which you made ready. Bitter to you is
  the vinegar which you produced. Bitter to you are the thorns which you plucked.
  Bitter to you are your hands which you bloodied, when you killed your Lord in
  the midst of Jerusalem.

C. Gentiles Are Witnesses of Israel's Crime (94-98)

94. Pay attention, all families of the nations, and observe!
  An extraordinary murder has taken place in the center of Jerusalem, in the city
  devoted to God's law, in the city of the Hebrews, in the city of the prophets,
  in the city thought of as just. And who has been murdered? And who is the murderer?
  I am ashamed to give the answer, but give it I must. For if this murder had
  taken place at night, or if he had been slain in a desert place, it would be
  well to keep silent; but it was in the middle of the main street, even in the
  center of the city, while all were looking on, that the unjust murder of this
  just person took place. 
95. And thus he was lifted up upon the tree, and an inscription
  was affixed identifying the one who had been murdered. Who was he? It is painful
  to tell, but it is more dreadful not to tell. Therefore, hear and tremble because
  of him for whom the earth trembled.
96. The one who hung the earth in space, is himself hanged;
  the one who fixed the heavens in place, is himself impaled; the one who firmly
  fixed all things, is himself firmly fixed to the tree. The Lord is insulted,
  God has been murdered, the King of Israel has been destroyed by the right hand
  of Israel.
97. O frightful murder! O unheard of injustice! The Lord is
  disfigured and he is not deemed worthy of a cloak for his naked body, so that
  he might not be seen exposed. For this reason the stars turned and fled, and
  the day grew quite dark, in order to hide the naked person hanging on the tree,
  darkening not the body of the Lord, but the eyes of men.
98. Yes, even though the people did not tremble, the earth trembled
  instead; although the people were not afraid, the heavens grew frightened; although
  the people did not tear their garments, the angels tore theirs; although the
  people did not lament, the Lord thundered from heaven, and the most high uttered
  his voice.

D. Israel Questioned and Sentenced to Death (99)

99. Why was it like this, O Israel? You did not tremble for
  the Lord. You did not fear for the Lord. You did not lament for the Lord, yet
  you lamented for your firstborn. You did not tear your garments at the crucifixion
  of the Lord, yet you tore your garments for your own who were murdered. You
  forsook the Lord; you were not found by him. You dashed the Lord to the ground;
  you, too, were dashed to the ground, and lie quite dead.

III. The Final Triumph of Christ (100-105)

100. But he arose from the dead and mounted up to the heights
  of heaven. When the Lord had clothed himself with humanity, and had suffered
  for the sake of the sufferer, and had been bound for the sake of the imprisoned,
  and had been judged for the sake of the condemned, and buried for the sake of
  the one who was buried, 
101. he rose up from the dead, and cried aloud with this voice:
  Who is he who contends with me? Let him stand in opposition to me. I set the
  condemned man free; I gave the dead man life; I raised up the one who had been
  entombed. 
102. Who is my opponent? I, he says, am the Christ. I am the
  one who destroyed death, and triumphed over the enemy, and trampled Hades under
  foot, and bound the strong one, and carried off man to the heights of heaven,
  I, he says, am the Christ.
103. Therefore, come, all families of men, you who have been
  befouled with sins, and receive forgiveness for your sins. I am your forgiveness,
  I am the passover of your salvation, I am the lamb which was sacrificed for
  you, I am your ransom, I am your light, I am your saviour, I am your resurrection,
  I am your king, I am leading you up to the heights of heaven, I will show you
  the eternal Father, I will raise you up by my right hand. 
104. This is the one who made the heavens and the earth, and
  who in the beginning created man, who was proclaimed through the law and prophets,
  who became human via the virgin, who was hanged upon a tree, who was buried
  in the earth, who was resurrected from the dead, and who ascended to the heights
  of heaven, who sits at the right hand of the Father, who has authority to judge
  and to save everything, through whom the Father created everything from the
  beginning of the world to the end of the age.
105. This is the alpha and the omega. This is the beginning
  and the end�an indescribable beginning and an incomprehensible end. This is
  the Christ. This is the king. This is Jesus. This is the general. This is the
  Lord. This is the one who rose up from the dead. This is the one who sits at
  the right hand of the Father. He bears the Father and is borne by the Father,
  to whom be the glory and the power forever. Amen.
The Peri Pascha of Melito. Peace to the one who wrote,
  and to the one who reads, and to those who love the Lord in simplicity of heart.
