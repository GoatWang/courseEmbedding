Nayar began his career in his native India, collaborating with the Merchant Ivory Films on Heat & Dust; The Deceivers and The Perfect Murder. After a move to Los Angeles, he set up his own production company, Kintop Pictures.

His collaboration with Wim Wenders earned an Oscar® nomination for highly acclaimed The Buena Vista Social Club and a Grammy nomination for the music video 'Teatro.'

In 2002, he produced another hugely successful Bend It Like Beckham, earning both Golden Globe® and BAFTA nominations. He followed this with another collaboration with Gurinder Chadha, the cross-cultural box office hit Bride and Prejudice and Mistress of Spices. Some of his other notable films have been Paul Schrader's thriller The Walker; Wim Wender's End of Violence and Mika Kaurismaki's LA Without a Map.

Liberalization and Development
Deepak Nayyar


Author an eminent economist
Includes a new Preface on recent developments
Heterodox perspective on the subject
Unusual mix of theory and policy








Liberalization and Development
Deepak Nayyar



Description



This collection of fifteen essays by eminent economist Deepak Nayyar provides an unusual blend of theory and policy, of applied research and empirical work, and of the world economy and India. It explores a wide range of themes-from macroeconomics and industrialization, to development in the changed context shaped by liberalization. This paperback edition includes a new Preface that focuses on developments since 2008 when the book was first published. The essays in the volume are grouped in four thematic clusters. The first part is on economic theory contextualized in developing countries. It relates macroeconomic theory and policy to the institutional setting and explores alternative perspectives for developing countries. The second part is on development, in a world that has been transformed by markets and globalization. It analyses the implications of this transformation in retrospect and prospect. The third part is on industrialization. It begins with the international context to consider the debate on industrialization in India which is relevant for other late-industrializers. The fourth part is on liberalization with a focus on India. It evaluates the Indian experience with stabilization, adjustment, and reform, which is then situated in its wider political and historical context.
