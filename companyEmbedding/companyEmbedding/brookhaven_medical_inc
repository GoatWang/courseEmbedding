TECHNOLOGY PIPELINE
HEMOACCESS VALVE SYSTEM

CAUTION: The Hemoaccess Valve System is in development and is not available for sale worldwide. 

OVERVIEW 
    Brookhaven Vascular (formerly known as CreatiVasc Medical) is focusing technology innovations targeting End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) which affects approximately 662,000 Americans and represents a $31 billion healthcare cost burden in the U.S1. Due to the lack of available kidneys for transplantation, approximately 468,000 ESRD patients are on dialysis because their kidneys are no longer able to work at a level needed to sustain life.1 While ESRD patients represent less than 1% of the Medicare population2, they account for 7% of Medicare spending.1 Vascular access has been frequently referred to as the Achilles heel of dialysis.3  Brookhaven Vascular is interested in fielding a significant technology development in this area.  

CLINICAL PROBLEM 
 Brookhaven Vascular is developing the latest generation of an innovative technology known as the Hemoaccess Valve System® (HVS).  The first generation of the HVS concept was implanted in humans in an early-stage clinical trial and became one of the three inaugural technologies in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Innovation Pathway program in 2012. 
  The HVS device is designed to potentially address complications associated with arteriovenous (AV) grafts, one of the major methods used to connect renal disease patients to a dialysis machine for blood filtration.  One study showed that in 328 patients, 77% of patients with an AV graft required invasive surgical intervention to maintain blood flow through their graft in the first 12 months after it is implanted4 and the surgical intervention is often repeated.5 Graft complications can include thrombosis (clotting)3, post-dialysis bleeding,5 and pseudoaneurysms.6  In addition, vascular access induced steal syndrome (“blood steal”) often causes the fingers and hand below the graft to lose adequate circulation which can lead to pain in the extremities below the graft - and even amputation where loss of circulation has occurred.7,8 
It is believed that these complications may be associated with the unnatural diversion of blood from an artery to a vein via the AV graft for 24 hours a day when it is only needed for dialysis access 9-12 hours a week. 
An AV graft places a burden on the heart since it requires high volumes of blood to be pumped through it to maintain its patency (flow).  A normal brachial artery handles 27.8 gallons of blood daily while a graft requires 228.3 gallons to maintain the graft equal to over eight times the blood volume.8  Cardiovascular disease is major cause of death among ESRD patients.1
  
BROOKHAVEN VASCULAR TECHNOLOGY
    The ideal AV graft hemodialysis process would be to selectively “turn on” blood flow into the AV graft when the patient needs vascular access for dialysis then “turn off” the flow of blood when the patient is not in dialysis, restoring normal blood flow to the artery and vein. This is the breakthrough that the Hemoaccess Valve System® (HVS) may offer.  The HVS device will be implanted when a patient has a dialysis graft implanted for AV access. When the dialysis technician will magnetically activate the HVS device, valves at each end of the AV graft will open, allowing blood flow for dialysis.  When dialysis is concluded, the AV graft is flushed with saline then the technician will use the device’s actuator to close the valves, restoring normal blood flow to the artery and vein.  Sterile saline-heparin solution will remain in the graft between dialysis sessions.  The Hemoaccess Valve System® is ONLY in development and NOT available for sale anywhere in the world at this time. 
POTENTIAL CLINICAL BENEFITS
  No clinical benefits have been proven with the use of the HVS. Some of the potential benefits are as follows:   

Potential reduction of thrombosis (clotting) which require frequent interventional surgeries to keep AV grafts functioning for dialysis.4
Potential reduction of pseudoaneurysms which can lead to significant bleeding events after the patient has left the dialysis clinic.6
Potential reduction in the added workload on the heart to pump high rates of blood through the graft (as noted previously, 8x the normal blood flow).8

RECOGNITION AND A PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY
    In addition to being selected as an FDA Innovation Pathway technology, the HVS device has won multiple awards including:

One of five winners (out of over 4,000 entries) in the History Channel’s INVENT NOW Innovation Awards.
The winner of the Deloitte InnoVision new technology award.

The HVS device may provide an innovative way to activate an implanted pump device without internal batteries or motors and without the use of needles to inject saline to activate the graft valves. 
    We believe this may have the potential to become a platform technology that has multiple applications for other medical applications.  The HVS technology is protected by a broad portfolio of more than 14 issued and pending patents in the U.S. and around the world.

Brookhaven Medical, Inc. to Acquire Wound Management Technologies | Business Wire


























































Brookhaven Medical, Inc. to Acquire Wound Management Technologies






October 15, 2013 09:52 AM Eastern Daylight Time



ATLANTA & FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Brookhaven Medical, Inc., an Atlanta-based medical device company with 
      interests in dialysis devices and advanced wound care, today announced 
      an agreement to acquire Wound Management Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: 
      WNDM) of Fort Worth, an emerging commercial stage company focused on the 
      worldwide advanced wound care market.
    


      The letter of intent, which outlines the primary terms of a merger of 
      Wound Management into Brookhaven, has been approved by the board of 
      directors of both companies. The parties are engaged in completing a 
      formal merger agreement underlying the transaction which is expected to 
      close in the first half of 2014.
    

      “I am pleased to enter this agreement with Wound Management,” said John 
      Feltman, chairman and CEO of Brookhaven. “Wound Management is an ideal 
      match for Brookhaven’s synergistic approach to building our leading 
      medical technology and products, and I believe it will be an integral 
      part of our success in ushering Brookhaven into the advanced wound care 
      industry.”
    

      Mr. Feltman said that, in addition to the Wound Management acquisition, 
      Brookhaven recently entered into an agreement in principle to acquire a 
      medical device company specializing in dialysis access and peripheral 
      vascular applications, and also recently completed a strategic 
      investment in CreatiVasc Medical, Inc., a private company based in 
      Greenville, South Carolina, which is developing a breakthrough 
      hemoaccess valve system for dialysis grafts. He said that CreatiVasc is 
      one of only three companies recently selected by the FDA for inclusion 
      in its Innovation Pathway Program. http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130723005969/en/Brookhaven-Medical-5-Million-Investment-CreatiVasc-Medical%E2%80%99s


      Mr. Feltman said that he “believes that Brookhaven can achieve rapid 
      growth and significant market share. The global market segments we serve 
      represent a market opportunity in excess of $50 billion. It is our firm 
      belief that Wound Management and our other planned acquisitions help 
      position Brookhaven to capture a significant share of product sales in 
      those targeted market segments,” he said.
    

      Speaking for Wound Management, Robert Lutz, Jr., its chairman and CEO, 
      said his company “is excited to execute this LOI and move forward with 
      Brookhaven toward a definitive merger agreement. By merging with 
      Brookhaven, Wound Management will be better able to implement our 
      strategic plan and should also be welcome news to our shareholders in 
      maximizing their return on investment as we become part of Brookhaven.
    

      “By working with Brookhaven, we have the best opportunity for our 
      CellerateRX® wound care and surgical products to achieve substantial 
      growth and to expeditiously take our emerging resorbable bone wax 
      technology to market,” he said. Wound Management recently entered into a 
      three-year marketing and distribution agreement for CellerateRX® with 
      WellDyne, Inc., a leading privately-held health services company that 
      provides pharmacy benefit management, mail order pharmacy and specialty 
      drug fulfillment, in addition to online access to a broad range of 
      information on health, disease, pharmaceuticals and wellness. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/wound-management-welldyne-inc-enter-204700877.html

Brookhaven Medical, Inc. to Acquire Wound Management TechnologiesATLANTA & FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Brookhaven Medical, Inc., an Atlanta-based medical device company with interests in dialysis devices and advanced wound care, today announced an agreement to acquire Wound Management Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: WNDM) of Fort Worth, an emerging commercial stage company focused on the worldwide advanced wound care market.The letter of intent, which outlines the primary terms of a merger of Wound Management into Brookhaven, has been approved by the board of directors of both companies. The parties are engaged in completing a formal merger agreement underlying the transaction which is expected to close in the first half of 2014."I am pleased to enter this agreement with Wound Management," said John Feltman, chairman and CEO of Brookhaven. "Wound Management is an ideal match for Brookhaven's synergistic approach to building our leading medical technology and products, and I believe it will be an integral part of our success in ushering Brookhaven into the advanced wound care industry."Mr. Feltman said that, in addition to the Wound Management acquisition, Brookhaven recently entered into an agreement in principle to acquire a medical device company specializing in dialysis access and peripheral vascular applications, and also recently completed a strategic investment in CreatiVasc Medical, Inc., a private company based in Greenville, South Carolina, which is developing a breakthrough hemoaccess valve system for dialysis grafts. He said that CreatiVasc is one of only three companies recently selected by the FDA for inclusion in its Innovation Pathway Program. http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130723005969/en/Brookhaven-Medical-5-Million-Investment-CreatiVasc-Medical%E2%80%99sMr. Feltman said that he "believes that Brookhaven can achieve rapid growth and significant market share. The global market segments we serve represent a market opportunity in excess of $50 billion. It is our firm belief that Wound Management and our other planned acquisitions help position Brookhaven to capture a significant share of product sales in those targeted market segments," he said.Speaking for Wound Management, Robert Lutz, Jr., its chairman and CEO, said his company "is excited to execute this LOI and move forward with Brookhaven toward a definitive merger agreement. By merging with Brookhaven, Wound Management will be better able to implement our strategic plan and should also be welcome news to our shareholders in maximizing their return on investment as we become part of Brookhaven."By working with Brookhaven, we have the best opportunity for our CellerateRX® wound care and surgical products to achieve substantial growth and to expeditiously take our emerging resorbable bone wax technology to market," he said. Wound Management recently entered into a three-year marketing and distribution agreement for CellerateRX® with WellDyne, Inc., a leading privately-held health services company that provides pharmacy benefit management, mail order pharmacy and specialty drug fulfillment, in addition to online access to a broad range of information on health, disease, pharmaceuticals and wellness. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/wound-management-welldyne-inc-enter-204700877.htmlAbout Brookhaven Medical, Inc.Brookhaven Medical, Inc.

  Speaking for Wound Management, Robert Lutz, Jr., its chairman and CEO, said his company “is excited to execute this LOI and move forward with Brookhaven toward a definitive merger agreement. By merging with Brookhaven, Wound Management will be better able to implement our strategic plan and should also be welcome news to our shareholders in maximizing their return on investment as we become part of Brookhaven.   “By working with Brookhaven, we have the best opportunity for our CellerateRX® wound care and surgical products to achieve substantial growth and to expeditiously take our emerging resorbable bone wax technology to market,” he said. Wound Management recently entered into a three-year marketing and distribution agreement for CellerateRX® with WellDyne, Inc., a leading privately-held health services company that provides pharmacy benefit management, mail order pharmacy and specialty drug fulfillment, in addition to online access to a broad range of information on health, disease, pharmaceuticals and wellness. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/wound-management-welldyne-inc-enter-204700877.html  About Brookhaven Medical, Inc.
