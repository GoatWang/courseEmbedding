William R. Hackley

By Jerry Wilkinson

-
          
       William R. Hackley moved to
Key West in 1829 where he remained until 1857. He was a practicing
attorney
and kept a diary, of which only parts survived. The Key West library
has
a copy of all surviving portions. It was transcribed by Dr. Robert L.
Goulding,
Hackley’s maternal grandfather. The Hackley family is an important part
of early Florida history.

        Most of the
diary is
of Key West; however, we pick up with Mr. Hackley visiting the Upper
Keys
and he briefly refers to Indian Key in 1831. Should the reader only
wish
to read the entries referring to Indian Key, I have placed an * at
those
entries :

-

*        “. . .
Thursday, Feby
24th.  Got under weigh a little before sunrise. Wind N.W. and beat
up to Indian Key and came to anchor about 4 PM. We stretched out in the
Gulf out of sight of land and in going in the Capt. caught two fish
that
would weigh around 70 pounds. They were 7 ft. long, one broad with an
upper
bill projecting out 1 foot, they were nearly black but in dying
exhibited
a change of colour and has on the back a fin 28 inches long and 24
broad
which gave them a beautiful appearance in the water and two pectoral
fins
of 24 inches length and 3/4 broad. The natives of the Bahamas call this
a Pike, it is a very good fish.

*       “Friday, Feb.
25.  Got
under weigh at daylight with the wind N.E. and stood out to the reef
and
stood back to the harbour and came to anchor - - - The John Dennison
came in and I received a letter from Mother and B. papers. Captn. Wm.
Barker
went down to Key West with a load of cotton from the British Brig Marcelly
of Grenack, Capt. Monroe, who got ashore on the bar at Bear Cut on the
15th. instant from New Orleans bound to Glascow with 991 bales. She is
a total loss and the cotton is all landed on the beach. After breakfast
went on shore on Lignum Vitae Key where Capt. Rooke has built a house
for
the purpose of obtaining preemptive right [a method of obtaining the
right
to purchase land before the Homestead Act.]. It is about three miles
from
Indian Key and is about 3 miles in circumference and is heavily
timbered
and a fine soil. In one place when a well was dug a quantity of stiff
red
clay was found. A quantity of Lignum Vitae grows on the key from whence
it derives its name. Capt. Bunce went on shore for the purpose of going
down to Duck Key. Wrote a note to Mr. Browne.

     “Saturday, Feb. 26th. Rose just
before
daylight and after an early breakfast went up to Lignum Vitae Key. The
men went to work thatching the house and I took a walk thro the woods.
I found the land very good and not difficult to be cleared. The house
is
made of posts set in the ground and poles nailed across and palmetto
leaves
tied to them which forms a tight roof and lasts about five years. Got
aboard
about dark.

*      “Sunday, Feb.27th. Rose
about daybreak
and after breakfast went to Lignum Vitae Key to look at some traps set
last night for raccoons- - they took none and we hunted the woods with
the same success. Got on board at 1/2 past 12, read Roccus and remained
on board all evening as I dislike Indian Key so much that unless I have
business I am determined not to go ashore.

       “Monday, Feby. 28th. Rose at
daybreak, after breakfast went up to Lignum Vitae Key and took all
hands
to finish the house which was done and it makes a much more pleasant
one
than I had supposed possible. The leaves look rather rough on the
outside
but within they present a pretty appearance. About 2 P.M. Mr. Burton
and
two men took the boat and went to look for stone crabs. I accompanied
him
and waded for more than a hour up to my knees in the water. The crab
lives
in a hole generally under some stones from which they are very
difficult
to be taken. They are nearly round with very large claws and are much
larger
than the common crab and much more delicate eating. Got on board after
sunset. Wind blowing fresh from N.E. and about 1/2 past 7 it began to
rain
but very little fell. The Capt. (Rooke) left one of his men to prepare
the ground for planting during his absence to fill his water at the
cape
[Cape Florida].

     “March 1st., 1831 Florida Reef.
Rose at
daybreak, the wind blowing so fresh from the N.E. that we do not like
to
undertake to beat up to the cape [Probably Cape Florida] and therefore
did not get under way. Last night there were 7 wrecking vessels out of
12 which are now on the reef in the harbour and at anchor. Read the
“Peace
Campains of Cornet (sic).”

*       “Wednesday, March
2nd. Rose
at daybreak and got under weigh to beat up the reef with wind E.N.E..
Made
one or two tacks when we found that the wind was so fresh and the sea
so
high that it was needless to attempt to get up and so we ran back and
came
to anchor at Indian Key. Read Hungarian Tales. After dinner took a sail
with the Capt. up to Lignum Vitae Key. 

       “Thursday, March 3rd
[1831]. 
Got under weigh at daybreak with a single reefed mainsail, foresail
with
the bonnet off, and standing jib. The wind in squalls from about NE and
a heavy sea even inside of the reef. About 9 A.M. discovered a ship on
shore which proved to be the Amulet, of Duxbery, G. Wisdom,
Mstr.,[?]
from Boston to New Orleans - at Pickles Reef [Off of Tavernier Key] in
8 Ft. of water and she draws 13. On our arrival we found 6 sloops and
one
schooner at anchor and we came too about half a mile from the ship in a
position in some degree sheltered by the rocks but even then the
schooner
rolled heavily. The ship lay on her bilge [The widest part of her
bottom.]
and the breakers were white all around her and now and then I could see
a sea break on her stern and flying foam all over her - one of the
sloops
was anchored at a 1/4 mile and had a warp [a rope to pull with] to the
ship by means of which by hauling the boats thro’ the midst of the
breakers
the cargo was transferring on board of the wrecking vessels. Capt.
Rooke
[Hackley’s captain] went on board but there was enough without him. We
went in about sunset and anchored in Tavanier [sic]. Whilst at anchor
on
the reef the Cutter Marion pass [sic] on her way to Charleston.

       “Friday, March 4th.
Got under
weigh at 1/4 past 4 and beat out to the reef, the ships still in the
same
position. Bore up and stood for the Cape and at about 1/4 before 3 came
to anchor off the mouth of the Miami [River]. Capt. Barker and Monroe
came
on board and Capt. Rooke agreed to take a load of cotton to Key West
for
$2 a bale. Mr. Burton and myself went up the river to procure water,
saw
some ducks but killed none. I left the boat and walked down the river
for
a short distance. The land has the appearance of being very rich, being
black mould, the grass on the openings, which are frequent, being more
than waist high.

       “Saturday, March 5th.
Got under
weigh at 5 A.M. and beat up to Bear Cut [North Miami Beach] where the
cotton
was landed from the [aforementioned] brig. The schrs Wm. Ross
and
          Pizarro
and sloop Energy are here to take a load; The brig has been
burnt
to obtain the copper & c. Her stem & a stern part now alone
remains
[sic] to show the spot she struck, about half a mile from shore. Took
my
gun and walked about 5 miles up the beach, on my return killed one
partridge.
I could have shot several but had none but duck shot [too large for
partridge]
with me.”

      “Sunday, March 6th. Rose at
daylight,
all hands employed in loading schr. I had so little success yesterday
that
I do not feel inclined to try the gun again. Read Anne of Grirestein
and
tried to fish, caught a catfish and in disengaging it from the hook it
stuck one of its fins in my finger which gave a great deal of pain for
several hours.

      “Monday, March 7th. Rose at
daylight,
all hands loading schr. I went ashore and walked up the beach and
gathered
some Hicaco plumes. Returned on board about 12N. Read Roccus. After
dinner
it became cloudy and rained a little. At night the mosquitoes were so
numerous
so to make a [mosquito] bar useful.

       “Tuesday, March 8th.
Rose at
daylight, the Capt. and myself went to ye brig, on our way discovered
the
whole of the rigging & c. of the brig, got some of it and at 12 got
under weigh with a light wind from SSW. There was a heavy fog in the
morning.
Came to anchor under Key Biscayne about sundown.

       “Wednesday, March
9th. Rose
at daylight and took in 33 bales making 246 in all and the bales are
piled
four tiers on deck. After dinner took a walk up the beach.

       “Thursday (not dated)
Rose
at daylight & went fishing before breakfast. At 1/2 past 10 a
squall
came up from the N.W. and blew for a short time accompanied by rain. At
half-past 11 got under weigh in company with the schooners Pizarro
and Wm. Ross and Sloop Energy and a smack [small
fishing
boat] all loaded from the Brig Marcelly. Anchored at 7 P.M. off the
[Carysfort]
Light Ship.

*       “Friday, March 11th.
Got under
weigh before daylight and at 1/4 before 12 anchored off Indian Key. The
Capt. went up to get the men he left. Ye ship Amulet lays on
the
rocks yet but is stripped of her rigging & c. A little to the
southward
of Tavanier [sic] Mr. Owens spoke to us, he is bound up to New River
[Fort
Lauderdale]. About 1/4 before 2 got under weigh and about 7 came to
anchor
at Key Vacas all in company.

      “ Saturday, March 12.,
1831. Got
under weigh with a light breeze from the E at 4 A.M. but I did not turn
out till day. Capt. Appleby came down in company, arrived at Key West
at
5 P.M. The warf [sic] presents a very lively appearance from the number
of vessels in port. The Judge called in and set some time. I subscribed
$10 toward the salary of a preacher who is to be invited to reside at
this
place. The judge gave [a salvage award of] $2,200 in the case of the Tison.
After tea wrote Mother.

      “Sunday, March 13th. Rose
at reveille
and read my brief in the case of O’Hare vs. Brig Halcyon and
after
breakfast read over the authorities relating to the case. About 12
Capt.
Rooke went up the reef and at half-past J. Weaver sailed for Charleston
in the Sloop Mary from St. Marks. He took my letter to Mother.
