DP&L Inc. is a subsidiary of AES Corporation. Through its subsidiary The Dayton Power and Light Company, is a public utility that sells electricity to residential, commercial, industrial, and governmental customers in a 6,000-square-mile (16,000 km2) area of West Central Ohio.[1]
The Dayton Power and Light Company was incorporated in 1911 under the laws of Ohio. DP&L is the principal subsidiary of DPL providing approximately 99% of DPL’s total consolidated revenue and approximately 92% of DPL’s total consolidated asset base. DPL and its subsidiaries employed over 1,500 people as of January 31, 2008.[1] The company is based in Dayton, Ohio.
Electricity for DP&L’s 24 county service area is primarily generated at eight coal-fired power plants and is distributed to more than 515,000 retail customers.[1]
Prior to 2000, DP&L also distributed natural gas within its service area; its gas operations were divested in the Fall of 2000 to Vectren, an Indiana company that formed earlier that year.
DPL was acquired by AES in 2011.[2]

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 01/06/1925
            

                BBB has determined that Dayton Power & Light meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB:

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 01/06/1925
            

                BBB has determined that Dayton Power and Light Company meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        Dayton Power and Light Company has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 3 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Dayton Power and Light Co. v. Environmental Protection Agency







5 ELR 20415 | Environmental Law Reporter | copyright © 1975 | All rights reserved

Dayton Power and Light Co. v. Environmental Protection AgencyNos. 74-2297; 74-2358; 75-1001; 75-1118; 75-1212; 75-1398 (6th Cir. June 16, 1975)In response to various motions to transfer six consolidated petitions for review of the EPA regulations which prohibit significant deterioration of air quality in areas where it exceeds national standards, the court holds that the D.C. Circuit is the "appropriate circuit" to decide these review petitions, under § 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act.  The regulations in question are the product of a unitary rule-making proceeding, are national in scope, and apply uniformly throughout the country.  Moreover, they appear to raise no questions of law or fact which will vary from one jurisdiction to another, multiple reviews might result in inconsistent decisions, and, since their promulgation was mandated by the D.C. Circuit, that court is in the best position to determine whether its order has been followed.  As there is only one appropriate circuit, 28 U.S.C. § 2112(a) has no application here.

 PHILLIPS, Chief Judge.
These consolidated cases require us to decide which Circuit Court of Appeals should hear petitions filed by numerous parties seeking review of certain regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  For the reasons stated below, we believe that the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1857 et seq., establishes the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit as the proper court to decide the petitions for review, and accordingly we must transfer these cases to that court.
Before 1972, EPA took the position that the Clean Air Act did not prevent the states from allowing existing air quality to deteriorate so long as the pollution remained less than the level prescribed in the national secondary ambient air quality standards.  In 1972, however, the District Court for the District of Columbia concluded otherwise and ordered EPA to promulgate regulations prohibiting significant deterioration of air quality in areas where the existing air quality is better than the national standards.  Sierra Club v. Ruckelshaus, 344 F. Supp. 253 (D.D.C.), aff'd mem., 4 ERC 1815 (D.C. Cir. 1972), aff'd by an equally divided Court sub nom. Fri v. Sierra Club, 412 U.S. 541 (1973).
In response to the District Court's order, EPA promulgated regulations, 39 Fed. Reg. 42510 (1974), establishing three classes of areas: in Class I areas almost any deterioration would be impermissible; in Class II areas the deterioration normally accompanying moderate growth would be permitted; and in Class III areas deterioration up to the national standards would be permitted.  The regulations initially designated all areas as Class II, subject to redesignation initiated by the states in accordance with a specified administrative procedure.  In addition, the regulations established a preconstruction review procedure for certain new and modified stationary emission sources to ensure that the permissible pollution increment for the area would not be exceeded.  The regulations were developed through a unitary rule-making procedure, and they have the effect of amending every state's air quality implementation plan in precisely the same way.
The regulations were announced by EPA and explained in some detail at a large public meeting held in Washington, D.C., on the morning of November 27, 1974.  At 2:15 p.m. on November 27, a petition for review of these regulations was filed in this court by Dayton Power and Light Company and four other utilities.  At 3:23 p.m. on the same day Sierra Club filed a similar petition in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  Additional petitions for review of these regulations subsequently were filed in this court and in the Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits.  Sierra Club was permitted to intervene in the cases filed in this court.  The Fifth and Ninth Circuit cases have been transferred to this court, and the Seventh and Tenth Circuit cases have been transferred to the District of Columbia Circuit.
The Dayton Power and Light Company has petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel EPA to file the administrative record in this court.  Sierra Club and EPA have filed motions to transfer the petitions for review to the District of Columbia Circuit.  Petitioners in the Ninth Circuit cases have filed motions to transfer their petitions back to the Ninth Circuit.All of these petitions and motions raise the common question whether this court or some other court should review these regulations on the merits.
[5 ELR 20417]
 The air quality deterioration regulations at issue here amended state implementation plans, and as such, they were promulgated pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1857c-5(c).  The parties therefore conclude, and we agree, that jurisdiction to review these regulations is conferred by 42 U.S.C. § 1857h-5(b)(1), which provides as follows:
(b)(1) A petition for review of action of the Administrator in promulgating any national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard, any emission standard under section 1857c-7 of this title, any standard of performance under section 1857c-6 of this title, any standard under section 1857f-1 of this title (other than a standard required to be prescribed under section 1857f-1(1b)(1) of this title), any determination under section 1857f-1(b)(5) of this title, any control or prohibition under section 1857f-6c of this title, or any standard under section 1857f-9 of this title may be filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.  A petition for review of the Administrator's action in approving or promulgating any implementation plan under section 1857c-5 of this title or section 1857c-6(d) of this title, or his action under section 1857c-10(c)(2)(A), (B), or (C) of this title or under regulations thereunder, may be filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit.  Any such petition shall be filed within 30 days from the date of such promulgation, approval, or action, or after such date if such petition is based solely on grounds arising after such 30th day.
This case plainly falls within the second sentence of § 1857h-5(b)(1), and we therefore must determine which is the "appropriate circuit" to review these regulations.
Dayton Power and Light Company and the other petitioners take the position that because the regulations amend state implementation plans, interested persons are entitled to review in the Court of Appeals for the local circuit.  Thus, under the theory of petitioners, this court would be the appropriate circuit to review the regulations insofar as they amend the implementation plans of Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee.  Petitioners also suggest that even if it is concluded that both the Sixth and the District of Columbia Circuits are "appropriate," the regulations still should be reviewed here under 28 U.S.C. § 2112(a)1 since the first petition for review was filed in this court.  Sierra Club and EPA argue that because the regulations are national in scope and uniformly applicable to every state, the District of Columbia Circuit is the "appropriate circuit" within the meaning of § 1857h-5(b)(1).  In addition, Sierra Club contends that the first valid petition for review in fact was filed in the District of Columbia Circuit and that 28 U.S.S. § 2112(a) therefore offers no support for petitioners' position.
Initially, we note that the first sentence of § 1857h-5(b)(1) lists a number of administrative actions that may be reviewed only in the District of Columbia Circuit.  The second sentence specifies other actions, including amendments to implementation plans, that may be reviewed only in the "appropriate circuit." Petitioners argue that because Congress expressly made certain EPA decisions reviewable exclusively in the District of Columbia Circuit, it would be anomalous to interpret the word "appropriate" in a way that would produce the same result with respect to other types of administrative decisions.  Thus petitioners believe that by "appropriate" Congress must have meant the local circuit having jurisdiction over the state or air quality region affected by the administrative action at issue.  The problem with this interpretation is that elsewhere in the Clean Air Act Congress has conferred jurisdiction specifically upon the circuit that includes the affected state.  For example, an EPA decision postponing applicability of a particular state's implementation plan to certain pollution sources would be subject to review "by the United States court of appeals for the circuit which includes such State . . . ." 42 U.S.C. § 1857c-5(f)(2)(B).  We believe that if Congress had intended a similar meaning for the second sentence of § 1857h-5(b)(1), it would have said so.  Accordingly, we must assume that Congress purposely used the indefinite phrase "appropriate circuit" in conferring jurisdiction.
The legislative history of the Act provides some clues to the meaning of "appropriate circuit." The parties refer us to the following passage from the Senate Report:
Because many of these administrative actions are national in scope and require even and consistent national application, the provision specifies that any review of such actions shall be in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.  For review of the approval or promulgation of implementation plans which run only to one air quality control region, the section places jurisdiction in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the affected air quality control region, or portion thereof, is located.
S. Rep. No. 91-1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970).
The subject of the quoted language is § 308 of Senate Bill 4358, which is quite similar to § 1857h-5(b)(1).  This language appears to be merely descriptive of the types of administrative actions specifically enumerated in § 1857h-5(b)(1) and does not lead inescapably to any particular interpretation of the word "appropriate." The passage, however, does reflect a congressional belief that consistent application of national regulations is often desirable and can be achieved through exclusive jurisdiction in the District of Columbia Circuit.
The reported decisions provide considerably more assistance in locating the "appropriate circuit." In Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, 465 F.2d 492 (1st Cir. 1972), petitioners sought review of administrative action granting a two-year extension of the statutory deadline for attainment of air quality standards for transportation-related pollutants and approving state plans that failed to provide for the adoption of transportation controls.  Petitioners filed motions to transfer the case to the District of Columbia Circuit, and the court was required to determine which circuit was the "appropriate" one under § 1857h-5(b)(1).  The court concluded that Congress had suggested a "flexible approach" by using the imprecise term "appropriate" circuit.  Accordingly, the court weighed all of the factors bearing upon its decision:
Whatever words are used to describe the Administrator's actions on the three issues presented, we fail to understand how his rationale relates specifically to each individual state plan.  The legal issues raised by petitioners in the First Circuit seem to be identical with those raised in every other circuit.  The parties are the same.  There do not appear to be factual questions unique to each circuit.  We must also consider that litigation in several circuits, with possible inconsistent and delayed results on the merits, can only serve to frustrate the strong Congressional interest in improving the environment as evidenced by the Clean Air Act.  Additionally, we do not feel that judicial manpower is so abundant so as to permit several circuits to solve identical complex legal and factual issues in the present case.  We note that petitioners first filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District [5 ELR 20418] of Columbia Circuit.  That is where the Environmental Protection Agency has its headquarters.  That is where the appropriate files are kept and where the regulations were announced.  In light of all these factors we are led to conclude that the D.C. Circuit is "the appropriate circuit" to hear petitioner's claims.  465 F.2d at 495.
The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit subsequently accepted the transfer from the First Circuit, agreeing that "Congress intended to adopt a flexible approach to determine which circuit is appropriate . . . ." under § 1857h-5(b)(1).  Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, 475 F.2d 968, 969 (D.C. Cir. 1973).  In assuming jurisdiction, the District of Columbia Circuit looked to several of the factors that also had influenced the First Circuit:
Applying this flexible approach to the cases presently before us, it is clear from the record that all of these cases raise identical legal issues.  None of these issues involve facts or laws peculiar to any one jurisdiction; rather, all concern uniform determinations of nationwide effect made by the Administrator.  Requiring these cases to be prosecuted in the several circuits will only lead to delay on a question where time is literally of the essence, and will needlessly tax the agency's legal resources.  We therefore hold that we have jurisdiction to hear these cases.  475 F.2d at 970.
We conclude that these two recent cases were decided correctly and that the case at bar should be subjected to a similar analysis.  The regulations at issue here were the product of a unitary rule-making proceeding.  They are national in scope and apply uniformly throughout the country.2
At this stage we perceive in this case no questions of law or fact that will vary from one jurisdiction to another.  If these regulations were to be reviewed in the Court of Appeals for each circuit there would be a substantial risk of seriously inconsistent results and an inevitable delay in the effectuation of the important national policies underlying the Clean Air Act.  Finally, we note that the regulations were promulgated in response to an order affirmed by the District of Columbia Circuit.  Clearly that court is in the best position to determine whether the regulations are consistent with its order.
For these reasons, we hold that the District of Columbia Circuit is the appropriate circuit to review these regulations within the meaning of § 1857h-5(b)(1).  Moreover, we conclude that 28 U.S.C. § 2112(a) has no application to this case.  That section would control only if petitions for review had been filed in more than one appropriate circuit.  It follows that all six of these cases must be transferred to the District of Columbia Circuit, an action we take in the exercise of our inherent power to transfer cases to another court of appeals.  See Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, supra 465 F.2d 492, 495-96 (1st Cir. 1972); Eastern Air Lines, Inc. v. CAB, 354 F.2d 507, 510 (D.C. Cir. 1965); Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. FPC, 343 F.2d 905, 909 (8th Cir. 1965).
Accordingly, we deny the petition for a writ of mandamus to require EPA to file the administrative record in this court.
The motions made by petitioners in the Ninth Circuit cases to transfer their cases back to the Ninth Circuit are denied.
The motions made by EPA and the Sierra Club to transfer these cases to the District of Columbia Circuit are granted, and it is ordered that all six cases be transferred to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
All other matters are left for decision by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
The costs in this Court are assessed against the petitioners.
1. Section 2112(a) provides in part as follows:
If proceedings have been instituted in two or more courts of appeals with respect to the same order the agency, board, commission, or officer concerned shall file the record in that one of such courts in which a proceeding with respects to such order was first instituted.  The other courts in which such proceedings are pending shall thereupon transfer them to the court of appeals in which the record has been filed.  For the convenience of the parties in the interest of justice such court may thereafter transfer all the proceedings with respect to such order to any other court of appeals.
2. This distinguishes the present case from Buckeye Power, Inc. v. EPA, 481 F.2d 162, 166 (6th Cir. 1973), in which we stated that interested persons may file petitions for review of EPA action aproving or disapproving state implementation plans only "in the United States Court of Appeals having jurisdiction over their area." Beckeye involved not a uniform amendment to all state plans, but the propriety of approving the particular plans submitted by Kentucky and Ohio, and the Sixth Circuit was plainly the "appropriate" one.

Dayton Power & Light Co (OTCPK:DAYTP)
Property, Plant and Equipment
=GURUF("DAYTP","Property, Plant and Equipment")

$1,872.90 Mil (As of Jun. 2016)
Dayton Power & Light Co's quarterly net PPE declined from Dec. 2015 ($2,738.70 Mil) to Mar. 2016 ($2,733.90 Mil) and declined from Mar. 2016 ($2,733.90 Mil) to Jun. 2016 ($1,872.90 Mil).
Dayton Power & Light Co's annual net PPE declined from Dec. 2013 ($2,718.10 Mil) to Dec. 2014 ($2,512.60 Mil) but then increased from Dec. 2014 ($2,512.60 Mil) to Dec. 2015 ($2,738.70 Mil).

Definition
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are the fixed assets of the companyFixed assets are also known as non-current assets.
Property, plant, and equipment includes assets that will - in the normal course of business - neither be used up in the next year nor will become a part of any product sold to customers.
Some of the most common parts of property, plant, and equipment are:

	Land
	Buildings (and leasehold improvements)
	Transportation equipment
	Manufacturing equipment
	Office equipment
	Office furniture

Companies with lots of property, plant, and equipment often have special categories. For example, railroad property includes:

	Track
	Ties
	Ballast
	Bridges
	Tunnels
	Signals
	Locomotives
	Freight Cars

There is often a note in the financial statements - found in a companys 10-K - that will explain the different categories of property a company owns.
The market value of property, plant, and equipment can differ tremendously from the book value of property, plant, and equipment.
For example, when Berkshire Hathaway liquidated its textile mills, it had to pay the buyers of the companys manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment away. That property, plant, and equipment was literally worth less than zero. On the other hand, some companies own thousands of acres of land.
All property, plant, and equipment other than land is depreciated. Land is never depreciated. However, land is not marked up to market value either. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), land is shown on the balance sheet at cost.
The property, plant, and equipment line shown on the balance sheet is usually net property, plant, and equipment. This means it is the cost of the property, plant, and equipment less accumulated depreciation.

Explanation
A company with durable competitive advantage doesnt need to constantly upgrade its equipment to stay competitive. The company replaces when it wears out. On the other hand, a company without any advantages must replace to keep pace.
Difference between a company with a moat and one without is that the company with the competitive advantage finances new equipment through internal cash flows, whereas the no advantage company requires debt to finance.
Producing a consistent product that doesnt change equates to consistent profits. There is no need to upgrade plants which frees up cash for other ventures. Think Coca Cola, Johnson & Johnson etc.

Service Details & FAQ 







							Frequently Asked Questions

							Answers to common questions. Choose a topic from below:



Who is XOOM Energy?


Read 






XOOM Energy is an independent energy retailer who, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, supplies natural gas, electricity, and renewable energy to residential and commercial customers in deregulated energy markets (product offerings vary by state).









Where does XOOM Energy offer service in the U.S.?


Read 






XOOM Energy has wholly owned subsidiaries offering natural gas and electricity service in 18 states across the U.S. Totaling 80+ utilities – making XOOM Energy one of the largest energy retailers in the country.









Is my electricity or natural gas service ever at risk by enrolling with XOOM Energy?


Read 






No.  You are never at risk of not having service by enrolling with XOOM Energy.  XOOM Energy is required to post collateral with each utility, and in the unlikely event XOOM Energy was not able to service your account, the utility would procure and deliver energy to your home or business on XOOM Energy's behalf.









What is an energy supplier?


Read 






An energy supplier is a company that acquires its electricity, renewable energy or natural gas supplies from the wholesale market and is licensed to sell it retail to homes and business.   Wholesale energy supply sources include much of the same source that the utility will use, such as electricity generators or the open market.  An energy supplier is not your local utility. The utility still operates the local distribution wires and pipes which carry electricity and natural gas through its territory and to homes or businesses. An energy supplier purchases and supplies energy, the local utility, delivers the energy to your home.









What utilities does XOOM Energy service in Ohio?


Read 






Currently, XOOM Energy Ohio, LLC supplies natural gas throughout the Dominion East of Ohio, Duke Energy, Columbia of Ohio and Vectren territories. XOOM Energy supplies electricity throughout AEP Ohio, Dayton Power and Light Co., Duke Energy, Ohio Edison (FirstEnergy), Toledo Edison (FirstEnergy) and The Illuminating Company (FirstEnergy).









What is energy deregulation?


Read 






Energy deregulation has been around for more than two decades in certain states and is designed to ensure consumers have access to adequate and competitively priced energy supplies.  While your local utility is still responsible for maintaining the wires, pipes and infrastructure that make up the distribution system, reading your meter and responding to emergencies, the utility no longer holds a monopoly on the energy service. Customers have the ability to choose from multiple competitive retailers that offer various service plans at competing rates.









Will I be switching utilities?


Read 






No. Your local utility will remain the same and will continue to deliver energy to your home or business just like they did when you bought the energy supply from them.









Will my service be interrupted when I switch service suppliers?


Read 






No. You are never at risk for service disruptions for switching to XOOM Energy. In fact, you will see no difference in the service you are receiving. The only change will be in your billing, which will be according to the service plan contract rate you selected.









Are there monthly fees?


Read 






All fees are outlined and explained in the Terms and Conditions that accompany each service plan.









What is the difference between fixed and variable rate plans?


Read 






A fixed rate plan provides you with stability and peace of mind. A fixed rate product may be higher or lower than utility rates, but, unlike utility rates, a fixed rate product will not change during the life of your contract. You are protected against unexpected and costly price increases and have greater control over the cost of your gas.   A variable rate plan allows you to purchase gas at market-based prices that change from month to month. While a variable rate is subject to monthly price increases or decreases, it may help you realize the lowest possible cost in the market. However, it also exposes you to potential price increases, and, unlike a fixed rate, a variable rate does not protect you against price volatility.  Variable rate plans may be higher or lower than the utility rate.









Why do I have to pay a cost recovery fee if I cancel?


Read 






For XOOM Energy to offer and fulfill its term obligation to you, we have to purchase energy in advance of usage to cover the entire length of your contract.  If you cancel your contract early, XOOM Energy needs to offset the cost of selling the unused portion of your energy to others. The cost recovery fee covers this cost and any other expenses we incur because of your cancellation.









When will my service become effective with XOOM Energy?


Read 






XOOM Energy service will typically commence on your meter read date immediately following your successful enrollment in our program, meaning it may take up to 30 days. In some cases, it may become active upon the second-meter read following your enrollment. In this case, it may take up to 60 days before your service commences.
