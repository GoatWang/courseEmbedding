The Missional Entrepreneur 
Principles and Practices for Business as Mission


Russell, Mark L. (Author)	
									        	
									




The Missional Entrepreneur takes an in-depth look at business as mission in reality with an eye for the principles and practices that can make it effective.




Description


										Both an emerging term and a developing concept, business as mission (BAM) has drawn much fascination in both mission and business circles with the concept of strategically using business to accomplish missional purposes. Though the term is ubiquitous in mission circles, there is great disparity in what it means. There has been much talk about BAM in theory, but far less research done on how it works out in reality. The Missional Entrepreneur takes an in-depth look at business as mission in reality with an eye for the principles and practices that can make it effective.

Allardon December 28, 2016Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseSpouse is a former Mobil geologist who spent a lot of time on Gulf rigs...she thought the movie was very realistic, and could explain several questions my son and I had during the film (watched on our Home Theater).  The idea to not "dumb down" the dialogue was a winner for the director/producer; using the lingo of the riggers added realism to the movie; we did not need to have e.g. the "negative pressure" test explained in detail, or what the "kill line" was, etc.  The CG in the movie was seamless, and the fire/explosion scenes were great...had to Google the Making Of... to learn a bit more about how they managed to film those scenes.  We downloaded the movie to watch at home, but now I wish I had the Blu-ray to see extras...Read more22 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsWorth Seeing, especially if you or someone you know is in the industry. Lots of Lessons Learned!ByThe River Hermiton March 24, 2017Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseLet me start off by saying I am in the oil and gas industry, and have been for 30+ years. I worked my way up from a lowly bilge rat to a supervisor. This movie was well done. They got the working conditions, dress, most of the lingo, etc. correct. Even the sequence of events concerning the blowout and the subsequent explosions on the rig were pretty accurate. There were a few "Hollywood Moments" where they took things way too far, but I guess they just couldn't help themselves...I personally have had quite a bit of pressure applied to me from the top to "hurry things up" and call things "good enough". I can imagine the frustration and stress they felt in the events leading up to blowout. We just discussed this movie at this week's safety meeting. I recommended each of the guys see it. Lots of good lessons there.Read more0Comment|

No political preachinessByAmyon January 18, 2017Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseThis was a great movie. No political preachiness, just telling the story of those that worked on the rig that day. It'll definitely bring tears to your eyes, especially when they pay tribute to the men that died at the end of the movie. They should always show pictures of the actual victims and their names, so the audience really sees and understands this wasn't some made up story, this tragedy was real and the victims deserve to be remembered.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsthings like "dinosaur oil" and finding fossils in well cuttingsByMatton February 7, 2017Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseAs an engineer who works for a major oil company (Not BP) and who spent years working a 14 days on/ 14 days off schedule on deepwater production platforms (what gets put in place to produce and transport the oil/gas after the rig has drilled the wells) I think this was a  fairly accurate, and entertaining movie.  It did embellish, as others have said, things like "dinosaur oil" and finding fossils in well cuttings.  It's the decay of micro organisms, not a bunch of T-Rexs that turn into oil and give the term "fossil fuel".  Also it failed to mention a lot of other contributing factors, but gives the common moviegoer a good sense of what life offshore is like and perhaps why oil is so expensive with all the equipment and tests that are necessary to safely produce oil and gas, some of which BP shortcut.Read more0Comment|

Based upon the events leading up to the explosion which destroyed the Deepwater Horizon petroleum drilling vessel which resulted in the underwater leak which devastated the Gulf Coast a few years ago, this movie tells the stories of the drillers who struggled to minimize the ecological damage while striving to escape the inferno their vessel had be come. Mark Wahlberg, Kate Hudson, John Malkovich, Gina Rodriguez and Kurt Russell lead the talented cast in this story of heroism.Read more0Comment|

My thoughts and prayers continue to go out to the brave souls that were lost and their families, as well as all that were impacted by this accident (people and the environment). Good action and special effects. Enjoyed the capture of the human element of the people that wok this industry, who beyond common belief care significantly about doing the right thing, both offshore and onshore.  Seemed the short comings of the rig equipment (BOP, the last line of defense) were under played.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsGood movie! Should have ending paragraphs with status update about amount of oil remaining & effects on eccosystem & industryByJunie Bon April 14, 2017Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseDeepwater Horizon is an interesting, well-acted movie about the April 20, 2010 horrific explosion of the BP operated, semi-submersible Deepwater Horizon oil rig which had been located approximately 41 miles off of Louisiana, in the Gulf of Mexico.  The blow out of the Macondo well resulted in the largest marine oil spill in US history. The drilling rig had been owned by Transocean and leased by the BP oil company.This movie is enlightening in that it depicts a glimpse into family lives of 2 workers prior to an off-shore assignment, a glimpse into work lives on an oil rig, the rig employee safety concerns, and depiction of the subsequent explosion and fire at the Deepwater Horizon Oil Rig. There is little character development as the movie is intentionally plot driven. Due to good casting, acting (especially Kurt Russell), and directing, the performances are effective and believable. The seemingly real special effects are outstanding, and the movie depicts injuries without resorting to graphic details. Following the conclusion of the movie, pictures of the 11 oil rig employees who had been killed are shown, enabling the viewer to reflect upon their tragic deaths, and to honor them. Also shown is brief information regarding BP and partners, the effects of the oil spill, and  updates about surviving employees.Although this movie was not intended to encompass the devastation following the actual explosion, an additional paragraph or two regarding the disastrous consequences could have effectively emphasized that, in addition to the tragic loss of human lives, there was loss of thousands of birds, dolphins, fish, crabs, shrimp, and turtles, loss of employment for those in the seafood and related industries, adverse effects upon local businesses, and significant damage to the ecosystem.  It would have been enlightening for there to have been a statement or two about the amount of oil likely remaining in and under the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and nearby effected waters, as well as an update regarding the current status of the capped well, and of the adversely effected ecosystem and seafood industry. This is important because effects of the disaster are still being felt today, and although you can no longer see the oil smears on top of the water now, 12 years later, you can be sure that a good amount of this oil is smeared along the coral and other parts of the ecosystem below the visible water.  Although 2 senior officers on the Deep Horizon oil rig had been charged with manslaughter following the deaths of 11 persons who had been aboard the rig, no one ultimately received a prison sentence. A Civil trial held in New Orleans late February 2013 resulted in determination that BP, Transocean, and Halliburton were all negligent, with BP being 67% responsible and grossly negligent, Transocean 30% responsible, and Halliburton 3% responsible. BP agreed to pay fines in amount of $18.7 billion dollars, which then became the largest corporate settlement in United States history.Read more0Comment|
