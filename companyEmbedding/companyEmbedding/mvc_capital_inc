Financial consultant MVC Capital ( MVC  ) said Friday it has begun a modified Dutch auction tender offer to purchase up to $15 million of its common stock at no less than $10 a share and not greater than $11 in $0.20 increments. If the tender offer is fully subscribed, MVC will purchase between 6.0% and 6.6% of MVC's outstanding shares of its common stock. Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering stockholders, MVC will determine the lowest per-share price that will enable it to acquire up to $15 million of its common stock.

PURCHASE, N.Y., July  21, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MVC Capital, Inc. (NYSE:MVC) ("MVC"), a publicly traded business development company that makes private debt and equity investments announced today the commencement of a modified "Dutch Auction" tender offer  (the "Tender Offer") to purchase up to $15 million of its common stock at a price per share not less than $10.00 and not greater than $11.00 in $0.20 increments. This Tender Offer is made possible by, among other things, the liquidity generated from the sale of U.S. Gas & Electric, Inc. The Tender Offer will expire on August 18, 2017, unless extended. If the Tender Offer is fully subscribed, MVC will purchase between 1,500,000 shares and 1,363,636 shares, or between 6.6% and 6.0%, respectively, of MVC's outstanding shares of its common stock. Any shares tendered may be withdrawn prior to expiration of the Tender Offer. Stockholders that do not wish to participate in the Tender Offer do not need to take any action.
Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering stockholders, MVC will determine the lowest per-share price that will enable it to acquire up to $15 million of its common stock. All shares accepted in the Tender Offer will be purchased at the same price even if tendered at a lower price.
The Tender Offer is not contingent upon any minimum number of shares being tendered. The Tender Offer is, however, subject to other conditions, which are disclosed in the Tender Offer documents. In the future, the Board of Directors may consider additional tender offer(s) or other measures to enhance shareholder value based upon a variety of factors, including the market price of MVC's common stock and its net asset value.
MVC's Board of Directors is not making any recommendation to stockholders as to whether to tender or refrain from tendering their shares into the Tender Offer. Stockholders must decide how many shares they will tender, if any, and the price within the stated range at which they will offer their shares for purchase. 
The information agent for the Tender Offer is Georgeson LLC, and the depositary is Computershare Trust Company, N.A. The offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase"), a letter of transmittal and related documents will be mailed to registered holders.  Beneficial holders will receive the Offer to Purchase and a communication to consult with their bank, broker or custodian, if they wish to tender shares. For questions and information, please call the information agent toll-free at (877) 507-1756.
Certain Information Regarding the Tender Offer
The information in this press release describing MVC's Tender Offer is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell shares of MVC's common stock in the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer is being made only pursuant to the Offer to Purchase and the related materials that MVC has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is distributing to its stockholders, as they may be amended or supplemented. Stockholders should read such Offer to Purchase and related materials carefully and in their entirety because they contain important information, including the various terms and conditions of the Tender Offer. Stockholders of MVC may obtain a free copy of the Tender Offer statement on Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and other documents that MVC is filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission from the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at www.sec.gov. Stockholders may also obtain a copy of these documents, without charge, from Georgeson LLC, the information agent for the Tender Offer, toll free at (877) 507-1756. Stockholders are urged to carefully read all of these materials prior to making any decision with respect to the Tender Offer. Stockholders and investors who have questions or need assistance may call Georgeson LLC.

      Delivering Shareholder Value Through Superior Execution 
          
MVC Capital is an externally-managed Business Development Company (BDC) that trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol "MVC".  The Company seeks to build shareholder value by making yielding¹ , equity and other investments in middle-market companies across various industries, with flexibility to invest across the entire capital structure.
MVC Capital generally targets companies at the lower end of the middle market, with annual revenue ranging from $10 million to $150 million and EBITDA of between $3 million and $25 million.  Since these companies tend to be overlooked by traditional lenders and investment banks, MVC has a greater opportunity to positively influence the financial and operational outcomes of these organizations.
Through our manager, The Tokarz Group Advisers, MVC Capital is committed to delivering shareholder value.  Effective due diligence and ‘writing the check' are only the beginning.  Our primary responsibility is to thoroughly understand the long-term business objectives of our portfolio companies and work in lock-step with our management teams to achieve these goals.  Our ability to recognize value where others don't, combined with our ability to partner with our portfolio investments to achieve operational success, is what ultimately distinguishes MVC Capital from our peers.

¹"Yielding investments" mean investments that produce regular income or cash distributions.

				***NAV was published monthly through January 31, 2012. At its January 31, 2012 meeting, the Fund's Board of Directors determined that, after January 31, 2012, the Fund's net asset value will be made publicly available on a quarterly, rather than on a monthly basis.
				**The NAV shown takes into account the cost basis of the Fund's holding of the Vitality European operations. The Valuation Committee has not yet made a fair value determination as to such holding. This determination will be made as part of the Committee's regular first quarter-end review of the portfolio (which determination would be effective as of January 31, 2010). The NAV shown also reflects a valuation estimate of the escrow account held in connection with the Vitality transaction which amounts to 79% of the proceeds held in that account. The Valuation Committee has not yet made a fair value determination as to the valuation of this escrow account, and expects to do so also in connection with its regular first quarter-end review of the portfolio. If no value were attributed to this escrow account, the Fund's NAV per share as of 12/31/09 would be $17.54.
1 Financial data presented above is unaudited.
				*NAV as of 4/30/09 includes standard monthly income and expense accruals as well as valuation adjustments to certain portfolio companies made by the Valuation Committee (effective as of such date), in accordance with the Company's valuation procedures and FAS 157.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

      Delivering Shareholder Value Through Superior Execution 
          
MVC Capital is an externally-managed Business Development Company (BDC) that trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol "MVC".  The Company seeks to build shareholder value by making yielding¹ , equity and other investments in middle-market companies across various industries, with flexibility to invest across the entire capital structure.
MVC Capital generally targets companies at the lower end of the middle market, with annual revenue ranging from $10 million to $150 million and EBITDA of between $3 million and $25 million.  Since these companies tend to be overlooked by traditional lenders and investment banks, MVC has a greater opportunity to positively influence the financial and operational outcomes of these organizations.
Through our manager, The Tokarz Group Advisers, MVC Capital is committed to delivering shareholder value.  Effective due diligence and ‘writing the check' are only the beginning.  Our primary responsibility is to thoroughly understand the long-term business objectives of our portfolio companies and work in lock-step with our management teams to achieve these goals.  Our ability to recognize value where others don't, combined with our ability to partner with our portfolio investments to achieve operational success, is what ultimately distinguishes MVC Capital from our peers.

¹"Yielding investments" mean investments that produce regular income or cash distributions.
