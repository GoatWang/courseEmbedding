Background[edit]
A native of Baton Rouge, Reilly graduated in 1979 from Episcopal High School in Baton Rouge and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with both Bachelor of Arts (1984) magna cum laude and Juris Doctor (1989) degrees. He is a Catholic.[1]
In October 1989, Reilly wed the former Jennifer Marie Eplett, a graduate of Wellesley College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, and Harvard Business School in Boston, the daughter of Mary Jane (née Coughlin) Eplett, a reading specialist from Lexington, Massachusetts, and Dr. James Douglas Eplett, Sr. (1931–2002), a physician from Nashua, New Hampshire.[2] The couple has three children.
Lamar Advertising was founded by Charles W. Lamar, Sr., Reilly's maternal great-grandfather as a small operation in Pensacola, Florida. It is one of the largest national corporations headquartered in Baton Rouge. Sean Reilly's older brother, Kevin Patrick Reilly, Jr. (born ca. 1954), is the President and Chairman of Lamar Advertising. Another brother, Wendell Reilly, was formerly affiliated with the company. Reilly's mother is Ann Lamar Switzer Reilly, known as "DeeDee" Reilly, a native of California and a Baton Rouge civic figure in her own right.[3] Sean Reilly earns nearly $700,000 annually from Lamar.[4]
Legislative career[edit]
From 1988 to 1996, Reilly served as a Democrat in the Louisiana House from District 68.[5] He was a member of the Education, Ways and Means and Capital Outlay committees. In the legislature, he succeeded his father, Kevin Patrick Reilly, Sr., a Massachusetts native who stepped down from the legislature to run unsuccessfully for Louisiana state treasurer in the 1987 nonpartisan blanket primary. Kevin Reilly was defeated by future U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu of New Orleans.
In the primary held on October 24, 1987, Sean Reilly led a Republican, Toni Higginbotham, and an Independent, Ben Peabody. Reilly received 7,928 votes (45.6 percent), to Higginbotham's 6,146 votes (35.4 percent) and Peabody's critical 3,311 ballots (19.1 percent),[6] Four weeks later, Reilly defeated Higginbotham in the November 21 general election, 7,379 votes (54 percent) to 6,291 (46 percent).[7] He ran unopposed for a second term in the House in the 1991 primary but did not seek a third term in 1995.
Civic leadership[edit]
Reilly has served his state in a variety of capacities as an appointee of both Democratic and Republican governors since he left the legislature. From 1999 to 2005, he served under Governor Murphy J. "Mike" Foster, Jr., to the board of the Louisiana Community and Technical College System.[8] In 2005, Democratic Governor Kathleen Blanco named him to the Louisiana Recovery Authority (LRA) as a charter Board member, a position which he filled until it was sunsetted in 2010. The LRA was established to direct the rebuilding of Louisiana after the 2005 hurricanes.
He chaired the LRA's State/Local Legislative Task Force. Governor Bobby Jindal named the former lawmaker as the chairman of his Transition Advisory Council on Ethics in 2007–2008. Jindal called on him to serve on the Board of Trustees of the Louisiana Innovation Council, a group which emphasizes technology and economic development statewide.[9] In 2011, Reilly was appointed by Governor Jindal to the Post-secondary Education Governance Commission. In 2016 Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards appointed Reilly to the Task Force on Structural Changes in Budget and Tax Policy.
He is co-founder and served as board member of the Louisiana Cultural Economy Foundation 2005–2009, and co-founder of the LRA Support Foundation in 2005, helping to direct philanthropy after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. He is also co-founder and Board Trustee of Blueprint Louisiana, a non-partisan effort to fundamentally improve Louisiana, serving since 2006 and as chairman from 2008–09.
Reilly is co-founder and has since 2010 co-chaired the citizen group, Louisiana's Flagship Coalition, which supports Louisiana State University as the top tier university in the state system. Reilly served as adjunct professor at LSU's Manship School of Mass Communications from 1998 to 2001. He supports the Manship School as a member of its board of visitors. He also serves on the board of the LSU Foundation. For his services to the university and the state, LSU awarded him an honorary doctorate on May 18, 2012. He is co-founder of Baton Rouge Community College Foundation and served as its president from 1998 to 2002. For his service to BRCC, the college awarded him an honorary degree.[citation needed] Reilly recently joined the Board of World Connect, Inc. and the Board of Dragonfly Therapeutics Inc. He also serves on Episcopal High School's Board of Trustees in Baton Rouge, LA and Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy's Board of Visitors.
In 2015, Reilly was named a National Finalist Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young.

In the legislature, he succeeded his father, Kevin Patrick Reilly, Sr., a Massachusetts native who stepped down from the legislature to run unsuccessfully for Louisiana state treasurer in the 1987 nonpartisan blanket primary. Kevin Reilly was defeated by future U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu of New Orleans.
In the primary held on October 24, 1987, Sean Reilly led a Republican, Toni Higginbotham, and an Independent, Ben Peabody. Reilly received 7,928 votes (45.6 percent), to Higginbotham's 6,146 votes (35.4 percent) and Peabody's critical 3,311 ballots (19.1 percent),[6] Four weeks later, Reilly defeated Higginbotham in the November 21 general election, 7,379 votes (54 percent) to 6,291 (46 percent).[7] He ran unopposed for a second term in the House in the 1991 primary but did not seek a third term in 1995.
Civic leadership[edit]
Reilly has served his state in a variety of capacities as an appointee of both Democratic and Republican governors since he left the legislature. From 1999 to 2005, he served under Governor Murphy J. "Mike" Foster, Jr., to the board of the Louisiana Community and Technical College System.[8] In 2005, Democratic Governor Kathleen Blanco named him to the Louisiana Recovery Authority (LRA) as a charter Board member, a position which he filled until it was sunsetted in 2010. The LRA was established to direct the rebuilding of Louisiana after the 2005 hurricanes.
He chaired the LRA's State/Local Legislative Task Force. Governor Bobby Jindal named the former lawmaker as the chairman of his Transition Advisory Council on Ethics in 2007–2008. Jindal called on him to serve on the Board of Trustees of the Louisiana Innovation Council, a group which emphasizes technology and economic development statewide.[9] In 2011, Reilly was appointed by Governor Jindal to the Post-secondary Education Governance Commission. In 2016 Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards appointed Reilly to the Task Force on Structural Changes in Budget and Tax Policy.
He is co-founder and served as board member of the Louisiana Cultural Economy Foundation 2005–2009, and co-founder of the LRA Support Foundation in 2005, helping to direct philanthropy after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. He is also co-founder and Board Trustee of Blueprint Louisiana, a non-partisan effort to fundamentally improve Louisiana, serving since 2006 and as chairman from 2008–09.
Reilly is co-founder and has since 2010 co-chaired the citizen group, Louisiana's Flagship Coalition, which supports Louisiana State University as the top tier university in the state system. Reilly served as adjunct professor at LSU's Manship School of Mass Communications from 1998 to 2001. He supports the Manship School as a member of its board of visitors. He also serves on the board of the LSU Foundation. For his services to the university and the state, LSU awarded him an honorary doctorate on May 18, 2012. He is co-founder of Baton Rouge Community College Foundation and served as its president from 1998 to 2002. For his service to BRCC, the college awarded him an honorary degree.[citation needed] Reilly recently joined the Board of World Connect, Inc. and the Board of Dragonfly Therapeutics Inc. He also serves on Episcopal High School's Board of Trustees in Baton Rouge, LA and Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy's Board of Visitors.
In 2015, Reilly was named a National Finalist Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young.
Other board service includes:

Greater Baton Rouge Hospice Foundation 1991–1997

Home> About us> Entrepreneurship> Entrepreneur Of The Year> Sean E. ReillySean E. Reilly Share 		Sean E. Reilly 		2015 Road to Palm Springs 		From print to pixel: All signs point to success for Sean E. Reilly of Lamar Advertising Company.	   		  		Lamar Advertising Company		CEO		Pensacola, FL		Founded: 1908 		Lamar Advertising’s story of success began with the dissolution of a business partnership and a coin flip that awarded a simple Pensacola, FL sign company to Charles W. Lamar. It was considered to be the losing end of the deal, but over the years this onetime small family business has been the leader in innovative ideas and concepts for the industry, and CEO Sean E. Reilly has been at the epicenter of its evolution. 		Among his accomplishments, Sean has overseen the acquisition of notable advertising firms; debuted digital printing; created an Emergency Alert System that displays Amber, FBI, FEMA and other emergency alerts; led the energy-efficient transformation for billboards that now house solar panels and LED lighting; and introduced and promoted RoadNinja, Lamar’s free interstate travel map, all while producing 3D billboard enhancements that have revolutionized the out-of-home display advertising market. 		Sean is a staunch believer in empowering Lamar’s management team, establishing a flat organizational structure that vests autonomy for decisions about pricing, new-site development, hiring and operations among its 200 local managers with limited oversi9ght from Lamar’s management team. The message it sends is that Lamar trusts its managers to make the right call, ultimately cultivating an organization-wide entrepreneurial spirit that extends well beyond family leaders. 		Cumulatively, these actions have helped to firmly establish Lamar as a member of the “Big Three” in out-of-home advertising. 		Who really lost that coin flip?

Home> About us> EntrepreneurshipEntrepreneurshipInsideAbout usOur valuesOur global approachOur leadersGlobal reviewEntrepreneurshipEntrepreneur Of The YearOur people and cultureDiversity and inclusivenessOur historyOur awardsOur alumniOur Knowledge advantageCorporate responsibilityEY/Ethics hotline Share	Entrepreneurs make a difference. They not only have great ideas, but also the drive to make them a reality. They use their fresh thinking and hard work to create positive social change – bringing new concepts and products to market, and creating jobs and wealth.	We have long recognized the potential of entrepreneurs. Over the past three decades, we have been working with entrepreneurs, adapting our experience, industry capabilities and resources to work for entrepreneurial, fast-growth companies. We work with a range of businesses, from those receiving their first venture funding through to large mid-cap companies, whose value may be measured in billions of dollars.	Our commitment to entrepreneurial companies, in both emerging and developed economies around the world, helps ensure that we’re working with more of tomorrow’s global leaders, today. EY Entrepreneur Of The Year® –  celebrating entrepreneurs	We started the Entrepreneur Of The Year Awards program to celebrate successful entrepreneurs, so they could share their stories, inspire others and receive the recognition they deserve. Our first program took place in 1986 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the United States	By 1987 it was held across 11 US cities. And in 1993 the program started to expand internationally. Today the program spans more than 140 cities in 50 countries, which together represent more than 90% of the global economy.	Over the past five years, more than 6,500 entrepreneurs joined the Entrepreneur Of The Year alumni. A “who’s who” of both developed and emerging markets, these alumni include many household names. Over half of today’s top 100 NASDAQ companies have won Entrepreneur Of The Year, and most received the award before they achieved top 100 status.	Ten years ago we decided to go global and started World Entrepreneur Of The Year. Held annually in Monaco, Entrepreneur Of The Year country winners compete for the World Entrepreneur Of The Year title. Past winners include Michael Spencer of ICAP plc, Guy Laliberté of Cirque du Soleil and Narayana Murthy of Infosys Technologies.     Nature or nurture?	Entrepreneurs turn excellent ideas into successful businesses. But where does this capacity come from? We look into the mind of the entrepreneur.     Entrepreneurial insights We interviewed more than 40 of the world's leading entrepreneurs and captured their thought- provoking observations in this unique collection of video conversations.
