Capturing Value from Waste through Innovative Resource Solutions


























Solutions Wanted
How can we all recycle more and waste less?





A cross the country, thousands of municipalities, businesses, institutions, and households are working to increase their recycling and reduce their waste. They understand how wasting less and recycling more can help conserve resources, protect the climate, support jobs, and create value. Some have already made great progress, and others are just getting started, but nearly everyone wants to be doing more.
As a resource management company, we view our customers as partners, each with their own values, expertise, and a unique set of waste streams waiting to be renewed.
To each customer partnership, we bring decades of practical experience, insights from multiple industries, a willingness to listen and innovate, and a passion for providing resource solutions.
Resource Solutions are the comprehensive services we provide to help our customers achieve their resource management goals, from today's pressing needs to tomorrow's visionary aspirations. The solutions we provide include: Recycling, Collection, Organics, Energy, and Landfills.
For complex industrial, institutional, or multi-location customers, we bring all of these services together with our professional expertise to deliver a holistic, customtailored Resource Solutions approach.
Recycling and value creation
Throughout this report, we often refer to "value creation." With this we are referring to the proven idea that holistic resource management can create real value for businesses, for example by uncovering operational inefficiencies, reducing unnecessary purchasing, minimizing waste disposal, and engaging employees and customers around positive environmental performance.

Our comprehensive Resource Solutions enable us to apply our knowledge and experience in recycling, collection, organics, energy and landfills to create economic and environmental value for our customers and our communities.










Our Resource Renewal Vision







We have Believed in a vision for resource renewal long before it was first defined in our 2009 Sustainability Report.

Resource renewal is about turning waste into resources. It is what we do when we partner with our customers to find practical ways to harvest value from discarded materials.
With resource renewal, we help to convert society's current linear system of resource extraction-and-disposal into a cyclical system in which eventually there are no wastes; there are only resources.
We humbly acknowledge that we cannot create this transformation overnight, nor can we create it alone. Such a shift requires a thoughtful policy framework and the active collaboration of players throughout the global supply chain, including: manufacturers who insist on responsibly harvested raw materials, designers who craft products for durability and recyclability, and consumers who respectfully handle and care for the products they buy.
Although this cyclical resource economy is still in its infancy today, with this report we are proud to provide a few case studies that show that resource renewal is possible. See page 38 for more.



The Zero Waste Cycle











"There are no benign technologies that take away all of the results of our activities as human beings. One doesn't have the God-given right to consume the world's resources with no consequences for what we're doing. You don't exist to do anything from a socially responsible standpoint unless you're a profitable company. So, we have to be capitalists to survive, but that doesn't mean that's all we have to be."
- John W. Casella, Creating Excellence Magazine, September 1990






Letter from the CEO




Nearly four decades ago my brother Doug and I built Vermont's first recycling facility in our hometown of Rutland. It was a simple plant for baling cardboard, and other material and we had simple motives: 1) to serve and create value for our customers; 2) to grow and diversify our business; and 3) to play a part in protecting the natural heritage and landscape of Vermont.
It was not a term anyone used widely back then, but our small recycling plant was built upon the foundation of sustainability - both environmental and economic. This is the only true sustainability; one does not exist without the other.
From that first facility - and on that foundation - we have built a company with a vision of solid waste management powered by a broad and enduring commitment to providing recycling, collection, organics, energy, and landfill services, and other resource solutions.
Now, forty years later, you are viewing our company's third sustainability report. We've shared it with you at a time in history when sustainability is no longer simply an experiment, but an imperative. It is no longer a buzzword, but a powerful framework for addressing the challenge of our planet's limited resources while driving economic opportunity and strength, innovation, creativity and quality of life.
We have three goals for this report.
First. Celebrate the progress our company has made in contributing to the sustainability of our planet, our communities and our customers' lives and businesses. Also, we rely on this report, and the public life it lives, to hold us accountable to our beliefs and our behaviors.
Second. Share with you our local, homegrown perspective on sustainability from our unique perch here in the northeastern United States. We are a local company, blessed to live and work alongside our customer and communities. We see - and share - their challenges, their needs, their goals, and their vision for their own lives and livelihoods everyday in a way only a New England company with Vermont roots can.
Third. Begin a vital conversation about how we all view the social, economic, and environmental value resource renewal and resource solutions create across our marketplace, our nation, and our planet. We are at an important moment in history, a turning point that has given us an opportunity to shift the way we look at our resources and the investments we may be required to make to sustain a high quality of life. Many of our paradigms and approaches are antiquated, and will not serve us well in the future. What has worked for the previous four decades, we believe, won't work for the challenges of the next ten, twenty, or forty years. We don't necessarily have the answers, but everyone needs to be a part of the conversation - a conversation we'd like to lead.
While we talk a lot in this report about our facilities, hard assets and investments, and our services, I firmly believe that the coming years will reveal our people and our partnerships to be our most compelling assets. Faced with the tremendous task of developing a whole new infrastructure for resource sustainability and inspiring deep shifts in public thinking and behavior, we must not underestimate the power of our talented, passionate people working in partnership with motivated customers, engaged communities, and visionary organizations.
So, it is our people who make this report more than a document, who live our beliefs everyday, and to whom we owe our thanks.



Regards,

John W. Casella
Chairman & CEO, Casella Waste Systems, Inc.

Our Journey & Approach
Like so many others, we operate in a dynamic industry that is in transition. Some of the major issues currently affecting the way we run our business include:








Global trends in population and economic development are placing mounting pressure on natural resource supply chains. For both environmental and economic reasons, the world needs high quality recycled commodities to minimize our reliance on virgin resources.
The mix of material in the disposal stream has shifted. We are seeing less paper and a wider variety of plastic packaging in the recycling stream. In general, we are seeing a larger ratio of industrial material entering the disposal stream, and less municipal material due to local recovery efforts.
The economic and environmental viability of the Waste-to-Energy (WTE) incineration model is coming into question, leaving communities to decide whether to enter long-term agreements with WTE suppliers, or pursue alternatives.
State-level decision-makers are passing new rules in hopes of creating environmental benefits, economic efficiencies, and green jobs. Vermont's Act 148 Universal Recycling Law and Massachusetts' new commercial organics ban are examples.
Customers want more than just reliable, safe, and compliant solid waste service; they are looking for partners to help them meet recycling goals and a new professional services model that includes access to data, recycling options for more of their waste streams, and low carbon disposal options.
The most progressive customers are taking a sophisticated approach that looks beyond the solid waste budget line-item to recognize and invest in the full value creation possibilities of holistic resource management.

Against this evolving backdrop, we have gravitated toward a strategic approach that emphasizes:

Listening to customers to deeply understand their service needs.
Drawing upon our operational expertise and knowledge to solve pressing problems.
Applying our expertise in commodity markets to help customers capture value from their waste.
Deploying solutions that are flexible and responsive to customer needs.

The approach is customer- rather than technology-centric. Instead of a one-size-fits-all, build-it-and-they-will-come approach, it is adaptive to evolving local needs. The resulting solutions and expertise leave us uniquely positioned to deliver shared environmental and economic value to our customers and communities, which in turn positions our company to thrive in the post-disposal, resource renewal economy.





Our Goals







Recycle 1 Million tons per year of recyclables and organics.
Over the next two years, we will focus on reducing our company-wide greenhouse gas emissions per ton of waste received.
With this report we are renewing our commitment to this reduce our diesel consumption by 10%.
As with our diesel goal, we are renewing our commitment to reduce our electricity consumption by 5%.
Demonstrate improvement in our annual corporate culture survey.
By 2015, train 100% of our managers to apply Selecting the One principles in their hiring decisions.
By 2016, 80% of managers and supervisors will have completed leadership training.












Shared Responsibility for Social Good
We believe that the services we provide and the investments we make in managing and renewing resources must be economically sustainable as well as environmentally sustainable. One cannot exist without the other.
We also believe that recycling is part of a larger and more crucial set of challenges facing society and the planet. We are - we believe - entering an era of constraints and limits in nearly all areas of human activity, including energy, climate, and natural resources.
In this belief, we are optimists. These challenges represent significant opportunities for innovation, creativity, economic growth and security, environmental stewardship, and quality of life for future generations. These challenges also demand major shifts in thinking, particularly around how and why we shape public policy, how and why we pay for resource renewal, and how and why we place a value on it - for ourselves, our children, and our society.
The economics around many of our most pressing resource challenges - energy, climate, etc. - remain underdeveloped and in need of transformation. Recycling, for example - and its widening contribution to resource sustainability - is one of those challenges.
If our goal as a society, and as a planet, is to address the challenges of resource limits, and to build a sustainable way of life, are resource renewal services like recycling worth paying for? Is recycling worth investing in for the short- and long-term social, economic, and environmental value it creates? What responsibility does each of us have to contribute to its economic sustainability so we continue to enjoy its environmental sustainability?
Our goal - in fact, our responsibility - is to lead that conversation with our stakeholders, public policymakers, and our customers.
