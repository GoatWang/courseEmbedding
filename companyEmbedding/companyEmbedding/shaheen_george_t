					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

George T. Shaheen (born July 11, 1944), an American businessman, was chief executive at management consulting firm Andersen Consulting from 1989 to 1999, before moving on to now-defunct online grocer Webvan. His Webvan employment agreement, signed September 19, 1999 was filed with the SEC.[1] By going to Webvan, Shaheen missed out on the windfall of the Accenture initial public offering.[2] He holds a master's degree in finance from Bradley University.[3] Shaheen is an American of Lebanese descent.[4]
In 2005-2006, Shaheen was CEO of Siebel Systems, Inc.[5] and served as CEO when it merged with Oracle.[6] He did not stay on with Oracle after the merger.
Cultural references[edit]
George Shaheen was the target of parody in the comic Bigtime Consulting, which had a very similar CEO character named George Unseen.

Mr. Shaheen has served on the Board of Korn/Ferry International, an international executive search and consulting firm, since September 2009 and currently serves as Chairman of the Board. Since June 2004 he has served on the board of NetApp, an enterprise technology company that provides data storage systems.
