OVERVIEW
EXPERIENCE
NEWS
PUBLICATIONS






Robert L. Bowman



	Robert L. Bowman has significant experience in aviation litigation matters, complex civil litigation matters, including the defense of claims for construction defects, personal injury, wrongful death, product liability, negligence, and breach of contract.

	Robert earned his undergraduate degree in engineering from the U.S. Military Academy, an MBA from the University of South Florida, and his law degree from the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis. Prior to attending law school, Robert served for six years as an officer and helicopter pilot in the U.S. Army.



Experience







Secured dismissal of all claims against Snohomish County, Washington, stemming from the 2014 Oso landslide that killed 43 people and destroyed a community in northern Washington. The plaintiffs, whose claims against the county centered on an alleged failure to warn of the potential for a dangerous landslide, agreed to dismiss those claims (reserving the right to appeal) after the court ruled in the county's favor on several pre-trial motions.
