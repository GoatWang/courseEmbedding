December 2014 MLP Market Insights
December 2014 – The US shale boom has created an additional 1 million barrels per day growth in crude oil production with another 0.6 million barrels per day of additional global growth. Global growth of demand is 1 million barrels per day leaving a current surplus of 0.6 million barrels per day. OPEC has not cut production, and now there is a growing global glut.

October 2014 MLP Market Insights
October 2014 – A very compelling buying opportunity for MLPs is emerging. The market usually presents small to moderate drawdown windows about once in a 12 month period. Over the past 18 years, there have been 3 periods with AMZX Index (Alerian Total Return) drawdowns greater than 10%. We are experiencing the fourth now. Historically, the faster an MLP market drawdown has occurred, the faster the downturn has ended and the AMZ and AMZX have achieved new highs. The MLP growth story is still solid. [read more]

Comparing US MLPs to US REITs

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
