The Take-Along VL2000 model is equipped features such as GSM/GPRS for data and voice SOS alert notifications, locate-on-demand, and a sleep mode with motion sensor for up to 14 days battery life. The Prime Lite model is a robust device, small enough to embed in a host of consumer or enterprise products for quick and easy tracking.
Embedded Tracking Devices[edit]
GPS tracking insoles utilize an invisible wandering assisted technology. The patented GPS SmartSole™ feature a miniaturized GPS tracking device implanted in the insoles and powered by a rechargeable battery with a 2-3 day single charge. The GPS SmartSole™ sends signals to a central monitoring website showing the exact location of the wearer/device using a combination of satellite and cellular technology.
