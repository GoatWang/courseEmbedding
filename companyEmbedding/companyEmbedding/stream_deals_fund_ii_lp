Reviews
“If you're the kind of gamer who is interested in building an empire without the constant blood-and-guts warfare of the Crusading era this is a welcome option.”8,5/10 – GamingNexus“The large-scale grand strategy of Crusader Kings 2 can feel Game of Thrones-ian in its web of intrigue and plotting. The Republic expansion takes place on a smaller scale. At times, its petty inter-family squabbling feels more like medieval Eastenders. Brilliant.”79/100 – PC Gamer

Top scientists of the world completed the most ambitious project of human being, the Global Artificial Intelligence Assembly, known as 'Gaia'.Gaia is build on the cloud. She connects all devices from cell phones on the hand to satellites in the space. Gaia collects all information, from which kind of hamburger you like last week, to all the stock deals in past 10 years, then analyses the mass data by assembling computing resources all over the world, and finally calculate the 'ultimate solution' for every human being. For the common people, Gaia will tell he or she what to do for every minute, to eat which food or read which article. It is not an order, but people always find that by following Gaia's suggestion it always benefits most. For the army, Gaia play as the commander, she can calculate the best move for each soldier on the field at the same time, and finally lead them to victory, without anyone wounded.Not like in Hollywood movies, Gaia did not build Skynet to eliminate human, or build her drone army to conquer the world. Followed by the first principle in her source code, "Help but not replace human", Gaia served human well. But the real conflict come from human them self: Many people realized that because of Gaia, human do not think any more, and finally abandoned their freedom. At the beginning, it is just some kind of idealism, but when AI let more and more people lose their job, it became rebellion. Most of them are elites in the past, but become useless when Ai came: No fund manager is useless because AI always give the best financing solution; Gaia can command soldiers directly through the holo-glass, so officers are not needed. Even the scientists who make Gaia are not escaped, a scientific AI study matrix can do all the life-time work of a professor, but only in an hour.Finally, those elites in the past decided to fight against Gaia, but soon they found all devices and weapons are controlled by Gaia. Cameras and drones spreads everywhere in cities, human forces even had no place to hide. So they banished themselves to abandoned industrial cities, they rebuild factories, using the technologies of 80s, which seems to be out dated but Gaia can not connect to. They re-active tanks and attack helicopters in the steel cemetery, rebuild battleships of WW2, some report said that they even rebuild the space shuttle platform. At last, they build up a settlement and their armies, without Gaia's control, they called themselves "Steel Alliance".Now, the war between Gaia and Steel Alliance is inevitable, no matter which side you are, good luck, commander:)

LCN Capital Partners has raised over $750 million for its second European fund. LCN European Fund II’s limited partners include European and North American pension plans, insurance companies, foundations and ultra high-net worth family offices. FocusPoint Private Capital Group was the placement agent.
PRESS RELEASE
\New York – May 22, 2017 – LCN Capital Partners (“LCN” or the “Firm”), an investment management firm co-founded by former W.P. Carey senior executive, Edward V. LaPuma, and former Goldman Sachs senior executive Bryan York Colwell, announced today that it had successfully completed fundraising for its second set of funds. The $-denominated LCN North American Fund II, L.P., and €-denominated LCN European Fund II, SLP (“FundsII”) raised in excess of $750 million. This fundraise provides LCN with over $2.5 billion in aggregate additional purchasing power. LCN’s credit-focused, quarterly income-oriented strategy targets “primary market” corporate sale-leaseback and build-to-suit investments across North America and Europe.
Funds II achieved their targets with a well known and diversified institutional investor group including both European and North American pension plans, insurance companies, foundations, and ultra high net worth family offices.
“We are pleased to announce the final close of our second set of parallel $- and €-denominated funds at levels exceeding our targets. We about doubled the capital raise achieved by our first two funds, each now fully invested and making their 8th quarterly distribution,” stated Ed LaPuma. Mr. LaPuma added, “We have successfully built our sale-leaseback investment platform with offices in New York, London, and Luxembourg, and our investing-partners continue to seek attractive investment attributes that primary market corporate sale-leaseback ownership provides.” Sale-leasebacks are a hybrid of credit-based leases coupled with the security of real estate ownership creates the security of an inflation-protected quarterly income stream insulated from the mark-to-market volatility that direct real estate ownership often entails. Mr. LaPuma added, 





“We appreciate the continuing strong support of original investing-partners and welcome our new investing-partners to Funds II which are already over 30% invested.”
Funds II continue LCN’s strategy of originating and structuring “primary market” traditional and build-to-suit sale-leaseback investments directly with corporate owner-occupants. Since its first set of Funds commenced investing, LCN has distinguished itself as a provider of liquidity as well as a reliable long term ongoing capital partner for its tenant-clients. LCN counts among its tenant-clients some of the largest global public companies and also privately owned concerns across North America and Europe. “With an Investment Committee of the two founders each engaged on LCN’s transactions, LCN can provide the certainty and speed of closing, handle deal complexity, and preserve confidentiality. These abilities have led some of the world’s best known corporate names to partner with LCN for their sale-leaseback and build-to-suit transactions” says Bryan York Colwell, Co-Founder/Managing Partner of LCN.
The LCN team has completed in excess of 250 sale-leaseback and build-to-suit investments exceeding $10 billion in cost, and currently has over $1.75 billion of property since launching its initial set of funds in 2013. LCN is headquartered in New York City, with offices in London and Luxembourg.
FocusPoint Private Capital Group acted as exclusive placement agent. Schulte, Roth & Zabel serves as fund counsel. Arendt & Medernach serves as Luxembourg counsel.

About LCN Capital Partners
LCN Capital Partners, a private equity firm with offices in New York, London, and Luxembourg, pursues a single proven strategy: credit-focused investments in operationally critical corporate real estate across certain industry sectors and commercial property types in North America and Europe. LCN has in excess of $1.75 billion of property. 





We believe this market opportunity is increasingly compelling as (1) corporate boards demand greater capital efficiency in their businesses to unlock real asset capital for growth and expansion, (2) alternative non-bank finance sources broaden in acceptance and importance, and (3) capital markets and traditional lending sources for middle market companies remain contracted while the volume of maturing corporate debt expands.
LCN seeks to provide (1) high quarterly distributions provided by long-term rental contracts which provide bond-like cash flows, (2) inflation protection based on contractual rent increases in addition to underlying real estate ownership, and (3) unique security given operationally-critical real estate ownership limits downside risks versus other corporate creditors both secured and unsecured.
LCN Capital Partners’ senior management team has unparalleled experience in corporate and real estate finance, having held senior leadership roles in investment banking, capital markets, asset management, and commercial real estate at the world’s preeminent firms. LCN Capital Partners is a natural extension of the Managing Partners’ prior experiences: the creation of an institutional and ultra-high net worth platform for global corporate sale leaseback investing. Co-founder
Edward V. LaPuma created and led W.P.Carey’s international businesses during his over 15-year tenure there, pioneering the sale-leaseback market in Europe as well as serving as president of two successful REITs of $2 billion and $700 million each. Co-founder Bryan York Colwell is a 17-year veteran of Goldman Sachs investment banking/M&A, and later served as a global group head at ABN Amro Bank.

                Video tab on site said to be pushed back to later this year
            



                Company said to fund some ‘hero’ shows with six-figure budgets
            



With the $70 billion TV advertising market in its sights, Facebook Inc. is starting to bankroll the creation of video series that will begin to appear on the world’s largest social network later this year.Facebook is closing deals for its first batch of shows, including two that the Hollywood Reporter unveiled earlier this week -- reality competition series “Last State Standing” and a second season of comedy “Loosely Exactly Nicole,” which first appeared on MTV. The shows will be available via a new video tab on Facebook that hasn’t been released.By funding a slate of original programs, Facebook hopes to entice more production companies to upload premium video, which Facebook will then use to siphon advertising dollars away from television. The lucrative advertising market inspires TV networks to create hundreds of shows and newer media companies, teenagers and aspiring filmmakers to upload billions of hours of video a day to YouTube, Snapchat and other online portals.




Facebook isn’t trying to compete with the highest end of that market -- paid services Netflix, HBO and Showtime. It has its sights set on cable networks and advertising-supported online services with young viewers.“Funding video is a way for Facebook to figure out its greater advertising program,” said Matthew Segal, chief executive officer of ATTN, a digital media company that publishes video to Facebook. “It’s clear they want to be a bigger player in the space; they want to eclipse TV.” Read more: A Bloomberg Intelligence midyear report on internet companiesFacebook has been hosting video for a few years, and two years ago began sharing advertising revenue with some companies that uploaded clips. While many of those companies found large audiences on the social network, few generated enough advertising revenue to treat Facebook as a primary distribution outlet for high-end video.Facebook executives have compared funding original videos to priming the pump at an oilfield, giving creators a financial incentive to upload more video, get a taste of the large audiences they can attract, and come back for more. Facebook has paid celebrities to use its live video feature, and encouraged TV networks and movie studios to stream live events and trailers on the social network for free promotion.









Facebook's Money Machine Targets TV Ad Dollars





Facebook is funding two kinds of programs -- a handful of more expensive series from established TV producers that will take a few months to produce (hero shows, they are called) and a bunch of shorter, cheaper videos from publishers like Vox Media Inc. and BuzzFeed Inc. (called spotlight shows). All shows will be episodic and designed to spur conversation among Facebook users.For the hero shows, Facebook is willing to spend a couple hundred thousand dollars an episode, according to people familiar with the matter, budgets that compare favorably with many cable networks. The shows will be exclusive to Facebook, which has expressed a desire for programs that appeal to young women (think “Pretty Little Liars” or “The Bachelor”), said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.For spotlight shows, Facebook is giving publishers a minimum guarantee of $10,000 to $20,000 an episode up front, and will have exclusive rights to the program for a period of time before the videos can be made available elsewhere, the people said. Facebook will share advertising revenue with the publishers, who can start to sell their own advertisements after a brief period.Facebook has been assembling a team of executives to shepherd its entree into Hollywood, starting with Ricky Van Veen, co-founder of comedy site College Humor. The company has since hired Netflix Inc. executive Sarah Madigan to acquire video programs and former MTV executive Mina Lefevre to oversee the development of new shows. Now Van Veen is looking to hire a head of unscripted development to work under Lefevre, people familiar with the matter said.Facebook’s interest in funding video tantalizes Hollywood, where producers drool at the thought of another deep-pocketed patron alongside fellow tech giants Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. Other new players, like Verizon Communications Inc., have had a harder time, often committing less money to less ambitious shows.With 2 billion people checking their news feed every month, Facebook reaches more people than any TV network. “Not only do nearly 100 percent of people under 35 have an account, but they are spending over 1,000 minutes a month on Facebook,” said ATTN’s Segal.Yet some elements of Facebook’s video strategy are still uncertain, according to employees and partners. Facebook hasn’t detailed how advertisements will be displayed on the programming it’s funding, and has yet to show many of its partners a demo of its new video tab, which is also called Spotlight. Publishers and producers are eager for Facebook to create a new destination for video since most users don’t watch clips in the news feed for more than a minute or two.“Getting people past 90 seconds is still a challenge,” Segal said.The debut of Spotlight was supposed to be earlier this year, was later pushed to June, and may now not happen until the fall, the people said. Facebook had successfully bid to host a live stream of singer Katy Perry around the debut of her new album, but had to forfeit the rights due to the delay of Spotlight, they said. The four-day event, Witness Worldwide, aired on YouTube last weekend.

Facebook is also developing a second tab that will be devoted to the more high-end programming, the people said. Facebook prefers not to put details of the video product in writing and will only discuss it by phone, according to people who have dealt with the company. Facebook has also rankled some potential partners by insisting on selling advertising itself and inserting ads into the middle of live broadcasts, the people said.Facebook has a small staff handling original programming, not enough to manage a robust operation. Facebook would rather share money from advertising sales than pay for content in the long term.“The sustainable model is some sort of revenue sharing,” Fidji Simo, Facebook’s head of video product, said in an interview. “The goal is really to get a lot of different partners to come to Facebook share their content and find success. It’s very hard to find that over the long term by funding.”That approach appeals to companies uploading short-form videos, but it may not make sense to high-end creators accustomed to large budgets. TV networks typically pay a licensing fee for a show and then keep revenue from the ads they sell. The studios still often retain the right to sell the program overseas, or sell reruns to other networks, which benefits writers and actors as well.Live sports, an area of growing interest to Facebook, is also very expensive. Facebook has added live feeds of baseball games and soccer matches through deals with different leagues, and previously pursued the rights to stream Thursday Night Football games. For now, leagues are using Facebook to test how many viewers they can reach on the site. They also hope early experiments will convince Facebook to spend big on future rights.
