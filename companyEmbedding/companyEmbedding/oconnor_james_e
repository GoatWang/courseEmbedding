Products Liability


	The unique perils of products liability laws and regulations are well known to companies involved with the manufacture or sale of commercial goods. Unlike other torts, when it comes to products liability, the evidentiary burden for plaintiffs is relatively low and the exposure for defendants can be extraordinarily high. Even the most vigilant, safety-conscious companies must be prepared to respond to serious products liability claims. In this era of globalized trade and extensive cooperation and communication among plaintiffs’ firms, companies should expect the frequency of products liability filings, particularly multi-jurisdictional class claims, to increase.

	Cozen O’Connor has been a leader in products liability defense for more than three decades. Our attorneys represent foreign and domestic designers, manufacturers, and distributors of a diverse array of products, from food and drugs to industrial equipment and building materials. We help clients respond to major personal injury and property damage claims in the form of single-product cases, class actions, mass torts, and multidistrict litigation, as well as all types of congressional, regulatory, or criminal investigations. We routinely appear before state and federal courts, arbitration panels, and federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and Consumer Product Safety Commission.   

	Members of the products liability team serve as ongoing national counsel to major products manufacturers. In this role, we build long-term client relationships and work closely with corporate counsel to minimize a company’s overall liability, establish efficient protocols for fielding claims, and limit the need for in-house litigation support. We advise clients about labeling, marketing, manuals and instructions, supply and distribution contracts, and insurance and indemnification issues. We analyze clients’ possible exposure to particular losses and mount an immediate and aggressive response to threatened or filed claims.

	Our attorneys not only have deep knowledge of the relevant law, but also a keen understanding of the importance of adept case management and superior preparation. Cozen O’Connor’s Products Liability Group has designed a proprietary database that can be tailored to track specific industries and clients when issues arise. Additionally, we have formed a network of more than ten thousand accredited scientific experts, from metallurgists to pharmacologists, who work with our attorneys to interrogate every aspect of a case.

	The firm has a successful track record of trying complex cases. More attorneys at Cozen O’Connor have first-chaired products liability trials than at any other comparably sized firm. This benefits our clients in numerous ways. Having regularly been through the crucible of trial, our attorneys’ strategic advice is based on an accurate understanding of how facts and arguments are likely to be perceived. Moreover, our reputation as trial lawyers gives us leverage in negotiations because adversaries know we settle only to serve our clients’ best interests – not to avoid court.

	While our clients demand the highest-quality legal services, cost containment and budget predictability are also important concerns for well-managed companies. Particularly in products liability litigation, where the full scope of a problem may not be immediately clear, Cozen O’Connor works closely with clients to develop litigation strategies that limit exposure and prevent escalation. We staff tight teams led by senior attorneys who communicate directly with clients about strategy and ongoing claims management.

	 

SERVICES


		Serve as national trial counsel and national coordinating counsel for product manufacturers

		Represent manufacturers, distributors, suppliers, and retailers

		Defend against allegations of products liability, including negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty, and consumer protection violations

		Manage single-product cases, class actions, mass torts, and multidistrict litigation

		Advise clients regarding underlying potential liabilities and exposure to particular loss claims, and review contracts, warning labels, and sale or distribution protocols

		Negotiate cross-jurisdictional global sourcing agreements between foreign makers of component parts and stateside assemblers or manufacturers


	 

CLIENTS

Food Contamination & Recall. Our attorneys routinely handle high-stakes food products liability claims and provide food-industry crisis management services. We help clients respond decisively at the first sign of trouble and defend clients in major food recall cases.

Safety Products. Cozen O’Connor is a leading advocate for the smoke alarm industry, serving as the national coordinating counsel and national trial firm for an international alarm products manufacturer. Our attorneys have successfully tried numerous cases to verdict in state and federal courts throughout the United States, often achieving wins for the defense on all counts.

Aviation. Our firm is known for its successful representation of aviation clients in a range of matters, including products liability, wrongful death and survival actions, personal injury, warranty claims and product recalls, and property damage. Because aviation litigation frequently involves multiple filings in multiple jurisdictions, Cozen O’Connor has a strong network of aviation attorneys in offices across the country and around the world.

Medical and Life Sciences. Cozen O’Connor’s attorneys combine sophisticated products liability experience with deep knowledge of the health care sector and cutting-edge medical technology. We are positioned to defend developers, designers, suppliers, manufacturers, and users of medical and life sciences products, particularly against claims of personal injury or wrongful death.

Additional Focus Industries. Cozen O’Connor also has extensive experience serving clients with exposures in the areas of sports equipment, automotive and off-road vehicles, construction equipment and building products, toxic torts and chemicals, firearms, and manufacturing equipment.

	 

TEAM

	Cozen O’Connor’s team includes more than eighty lawyers who have distinguished themselves in the field of products liability. Our attorneys are named fellows of the American College of Trial Lawyers and the International Academy of Trial Lawyers, and are ranked by Chambers and Partners. In addition to being recognized by independent legal observers as among the nation’s “most influential” trial attorneys who are regularly involved in “significant verdicts,” our lawyers are also known for their intellectual gravitas. They serve on national boards and lecture frequently on products liability and tort defense.

	While the design, manufacture, sale, and promotion of many products is now a global endeavor, the majority of U.S. products liability laws are determined by individual states and vary widely across the country. Top law firms, therefore, must be able to operate effectively on the international, national, and state level. Our attorneys have played lead roles in some of the most sprawling multi-jurisdictional products liability litigations to date, including in defense of asbestos, tobacco, and diet systems companies. With offices abroad and lawyers licensed across the United States, Cozen O’Connor has the capacity to respond to products liability matters wherever they arise.

The announcement quickly led to the filing of two putative class action consumer lawsuits against Cascade, one of which is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and a lawsuit by NOCSAE against Warrior in federal court in Missouri.

An Attack on Plaintiffs' Use of Consumer Complaints [The Legal Intelligencer]


            			            February 11, 2014
					            

                                    In products liability actions, plaintiffs use prior consumer complaints as evidence that a defect existed or that the defendant ignored a known defect. Precluding these prior consumer complaints is important to the defense, because this evidence has significant potential to prejudice the jury and lead to the imposition of liability in cases where plaintiffs have failed to produce sufficient proof of a defect. For these reasons, defendants must challenge the admissibility of prior consumer complaints. Defendants should argue that the communications are not substantially similar to the facts, circumstances and defects claimed in the case at issue (and are, thus, not relevant), and are inadmissible hearsay.

8th Circ. Suggests More Mass Torts May Be Removable [Law360]


            			            January 03, 2014
					            

                                    The Eighth Circuit recently upheld the removal to federal court of product liability claims filed by over 100 plaintiffs in state court in St. Louis. See Atwell v. Boston Scientific Corp., 2013 (8th Cir. Nov. 18, 2013). The decision illustrates how plaintiffs’ requests to coordinate multiple cases can sometimes sweep “mass tort” cases filed in state court right into federal court as a “mass action” under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005. This is no small shift in a litigation, and so Atwell provides a helpful background on some of the characteristics of a plaintiff coordination proposal that can trigger such CAFA removal.

                                    The Admissibility of Other Incidents in Aviation Products Liability Cases - International Association of Defense Counsel - Typical law school evidence courses include only a cursory examination of the admissibility of “other acts”,1 and even then, it is usually in the context of criminal cases under FED R. EVID. 404(b). And, indeed, the federal rules and case law are well-established when dealing with the government’s efforts to use evidence of other acts against a criminal defendant. But in civil matters—products liability cases in particular—the rules are less clear. So it is

                                    International Litigation: The U.S. Jurisdiction To Prescribe and the Doctrine Of Forum Non Conveniens - The Federal Lawyer - Since the 1945 decision by Judge learned hand in United States v. Aluminum Co. of America (colloquially known as the "Alcoa" case), it has become well-established law that the Sherman Antitrust Act-legislation that was adopted over 100 years ago-applies to and prohibits conduct in foreign countries if that conduct has an illegal "effect" in the United States.

Irradiation of Iceberg Lettuce and Spinach: Has It Gone Far Enough? [freshcut.com]

                                    Lettuce and spinach tainted with E. coli creates panic throughout the country. Raw onions contaminated with hepatitis kill four and sicken nearly 700. Salmonella-laden tomatoes make hundreds ill and raise fears of bioterrorism. While this may sound like something out of a bad horror movie, foodborne illness and the devastation it leaves behind – both in terms of human suffering and costs to our economy – should not be taken lightly.

Recent multi-state, international recalls of Escherichia coli (“E. coli”) and Salmonella contaminated produce in 2006 and 2007 highlight the countless examples of the widespread
impact of food contamination claims in our modern, industrialized society.

As a result, much political action has ensued to safeguard our imported food supplies, most notably with respect to our relationship with China.

For years, personal injury lawyers have been searching for “the next asbestos,” and although they achieved significant successes against big tobacco, a new toxin with the staying power of asbestos has remained elusive.

OConnor Product Excellence Video


Here is a short film that describes our manufacturing process for the mainbody housing of the OConnor 2575 pan and tilt head.
In our products, we use some of the most pacing mechanical manufacturing technologies such as the latest advances MIM, to technologies such as investment casting, developed in ancient Egypt over 5000 years ago!
The mainbody is the main hub around which everything is built. It houses the fluid drag chambers and pan and tilt bearings, as well as, acting as the base for mounting the counterbalance mechanism.
The Video starts with the melting of the magnesium alloy ingots and the construction of the sand moulds from an array of patterns and core boxes. The cope and drag are assembled and the casting poured.
The casting is then extracted, runners and risers are cut off and the casting is fettled and heat treated for strength in preparation for machining.
The castings are then loaded into a high speed Horizontal NC Milling machine to be cut to its final tightly tolerance dimensions, being inspected carefully along the way!
The machined part is then carefully deburred before being sent off for coating, this coating stops the magnesium corroding and also provides a key for the hard epoxy paint.
Once painted the casting is ready for final assembly and testing.
If you want more detail on this or have any questions please go to our ‘Ask OConnor’ section.

Labs

Chadwell O’Connor developed the Fluid Head pan and tilt system in the late 1940s while trying to solve the problem of panning smoothly while he pursued his passion of filming steam locomotives. His invention only became a marketed product when Walt Disney himself saw Chad O’Connor using that Fluid Head, and placed an order for 10 of them. OConnor Engineering Laboratories was born.
Today, OConnor specializes in fluid heads, tripods and camera accessories, and though the founder has passed on, OConnor employees all over the world continue to observe the art and craft of cinematography, in order to invent, innovate and improve products to further the art and help ease the craft. With a nod to Chad and the amazing legacy he left us, we created the Labs - a technical section of our website, designed to share our experiences with you. It will feature tips & tricks on how to use, tweak and fix OConnor products in the field, complete with pictures, videos and short editorial pieces.

The adjustment range of the O-Grips is defined as one half-sphere per module. This half-sphere is the result of having one full circle of movement in a primary plane around the mounting point and one half-circle of movement in all planes perpendicular to this primary plane.

I've had to use Greg twice now, and both times my outcome has been surreal. I was initially referred to Greg from a friend who also received a great result, and I wouldn't refer anyone but Greg Nelson. His experience as a Prosecutor shows, as he has extensive knowledge on the inter workings of the courts and you can tell he is respected by all. Not only does Greg help with the final outcome, but he is a good ally to have during the entire process. A DUI can be a very stressful process, but Greg's experience and professionalism helps take away a lot of this stress. To top it off, he is very reasonably priced and accepts payment plans. Please, don't choose a lawyer before contacting Greg Nelson.Greg, thanks again for your professionalism and assistance during my tough times. Sean M.Farm Bureau Financial Services Ron Randallrideumcowgirl ratedRon Randall &amp;amp; his Farm Bureau staff are goldenRon cares about his clients.  He isn't just an agent.  He becomes an ally who will go to bat for you for getting your premiums reduced, claims reconsidered, and coverage extended.

He is as thoughtful and forthright an agent as you will ever find.  And his staff are very friendly, helpful, and caring as well.  He attracts positive people.  I would recommend this agency to anyone who is looking for a change.  You won't be disappointed.Quinn LawNicholas B. ratedI hired justin for a family law issue.

When buying a policy, the person agrees to pay a premium, which is small, regular payment based on the losses that may occur. If the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy, the premium is usually higher. Premiums are often paid monthly, and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured item.Many types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item. The amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible. In the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers, the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what. If the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount, the insurance company does not pay anything. If the cost is greater than the deductible, the policyholder only pays the deductible, while the insurance pays the rest. Generally, the deductible amount is related to your premium, with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium, and vice-versa.Insurance Agents
Selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage. This is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation. Agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most. Based on their needs and individual risk, agents can often give potential customers a quote, which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy. This is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost, because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time. Insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly. Credit scores play a major role in insurance scores, but past insurance-claim history is also taken into account.While agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance, some sell several different types of insurance. Agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently, selling policies from several different insurers.Insurance ProductsAlmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances. Insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed. Some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all use.Automotive Insurance
Millions of Americans drive a car to get from place to place each day, so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types. In most states, the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car, up to a certain amount. Most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance, which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault. Liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident. It's important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others, not the policyholder themselves. In addition to liability insurance, car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident. For this purpose, liability, vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policy.Insurance can also be purchased for other vehicles, like motorcycles, ATVs, boats or RVs, and generally functions similarly to car insurance. Policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous, or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle. Many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles, ATVs, boats and RVs.Homeowners Insurance
Your home, condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for, so it makes sense to get it insured. Homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself, but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well. Many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policy.Like auto insurance, homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items. The primary coverage type is for the dwelling, insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it. Policies may also cover property within the home, with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets. Personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for, much like auto insurance.Property insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control. These are known as perils, and may include fire, flooding, natural disasters and other catastrophic events. You may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a high-risk area. Flood insurance is an exception, however, and can be purchased through the government-sponsored National Flood Insurance Program. Your lender may require this if you live in a flood-prone area.Health Insurance
To help pay for medical expenses, many people rely on their health insurance. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act, almost every American is required to enroll in a health care plan, or they face a penalty. Health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance, although it is probably used to cover expenses more often, since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine. Health insurance also operates on a premium-deductible model, and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle. For example, if you visit doctors very infrequently, you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible. On the other hand, people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible. Dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by law.Life Insurance
When someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work, it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones. Many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost. Life insurance comes in two basic types: term and universal. With a term life insurance plan, you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time, usually 10 years or more. If you die at any point in that timeframe, your family receives a death benefit. If you're still around when the term is over, the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing. Universal life covers your entire life, and usually delivers a minimum benefit at death.Travel insurance
Travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel, whether it's losing luggage or medical treatment abroad. Travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations. Travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage. Specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks, like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation. Blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trip.Pet insurance
Pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog, cat or other domestic animal. Medical care for animals can be very costly, particularly because insurance for them is rare. By paying into a premium, you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication. While virtually unheard of a few years ago, pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to rise.Umbrella insurance
Umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies, usually home or auto insurance. Consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover. For example, most car insurance liability policies cover at least $25,000 per person or $50,000 per accident. But if the accident involves a very valuable car, or the victim is willing to pursue legal action, insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost. You may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policy.Insurance Claims BasicsTo receive a payout for an insurance policy, the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company. The basics of the process are straightforward, but can vary depending on the type of insurance.Claims Adjusters and Examiners
A claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company, and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided. An adjuster inspects claims related to property damage, as in the case of auto or home insurance policies. Claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance, and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedures.How To Make a Claim
Filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing, but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses. It's important to note that in the case of emergencies, you should always call 911 first. The safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insurance.Auto Insurance Claim: If you're involved in an accident, you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation. You can file a claim upon obtaining the police report. It's also a good idea, if possible, to take your own notes at the scene. The most important things to record are what happened before the accident, the date and time, traffic signs in the area and road conditions. Also be sure to get the other driver's name, address, license plate number and insurance information. Even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process. Once you have this documentation, call your insurance company right away.
Homeowners Insurance Claim: In the case of damage, take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved. Take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible. If any of your possessions were damaged, use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim. Once an adjuster has made their own report, review it for accuracy.
Life Insurance Claim: Send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan, as well as a certified copy of the policyholder's death certificate. With the proper information, life insurance claims are generally straightforward. Problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy. In this case, an attorney may be needed to settle the claim.Finding Discounts on InsuranceInsurance is a wise investment, but it can make a dent in your monthly budget. Thankfully, there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you need.Shop and Compare
Perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible. Even after you've chosen a plan and started paying into it, consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy. Consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy. While traditional agents can still find a good deal, independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs. The Internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before. Potential customers can often get free quotes online very quickly.Buy Only What You Need
Insurance agents will often try to "upsell" on various extra products that may be useful for certain people, but are generally excessive for the average consumer. Stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs. For example, if the annual cost of your auto insurance is 10 percent or more of the total value of your car, drop all but the most essential coverage. This is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings. Otherwise, you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash. It can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policy.Take Advantage of Discounts
Insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances. In one of the most basic discounts, many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home, auto and life insurance policies from the same provider. Car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course. For those with teenagers on their plan, good grades can earn a small discount as well. Insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums. Some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel, federal employees, teachers, first responders and their families.
