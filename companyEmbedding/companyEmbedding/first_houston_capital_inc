What are analysts saying about CA stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about CA stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period." (7/17/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "CA announced the acquisition of privately held Veracode for $614M in cash. Veracode provides SaaS-based application security for integration across the software development lifecycle. The deal value represents about 6.0-8.0x NTM revenue, which we view as reasonable, and discuss in more detail below. We believe providing security at the application level will become even more important over time given the ever increasing distributed nature of IT infrastructures." (3/7/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CA (NASDAQ:CA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.13)Consensus Price Target: $34.85 (12.07% upside)

Products
First Houston Capital manages diversified portfolios that consist of individual stocks and bonds. We do not buy mutual funds or products managed by other companies. We believe that we create portfolios that are highly transparent and simple to understand.
Some level of cash is nearly always present in every portfolio and is kept in a money market fund until a better alternative is found. Except for these modest amounts of cash, however, we are nearly always fully invested.
We have different investment styles to fit every client’s goals and objectives as defined here:
FHC Growth and Income portfolios include equities that provide growth at a reasonable valuation. Portfolios may contain foreign securities but primarily own large U.S.-based companies.  Growth is the primary consideration; income is secondary.  The tax implications of selling a security are important.
FHC Equity Income includes stocks that provide growth at a reasonable valuation and above-average dividend yields.  Portfolios may own foreign securities.  The key aspect of this style of investing is that income is a primary consideration; capital appreciation is secondary.  The tax implications of selling a security are important.
FHC Aggressive Growth portfolios buy stocks for appreciation and sell stocks short in anticipation of a decline.  Portfolios may own foreign securities and are not constrained by market capitalization.  This style of investing is focused on short-term trading which may produce volatile results.  Absolute return drives the process.  Tax implications are ignored.
The FHC Total Return Bond portfolios invest in high quality taxable fixed income securities, primarily corporate bonds. The investment objective is a high level of income consistent with preservation of capital.
We will be glad provide a list of our largest holdings upon request.

Investment Philosophy
First Houston Capital takes a value-oriented investment approach, sometimes referred to as “growth at a reasonable price.” We seek to own proven, profitable and predictable companies.
We like companies that pay cash dividends or have the capacity to do so. We own businesses that have barriers to entry against competitors and hold a sizable market share in their products.
We do not invest in companies with highly cyclical past performances. We also do not speculate in futures, real estate or “concept” stocks.
We consider selling stocks when they are over-priced, when they fail to meet our objectives or when the position becomes larger than 5% of a portfolio. Otherwise, our favorite holding period is forever.

Individual & Joint Accounts
Individual and joint accounts are generally taxed by the Federal government for both income and realized capital gains.
At First Houston Capital, we manage our portfolios with taxes in mind. We do not jump into and out of the market, creating lots of short-term gains and losses. Rather, our focus is long-term. Our preferred holding period for a stock is forever, hopefully creating capital appreciation that may never be taxed. When we sell, we try to capture the benefits of long-term capital gains. Selling can also limit losses and offset gains elsewhere in the portfolio.
We favor companies with a history of paying dividends to shareholders on a regular basis. Dividend income has historically benefited from a lower tax rate than interest income or ordinary income.
Our portfolios usually hold between 40 and 50 stocks among different economic sectors. This provides efficient diversification without a portfolio looking like an index fund. The ownership of individual stocks allows clients to gift shares to charity or other family members without paying capital gains taxes.
First Houston Capital is not a tax advisor but we do try to run individual and joint accounts as tax efficiently as we can. Please check with your CPA or someone with specialized tax knowledge when seeking tax advice.

Retirement Accounts
Retirement accounts include a variety of different tax deferred arrangements that range from 401-K savings plans, simplified employee pensions (SEPs) and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). First Houston Capital can manage almost every type of retirement account and build a portfolio specifically designed to meet a clients’ goals and risk objectives.
Our core investment philosophy applies to all portfolios regardless of their tax status. We aim to buy great companies among numerous industries that are reasonably priced at the time of purchase. We try to hold winners for big gains and sell the inevitable losers for small losses.
One unique tax deferred character of retirement accounts allows us to move into or out of a stock without concern for the tax consequences. For example, we may sell covered calls against a stock position in retirement accounts to generate extra income and hedge market risk. If the stock is “called” away, the client has likely had a profitable trade but no tax consequences. Such buying and selling in a retirement account does not normally have to be reported to the IRS.
Retirement accounts are not taxable until the owner begins to make withdrawals, often deferred until age 70 1/2.
Please check with your tax advisor before creating a retirement account or adding/withdrawing from an existing account.
