He joined Aleris in 2012 and presently leads the global finance activities for the organization. Mr. Rychel will join the Audit Committee of Cliffs Natural Resources' Board. With the addition of Eric Rychel, the Cliffs' Board of Directors is now comprised of ten members, of which nine are independent directors.
