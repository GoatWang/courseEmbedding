Mr. Eure previously served as a director of WCI Communities, Inc., a homebuilder whose stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We believe Mr. Eure's long career in public accounting, his financial, business, and accounting expertise, and his service as a public company director provide the requisite qualifications, skills, perspectives, and experience that make him well qualified to serve on our Board of Directors. Mr. Eure qualifies as an audit committee financial expert.
