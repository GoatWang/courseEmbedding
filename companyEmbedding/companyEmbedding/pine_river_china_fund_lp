Pine River Capital Management L.P. is an asset management firm.[3][4][5][6] The firm trades stocks, fixed income, derivatives, warrants and listed investment vehicles.[7] The company manages approximately $14 billion[2] across three actively managed platforms: hedge funds, managed accounts and listed investment vehicles to support a number of strategies including interest rates, mortgages, equity long/short, event-driven equity, and global convertible bond arbitrage.[8][9] The company is currently managed by founder and CEO Brian Taylor and 17 partners.[10][11]

History[edit]
Brian Taylor founded Pine River in 2002 to pursue opportunities in global relative value trading with an initial investment of $5.3 million.[3][12] Since then, the company has grown to over $14 billion in assets under management and employs over 500 people.[2][13] The firm was initially located in Pine River, Minnesota, before moving to Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2003.[3] In 2007, Pine River relocated to Minnetonka.[14] Pine River now has offices in New York City, London, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, San Francisco, Austin and Luxembourg.[15][16] The firm has a presence in Shenzhen, building and maintaining analytics platforms and doing in-depth research on China’s on-shore companies and markets.[11]
Pine River Capital Management is a signatory of the Hedge Fund Standards Board.[17] Pine River Capital Management L.P. became registered as an investment advisor with the US Securities and Futures Commission in January 2006. Pine River Capital Management (UK) Limited became authorized by the British Financial Services Authority to manage investments in the UK in January 2004.

Pine River Capital Management L.P. became registered as a Foreign Institutional Investor in IIndia in February 2008.[18] Pine River also complies with the Open Protocol Enabling Risk Aggregation Standards.[19]
In 2009, a subsidiary of Pine River became the external investment manager of Two Harbors Investment Corp. (NYSE: TWO), a publicly listed real estate investment trust that invests in mortgage-backed securities and related instruments.[20]
Investment Style[edit]
Pine River’s various portfolio management teams take a relative value approach to investing, seeking to identify dislocations between prices of related financial instruments and markets.[3][21] The firm had returns of roughly 90% in 2009, largely due to its mortgage investments following the 2008 financial crisis.[3] Pine River also pursues opportunities in a range of global markets and has developed into a diversified investment firm.[22][23] Alongside its growth in assets under management, Pine River has created infrastructure and risk controls that support further expansion.[24]

China Would Outlast U.S. in Trade War, Billion-Dollar Fund Says

                Trade war a ‘distinct possibility’ in 2017, James Wang writes
            



                China better placed to use state resources to aid exporters
            



China would outlast the U.S. in a trade war, which is a “distinct possibility” next year after President-elect Donald Trump takes office, a commentator wrote in the $1 billion Pine River China Fund’s investor letter.China’s government would be better placed than the U.S. to marshal state resources to cushion the impact on exporters, wrote James Wang, a City University of Hong Kong professor who pens a monthly commentary for the fund. Privately-owned Chinese exporters would be worse hit than state-controlled peers because they have less political clout in Beijing, he said.“By design, decision-makers in a democracy face difficulties coordinating a relief effort and must eventually face a political backlash from impacted domestic producers,” Wang wrote. “On this basis, the Chinese may have more runway to play the long game in a trade war.”








During his campaign, Trump pledged to brand China a currency manipulator and impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. His protocol-breaking phone call with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and his attacks on China on Twitter have sparked further friction between the world’s two biggest economies before he takes office next month.Trump’s electoral victory capped a year of rising populism that Wang likened to the aftermath of World War I, which ushered in an age of discontent and protectionism.Diffuse Power“The balance of power worldwide is much more diffuse compared to the early 20th century, and players like China and India have emerged to create new political centers of gravity,” Wang wrote. “However, as economic and political paralyses spread across the developed world, the most likely outcome is a trade war.”




Pine River China Fund is being spun off into a separate Hong Kong-based company next year, led by its current manager Dan Li and minority-owned by Pine River.Punitive tariffs on China’s shipments to the U.S. would knock 3 percent off China’s gross domestic product next year, triggering a hard landing for the nation and hurting the global economy, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. China equity strategist Kinger Lau said in November.

Chinese exporters of “Wal-Mart type” goods, including clothing, furniture, footwear and textiles would be hurt, while the impact of tariffs on telecommunications equipment is less obvious, as the lion’s share of profit from an iPhone accrues to Apple Inc., instead of its Chinese suppliers, Wang wrote. In retaliation, China could potentially withhold aircraft orders from Boeing Co. as well as curb automobile and agricultural imports from the U.S., he said.In the U.S., such a trade war could stimulate inflation and dent domestic consumption, he added.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
Single inverse ETFs are trading tools that allow investors to either seek profit or seek to apply a hedge for an existing portfolio position that they anticipate will experience negative returns, in the short term.

The fund allows investors a tactical trading alternative to selling out of an existing position and creating a taxable event.
Since it does not employ leverage, compounding is less magnified compared to leveraged inverse ETFs.

Inverse ETFs are designed to move in the opposite direction of their benchmarks on a daily basis, and should not be expected to track their underlying indexes over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand the consequences of seeking daily inverse investment results and intend to actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The CSI 300 Index (CSIN0301) is a modified free-float market capitalization weighted index comprised of the largest and most liquid stocks in the Chinese A-share market. Index constituent stocks must have been listed for more than three months (unless the stock’s average daily A-share market capitalization since its initial listing ranks among the top 30 of all A-shares) and must not be experiencing obvious abnormal fluctuations or market manipulations. One cannot invest directly in an Index.

The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
