Navigating Global Bond Markets















Navigating Global Bond Markets

 / 























The Global Bond Markets Are Changing





The global bond market is undergoing a series of profound changes, challenging the traditional role of income and stability that bonds have played and creating new opportunities. We believe investors should understand these changes and adapt their portfolios to the new fixed-income landscape.











Interest Rates May Challenge Investors
 






Opportunities Exist Across the Globe, Across the Spectrum
 






Divergence in Global Growth
 






Lower Liquidity, May Mean Higher Volatility
 











Can Your Portfolio Keep Up?





We believe investors should consider dynamic and flexible fixed income investments that attempt to neutralize or even benefit from rising interest rates. Investors should also consider strategies that seek value across all sectors of the global fixed income market, allowing them to diversify geographically and take advantage of diverging growth patterns.  Overall investors may prefer highly liquid mutual funds for their long-term investments, not individual bonds, and money market funds for their short-term investments.

Investment Philosophy
Our in-house research effort enables us to identify investment opportunities and drives all investment decisions. This work combines a macro-economic approach with thoughtful analysis of trends in major industrial groups and detailed evaluation of companies. Methods embody classical economic and business analysis to understand market position, growth prospects, and cost structures, among other factors. The goal is to understand businesses well and to be able to determine what constitutes fair value for an enterprise.
In pursuing this objective the firm relies on a variety of sources of information,
including published annual and interim reports as well as other documents that may be available to develop insight and understanding. Industry publications and analysis prepared by third parties are frequently used. Attendance at industry fairs and conferences are also helpful. In each case LBA personnel will contact and meet with representatives of companies that are being considered for investment. Our research includes the development of financial forecasts for each company considered with the cooperation of senior management. We believe this is an important part of our evaluation process, helping us better understand the various influences on profitability and possible changes.
The team gives careful attention to the price paid for all investments both absolute and relative to other opportunities. Discipline in comparing market prices to internally developed valuations and ensuring we do not overpay is important to long term results.
The scope of our work is global. LBA seeks and evaluates attractive industries and companies around the world and measures them against their international competitors.
Intrinsic value is created in a business over the long-term. To capture that value, the team strives to develop insight into fundamental trends that will have a longer term influence on an investment. 
Since LBA's inception over 25 years ago, the firm has pursued the same investment approach in all asset classes and has applied this approach consistently across all portfolios. The firm uses no external managers, and all investment decisions are made based on research performed by the firm's portfolio management team.
LBA's goal is to build portfolios that are exposed to diversified economic activity in many industries and regions of the world. In equity investments, we focus on companies that have strong balance sheets, steady cash flow, solid dividend yields and the prospect for appreciation on the strength of improved performance and market re-valuation over a three to five year time horizon. In fixed income investments, we emphasize holding high quality bonds that meet the objectives of stability and income. We focus on studying the world and North American economies to develop views on future movements in interest rates to position the portfolios appropriately. We also spend time looking at individual securities and their particular attributes, such as credit risk, inflation protection, embedded options, and other characteristics.

Investment Team
Investment decisions are made in committee by the research team. Members of this group have varied academic backgrounds which include business training, typically at the MBA level. Other disciplines include electrical, civil, industrial and metallurgical engineering as well as chemistry, economics and accounting. We are also fortunate to have team members who have studied and worked in different regions of the world. Members of this group assess opportunities in both equity and credit markets thus bringing an integrated approach to the assessment of risks and opportunities for both these asset classes.
Each person in this group participates as a member of the investment committee which meets weekly to review and approve specific investment proposals and construct the overall investment strategy. Discussion typically involves detailed review of economic conditions and their influence on bond and stock markets. The review of individual companies is set in context of the companies' competitive position within the industry. This analysis would customarily include a discussion of market share, cost structure and business development strategies. Marketing and client service professionals may also participate in these meetings to add both perspective and assure a more complete understanding of investment positions.

Each year API Asset Performance Inc., an investment counseling and research consultancy firm, unveils the list of the best performing managers ranked by various asset classes.
This week the pension consultant released the 2013 winners, which are the managers, or the firms that generated the best one-year performance numbers. The winners are drawn from the firms/pooled funds that are part of its database. Here are the results:
 BALANCED FUNDS The top performer was the Hughes Little Balanced Fund, which posted an annual return of 26.94%. That gain for the Vancouver-based manager was just ahead of the 26.5% gain recorded by the Letko Brosseau RSP Balanced Fund, but comfortably ahead of third placed, Trimark Income Growth Fund which recorded a 22.94% advance.
 CANADIAN EQUITIES North Growth Canadian Equity Fund, managed by Rory North – whose father Rudy was one of the founders of Vancouver-based PH&N — posted the best one-year gain: the fund was up by 46.97%. (The same fund, that has 40% exposure to technology companies, is up 15% this year.) That return was considerably higher than the 33.59% increase generated by CI Cambridge and the 30.96% gain for 1832 Canadian Value.
US EQUITY The 1832 U.S. Growth Fund generated the largest one-year gain: It was up by 51.59%, just ahead of the 51.37% rise for the Louisbourg US Equity Fund and the 50.45% increase posted by Kingwest U.S. Equity Portfolio.
INTERNATIONAL EQUITYThe Q International Fund, managed by Connor Clark & Lunn, posted the largest increase, a 39.05% gain, slightly ahead of the 38.79% increase generated by the Bissett International Equity Fund and the 38.34% jump posted by the Brandes Canada International Equity Trust.
GLOBAL EQUITY It was no contest given that the Orbis Global Equity Strategy was up by 56.17% — about 10 percentage points above the 47.25% gained by the Templeton Global Equity Trust. CC&L’s Q Group Global Fund was up by 44.94% for the year.
 SMALL CAP Over the 12 months ended December 31, 2013, the Mawer New Canada Fund posted a gain of 51.08% — a touch ahead of the 49.36% increase made by the HSBC Canadian Small Cap Equity Pooled Fund, but comfortably ahead of third placed, the QV Small Cap Fund.
UNIVERSE BONDS It was tough to generate any return at all from this asset class: With a gain of 0.35% the 1832 Canadian Bond Fund was the best performer. The second and third placed firms – the Aurion Income Opportunities Fund and the Jarislowsky Fraser Bond Fund – posted gains of 0.24% and 0.09% respectively.

Navigating Global Bond Markets















Navigating Global Bond Markets

 / 























The Global Bond Markets Are Changing





The global bond market is undergoing a series of profound changes, challenging the traditional role of income and stability that bonds have played and creating new opportunities. We believe investors should understand these changes and adapt their portfolios to the new fixed-income landscape.











Interest Rates May Challenge Investors
 






Opportunities Exist Across the Globe, Across the Spectrum
 






Divergence in Global Growth
 






Lower Liquidity, May Mean Higher Volatility
 











Can Your Portfolio Keep Up?





We believe investors should consider dynamic and flexible fixed income investments that attempt to neutralize or even benefit from rising interest rates. Investors should also consider strategies that seek value across all sectors of the global fixed income market, allowing them to diversify geographically and take advantage of diverging growth patterns.  Overall investors may prefer highly liquid mutual funds for their long-term investments, not individual bonds, and money market funds for their short-term investments.

7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
