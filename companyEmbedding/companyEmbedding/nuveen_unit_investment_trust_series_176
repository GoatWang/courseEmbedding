Investing involves risk; principal loss is possible.


There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in a unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a trust.


Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost.


Teachers Advisors, Inc., Nuveen Asset Management, LLC, Symphony Asset Management LLC, and NWQ Investment Management Company, LLC, registered investment advisers and affiliates of Nuveen, LLC serve as the portfolio consultants responsible for recommending a portfolio of securities for certain unit investment trusts.  Argus Investors Counsel, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morningstar Investment Services, Inc., Prospect Capital Management L.P., Zacks Investment Research, ARK Investment Management (“ARK”), and KKM Financial, LLC also provide portfolio consulting services for various unit investment trusts but are not affiliated with Nuveen, LLC or its affiliates.

Investing involves risk; principal loss is possible.


There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in a unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a trust.


Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost.


Teachers Advisors, Inc., Nuveen Asset Management, LLC, Symphony Asset Management LLC, and NWQ Investment Management Company, LLC, registered investment advisers and affiliates of Nuveen, LLC serve as the portfolio consultants responsible for recommending a portfolio of securities for certain unit investment trusts.  Argus Investors Counsel, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morningstar Investment Services, Inc., Prospect Capital Management L.P., Zacks Investment Research, ARK Investment Management (“ARK”), and KKM Financial, LLC also provide portfolio consulting services for various unit investment trusts but are not affiliated with Nuveen, LLC or its affiliates.

Incapital and Nuveen Investments Expand Unit Trust Partnership




















June 10, 2015 08:30 ET

		New Unit Trusts Leverage Expertise of Nuveen's Multi-Affiliate Model

		Enhanced by Incapital Additions to Unit Trust Business

		Nuveen Expands Specialist Sales Support Team for Unit Trusts

CHICAGO, June 10, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Incapital LLC and Nuveen Investments, today announced the expansion of their joint-distribution and portfolio consultant unit trust partnership with the addition of new unit trusts and expanded sales resources at both firms to support the growth of the unit trust business and better serve the financial advisor community and their clients. Since the beginning of 2014, Nuveen and Incapital have partnered together on key aspects of unit trust product development, marketing, distribution and client relationship management. In this partnership, Incapital serves as trust underwriter and sponsor, providing units to the public through broker-dealers and other firms.  Nuveen Investments, through its several affiliates, serves as portfolio consultant responsible for developing investment strategies and constructing model portfolios for the unit trusts.

	Commenting on the partnership, John DesPrez, Incapital's Chief Executive Officer, said, "Incapital's relationship with Nuveen Investments continues to deepen. With the expansion of our joint-distribution agreement, we will be offering a wider range of investment strategies to thousands of additional financial advisors and their clients."

INCAPITAL UNIT TRUSTS FEATURING NUVEEN'S INVESTMENT EXPERTISE

	Since inception of the partnership, Incapital has offered five equity unit trust strategies that draw upon the deep and specialized expertise of Nuveen Investments' affiliates:


		Nuveen Equity Outlook Portfolios

		Nuveen Large Cap Dividend Portfolios

		Nuveen Core Real Estate Securities Portfolios

		Nuveen NWQ Global Dividend Value Portfolios

		Nuveen Tradewinds Global Energy Revolution Portfolio


	To further broaden its platform for clients, Incapital has been working closely with Nuveen this year to develop a robust pipeline of new unit trusts employing a variety of strategies and themes. Capitalizing on the recently closed Nuveen 2015 Equity Outlook Portfolio, Series 68, which more than doubled in assets from the prior year's series, Incapital filed an initial registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the Nuveen 2015 Mid-Year Equity Outlook Portfolio, Series 86. This new unit trust's portfolio selection is led by Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's Senior Portfolio Manager and Chief Equity Strategist, and seeks to include a mid-year update in which Bob Doll reassesses his investment outlook as expressed in his 2015 Ten Predictions.

	Additionally, Incapital filed an initial registration statement with the SEC for the Nuveen Symphony Low Volatility Equity Portfolio, Series 88, which employs the investment expertise of Symphony Asset Management, an affiliate of Nuveen Investments. Recognized for their rigorous fundamental research and alternative investment/hedge fund expertise, Symphony applies a team-based approach to valuation and risk analysis, which seeks to identify and translate relative value into desired risk/reward portfolio outcomes. 

	Bill Adams, Nuveen Investments' Senior Executive Vice President and Head of Global Structured Products added, "We are very pleased to expand our relationship with Incapital as we work to bring innovative investment options to investors. We believe unit trusts can expand the ability of investors and their advisors to access the specialized investment expertise of our affiliates across a broad range of asset classes to help them better achieve their financial objectives." 

JOINT-DISTRIBUTION EFFORT

	Incapital has recently appointed Hugh McHaffie as Managing Director who will soon oversee the origination and distribution of a range of wealth management solutions, including Unit Trust, Market Linked and Annuity offerings. McHaffie is supported by a veteran Unit Trust origination team in Chicago, headed by John Browning, Managing Director and Randy Watts, Executive Director. Pat Dwyer, National Sales Manager, will soon lead Incapital's nation-wide distribution network supporting financial advisors seeking wealth management investment solutions for their clients.

	Given the performance of the current unit trust offerings, strong interest from the market, and robust pipeline of new offerings currently under consideration, Nuveen Investments is also enhancing its unit trust distribution efforts with the appointment of Melissa Roe as Managing Director, National Head of Unit Trust Sales. Overseeing a team of external and internal unit trust specialists, Roe will act as a liaison between Nuveen Investments and Incapital to represent the capabilities of Nuveen Investments' affiliates and ensure that the needs of financial advisors and their investor clients are being served.

Nuveen, Incapital team up to offer new equity unit trust
Strategist Bob Doll lends investment expertise to offering expected in early 2014






Nov 25, 2013 @ 1:53 pm
By 
	Trevor Hunnicutt























+ Zoom




      Two Chicago investment firms are linking together in a partnership aimed at helping both expand – starting with unit investment trusts.Fund manager Nuveen Asset Management and investment bank Incapital announced Monday a new stock-based unit investment trust developed with famous stock picker Robert C. Doll. The unit trust, which will debut in early 2014, is the first in a series of offerings to come from the partnership, Incapital's chief executive said on Monday.Unit investment trusts are a twist on the traditional mutual fund. Shareholders own a pool of investments that the portfolio manager buys and holds until a termination date, when the trust is dissolved and the proceeds are paid out. The underlying securities are not actively traded.
				



Unit trusts have been regaining popularity. There was nearly $72 billion in 5,787 unit trusts in 2012, up from about $60 billion in 2011, according to the Investment Company Institute. That is the highest asset level the product has seen, in absolute terms, since 2000. Stock-based trusts draw the lion's share, or 92%, of new deposits.In an interview, Incapital chief executive John Radtke said the unit trusts would be the first in a series of offerings by the partnership, which will take advantage of Nuveen's investment management expertise and Incapital's distribution network, as well as their trading and reporting website for issuers and broker-dealers.“There's more opportunities to grow this pie in the future,” Mr. Radtke said. “Our customer base was looking to move away from fixed income to alternative asset classes including equities.”Mr. Doll's career in the asset management industry has spanned more than three decades. The equity strategist retired from BlackRock Inc. last year after it was revealed that his proprietary quantitative methods actually were third-party models that he had tweaked and customized. Months later, he emerged in a new role at Nuveen. Nuveen, which historically has focused on local government debt, has been working to develop its offerings across asset classes since some of its bond offerings became unredeemable when credit markets seized up in 2008. The firm, which merged with U.S. Bancorp's long-term asset business after a 2010 acquisition, managed $118 billion in assets as of Sept. 30.Incapital is a boutique investment bank that specializes in bonds and complex debt products like structured notes — a hybrid derivative that might, for instance, combine the characteristics of a bond with those of an option to alter the risk-and-return profile of the investment.The chairman of Incapital is Thomas S. Ricketts, the son of TD Ameritrade Inc. founder J. Joseph Ricketts. The family purchased the Chicago Cubs baseball franchise in 2009.

Nuveen Large Cap Dividend Portfolio



Strategy


Overview


Historical Pricing


Performance


Portfolio Holdings


Distributions





Investment Objective

        The Nuveen Large Cap Dividend Portfolio is a unit trust that seeks to provide total return from capital appreciation and dividend income. There is no guarantee that the objective will be met.

Investment Strategy

	The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by purchasing large capitalization stocks that Nuveen Asset Management believes offer attractive dividend growth potential.


	Portfolio Security Selection

	Portfolio construction is led by Bob Doll, CFA, of Nuveen Asset Management. Bob Doll leverages Nuveen Asset Management’s proprietary equity investment process that combines quantitative techniques as well as fundamental research to recommend stocks for the Trust.


Universe – Russell 1000® Index, composed of approximately 1000 large cap stocks.

Quantitative Analysis – Among dividend-paying stocks within the Russell 1000® Index, a multi-factor quantitative model evaluates each stock’s valuation, growth history, profitability, balance sheet strength and capital deployment to narrow the opportunity set.

Fundamental Ranking Process – The remaining stocks are ranked on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 1 being most attractive and 5 being least attractive) using fundamental research and analysis. Stocks rated 5 are excluded from portfolio consideration.

Portfolio Construction – From the remaining pool, Bob Doll recommends a portfolio that he believes is positioned for attractive total return, dividend growth potential and strong cash flow over the 15 month investment horizon of the trust. Risk/return frameworks are systematically utilized to limit perceived risks.

Portfolio – 25 approximately equally weighted large cap stocks across diverse sectors.

                    1.450%
                


Creation and Dev. Fee
                

                    0.500%
                



The table above shows the initial offering period sales charges. Percentages are based on a $10.00 per unit offering price. For unit prices other than $10.00, percentages of initial sales charge, creation and development fee, and deferred sales charge will vary. The maximum sales charge is comprised of the initial sales charge, creation and development fee and deferred sales charge. The Trust is also subject to annual operating expenses and organization costs, which are not included in the sales charges. The creation and development fee is a charge of $0.05 per unit collected at the end of the initial offering period. If the price you pay exceeds $10.00 per unit, the creation and development fee will be less than 0.50%; if the price you pay is less than $10.00 per unit, the creation and development fee will exceed 0.50%. Investors will not be assessed the initial and deferred sales charge for eligible fee-based accounts and must purchase units utilizing a Fee CUSIP. Please see the prospectus for sales charge details.



Risk Considerations
	Investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. This Trust is unmanaged and there is no guarantee that the Trust’s investment objectives will be achieved. There is no assurance that common stocks will make dividend payments. Dividends are paid only if declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This Trust is concentrated in the consumer products sector. Some of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sector include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, economic recession, currency fluctuations, changing consumer tastes, extensive competition, product liability litigation and increased government regulation. These and other risk considerations, such as various business, market, and investment risks are described in detail in the Trust’s prospectus. 
	 
	Although this Trust’s life is approximately 15 months, the Trust’s strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider, in light of their particular financial situations, whether it may be appropriate to invest in successive trust portfolios, if available, subject to the applicable sales charges. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account. Investors should consult their tax advisor.

	NOT FDIC INSURED - NOT BANK GUARANTEED - MAY LOSE VALUE

LIQ is the Liquidation Price.  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units.  This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation & development fee.  This price reflects any remaining non-contingent deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. 
This page contains historical pricing or historical distributions information for the unit investment trust listed above. It should not be used for federal or state tax purposes, please contact your financial advisor for tax information.





Risk Considerations
	Investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. This Trust is unmanaged and there is no guarantee that the Trust’s investment objectives will be achieved. There is no assurance that common stocks will make dividend payments. Dividends are paid only if declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This Trust is concentrated in the consumer products sector. Some of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sector include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, economic recession, currency fluctuations, changing consumer tastes, extensive competition, product liability litigation and increased government regulation. These and other risk considerations, such as various business, market, and investment risks are described in detail in the Trust’s prospectus. 
	 
	Although this Trust’s life is approximately 15 months, the Trust’s strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider, in light of their particular financial situations, whether it may be appropriate to invest in successive trust portfolios, if available, subject to the applicable sales charges. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account. Investors should consult their tax advisor.

Returns With Transactional Sales Charge reflect the maximum transactional sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The transactional sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than the creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.

Returns Without Transactional Sales Charge do not reflect any transactional sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual returns.  Distribution Received in Cash returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume income and principal distributions are paid out in cash on the payable date.  Distributions Reinvested returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume income and principal distributions are reinvested on the reinvestment date.

Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost.

All returns are historical and do not represent potential future performance.  A trust’s performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision.

Data used for the Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics is from Bloomberg Finance L.P. Portfolio holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities. Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics are as of deposit day and are subject to change and may vary thereafter.
The style and capitalization characteristics are designed to help investors understand how they fit into an overall investment plan. Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth Investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles. Market capitalization is determined by the following criteria: Large Cap: Greater than $10 billion, Mid Cap: $2 billion-$10 billion, Small Cap: $250 million-$2 billion Micro Cap: Below $250 million.



Risk Considerations
	Investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. This Trust is unmanaged and there is no guarantee that the Trust’s investment objectives will be achieved. There is no assurance that common stocks will make dividend payments. Dividends are paid only if declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This Trust is concentrated in the consumer products sector. Some of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sector include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, economic recession, currency fluctuations, changing consumer tastes, extensive competition, product liability litigation and increased government regulation. These and other risk considerations, such as various business, market, and investment risks are described in detail in the Trust’s prospectus. 
	 
	Although this Trust’s life is approximately 15 months, the Trust’s strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider, in light of their particular financial situations, whether it may be appropriate to invest in successive trust portfolios, if available, subject to the applicable sales charges. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account. Investors should consult their tax advisor.

	NOT FDIC INSURED - NOT BANK GUARANTEED - MAY LOSE VALUE

Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Trust. The prospectus contains these factors and other information about the Trust. To obtain a prospectus, please request one from your financial advisor or download one from sec.gov/edgar.shtml. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

Income distributions will vary with changes in dividends or interest received on the underlying securities and with changes in the trust's fees and expenses. Principal distributions will be made only when the trust receives principal cash and will therefore vary. Both income and principal distributions may be affected by the sale of securities in the portfolio. See the prospectus for a more detailed description of the factors which could affect income and principal distributions.

	Investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. This Trust is unmanaged and there is no guarantee that the Trust’s investment objectives will be achieved. There is no assurance that common stocks will make dividend payments. Dividends are paid only if declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This Trust is concentrated in the consumer products sector. Some of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sector include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, economic recession, currency fluctuations, changing consumer tastes, extensive competition, product liability litigation and increased government regulation. These and other risk considerations, such as various business, market, and investment risks are described in detail in the Trust’s prospectus. 
	 
	Although this Trust’s life is approximately 15 months, the Trust’s strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider, in light of their particular financial situations, whether it may be appropriate to invest in successive trust portfolios, if available, subject to the applicable sales charges. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account.

Featuring the
            investment expertise of  






An Equity Unit Trust Designed to Offer:

A portfolio of U.S. stocks selected for their combined dividend growth and total return potential
A large cap focus that may dampen volatility
Potential for current income from dividend-paying stocks



The Case for Dividend Growers
Beyond their potential to provide attractive income, dividend growers and initiators—companies that have raised their dividends or initiated a new dividend—have historically realized higher returns with less risk than non-dividend payers and companies that have maintained their dividends over time.

The chart illustrates the average annualized historical performance of S&P 500® stocks, grouped as shown according to their dividend policies. The performance of each group is based on the equal-weighted geometric average of dividend-paying and non-dividend paying historical S&P 500® stocks, rebalanced annually. The performance shown represents the risk-return characteristics of each of the categories. Each stock’s dividend policy is determined on a rolling 12-month basis. For example, a stock is classified as dividend paying if it paid a cash dividend at any time during the previous 12 months. Dividend growers and initiators include stocks that raised their existing dividend or initiated a new dividend during the preceding 12 months. Past performance does not guarantee future results. There is no assurance that any asset class or index will provide positive performance over time. Different benchmarks, economic periods,
methodologies and market conditions will produce different results. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.


Why a Large Cap Dividend Growth Strategy Now?
Nuveen Asset Management believes:

Dividend growth stocks present select opportunities
Large cap companies with relatively low payout ratios and strong cash flows are well positioned to outperform
Dividend growers may prove more defensive in rising rate environments



Portfolio Security Selection
Bob Doll, CFA, Senior Portfolio Manager and Chief Equity Strategist, Nuveen Asset Management, uses a time-tested proprietary equity investment process that combines quantitative techniques with fundamental research to recommend stocks for the Trust. 


The opinions expressed by Bob Doll of Nuveen Asset Management, LLC are for informational purposes only as of the date of writing and may change at any time based on market or other conditions and may not come to pass.

1. LIQ is the Liquidation Price.  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units.  This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation & development fee.  This price reflects any remaining non-contingent deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
2. There is no guarantee that any distributions will be made.  The estimated net annual income is per unit as of deposit day and based on the most recently declared dividends, distributions or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes of the portfolio’s holdings.  The actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the estimate with changes in the portfolio’s fees and expenses, income received, currency fluctuations, and with the call, redemption, maturity, or sale of securities. 
3. The historical annual dividend distribution was calculated as of the day of deposit based on the trailing 12-month dividends or distributions paid by each issuer of securities in the trust portfolio and is net of the deferred sales charge and operating expenses charged by the trust. The trailing 12-month dividend for each issuer includes net dividend amounts for all fixed schedule dividends that have been declared over the past 12 months, excluding special distributions like special cash and return of capital, taxes, any related dividend fees and tax related credits. The amount of distributions you receive will vary from the above-stated amount due to changes in the dividends or distributions paid by issuers, changes in the trust's fees and expenses, income received, currency fluctuations, and with the call, redemption, maturity or sale of portfolio securities. Fees and expenses of the trust may vary as a result of the trust's size, redemption activity, brokerage and other transaction costs and extraordinary expenses among other factors.

Data used for the Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics is from Bloomberg Finance L.P. Portfolio holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities. Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics are as of deposit day and are subject to change and may vary thereafter.
The style and capitalization characteristics are designed to help investors understand how they fit into an overall investment plan. Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth Investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles. Market capitalization is determined by the following criteria: Large Cap: Greater than $10 billion, Mid Cap: $2 billion-$10 billion, Small Cap: $250 million-$2 billion Micro Cap: Below $250 million.


This material is not intended to be a recommendation or investment advice, does not constitute a solicitation to buy or sell securities, and is not provided in a fiduciary capacity. The information provided does not take into account the specific objectives or circumstances of any particular investor, or suggest any specific course of action. Investment decisions should be made based on an investor’s objectives and circumstances and in consultation with his or her advisors.


Risk Considerations
				There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust. This trust terminates approximately 2 years from the initial date of deposit.

				Investing in the trust units may involve a high degree of risk and is highly speculative and aggressive, and therefore an investment in trust units may not be suitable for someone with low risk tolerance.

				Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.

				A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This trust is concentrated in the financials sector, particularly in business development companies ("BDCs") and real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). There are certain risks specific to the financials sector, and in particular, BDCs and REITs, including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.
				 
				This trust is concentrated in the financials sector, particularly in business development companies ("BDCs") and real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). There are certain risks specific to the financials sector, and in particular, BDCs and REITs, including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.

				This trust invests in BDCs and will be subject to risks associated with BDCs. BDCs are closed-end funds that have elected to be treated as business development companies and their ability to grow their overall financial condition is impacted significantly by their ability to raise capital, engage in borrowing, acquire suitable investments, and maintain their status as a BDC. Failure to do so will adversely affect the value of a BDC’s shares. BDCs generally employ leverage in their portfolios. While leverage often increases the yield of a portfolio, it may magnify the potential for gains and losses on amounts invested, and accordingly, may increase the volatility and/or risks associated with those shares. A BDC’s investments are frequently not publicly traded, and as a result, there is uncertainty as to the value and liquidity of those investments. BDCs are subject to laws or regulations governing BDCs that could negatively affect the value of the BDC shares. Shares of BDCs frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value in the secondary market and the net asset value of a BDC’s shares may decrease.

				This trust invests in REITs and real estate companies. Many factors can have an impact on the performance of REITs and real estate companies, including cash available for distribution, the credit quality of a particular REIT, or the real estate industry in general. Risks associated with ownership of real estate include global and local economic conditions, decline in real estate values, changes in interest rates, and the strength or weakness of the real estate market.

				You will bear not only your share of the trust’s expenses, but also those of the underlying BDCs and REITs, which frequently have high expenses including but not limited to management fees and operational expenses. By investing in BDCs and REITs through the trust, investors incur greater expenses than they would incur if they invested directly in the BDCs and REITs.

				BDCs and REITs may invest in foreign securities which involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

				BDCs may invest in securities of small and mid-cap companies. Securities of small and mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

				BDCs and REITs may invest in fixed income securities. Fixed income securities are subject to various risks, including interest rate, credit, call, and quality risk. In general, the value of the fixed income securities will fall if interest rates rise. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. A security issuer may be unable to make interest and/or principal payments in the future. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.

				BDCs may invest in high yield debt securities. High yield debt securities are generally below investment grade quality (“non-investment grade” debt). Investing in such debt should be viewed as speculative and you should review your ability to assume the risks associated with investments which utilize such debt. Non-investment grade debt is subject to numerous risks including higher interest rates, economic recession, deterioration of the non-investment grade debt markets, possible downgrades and payment defaults of interest and/or principal. Non-investment grade debt prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated debt and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater degree.

				BDCs and REITs operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, and REITs and BDCs must raise additional capital to grow because they distribute most of their income.

Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee dividend payments from securities held in the trust, if any, will increase or that dividend yield on securities in the trust will be greater than the yield of any index mentioned herein.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This trust is concentrated in the financial sector. There are certain risks specific to the financials sector including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.

This trust is concentrated in the real estate industry. Many factors and risks have an impact on the performance of real estate investments and securities, including interest rates, credit quality, global and local economic conditions, land development, competition for tenants, declining occupancy rates, tenant defaults, the mortgage and lending markets, oversupply or reduced demand for space where the properties are located, changes in tax and zoning laws as well as increases in operating, insurance, maintenance and improvement costs. Many costs associated with owning and operating real estate are fi xed even when revenues from the properties are declining. Additionally, real estate development activities are subject to various risks, including excess construction costs, unfavorable fi nancing terms, construction delays, changing market conditions and other challenges.

This trust invests in REITs. REITs are real estate investments that own and/or operate income-producing real estate properties and real estate-related assets. The success or failure of a REIT depends in part on the success or failure of its underlying real estate holdings. REIT shares do not assure dividend payments. Any images contained within this material are not intended to, and do not, represent any actual real estate investment of this unit trust or any underlying holding of any REIT within this portfolio.

This trust invests in Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”). Most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources, or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to those sectors, including commodity price risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs are also subject to the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the tax treatment of MLPs for federal income tax purposes, which could have a negative impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs.

Stocks of small companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax deferred accounts. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

Investment Objective

        The Nuveen Core Real Estate Securities Portfolio is a unit trust that seeks to provide current income and capital appreciation. There is no assurance that this objective will be met.

Investment Strategy
The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by purchasing a portfolio of real estate securities that has the potential for attractive total return, reduced volatility relative to its benchmark (the MSCI U.S. REIT Index or “Benchmark”), and consistent cash flow.
Security Selection from an Experienced Team
Nuveen Asset Management serves as the Trust’s portfolio consultant. The team
responsible for designing the portfolio has a proven track record managing real estate focused mutual funds, including
the Nuveen Real Estate Securities Fund, as well as closed-end funds and
separately managed accounts.
A Bottom-Up, Relative Value ApproachNuveen Asset Management conducts extensive research and analysis to design a largely sector-neutral portfolio diversified across multiple real estate sectors.
Broad Universe of 200+ Real Estate Securities - Investible universe of REITs, real estate operating companies, and development and service companies is broader than that of the Benchmark, enhancing the opportunity to identify securities with the potential to perform throughout the real estate cycle. 
Relative Value Analysis - Evaluation of the market's supply outlook, occupancy levels, capital availability, cash flow potential, geographical location and management experience narrows the opportunity set to companies the team believes offer the greatest potential for outperformance.
Additional Screening Metrics - Assessment of business fundamentals; valuation of property types relative to peers, the market and historical measures; and positive catalysts. Evaluation of risk/return potential of remaining securities to arrive at final portfolio recommendations.
Core Portfolio -  Real estate securities the team believes offer the best valuation opportunities across property types, with sector allocations that align closely with those of the Benchmark.

The creation and development fee is a charge of $0.05 per unit collected at the end of the initial offering period. If the price you pay exceeds $10.00 per unit, the creation and development fee will be less than 0.50%; if the price you pay is less than $10.00 per unit, the creation and development fee will exceed 0.50%.

Please see the prospectus for sales charge details.


Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee dividend payments from securities held in the trust, if any, will increase or that dividend yield on securities in the trust will be greater than the yield of any index mentioned herein.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This trust is concentrated in the financial sector. There are certain risks specific to the financials sector including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.

This trust is concentrated in the real estate industry. Many factors and risks have an impact on the performance of real estate investments and securities, including interest rates, credit quality, global and local economic conditions, land development, competition for tenants, declining occupancy rates, tenant defaults, the mortgage and lending markets, oversupply or reduced demand for space where the properties are located, changes in tax and zoning laws as well as increases in operating, insurance, maintenance and improvement costs. Many costs associated with owning and operating real estate are fi xed even when revenues from the properties are declining. Additionally, real estate development activities are subject to various risks, including excess construction costs, unfavorable fi nancing terms, construction delays, changing market conditions and other challenges.

This trust invests in REITs. REITs are real estate investments that own and/or operate income-producing real estate properties and real estate-related assets. The success or failure of a REIT depends in part on the success or failure of its underlying real estate holdings. REIT shares do not assure dividend payments. Any images contained within this material are not intended to, and do not, represent any actual real estate investment of this unit trust or any underlying holding of any REIT within this portfolio.

This trust invests in Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”). Most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources, or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to those sectors, including commodity price risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs are also subject to the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the tax treatment of MLPs for federal income tax purposes, which could have a negative impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs.

Stocks of small companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax deferred accounts. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

LIQ is the Liquidation Price.  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units.  This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation & development fee.  This price reflects any remaining non-contingent deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. 
This page contains historical pricing or historical distributions information for the unit investment trust listed above. It should not be used for federal or state tax purposes, please contact your financial advisor for tax information.




Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee dividend payments from securities held in the trust, if any, will increase or that dividend yield on securities in the trust will be greater than the yield of any index mentioned herein.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This trust is concentrated in the financial sector. There are certain risks specific to the financials sector including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.

This trust is concentrated in the real estate industry. Many factors and risks have an impact on the performance of real estate investments and securities, including interest rates, credit quality, global and local economic conditions, land development, competition for tenants, declining occupancy rates, tenant defaults, the mortgage and lending markets, oversupply or reduced demand for space where the properties are located, changes in tax and zoning laws as well as increases in operating, insurance, maintenance and improvement costs. Many costs associated with owning and operating real estate are fi xed even when revenues from the properties are declining. Additionally, real estate development activities are subject to various risks, including excess construction costs, unfavorable fi nancing terms, construction delays, changing market conditions and other challenges.

This trust invests in REITs. REITs are real estate investments that own and/or operate income-producing real estate properties and real estate-related assets. The success or failure of a REIT depends in part on the success or failure of its underlying real estate holdings. REIT shares do not assure dividend payments. Any images contained within this material are not intended to, and do not, represent any actual real estate investment of this unit trust or any underlying holding of any REIT within this portfolio.

This trust invests in Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”). Most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources, or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to those sectors, including commodity price risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs are also subject to the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the tax treatment of MLPs for federal income tax purposes, which could have a negative impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs.

Stocks of small companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax deferred accounts. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

Returns With Transactional Sales Charge reflect the maximum transactional sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The transactional sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than the creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.

Returns Without Transactional Sales Charge do not reflect any transactional sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual returns.  Distribution Received in Cash returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume income and principal distributions are paid out in cash on the payable date.  Distributions Reinvested returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume income and principal distributions are reinvested on the reinvestment date.

Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost.

All returns are historical and do not represent potential future performance.  A trust’s performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision.

Data used for the Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics is from Bloomberg Finance L.P. Portfolio holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities. Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics are as of deposit day and are subject to change and may vary thereafter.
The style and capitalization characteristics are designed to help investors understand how they fit into an overall investment plan. Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth Investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles. Market capitalization is determined by the following criteria: Large Cap: Greater than $10 billion, Mid Cap: $2 billion-$10 billion, Small Cap: $250 million-$2 billion Micro Cap: Below $250 million.


Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee dividend payments from securities held in the trust, if any, will increase or that dividend yield on securities in the trust will be greater than the yield of any index mentioned herein.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This trust is concentrated in the financial sector. There are certain risks specific to the financials sector including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.

This trust is concentrated in the real estate industry. Many factors and risks have an impact on the performance of real estate investments and securities, including interest rates, credit quality, global and local economic conditions, land development, competition for tenants, declining occupancy rates, tenant defaults, the mortgage and lending markets, oversupply or reduced demand for space where the properties are located, changes in tax and zoning laws as well as increases in operating, insurance, maintenance and improvement costs. Many costs associated with owning and operating real estate are fi xed even when revenues from the properties are declining. Additionally, real estate development activities are subject to various risks, including excess construction costs, unfavorable fi nancing terms, construction delays, changing market conditions and other challenges.

This trust invests in REITs. REITs are real estate investments that own and/or operate income-producing real estate properties and real estate-related assets. The success or failure of a REIT depends in part on the success or failure of its underlying real estate holdings. REIT shares do not assure dividend payments. Any images contained within this material are not intended to, and do not, represent any actual real estate investment of this unit trust or any underlying holding of any REIT within this portfolio.

This trust invests in Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”). Most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources, or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to those sectors, including commodity price risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs are also subject to the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the tax treatment of MLPs for federal income tax purposes, which could have a negative impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs.

Stocks of small companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax deferred accounts. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

Income distributions will vary with changes in dividends or interest received on the underlying securities and with changes in the trust's fees and expenses. Principal distributions will be made only when the trust receives principal cash and will therefore vary. Both income and principal distributions may be affected by the sale of securities in the portfolio. See the prospectus for a more detailed description of the factors which could affect income and principal distributions.

Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee dividend payments from securities held in the trust, if any, will increase or that dividend yield on securities in the trust will be greater than the yield of any index mentioned herein.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This trust is concentrated in the financial sector. There are certain risks specific to the financials sector including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.

This trust is concentrated in the real estate industry. Many factors and risks have an impact on the performance of real estate investments and securities, including interest rates, credit quality, global and local economic conditions, land development, competition for tenants, declining occupancy rates, tenant defaults, the mortgage and lending markets, oversupply or reduced demand for space where the properties are located, changes in tax and zoning laws as well as increases in operating, insurance, maintenance and improvement costs. Many costs associated with owning and operating real estate are fi xed even when revenues from the properties are declining. Additionally, real estate development activities are subject to various risks, including excess construction costs, unfavorable fi nancing terms, construction delays, changing market conditions and other challenges.

This trust invests in REITs. REITs are real estate investments that own and/or operate income-producing real estate properties and real estate-related assets. The success or failure of a REIT depends in part on the success or failure of its underlying real estate holdings. REIT shares do not assure dividend payments. Any images contained within this material are not intended to, and do not, represent any actual real estate investment of this unit trust or any underlying holding of any REIT within this portfolio.

This trust invests in Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”). Most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources, or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to those sectors, including commodity price risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs are also subject to the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the tax treatment of MLPs for federal income tax purposes, which could have a negative impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs.

Stocks of small companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax deferred accounts. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

NOT FDIC INSURED - NOT BANK GUARANTEED - MAY LOSE VALUE

Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the unit investment trust carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about this unit investment trust. To obtain a prospectus, please download a prospectus from sec.gov/edgar.shtml or the Unit Trust Offerings page. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

Incapital Unit Trust, Series 55, is a unit investment trust that consists of the Nuveen Core Real Estate Securities Portfolio, 3Q 2014. Incapital LLC serves as the Sponsor to the Trust.

Nuveen Asset Management, LLC is a registered investment advisor and wholly owned subsidiary of Nuveen Investments, Inc. The Nuveen name and logo are registered marks of Nuveen Investments, Inc.

1. LIQ is the Liquidation Price.  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units.  This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation & development fee.  This price reflects any remaining non-contingent deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
2. There is no guarantee that any distributions will be made.  The estimated net annual income is per unit as of deposit day and based on the most recently declared dividends, distributions or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes of the portfolio’s holdings.  The actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the estimate with changes in the portfolio’s fees and expenses, income received, currency fluctuations, and with the call, redemption, maturity, or sale of securities. 
3. The historical annual dividend distribution was calculated as of the day of deposit based on the trailing 12-month dividends or distributions paid by each issuer of securities in the trust portfolio and is net of the deferred sales charge and operating expenses charged by the trust. The trailing 12-month dividend for each issuer includes net dividend amounts for all fixed schedule dividends that have been declared over the past 12 months, excluding special distributions like special cash and return of capital, taxes, any related dividend fees and tax related credits. The amount of distributions you receive will vary from the above-stated amount due to changes in the dividends or distributions paid by issuers, changes in the trust's fees and expenses, income received, currency fluctuations, and with the call, redemption, maturity or sale of portfolio securities. Fees and expenses of the trust may vary as a result of the trust's size, redemption activity, brokerage and other transaction costs and extraordinary expenses among other factors.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.
