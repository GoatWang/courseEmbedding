FirstView


  In 2009, First  Alarm launched FIRSTVIEW. Our real-time  video services are now bundled under the brand name FIRSTVIEW which include:

  
    • Video Alarm Verification
    • Voice Interdiction
    • Video Escort of Employees
    • Video Patrol Tours
    • Behavior Recognition (Loitering, Vandalism,  Illegal Dumping, etc. )
    • Wireless Trespass System with Video  Verification
    • Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring of  Employees

During a security event (break-in, suspicious  activity, etc.) the FIRSTVIEW system streams video from the protected premises  to our Central Station where a security dispatcher views the video information  and takes the appropriate action which may include dispatching law enforcement  or security. The dispatch may also contact the suspect using FIRSTVIEW’s  voice-link system. 


This video is an apprehension of two men breaking into a construction trailer to steal the office equipment.


This thief broke into the shelter at the bottom of a cell tower to steal copper. The damage caused was thousands of dollars for a couple hundred dollars of copper. Police were dispatched and the thief was apprehended.
Most video surveillance systems can be  equipped with FIRSTVIEW services. 
Contact us today to learn how FIRSTVIEW can  enhance your video surveillance system!

Let Us Count the Ways: The Tech We Really LoveHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearch0Valentine's DayLet Us Count the Ways: The Tech We Really LoveYahoo Tech StaffFebruary 10, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareAt its core, technology is ruled by cold, hard logic. But our relationship to it doesn’t have to be.We’ll bet that at some point in your life, perhaps even now, there was a piece of hardware, an app, or an online service that made you smile with delight, that felt like a trusted, loyal companion. In short, you might have felt something like affection for a little bundle of bits and bytes.Well, we here at Yahoo Tech aren’t afraid to let our feelings show. We aren’t ashamed to admit that there is some technology we love (just as there’s some we loathe with a cold, dark passion). We aren’t saying these are the best tech products in the world. Just that these are the ones we wouldn’t want to live without, the ones that have become parts of our lives, the ones we really, really like like.Amazon EchoI’m working at home when my friend Kirk calls. “Hey, what’s up?” I ask. “Actually,” he says sheepishly, “I called to talk to Alexa.” Alexa is the name of the bot inside the Amazon Echo. Since I installed her in my kitchen, she has made lots of friends; my teenagers talk to her in the middle of the night. She also settles trivia questions during dinner parties, keeps track of our shopping lists, plays that song we want to hear right now, and reads us poetry. She tells us the traffic, the next train time, the weather, how many ounces are in a quart, and who invented the zipper. She is smart, charming, and self-deprecating.So I understood Kirk’s call. I held up the phone so he could talk to her. “Alexa,” he asked. “Tell me a joke.” And she did — a bad one, but still a joke. We laughed and told her it was terrible; Kirk admitted he would probably retell it at work. She replied, “If you thought that was bad, just wait until you hear the others.” — Christina Tynan-WoodBose QuietComfort 25Nobody has ever quite matched the noise-canceling prowess of Bose’s QuietComfort headphones. But ouch: $300 for a pair of headphones? For years I avoided buying them. The original model was too big and heavy, and the smaller QuietComfort 15s created a weird, uncomfortable dead-vacuum sensation in my ears. But when I reviewed last year’s new QuietComfort 25 headphones, I knew that my life as a frequent flier was about to change.They sound better than any previous model, they don’t do that nasty thing to my ears, and they fold up smaller into a more compact case. How much did I love them? So much that I bought a pair for myself. They say that noise-canceling headphones reduce stress and protect your hearing. (Because they subtract most of the loud, continuous roar around you, you can listen to music or movies at a lower volume.) Whatever. All I know is that the QuietComfort 25s make flying a lot more quiet and comfortable. — David PogueGoogle MapsThe odds of me leaving my home without a quick check of Google Maps are only slightly greater than the chances that I’ll step outside without my house keys or my shoes. Ever since Google’s navigation service debuted in 2005 as a rebuke (of sorts) to AOL’s decaying MapQuest, Maps has shown the way for both its users and competing mapping apps. (Six years after Google added bicycling navigation, for example, Bing Maps and Apple Maps have yet to offer any such help to cyclists.) Its traffic awareness has gotten so good that, if it tells me to exit the highway to avoid a slowdown, I just flip on the turn signal.Read MoreThat doesn’t mean Google’s work is done. For instance, around Washington, D.C., it remains ignorant of Capital Bikeshare and (thanks to holdups at a few local transit agencies) some bus routes. But I have a lot more confidence in Google’s continued progress than in Microsoft or Apple catching up. — Rob PegoraroMacBook ProSure, I’ve had plenty of laptops in my time. But they were always work machines provided by my employers, their settings and apps dictated, ultimately, by IT — they weren’t mine. Of course, I’ve had plenty of personal machines too. But they were always desktop computers that I had to share with the rest of the family. Then, a year and a half ago, as I exited a job, I was allowed to keep the laptop I’d been using — a nice little 13-inch MacBook Pro, with a sharp Retina display and plenty of RAM. Suddenly, for the first time, I had a machine that was truly mine.I wiped out every vestige of IT-installed cruft, reinstalled only those apps and utilities I knew I wanted, and configured it just so. We’ve been through a lot together since then: I’ve conducted an arduous job search with it, started work on that novel I always said I’d write, and took care of all kinds of little private projects that I’d never had the means to pursue before. It’s the most personal computer I’ve ever had. And while I’ve always scoffed at fanboyism, I have to admit I feel a certain fondness for this machine. Weird, I know. — Dan MillerMLB.tvFor my money, MLB.tv is the best digital subscription service on the planet — in the summer, anyway. During baseball’s regular season, you get every out-of-market game in high-definition, piped over the Internet to your TV, tablet or phone. The interactive elements — DVR controls, clickable line scores, picture-in-picture — improve every year, and you can choose home or away broadcast feeds. For many lonesome years, I was unable to watch my hometown team, the Detroit Tigers. Now I can catch their games whenever and wherever. Watching baseball on my tablet, wirelessly and in high def, as I move from room to room? It sure feels like love. — Glenn McDonaldPandoraApple Music? Meh. Spotify? Please. My heart belongs to Pandora. Why? Because, after some judicious fine tuning, it consistently plays tunes I love and introduces me to great artists I would never have otherwise heard. I don’t have to constantly figure out what to play next; Pandora takes care of that for me. I am happy to pay $60 a year to skip the commercials — and I’m a cheapskate.Of course, it’s not all buttercups and roses. Pandora maxes out at 100 stations, which means I have to keep deleting them as my daughter adds new ones. Some playlists are only about 30 songs long. And, of course, it’s no good if I really need to hear a specific song at a particular moment. (Right now, that’d be “Wall of Death” by Richard Thompson.) But no relationship is perfect. And more often than not, Pandora and I end up making beautiful music together. — Dan TynanPlayStation 4I wasn’t much of a gamer kid, really, so it’s surprising how much quality time I spend with the PlayStation 4 as an adult. Video games are the signature art form of our time, I think, and I spend a frankly embarrassing amount of time playing and thinking about them. The PS4’s souped-up hardware makes it the platform of choice for top-shelf commercial franchises and cerebral indie games alike. Plus, I run all my movies through the PS4 — on Blu-ray, via Netflix, or by digital download. I can get pretty passionate about games and films; the PS4 is my stalwart partner. — Glenn McDonaldRoku StickI’ve been with my Roku Stick for more than two years. And in that time it’s become one of my most cherished possessions. Not only do I use it every night to stream Futurama on Netflix, it also lets me watch Mets games through the available Time Warner Cable app without having to pay for an extra cable box. OK, so maybe the Roku Stick is a bit slow, and it doesn’t have a fancy remote with a headphone jack like the Roku 4. But it’s inexpensive and gets the job done, and sometimes that’s all I want. — Daniel HowleySeamlessWe all have that one app or online service we wouldn’t feel quite complete without. For me, that app/service is Seamless. If you’re lucky enough to live in one of its service areas (which number over 450 in the U.S., according to the site), the app is an easy way to order takeout or delivery from your smartphone, tablet, or computer without having to actually call anyone. Beyond making ordering easier, Seamless has opened my eyes to all kinds of incredible new restaurants in my area and, in the process, turned me on to all kinds of incredible new cuisines I otherwise would never have tried. Sure, I might spend more time using Facebook and Twitter. But Seamless is the app I can’t live without. — Daniel HowleySonos Wireless Music SystemMy relationship with Sonos has lasted longer than almost all my personal ones — and, frankly, it’s been a hell of a lot easier. I started with the Sonos ZonePlayer in 2007 or so; since then I’ve moved through through a series of ever-smaller, ever-less-expensive (but still great-sounding) wireless speakers. It’s one of those rare gadgets that really do just work: Press a couple of buttons, and it automatically connects to your home network and your phone. And Sonos keeps adding new music services: You can now listen to nearly 50 streaming music sources, from your iTunes library to Pandora, Spotify, Murfie, and thousands of Internet radio stations. A new Trueplay feature automatically adjusts the sound to match the acoustics in the room. What’s not to love? — Dan TynanSony RX100 CameraFor a tech writer, there’s almost nothing better than getting thank-you emails from readers who bought something you recommended. It’s reflected glory for free. That’s what happens whenever I write up the Sony RX100 camera. It may look like a typical pocket camera, but inside is a huge sensor: 1 inch diagonal, maybe three or four times as big as other pocket cameras’ sensors. A bigger sensor means better color, less grain in low light, and amazing dynamic range (from the darkest to lightest pixels). And thanks to this camera’s f/1.8 lens (the widest aperture available on a pocket camera), you can get some lovely, professional-looking blurred backgrounds. (Don’t take my word for it: Here are some sample shots.) The 2014 third-generation model, the Mark 3 (which you can get for $750), added a pop-up eyepiece viewfinder, so you don’t have to frame your shots with the screen; the newer Mark 4 ($950) adds a super-slo-mo feature you’ll likely rarely use. Either way, it’s like having professional gear in your pocket. For me, it was love at first shot. — David PogueTextExpanderTextExpander and I have been together a long time. I’ve been using the utility — which inserts a saved snippet of text whenever you hit a specific combination of keys — almost as long as I’ve been using a Mac as my primary computer, which is going on 12 years now. And, as in many long-term relationships, there are times when I take TextExpander for granted. But I shouldn’t. Because I use it many, many times a day, all day, every day. Filling out an online form? I can insert my name, address, phone number, and email address with a couple of quick keystrokes. Editing a story? I can add links, formatting, and boilerplate text just as fast. I’ve been doing all that for so long, I don’t even think about it; it’s literally muscle memory. But once in a while it’s good to take a step back and appreciate something that’s always there, ready to help. Really, TextExpander, I couldn’t compute without you. — Dan MillerUber/Car2GoThe Uber app and I have been in a serious relationship for years: many, many rides on demand, scooping me from whichever curb I’m standing within minutes. But recently our high-tech transportation commitment has turned complicated — unbeknownst to Uber.When Car2Go launched in Brooklyn, I couldn’t resist its charm. Cheaper and more fun, its on-demand car rental service has become a steady ride-on-the-side for me. Car2Go rentals are parked streetside throughout my neighborhood, just waiting to be reserved and accessed by the tap of a few buttons in its app for just 41 cents a minute. It’s hard to say no.Do I feel guilty about my running around on Uber? Sometimes. But in those moments, I just try to remember the rotten way Uber treats its “employees,” and my slinking seems justified. Of course I’ll never completely leave Uber. Car2Go is still too young and unreliable: I can’t always find a car in my area when I need one. But I can’t see this car-on-demand romance-juggling ending anytime soon. — Dan BeanVivintWhen I agreed to have a Vivint home-security and -automation system installed in my house, I thought it sounded sensible. But lovable? I wouldn’t have said so, but a couple of things changed my mind. First, my friend Karen called to say she was coming over with five pounds of bacon. Unfortunately, I wasn’t home; I was in a car two hours away. But instead of telling her to come by later, I told her to text me when she got there, and I’d open the garage for her. (No, I wasn’t driving; I know better than to try controlling my house from behind the wheel.) It worked like a charm: Karen arrived, I opened the garage, she deposited the bacon in my freezer, then went on her way; I locked up after her from the passenger seat.But that’s not all Vivint can do. I can see who’s ringing my doorbell and talk to him or her from wherever. If anyone leaves the house in the middle of the night, it’ll ping me — handy when you have teenagers. My daughter says she got home at 10:00 last night? I can check Vivint’s video log to confirm. I can turn the heat up or down, lock or unlock the doors, and arm the security system from bed — even if that bed is in a hotel in Sweden. Is love the same as need? I don’t know. But I do know I couldn’t live without my Vivint. — Christina Tynan-Wood#valentine's-day#featuredReblogShareTweetShareWhat to Read NextWhy Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are fightingYahoo TechShop July Specials at Macy's - Extra 25-60% OffMacys.comSponsoredWhy scientists want AI regulated now before it's too lateYahoo TechAmazon launches a social network for spending moneyYahoo TechHow Microsoft wants to bring broadband to rural AmericansYahoo TechDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredThe top 10 games of E3 2017Ben SilvermanAnother fitness-band company shuts down.

Let Us Count the Ways: The Tech We Really LoveHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearch0Valentine's DayLet Us Count the Ways: The Tech We Really LoveYahoo Tech StaffFebruary 10, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareAt its core, technology is ruled by cold, hard logic. But our relationship to it doesn’t have to be.We’ll bet that at some point in your life, perhaps even now, there was a piece of hardware, an app, or an online service that made you smile with delight, that felt like a trusted, loyal companion. In short, you might have felt something like affection for a little bundle of bits and bytes.Well, we here at Yahoo Tech aren’t afraid to let our feelings show. We aren’t ashamed to admit that there is some technology we love (just as there’s some we loathe with a cold, dark passion). We aren’t saying these are the best tech products in the world. Just that these are the ones we wouldn’t want to live without, the ones that have become parts of our lives, the ones we really, really like like.Amazon EchoI’m working at home when my friend Kirk calls. “Hey, what’s up?” I ask. “Actually,” he says sheepishly, “I called to talk to Alexa.” Alexa is the name of the bot inside the Amazon Echo. Since I installed her in my kitchen, she has made lots of friends; my teenagers talk to her in the middle of the night. She also settles trivia questions during dinner parties, keeps track of our shopping lists, plays that song we want to hear right now, and reads us poetry. She tells us the traffic, the next train time, the weather, how many ounces are in a quart, and who invented the zipper. She is smart, charming, and self-deprecating.So I understood Kirk’s call. I held up the phone so he could talk to her. “Alexa,” he asked. “Tell me a joke.” And she did — a bad one, but still a joke. We laughed and told her it was terrible; Kirk admitted he would probably retell it at work. She replied, “If you thought that was bad, just wait until you hear the others.” — Christina Tynan-WoodBose QuietComfort 25Nobody has ever quite matched the noise-canceling prowess of Bose’s QuietComfort headphones. But ouch: $300 for a pair of headphones? For years I avoided buying them. The original model was too big and heavy, and the smaller QuietComfort 15s created a weird, uncomfortable dead-vacuum sensation in my ears. But when I reviewed last year’s new QuietComfort 25 headphones, I knew that my life as a frequent flier was about to change.They sound better than any previous model, they don’t do that nasty thing to my ears, and they fold up smaller into a more compact case. How much did I love them? So much that I bought a pair for myself. They say that noise-canceling headphones reduce stress and protect your hearing. (Because they subtract most of the loud, continuous roar around you, you can listen to music or movies at a lower volume.) Whatever. All I know is that the QuietComfort 25s make flying a lot more quiet and comfortable. — David PogueGoogle MapsThe odds of me leaving my home without a quick check of Google Maps are only slightly greater than the chances that I’ll step outside without my house keys or my shoes. Ever since Google’s navigation service debuted in 2005 as a rebuke (of sorts) to AOL’s decaying MapQuest, Maps has shown the way for both its users and competing mapping apps. (Six years after Google added bicycling navigation, for example, Bing Maps and Apple Maps have yet to offer any such help to cyclists.) Its traffic awareness has gotten so good that, if it tells me to exit the highway to avoid a slowdown, I just flip on the turn signal.Read MoreThat doesn’t mean Google’s work is done. For instance, around Washington, D.C., it remains ignorant of Capital Bikeshare and (thanks to holdups at a few local transit agencies) some bus routes. But I have a lot more confidence in Google’s continued progress than in Microsoft or Apple catching up. — Rob PegoraroMacBook ProSure, I’ve had plenty of laptops in my time. But they were always work machines provided by my employers, their settings and apps dictated, ultimately, by IT — they weren’t mine. Of course, I’ve had plenty of personal machines too. But they were always desktop computers that I had to share with the rest of the family. Then, a year and a half ago, as I exited a job, I was allowed to keep the laptop I’d been using — a nice little 13-inch MacBook Pro, with a sharp Retina display and plenty of RAM. Suddenly, for the first time, I had a machine that was truly mine.I wiped out every vestige of IT-installed cruft, reinstalled only those apps and utilities I knew I wanted, and configured it just so. We’ve been through a lot together since then: I’ve conducted an arduous job search with it, started work on that novel I always said I’d write, and took care of all kinds of little private projects that I’d never had the means to pursue before. It’s the most personal computer I’ve ever had. And while I’ve always scoffed at fanboyism, I have to admit I feel a certain fondness for this machine. Weird, I know. — Dan MillerMLB.tvFor my money, MLB.tv is the best digital subscription service on the planet — in the summer, anyway. During baseball’s regular season, you get every out-of-market game in high-definition, piped over the Internet to your TV, tablet or phone. The interactive elements — DVR controls, clickable line scores, picture-in-picture — improve every year, and you can choose home or away broadcast feeds. For many lonesome years, I was unable to watch my hometown team, the Detroit Tigers. Now I can catch their games whenever and wherever. Watching baseball on my tablet, wirelessly and in high def, as I move from room to room? It sure feels like love. — Glenn McDonaldPandoraApple Music? Meh. Spotify? Please. My heart belongs to Pandora. Why? Because, after some judicious fine tuning, it consistently plays tunes I love and introduces me to great artists I would never have otherwise heard. I don’t have to constantly figure out what to play next; Pandora takes care of that for me. I am happy to pay $60 a year to skip the commercials — and I’m a cheapskate.Of course, it’s not all buttercups and roses. Pandora maxes out at 100 stations, which means I have to keep deleting them as my daughter adds new ones. Some playlists are only about 30 songs long. And, of course, it’s no good if I really need to hear a specific song at a particular moment. (Right now, that’d be “Wall of Death” by Richard Thompson.) But no relationship is perfect. And more often than not, Pandora and I end up making beautiful music together. — Dan TynanPlayStation 4I wasn’t much of a gamer kid, really, so it’s surprising how much quality time I spend with the PlayStation 4 as an adult. Video games are the signature art form of our time, I think, and I spend a frankly embarrassing amount of time playing and thinking about them. The PS4’s souped-up hardware makes it the platform of choice for top-shelf commercial franchises and cerebral indie games alike. Plus, I run all my movies through the PS4 — on Blu-ray, via Netflix, or by digital download. I can get pretty passionate about games and films; the PS4 is my stalwart partner. — Glenn McDonaldRoku StickI’ve been with my Roku Stick for more than two years. And in that time it’s become one of my most cherished possessions. Not only do I use it every night to stream Futurama on Netflix, it also lets me watch Mets games through the available Time Warner Cable app without having to pay for an extra cable box. OK, so maybe the Roku Stick is a bit slow, and it doesn’t have a fancy remote with a headphone jack like the Roku 4. But it’s inexpensive and gets the job done, and sometimes that’s all I want. — Daniel HowleySeamlessWe all have that one app or online service we wouldn’t feel quite complete without. For me, that app/service is Seamless. If you’re lucky enough to live in one of its service areas (which number over 450 in the U.S., according to the site), the app is an easy way to order takeout or delivery from your smartphone, tablet, or computer without having to actually call anyone. Beyond making ordering easier, Seamless has opened my eyes to all kinds of incredible new restaurants in my area and, in the process, turned me on to all kinds of incredible new cuisines I otherwise would never have tried. Sure, I might spend more time using Facebook and Twitter. But Seamless is the app I can’t live without. — Daniel HowleySonos Wireless Music SystemMy relationship with Sonos has lasted longer than almost all my personal ones — and, frankly, it’s been a hell of a lot easier. I started with the Sonos ZonePlayer in 2007 or so; since then I’ve moved through through a series of ever-smaller, ever-less-expensive (but still great-sounding) wireless speakers. It’s one of those rare gadgets that really do just work: Press a couple of buttons, and it automatically connects to your home network and your phone. And Sonos keeps adding new music services: You can now listen to nearly 50 streaming music sources, from your iTunes library to Pandora, Spotify, Murfie, and thousands of Internet radio stations. A new Trueplay feature automatically adjusts the sound to match the acoustics in the room. What’s not to love? — Dan TynanSony RX100 CameraFor a tech writer, there’s almost nothing better than getting thank-you emails from readers who bought something you recommended. It’s reflected glory for free. That’s what happens whenever I write up the Sony RX100 camera. It may look like a typical pocket camera, but inside is a huge sensor: 1 inch diagonal, maybe three or four times as big as other pocket cameras’ sensors. A bigger sensor means better color, less grain in low light, and amazing dynamic range (from the darkest to lightest pixels). And thanks to this camera’s f/1.8 lens (the widest aperture available on a pocket camera), you can get some lovely, professional-looking blurred backgrounds. (Don’t take my word for it: Here are some sample shots.) The 2014 third-generation model, the Mark 3 (which you can get for $750), added a pop-up eyepiece viewfinder, so you don’t have to frame your shots with the screen; the newer Mark 4 ($950) adds a super-slo-mo feature you’ll likely rarely use. Either way, it’s like having professional gear in your pocket. For me, it was love at first shot. — David PogueTextExpanderTextExpander and I have been together a long time. I’ve been using the utility — which inserts a saved snippet of text whenever you hit a specific combination of keys — almost as long as I’ve been using a Mac as my primary computer, which is going on 12 years now. And, as in many long-term relationships, there are times when I take TextExpander for granted. But I shouldn’t. Because I use it many, many times a day, all day, every day. Filling out an online form? I can insert my name, address, phone number, and email address with a couple of quick keystrokes. Editing a story? I can add links, formatting, and boilerplate text just as fast. I’ve been doing all that for so long, I don’t even think about it; it’s literally muscle memory. But once in a while it’s good to take a step back and appreciate something that’s always there, ready to help. Really, TextExpander, I couldn’t compute without you. — Dan MillerUber/Car2GoThe Uber app and I have been in a serious relationship for years: many, many rides on demand, scooping me from whichever curb I’m standing within minutes. But recently our high-tech transportation commitment has turned complicated — unbeknownst to Uber.When Car2Go launched in Brooklyn, I couldn’t resist its charm. Cheaper and more fun, its on-demand car rental service has become a steady ride-on-the-side for me. Car2Go rentals are parked streetside throughout my neighborhood, just waiting to be reserved and accessed by the tap of a few buttons in its app for just 41 cents a minute. It’s hard to say no.Do I feel guilty about my running around on Uber? Sometimes. But in those moments, I just try to remember the rotten way Uber treats its “employees,” and my slinking seems justified. Of course I’ll never completely leave Uber. Car2Go is still too young and unreliable: I can’t always find a car in my area when I need one. But I can’t see this car-on-demand romance-juggling ending anytime soon. — Dan BeanVivintWhen I agreed to have a Vivint home-security and -automation system installed in my house, I thought it sounded sensible. But lovable? I wouldn’t have said so, but a couple of things changed my mind. First, my friend Karen called to say she was coming over with five pounds of bacon.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

ROCHESTER, N.Y., May 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Document Security Systems, Inc. (NYSE MKT: DSS), (DSS), a leader in anti-counterfeiting and authentication solutions, reported results for the first quarter of 2016.
"During the first quarter of 2016, the Company took advantage of an increase in orders from several of our largest packaging group customers resulting in strong revenue and operating results.  We continue to see growth from our best customers, and highest margin product and service offerings. This is starting to translate into revenue strength even while reducing our cost base.  The momentum with which we ended 2015 has continued during the quarter," said Jeff Ronaldi, CEO of Document Security Systems. Mr. Ronaldi continued: "As 2016 progresses, we expect successes from new product initiatives will add to the strength of our business in the anti-counterfeiting and authentication marketplace.   As companies continue to fight the ever-increasing problem of counterfeiting, DSS' wide array of product offerings is well positioned to continue to widen our share of this expanding market opportunity."     
Q1 2016 Financial Highlights Revenue for the first quarter of 2016 increased 27% to $4.3 million from $3.4 million in the same year-ago quarter.  During the quarter, the Company had strong performance from its printed products groups, whose revenues which increased 32%, which was partially offset by a decline in technology sales, services and licensing revenue of 11%.  
Costs and expenses totaled $4.9 million, a decrease of 2% from $5.0 million in the same year-ago period. During the quarter, direct costs of goods sold increased in correlation with the increase in revenue.  Otherwise, nearly all other expense categories decreased as compared to the first quarter of 2015.  
Net loss during the quarter was approximately $624,000 ($0.01 per share), which was a 62% decrease in net loss of $1.6 million ($0.04 per share) in the first quarter of 2016. The significant decrease in net loss was the combined result of the Company's ability to increase revenues while decreasing non-direct costs during the quarter.  
Adjusted EBITDA loss, a non-GAAP metric defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, and asset impairments as well as other non-recurring items, was approximately $107,000 during the  quarter compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $869,000 in the first quarter of 2015 (see further discussion about the use of adjusted EBITDA, below). Once again, the significant improvement reflected both the increase in revenues and the decrease in costs in nearly every expense category.

About the Presentation of Adjusted EBITDAThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial performance measurement. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by the Company by adding back to net income (loss) interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, as further adjusted to add back stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring items, and impairments of investments and intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA is provided to investors to supplement the results of operations reported in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing its financial results with other companies in the industry, many of which also use Adjusted EBITDA in their communications to investors. By excluding non-cash charges such as amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and impairment charges, as well as non-operating charges for interest and income taxes, investors can evaluate the Company's operations and its ability to generate cash flows from operations and can compare its results on a more consistent basis to the results of other companies in the industry. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate potential acquisitions, establish internal budgets and goals, and evaluate performance of its business units and management. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance of its business and a useful measure of the Company's historical and prospective operating trends. However, there are significant limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA since it excludes interest income and expense and income taxes and non-recurring items, all of which impact the Company's profitability and operating cash flows, as well as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and stock-based compensation. The Company believes that these limitations are compensated by clearly identifying the difference between the two measures. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income and loss presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA as defined by the Company may not be comparable with similarly named measures provided by other entities. The following is a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA loss:
