Product DescriptionNew York Times bestselling memoirist Donald Miller takes readers on his yearlong journey to learn to abandon performance-based relationships and find real intimacy.When fling after fling led to lots of drama and a long series of heartaches, Donald Miller decided he’d had enough. There must be a better way to soothe loneliness without jumping on a roller coaster, to feel affirmation without putting on a show, to find true love. It wasn’t just about finding the right girl, though that helped. Once he found her, he had to know what to do—or who to be. A manipulative control freak? A successful workaholic? His usual methods had drawbacks. But the alternatives were not just hard to do; they were hard to imagine.From the author of Blue Like Jazz comes a story about finding the keys to a healthy relationship and discovering they are also the keys to a healthy family, a healthy career, and a healthy mind. And it all feels like a conversation with the best kind of friend: smart, funny, true, important.Scary Close is Donald Miller at his best.

Discover how the StoryBrand Process has helped businesses like yours quadruple in revenue

 


WHAT MAKES STORYBRAND SO DIFFERENT?
When it comes to talking about their businesses, many people are so close to their products or services they don’t know where to start. The StoryBrand Marketing Workshop helps companies understand what customers are looking for so they can tell their story in such a way people listen.Click to continue reading...
We know how hard it is to communicate clearly and have helped hundreds of large and small businesses clarify their messaging. And when you clarify your message, your website starts working for you, your team members are converted into a sales force and your customers speak a viral message that spreads.
The StoryBrand Workshop is taught by Donald Miller, creator of the SB7 framework. Don has studied story for decades and as such is versatile in a language human beings have been speaking for centuries. Combined, his 7 books have spent more than a year on the NYT Bestsellers list. He’s consulted with hundreds of companies to help them clarify their messaging. Don isn’t a professor in an ivory tower. The SB7 framework was created to help him filter the messaging for his own company and the process resulted in him doubling revenue and profits for three consecutive years. Since then he’s gone on to consult with dozens of billion-dollar brands and hundreds of small businesses. Hundreds of Don’s clients have dramatically increased their revenue after learning the SB7 framework.
In the 2-day StoryBrand Workshop, you will: 1. Learn a proven communication formula that has been used in thousands of major motion pictures. You will completely understand how story works and why it’s the most powerful tool to compel a human brain. 2. See how this formula has been used by the world’s top brands in commercials, print ads and web-based marketing and 3. Apply this framework to your company’s messaging including websites, email blasts, keynotes and even elevator pitches. StoryBrand will help you create compelling messaging that stands out.
The human brain is drawn to CLARITY and away from confusion. If customers are confused about what you offer, they’ll look past you for somebody who can say it clearly. Once you clarify your message, your company will begin to grow. Companies that clarify their messaging win in the marketplace. Register for the StoryBrand Workshop today and spend 2 days with Donald Miller. Why? Because nobody will know how much they need your product or service until you tell them in the right way.

“If you can clarify your message to the point where there’s that instant understanding and benefit that causes people to buy you’re never going to consider what the cost of this workshop was.”
BRIAN CLARK, CEO AND FOUNDER OF COPY BLOGGER







“Our business had grown fast and we needed a check-up on our branding strategy. The StoryBrand process was IMMENSELY helpful to our team. We anticipate even more success as we implement the powerful 7-part framework.”
JOHN MAXWELL, BESTSELLING AUTHOR AND LEADERSHIP EXPERT







“We’re going to take the story process StoryBrand taught us and run our entire company through it.”
VIKTORIA HARRISON, VP OF CREATIVE, CHARITY: WATER

































WHAT’S MY INVESTMENT?
How much is unclear messaging costing you? How many potential customers can’t hear your offer in the sea of noise? How many of your events are half empty because people don’t know why they should come? How many people are passing up your consulting? Can potential customers understand why they need your product or service? A lack of clarity may already be costing you a great deal.

Sunday

8:00PM – Welcome Reception
You’ll get to know your fellow participants over desserts and drinks. These are the like-minded leaders you’ll spend the next two days with. You’ll be inspired and encouraged by the brilliant friends who attend a StoryBrand workshop. At some point during the reception, Don will introduce the 7-part framework and set the stage for the two days ahead.


Monday

9:00AM — Session One:
How Learning to Tell a Great Story Will Grow Your Business
Don will break down a major Hollywood film showing you the tools screenwriters use to captivate an audience, and captivating an audience is exactly what your brand needs to do. The emphasis here is on clarity. If your brand can tell a better story than your competition, you’ll win in the marketplace. This 7-part framework will provide a filter for all your brand communication moving forward and it has been hiding under your nose all your life. Every time you watch a movie, from here on out, you’ll notice the tools screenwriters use to create clarity and to captivate an audience. You’ll use these tools to explain your ideas, products and services for the rest of your life. Telling a clear story will give you a distinct advantage.

10:30AM – Session Two:
How Successful Brands Use Story to Stay on Top
Successful brands are already using the StoryBrand framework. Whether they’re a small company, a billion-dollar brand or even a political candidate, the StoryBrand framework is the key to standing out against the competition. How did Domino’s Pizza mount their comeback? Why did Mitt Romney lose the election to Barack Obama? It will all become clear, and you’ll take furious notes about all the ways you can apply the framework to your brand.

12:00PM – Lunch
Grab lunch with a fellow participant and be inspired by the work they are doing and their passion for their business. Turns out you’re not alone in trying to grow your company. These are relationships you will likely keep for years to come.

1:30PM – Session Three:
Knowing Your Customer (With Work Groups)
Most brands position themselves as the hero in the story. But this never works. Your brand is the guide to the hero and we explain why. Every human being feels like they are the hero in the story, and successful brands affirm this identity in their customers and provide guidance so the hero can win the day. This paradigm shift alone will change the way you talk about your products and services forevermore.

3:00PM – Session Four:
What Does Your Customer Really Want? (With Work Groups)
Every customer wants something as it relates to your brand, but it’s not what you think. Businesses tend to sell solutions to external problems, but did you know customers tend to buy solutions to internal problems? In other words, customers are trying to resolve a frustration they’re feeling and you are going to be the brand that helps them resolve it. In this session, we will show you what customers are really looking for and once you start selling to that, you’ll start seeing an uptick in engagement and revenue.

5:00PM – Done for the Day
Grab fellow participants for a night on the town and continue building your new community of like-minded professionals.


Tuesday

9:00AM – Session Five:
Becoming the Guide
In a story and in successful brand strategies, companies position themselves as the guide. Communication expert Nancy Duarte points out that leaders should position themselves as Yoda to Luke Skywalker or Haymitch to Katniss. To position your company as a guide, you need to do 2 magical things. We’ll explain what they are and how to do them in this session. And when you execute this strategy, you’ll be amazed at how you suddenly become the “brand” customers have been looking for.

10:30AM – Session Six:
Offering a Plan
Too many companies rush into the room and try to sell their products. But remember, buying a product is a journey. And it can be a scary one, depending on what you’re selling and how expensive it is. When you offer 1 of the 3 kinds of plans we outline in this session, your customers will have much more confidence that you understand them and can help them resolve their problems. These plans have been working for successful companies for years and they will work for you, too.

12:00PM – Lunch

1:30PM – Session Seven:
Creating Your BrandScript
During session seven, we take all that you’ve learned, discussed, interacted with and brainstormed for the last 2 days and create a BrandScript for your brand. You will use this BrandScript in your e-mail blasts, on your website, in your advertising and even while talking to people at parties. Because your brand now has a clear story, people will understand you and word will start to spread.

3:00PM – Session Eight:
Implementing Your BrandScript (Extended Session)
In the final session, we critique your current marketing material. We actually put many of the Workshop attendees’ websites on an enormous television screen and talk about what needs to change. After all you’ve learned over the last few days, you’ll even be able to critique them yourself. What should your website say? What shouldn’t it say? Where are you confusing customers? Do they understand what your brand offers? Does what you offer resolve their internal conflict? Can the whole pitch be digested in just a few seconds, or are you rambling on? In this session, we will also show you how to write the perfect sales letter using the StoryBrand framework. This sales letter alone may pay for the cost of the entire workshop.

5:00PM – Workshop Concludes

*The StoryBrand Workshop includes 15 hours of lectures, plenty of time for interaction with Donald Miller and your peers, dozens of examples from Hollywood films and dozens more examples from web, print and television advertising. Each participant will also receive their own workbook containing more than a hundred pages of examples and inspiration from brands using story successfully. Experts in automated e-mail campaigns and copywriting will also be with us and you’ll get to ask plenty of questions about your own business. StoryBrand is the jolt of inspiration and information you need to fall back in love with doing business.










After you attend the Workshop, you’ll get access to the StoryBrand Experts Academy, packed full of videos, PDFs and tools to grow your business.

Product Description▼▲
Can you love a God who doesn't make sense? Like Anne Lamott's Traveling Mercies, Miller's memoir-like collection of essays wrestles with the paradoxes of the Christian faith, describing his journey back to a culturally relevant, infinitely gracious Savior. A mind-changing perspective for those who believe that organized religion doesn't meet their spiritual needs.

Publisher's Description▼▲
"I never liked jazz music because jazz music doesn't resolve. I used to not like God because God didn't resolve. But that was before any of this happened." ?Donald MillerIn Donald Miller's early years, he was vaguely familiar with a distant God. But when he came to know Jesus Christ, he pursued the Christian life with great zeal. Within a few years he had a successful ministry that ultimately left him feeling empty, burned out, and, once again, far away from God. In this intimate, soul-searching account, Miller describes his remarkable journey back to a culturally relevant, infinitely loving God.For anyone wondering if the Christian faith is still relevant in a postmodern culture.For anyone thirsting for a genuine encounter with a God who is real.For anyone yearning for a renewed sense of passion in  life.Blue Like Jazz is a fresh and original perspective on life, love, and redemption.


Author Bio▼▲
Donald Miller has helped more than 3,000 businesses clarify their marketing messages so their companies grow. He's the CEO of StoryBrand, the cohost of the Building a StoryBrand Podcast, and the author of several books, including the bestsellers Blue Like Jazz and A Million Miles in a Thousand Years. He lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with his wife, Betsy, and their dogs, Lucy and June Carter.    


Publisher's Weekly▼▲
Miller (Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance) is a young  writer, 
speaker and campus ministry leader. An earnest  evangelical who nearly lost his 
faith, he went on a spiritual  journey, found some progressive politics and 
most importantly,  discovered Jesus' relevance for everyday life. This book, in 
its  own elliptical way, tells the tale of that journey. But the  narrative is 
episodic rather than linear, Miller's style  evocative rather than rational and 
his analysis personally  revealing rather than profoundly insightful. As such, 
it offers  a postmodern riff on the classic evangelical presentation of the  
Gospel, complete with a concluding call to commitment. Written  as a series of 
short essays on vaguely theological topics  (faith, grace, belief, confession, 
church), and disguised  theological topics (magic, romance, shifts, money), it 
is at  times plodding or simplistic (how to go to church and not get  angry? 
"pray... and go to the church God shows you"), and  sometimes falls into merely 
self-indulgent musing. But more  often Miller is enjoyably clever, and his 
story is telling and  beautiful, even poignant. (The story of the reverse 
confession  booth is worth the price of the book.) The title is meant to be  
evocative, and the subtitle-"Non-Religious" thoughts about  "Christian 
Spirituality"-indicates Miller's distrust of the  institutional church and his 
desire to appeal to those  experimenting with other flavors of spirituality.

Real, like Jazz


December  4, 2014



Hannah V. 






  
            I thought that the book Blue Like Jazz by Donald Miller was a great explanation of what the Christian faith looked like from a brand new set of eyes. As he went through his own life struggles, explaining each incident in raw detail, it was clear that this faith isnt just another cult or forced living but a new life entirely. I used to not like God because God didnt resolve. But that was before any of this happened. My favorite aspect of this book was the way Miller was able to connect with me, as the reader, and it didnt feel as though it was just another book about someones life being turned around. It felt real, earnest, and alive, just like jazz music. I would recommend this book to anyone that thinks that becoming a Christian will ruin their way of living or that being a Christian isnt worth leaving their old life. This is a clear example of how life can only get better when God is with you.

            Blue like Jazz both informs and challenges its reader to identify flaws in their faith. This is done through strait forward analysis of Christian actions, including both flaws and strengths. Donald Miller eloquently describes Christianity through many personal stories. These stories help to logically inform the reader what it truly means to be a Christian, how there are fake believers, and addresses stereotypes placed on Christians. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is a skeptical believer, or who wants advice with how to deal with situations that are extremely challenging to faith.


Miller allows the reader to come up with his or her own opinion on the topic he proposes. This is extremely powerful in that it forces the reader to think. Donald Miller's book Blue Like Jazz demonstrates the sincerity that is necessary in faith through personal stories and should be read by anyone who is searching for inspiration.

            Donald Miller a young writer who earlier in his life was beginning to lose his faith. He went on a journey that shaped his faith. He discovered changing politics, met inspiring people, and most importantly found Jesus. Miller tells of his struggles that many Christians can relate to. Through his thought-provoking encounters and experiences, he squeezes in humor to help communicate difficult matters and reduce tension. Though the writing is written brilliantly, the topics that are touched upon are broad. Topics such as church, faith, grace, has so many ways that can be described, it's difficult to explain it just through experiences. Miller tries to find himself in God through his understanding of these terms, but hard to do so without bringing in some theological discussion. Miller often brings up his view on the church. His views of church are very real and almost critical. Some Christians feel misrepresented. Miller's perspective on some of his topics still seems unclear. It's as if he still can't conclude what Church really is. The book does a great job on emphasizing how faith relates to Jazz. This is the first Donald Miller book I have read. Though there are some downfalls, I love his boldness and his honest opinions on Christianity.

            I don't know that I have ever read a book like Blue Like Jazz before. Author Donald Miller is a best-selling American author and public speaker based out of Portland, Oregon who focuses on Christian spirituality as "an explanation for beauty, meaning, and the human struggle." He is also the author of Searching for God Knows What and A Million Miles in a Thousand Years.


Miller writes, "There is something beautiful about a billion stars held steady by a God who knows what He is doing. They hang there, the stars, like notes on a page of music, free-form verse, silent mysteries swirling in the blue like jazz. And as I lay there, it occurred to me that God is up there somewhere. Of course, I had always known He was, but this time I felt it, I realized it, the way a person realizes they are hungry or thirsty. The knowledge of God seeped out of my brain and into my heart. I imagined Him looking down on this earth, half angry because His beloved mankind had cheated on Him, had committed adultery, and yet hopelessly in love with her, drunk with love for her."


Blue Like Jazz is the coming of age story of the author as he struggles with his own ideas of religion and the new world he encounters away at Reed College. This isn't your parents "Inspirational Christian Reading" book either, this is a visceral piece full of honesty and truth. Blue Like Jazz is easily one of the best Christian experience books I have ever read. Donald Miller is an extremely talented writer. Blue Like Jazz will make you laugh out loud at the same time it will ask you tough questions.


Read with caution! Highly recommended.

 The Ultimate Field Guide to a Successful Website Redesign


Is your website working well for you? 
Unfortunately, for a lot of businesses, the answer is no. And there’s a clear reason. The purpose of a website has changed dramatically in the last five years. It was once a storehouse of information about a company. Now, it’s a supplement to a broader marketing campaign. As such, it must be simple and compelling. It should complement your overall brand strategy and support the clear ideas you’ve identified as a primary message of your brand.

Publisher's Description▼▲
After decades of failed relationships and painful drama, Donald Miller decided hed had enough. Impressing people wasnt helping him connect with anyone. Hed built a life of public isolation, yet he dreamed of meaningful relationships. So at forty years old he made a scary decision: to be himself no matter what it cost.  From the author of Blue Like Jazz comes a book about the risk involved in choosing to impress fewer people and connect with more, about the freedom that comes when we stop acting and start loving. It is a story about knocking down old walls to create a healthy mind, a strong family, and a satisfying career. And it all feels like a conversation with the best kind of friend: smart, funny, true, important.  Scary Close is Donald Miller at his best. 


Author Bio▼▲
Donald Miller is the author of several books, including the bestsellers Blue Like Jazz and A Million Miles in a Thousand Years. He helps people live a better story at www.creatingyourlifeplan.com and helps leaders grow their businesses at www.storybrand.com. He lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with his wife, Betsy, and their chocolate lab, Lucy.

            Scary Close is the first book of Donald Miller that I have read. I found his writing much different than I expected, because of his initial honesty in the book, which I found surprising coming from a Christian. The thoughts and life stories he shared at the beginning felt quite secular. As I read on, I came to the realization that it was his way of being open and honest with people who are seeking and searching in their lives, and encouraging others to do the same. I came to greatly appreciate his honest, open approach. He shared so many of his own personal hang-ups, such as his dating relationships. One thing I will take away from this book is that in order for us to succeed at relationships, we must be open and honest. He encouraged me not to be afraid of the outcome and stop trying to predict reactions of others so carefully.


This book also spoke to me, in how he was so encouraged by what a friend said to him (Bob Goff). It reminded me how much a good friend or acquaintance can help to encourage or to enlighten us about ourselves- good or bad. And the power we can have to speak truth and hope into each others lives. 


I would recommend this book to anyone in a relationship- dating or marriage. It helps you to take stock of where things are at and the relationships you are in.


I was provided this book by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

                This review was written for Scary Close: Dropping the Act and Acquiring a Taste for True Intimacy - eBook.
            
 
            Since I read Blue Like Jazz, I've started to like Miller's writings. He's straight-forward, honest, no-fuss writing appeals to me. He explained faith in a way like no one ever could, I think. In fact, the next time I'm asked why I believe what I believe by philosophical people who wants to start an argument with me, I will give him the book and let it explain. Then, he can tell me his thoughts after that.


While the concepts he wrote in his book are simple, yet they are profound and are often the most difficult to do. I would agree with him when he wrote that often we exchange quantity instead of quality when it comes to relationships. Although he is a man, I can relate to his kind of personality. He also wrote about how we may manipulate our relationships and know when to lovingly walk away from it.


Don talks about the different phases of his relationships with self and with others which I am certain reflects about us, too. I dare say that the journey is not Don's but ours, too. Only if we are honest enough to admit.


What I especially liked in this book is how Don stressed the importance of accountability, being willing to listen to people who care about you and your other relationships, be teachable, seek out ways to change yourself for the better.


This book is not about finding the right woman to marry or about marriage at all, Scary Close is about finding authenticity in relationships. Relationship to self. Relationship to others. Because it is only when you are honest to who you really are can you finally be honest with others. This book will encourage you to be more authentic. When you are true, all the true people in your life will show up.

            Donald Miller is probably one of those names that most people have heard about. He has written Blue Like Jazz and A Million Miles in a Thousand Years. The thing I appreciate the most about Miller is his honesty. Even if it makes him less popular among people, he's not afraid to wrestle out his thoughts with others, including his readers.


 Scary Close is a book that is a bit challenging to people like myself, who are introverts. Sometimes it takes a lot to be around people and to open up and be honest. I enjoyed going on the journey with Miller as he found how to balance life with an extrovert and the own problems that come with being an introvert. Honestly, I could relate easily to his desire to rent a cabin and be away from people for an extended time just to write. I think all introverts can relate to the always occurring problem of being with people and opening up and risking yourself with those who enjoy and long for the spotlight vs. being alone in a room to recharge.


 Miller holds nothing back in this book, even sharing some stories from his therapy sessions. He talks about his childhood experiences at school and other issues that I think most people would hesitate to tell their close friend, let alone a random reader. However, that's what I appreciated most. The honesty, transparency, and vulnerability. It revealed to me how much I long to be those things with certain people, but it comes at the risk of ignoring what others will think of you. Miller reminds his readers that life isn't supposed to be about "more" and "impressing others." There's more to life and happiness than that.

One man's torturous journey to intimacy

            Miller found out that being authentic was scary. He shares his experience of finding out that he was hiding his true self behind a reactionary construct of humor. He began to understand why he had created the act in the first place. He also realized that he had found at a young age that he could get respect from writing. But he began to wonder what it would be like if he dropped the act and began to trust being himself.


Miller takes us through his journey to intimacy, to a deep sense of meaning. He shares the retreat he went to, the counselor he saw, the books he read, the guys he talked to, and the woman who helped him (his then future wife, Betsy).


He shares his breakthroughs and the insights he gained. He recognizes the paradox of relationships. Individuals must be independent and free in order to be with each other. Intimacy means we are independently together. (97) He was able to identify manipulation and control. You can't control somebody and have intimacy with them at the same time. (95)


Sometimes Miller had to learn lessons that seemed obvious to me. For example, I'm convinced honest is the soil intimacy grows in. (168) He does mention that women seem to have an easier time of it than men. So perhaps men will identify with the torturous route Miller took to honesty and intimacy. He owes a great deal to Betsy as she was stability through his journey, even when he acted like a jerk.


This book is not pushy Christian. Miller does share his Christian experience but is also not embarrassed to say he hadn't attended church for over five years. His thoughts will probably resonate with the younger generation who question the value of community worship and fellowship.


People who are discovering who they are might appreciate this book, especially men. It is very experience oriented, as opposed to instructional. Miller just shares his own experiences, lots of his own experiences. I think I know more about him than I ever wanted to. Men may need the type of encouraging experience found in this book. Women might find themselves repeatedly saying, Well, I already knew that.

            Going into a job interview, I used to worry about over-selling myself.  At some point, I decided that I would rather lose out on a job opportunity than to suffer the indignity  six months down the road  of wondering if my boss was wishing she could find that stellar employee she had thought she was hiring.  Ive tried to have the same mindset with my family, thinking that it would be better to have them actually know me than to have them be impressed with me (although I wouldnt complain if both could be true).  The fact that I attend a small church, webbed through and through with relationships, also requires a high degree of congruency.  The person I am when Im sitting in the library teaching the Bible had better be the same person who stands in the parking lot and hollers at her (and sometimes other peoples) children!


This connection with other people and this vulnerability of being fully known was missing from Donald Millers life.  As one of the eleven people in the universe who has not read Blue Like Jazz, I approached Scary Close with tabula rasa.  Even so, I found the tale of his meandering quest for intimacy and the memoir-like account of his courtship with his wife to be refreshing and redemptive because, ultimately  Hooray, he gets it!


Donald Miller spent his early adult years building a career based on an image that worked well for him, but he was brought up short when a wise counselor asked, How else will we connect with people unless we let them know us?  It is profoundly lonely to realize that all your friends love an image that you have projected.  The scary question always lurks:  What if they knew the real me?


Miller helps his readers to see that most of us hide our truest selves beneath an outer ring or a character that we learn to play in order to win or to deserve love and acceptance.  In his case, humor and intelligence made him feel powerful and professionally successful, but his dating life was a death spiral of codependency and resentment.  Letting go of his need to be impressive and to control every atom in the universe was necessary in order for Miller to become the other healthy person in his relationship with Betsy.  To expedite the process, he decided to hang out with better people, and soon found that he also wanted  his work style to evolve from self-involved introvert to collaborative team-player.


As Miller interacted with his fiances family, he realized the same principle bears out in family life:  transparency within the family is a predictor of emotional health and happiness in children.  To this end, Scary Close offers help for recognizing and ending manipulative behavior, overcoming fear of intimacy, and avoiding the loss that comes from careful living.


Two concepts from Scary Close flashed like comets across my relational sky:


1.  All relationships are teleological; i.e. going somewhere; living; alive and moving and becoming something.  Married for nearly twenty-five years, I dont want to find one day that weve begun to coast downhill in our relationship just because we have taken it for granted and stopped working at it.


2.  No human relationship will ultimately satisfy my heart, and even intimacy with God will not yield ultimate fulfillment on this planet.  To expect otherwise is to deny the reality of our present condition of groaning within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body, (Romans 8:23).  In the meantime, however, until that soul-healing is complete, it is wonderful to walk beside another fallen creature in understanding and acceptance, and to see in our children the fruit of having let them become scary close.

									Donald Miller grew up in Houston, Texas. Leaving home at the age of twenty-one, he traveled across the country until he ran out of money in Portland, Oregon, where he lives today.
Harvest House Publishers released his first book, Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance, in 2000. Two years later, after having audited classes at Portland’s Reed College, Don wrote Blue Like Jazz, which would slowly become a New York Times Bestseller.
In 2004 Don released Searching for God Knows What a book about how the Gospel of Jesus explains the human personality. Searching has become required reading at numerous colleges across the country. In 2005 he released Through Painted Deserts the story of he and a friends road trip across the country. Don’s most recent project is a book about growing up without a father called To Own a Dragon.

Biography[edit]
At 21, Miller left his home in Pearland, Texas and went to Portland, Oregon, where he put down roots as he had planned when he started his road trip a few months before. Miller's first book, Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance (Harvest House Publishers 2000), chronicled the cross-country road trip he took at age 21. It was printed with little fanfare, but it was republished more successfully in 2005 as Through Painted Deserts. During this time, Miller was the editor of an online Christian magazine called roadsearching.com and the owner of a small Portland-based publishing company called Coffee House Books, which published home schooling textbooks. Miller became a New York Times Bestselling Author when he published Blue Like Jazz in 2003. In 2004, Miller released Searching For God Knows What, which explores how the life of Jesus illustrates the human personality. In 2006, he added another book, To Own A Dragon, which offered Miller's reflections on growing up without a father. This book reflected an interest already present in Miller's life, as he founded The Mentoring Project, a non-profit that partners with local churches to mentor fatherless young men. Don's next book, A Million Miles in a Thousand Years, was released in late 2009. Later that year, Miller began production of All Things Converge, a series of DVDs for small groups that feature Miller interviewing prominent Christian writers and theologians. The first three DVDs in the series were released in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Miller also served as the Founding Director of The Burnside Writers Collective, a group of spiritual writers who contributed to an online magazine.
Miller is recognized for his view that Christian faith should be a relationship, rather than a formula. He writes in Searching for God Knows What that too many Christians act like the Bible is a sort of math textbook, rather than a long story of God's involvement with people through friendships with Biblical figures like Adam, Abraham, and Moses. This emphasis on the Bible as a narrative has made his writings popular with many involved in the emerging church conversation.[2] Miller does not consider himself a follower of the movement; he still recognizes the need of mankind to recognize its depravity so that it might better teach the concept of love.
On November 30, 2013 Donald Miller married Elizabeth Miltenberger. They now live in Nashville, Tennessee with their chocolate lab, Lucy.
Miller is also the founder of Storyline and StoryBrand. Storyline is a life coaching service that connects with its users through conferences, books, and a blog. StoryBrand is a marketing service.

This book reflected an interest already present in Miller's life, as he founded The Mentoring Project, a non-profit that partners with local churches to mentor fatherless young men. Don's next book, A Million Miles in a Thousand Years, was released in late 2009. Later that year, Miller began production of All Things Converge, a series of DVDs for small groups that feature Miller interviewing prominent Christian writers and theologians. The first three DVDs in the series were released in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Miller also served as the Founding Director of The Burnside Writers Collective, a group of spiritual writers who contributed to an online magazine.
Miller is recognized for his view that Christian faith should be a relationship, rather than a formula. He writes in Searching for God Knows What that too many Christians act like the Bible is a sort of math textbook, rather than a long story of God's involvement with people through friendships with Biblical figures like Adam, Abraham, and Moses. This emphasis on the Bible as a narrative has made his writings popular with many involved in the emerging church conversation.[2] Miller does not consider himself a follower of the movement; he still recognizes the need of mankind to recognize its depravity so that it might better teach the concept of love.
On November 30, 2013 Donald Miller married Elizabeth Miltenberger. They now live in Nashville, Tennessee with their chocolate lab, Lucy.
Miller is also the founder of Storyline and StoryBrand. Storyline is a life coaching service that connects with its users through conferences, books, and a blog. StoryBrand is a marketing service.

Biography[edit]
At 21, Miller left his home in Pearland, Texas and went to Portland, Oregon, where he put down roots as he had planned when he started his road trip a few months before. Miller's first book, Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance (Harvest House Publishers 2000), chronicled the cross-country road trip he took at age 21. It was printed with little fanfare, but it was republished more successfully in 2005 as Through Painted Deserts. During this time, Miller was the editor of an online Christian magazine called roadsearching.com and the owner of a small Portland-based publishing company called Coffee House Books, which published home schooling textbooks. Miller became a New York Times Bestselling Author when he published Blue Like Jazz in 2003. In 2004, Miller released Searching For God Knows What, which explores how the life of Jesus illustrates the human personality. In 2006, he added another book, To Own A Dragon, which offered Miller's reflections on growing up without a father. This book reflected an interest already present in Miller's life, as he founded The Mentoring Project, a non-profit that partners with local churches to mentor fatherless young men. Don's next book, A Million Miles in a Thousand Years, was released in late 2009. Later that year, Miller began production of All Things Converge, a series of DVDs for small groups that feature Miller interviewing prominent Christian writers and theologians.

Mini Bio (1)


          Donald Miller was born in Houston, Texas. When he was twenty-one he traveled across America with a friend in a Volkswagen van. They ran out of money in the Pacific Northwest where they lived in the woods, in the Cascade Mountains of central Oregon.Always fascinated by stories, Don wrote about this journey in a travel memoir called Through Painted Deserts. He would later go on to work in the publishing industry, bringing other people's stories into the world. When he started his own company, he was once again without money and so wrote another book called Blue Like Jazz, which, more than two years after its release, would arrive on the New York Times Bestsellers List where it spent more than 40 weeks.While writing a book about fatherlessness, Don started a mentoring program in Portland that hopes to mentor more than a million fatherless kids across America. That initiative led Barack Obama to invite Don onto the Presidential Task Force on Fatherhood and Healthy Families.Don's most recent book is called A Million Miles in a Thousand Years and it's about how the elements of a great story can help us understand the elements of a great life. That book also hit the New York Times Bestsellers List, and inspired corporations to work with Don to improve employee engagement in their corporate vision, and customer understanding of the corporations overall narrative.Don has appeared on a diversity of television programs including NPR's Tavis Smiley and Fox News' The Strategy Room and has spoken for a variety of venues including the Veritas Forum at Harvard and national corporate conferences for brands such as Chic-fil-a.Don lives and works in Nashville, Tennessee.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

One of the things I associate with God is a sunrise. How many sunrises have you missed over the years, and God created that?
Donald Miller


God,
Sunrise,
You



















I think understanding your life as a story is a really terrific way of kind of knowing where you are and knowing who you are.
Donald Miller


Life,
Understanding,
Story
























Life is a story. You and I are telling stories; they may suck, but we are telling stories. And we tell stories about the things that we want. So you go through your bank account, and those are things you have told stories about.
Donald Miller


Life,
Want,
Life Is A



















If you have a beautiful story, it has to have conflict. If you don't have conflict, it can't be a good story.
Donald Miller


Beautiful,
Good,
Conflict



















One of the things I love about our source text as Christians, the Bible, is that it teaches us not to avoid conflict. And it teaches us that before the fall of man, in Paradise, there was conflict. God wants conflict to be a part of your life.

Love,
God

I think, in the grand epic, Jesus is the hero of our stories. And our stories, as they were, are subplots in a grand epic and our job is not to be the hero of any story. Our job is to be a saint in a story that he is telling.
