Rasna Therapeutics, Inc. Completes Reverse Merger and Becomes a 
      Publicly Traded Company






August 17, 2016 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rasna Therapeutics, Inc., a development stage biotechnology company 
      focused on the development of cancer drugs, today announced the 
      successful completion of its merger with the Active With Me, Inc. 
      (OTC:ATVM). The combined company intends to change its name to Rasna 
      Therapeutics, Inc. and will trade on the OTC Markets under the symbol 
      “ATVM.” The Company intends to submit an application to change its 
      trading symbol.
    


      “Becoming a public company is a key element of our growth strategy, and 
      the completion of this reverse merger is a significant accomplishment 
      for Rasna Therapeutics,” said James Tripp, Acting Chief Executive 
      Officer of Rasna, “We believe that this breakthrough program may have 
      significant benefits across all forms of leukemia. Our NPM1 
      program targets the sub-set of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients 
      with the NPM1 mutation and may also benefit the general AML population. 
      We are aiming to have a lead candidate identified by 2017.”
    

      Rasna Therapeutics is engaged in modulating the molecular targets LSD1 
      and NPM1, which are implicated in the disease progression of leukemia 
      and lymphoma. Rasna was formed in 2013 by biotechnology entrepreneur 
      Gabriele Cerrone, together with distinguished scientists, Dr. Roberto 
      Pellicciari, a medicinal chemist and the scientific founder of Intercept 
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT), and Dr. Brunangelo Falini, a physician and 
      hematologist.
    

      Rasna’s scientific team is comprised of world-renowned experts in blood 
      cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma. Dr. Riccardo Dalla-Favera is a 
      board member of Rasna and the director of the Institute for Cancer 
      Genetics at Columbia University and a member of the National Academy of 
      Sciences, Dr. Falini is the Director of the Hematology Institute at the 
      University of Perugia, Italy and Dr. Pier Giuseppe Pelicci, a 
      collaborator with Rasna, is the Chairman of the Department of 
      Experimental Oncology at the European Institute of Oncology.
    

About Rasna Therapeutics, Inc.


      Rasna Therapeutics, Inc. is a development stage biotechnology company 
      focused primarily on the development of drug candidates for leukemia and 
      lymphoma. Abnormal epigenetic modification is recognized to play an 
      important role in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 
      leading to silencing of genes involved in tumor suppression and cellular 
      reproduction. Rasna’s focus on inhibition of lysine specific 
      demethylase-1 (LSD1), an enzyme involved in epigenetic control, 
      represents a promising and novel approach towards AML. Rasna has 
      developed novel irreversible and reversible LSD1 regulators that have 
      shown appropriate effects on the LSD1 gene in-vitro and in 
      IND-enabling pre-clinical studies.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Note About Forward-Looking Statements  This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as "future," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "predicts," "will," "would," "could," "can," "may," and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company's actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on September 28, 2016 under the heading "Risk Factors," which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on September 28, 2016.  We assume no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.  Unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms "Rasna,"," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Rasna Therapeutics, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and, where appropriate, its wholly owned subsidiaries.  Company Background  Rasna Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly Active With Me, Inc.) (the "Company" or "Rasna Successor"), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 6, 2012.  Arna Therapeutics Limited ("Arna") is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands under applicable law and regulation. Arna was incorporated on September 30, 2013. Arna only has one segment of activity which is that of a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on targeted drugs to treat diseases in oncology and immunology, mainly focusing on the treatment of leukemia.  Rasna Therapeutics Limited ("Rasna UK") is a private limited company incorporated in England and Wales under the U.K. Companies Act on February 10, 2014 (inception). Rasna UK only has one segment of activity which is that ofresearch and development in clinical drugs for the treatment of leukemia. As of March 31, 2016, Rasna UK has a wholly owned subsidiary, Falconridge Holdings Limited ("Falconridge") which has been dormant since its inception.  On April 27, 2016, Rasna UK sold its stake in Falconridge to Rasna Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware Corporation ("Rasna, Inc.") for $1. This entity had no operations, no assets or liabilities as at this date.  On May 17, 2016, Rasna and its subsidiary Falconridge entered into an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization ("Merger Agreement") with Arna. Pursuant to the agreement, Arna was merged into Falconridge and the shareholders of Arna were issued shares of Rasna in exchange for shares of Arna.  The Merger is being treated as a reverse acquisition effected by a share exchange for financial accounting and reporting purposes since Arna's operations, Board of Directors and management will remain subsequent to the consummation of the transaction, however, the legal aquiror is Rasna Therapeutics, Inc. As a result, the historical operations that are reflected in these financial statements are those of Arna, and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and in the transaction with Rasna Therapeutics, Inc have been written to fair value in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. Refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions, for more information related to the transaction.  On August 15, 2016, the Company, entered into an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization (the "Merger Agreement") with Rasna, Inc., and Rasna Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"), providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Rasna, Inc. (the "Merger"), with Rasna, Inc. surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the Merger, the resulting company, Rasna Therapeutics, Inc., is a biotechnology company that is engaged in modulating the molecular targets NPM1 and LSD1, which are implicated in the disease progression of leukemia and lymphoma.  On September 20, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Change in Nevada which effected a 3.25 for 1 forward stock split of its common stock for shareholders of record as of August 16, 2016 and increased the authorized number of shares of common stock to 200,000,000 shares.  The Company only has one segment of activity which is that of a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on targeted drugs to treat diseases in oncology and immunology, mainly focusing on the treatment of leukemia.  Acquisitions  Falconridge  The following transactions were accounted for using the purchase accounting method which requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their acquisition date fair value.  On May 5, 2016, Rasna UK sold its intellectual property to Falconridge, a subsidiary of Rasna, Inc., for a note payable in the amount of $236,269. The fair value of the intellectual property was deemed to be the $236,269 based on the consideration received.  On May 17, 2016, Arna was merged into Falconridge and the shareholders of Arna were issued shares of Rasna, Inc. in exchange for shares of Arna. On this day, Rasna, Inc. and its subsidiary Falconridge entered into an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization with Arna. Pursuant to the agreement, Arna was merged into Falconridge and the shareholders of Arna were issued shares of Rasna, Inc. in exchange for shares of Arna. Arna was deemed to be the accounting acquirer because Rasna, Inc. and Falconridge Holdings Limited were non-trading holding companies and Arna's operations will comprise the ongoing operations of the combined entity and its senior management will serve as the senior management of the combined entity. Further, 65% of the voting interest in Rasna, Inc. was acquired in connection with the transaction. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity, Rasna, Inc., were written to fair value in accordance with the Acquisition Method prescribed in ASC 805, Business Combinations.  The consideration transferred was measured based upon the share price recently received during a non-public equity raise in Rasna, Inc., during which non-related investors paid $0.40 per share of common stock. During the acquisition transaction, 19,187,500 of 54,837,790 shares were issued to legacy Rasna, Inc. shareholders, which results in consideration transferred to the acquiree's shareholders of $7,675,000.  Rasna  On August 15, 2016, Active With Me, Inc., entered into an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization (the "Merger Agreement") with Rasna, Inc., and Rasna Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Active With Me, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Rasna, Inc. (the "Merger"), with Rasna, Inc. surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Active With Me, Inc. As a result of the Merger, the resulting company, Rasna Therapeutics, Inc., is a biotechnology company that is engaged in modulating the molecular targets NPM1 and LSD1, which are implicated in the disease progression of leukemia and lymphoma.  The Merger is being treated as a reverse recapitalization effected by a share exchange for financial accounting and reporting purposes since substantially all of Active With Me's operations were disposed of prior to the consummation of the transaction. Rasna Successor is treated as the accounting acquirer as its stockholders control the Company after the Exchange Agreement, even though Active With Me, Inc. was the legal acquirer. As a result, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in these financial statements are those of Rasna Successor as if Rasna Successor had always been the reporting company. Since Active With Me, Inc. had no operations upon the Merger Agreement taking place, the transaction was treated as a reverse recapitalization for accounting purposes and no goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded by the Company as a result of the Merger Agreement.  Thereafter, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company transferred all of the outstanding capital stock of Rasna Successor to a former officer and director of Active With Me, Inc. in exchange for cancellation of an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of Rasna Successor's common stock held by such person.  In connection with the share exchange, each share of Rasna, Inc was exchanged for the right to receive .33 shares in Active With Me, Inc. Once issued, the new shares were combined with the 3,305,000 common shares held by legacy Active With Me, Inc. shareholders. Immediately following the Merger, 1,500,000 shares were canceled, which related to one legacy Active With Me shareholder that effectively spun off the remaining assets of Active With Me in connection with the transaction. Finally, subsequent to the transaction, the legal acquirer executed a 3.25 for 1 stock split on its common shares. Historical common stock amounts and additional paid-in capital have been retroactively adjusted for the effect of the share splits executive in connection with the Merger transaction. Following the closing of the Merger and Rasna Successor's cancellation of 1,500,000 shares in the Split-Off, there were 19,901,471 shares of Rasna Successor issued and outstanding, which once effected for the 3.25 for 1 reverse stock split, resulted in 64,679,798 shares outstanding in the combined entity.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and the Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 2- "Accounting Policies", of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.  Basis of preparation  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") and Accounting Standards Updates ("ASU") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB").  Principles of Consolidation  In accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation, the Company consolidates any entity in which it has a controlling financial interest. Further, the Company consolidates any variable interest entity that it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of, and have the power to direct its significant activities. Upon review of the relationship between Rasna Therapeutics ("Rasna UK") and Rasna, Management noted that equity investment in Rasna UK is not sufficient to fund its operations. Accordingly, Rasna is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the assets held within Rasna UK, which primarily consist of cash received from Rasna to fund its operations, and has power to direct its significant activities. As a result, Rasna consolidates this variable interest entity.  The interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary, Arna Therapeutics Limited as well as the operations of Rasna for the period from May 17, 2016 through September 30, 2016. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.  Business Combinations  Management accounts for business combinations under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 805-10, Business Combinations ("ASC 805-10"), which requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including non-controlling interests, are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. ASC 805-10 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred.  The amounts reflected within the Note 3 - Acquisitions are the results of the preliminary purchase price allocation and will be updated upon completion of the final valuation report. Management is required to complete the purchase price allocation within 12 months of the acquisition date. If such completion of the allocation results in a change in the preliminary values, the measurement period adjustment will be recognized in the period in which the adjustment amount is determined in accordance with ASU 2015-16.  Going concern  The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other pre-commercial stage companies, including its dependence on key individuals, uncertainty of product development and generation of revenues, dependence on outside sources of capital, risks associated with research, development, testing, and obtaining related regulatory approvals of its pipeline products, suppliers and collaborators, successful protection of intellectual property, competition with larger, better-capitalized companies, successful completion of the Company's development programs and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations are dependent on future events, including obtaining adequate financing to fulfill its development activities and generating a level of revenues adequate to support the Company's cost structure.  The Company has experienced net losses and significant cash outflows from cash used in operating activities over the past years, and as at September 30, 2016, had an accumulated deficit of $6,331,183, a net loss for the six months ended September 30, 2016 of $1,507,135 and net cash used in operating activities of $1,353,798.  We expect to continue to incur net losses and have significant cash outflows for at least the next twelve months. The Group has sufficient funds to continue operating until the end of the third quarter of 2017, but will require significant additional cash resources to launch new development phases of existing products in its pipeline. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Group will continue as a going concern. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of the Group's assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. A successful transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of positive cash flows adequate to support the Group's cost structure.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to the fair values of stock based awards, income taxes and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations.  Fair Value  The carrying value of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, related party balances, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of such financial instruments. Management measures certain other assets, including nonmarketable equity securities, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired.  Concentration of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of related party receivables.  Deposits held with banks, including those held in foreign branches of global banks, may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. These deposits may be redeemed upon demand and bear minimal risk. Management believes that the institutions that hold our instruments are financially sound and are subject to minimal credit risk.  Cash and cash equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash on deposit with banks with an original maturity of three months or less.  Goodwill and Intangible assets  Intangible assets are made up of in-process research and development, ("IPR&D") and certain intellectual property ("IP"). IPR&D assets represent the fair value assigned to acquired technologies, which at the time of acquisition have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. IP assets represent the fair value assigned to technologies, which at the time of acquisition have reached technological feasibility, however, have not yet been put into service. Intangible assets are considered to have an indefinite useful life until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development projects at which time they will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their economic or legal useful life.  Goodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized; rather, it is subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. Goodwill is assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment charge is recognized only when the implied fair value of the Company's reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying amount.  Management evaluates indefinite life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual impairment tests indicate that the asset might be impaired. The ongoing evaluation for impairment of its indefinite life intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment. Management reviews definite life intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. There were no impairment charges as of the six months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.  Risks and Uncertainties  The Company intends to operate in an industry that is subject to rapid change. The Company's operations will be subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational, technological, regulatory, and other risks associated with an early stage company, including the potential risk of business failure.  Research and development  Expenditure on research and development is charged to the statements of operation in the year in which it is incurred with the exception of expenditures incurred in respect of the development of major new products where the outcome of those projects is assessed as being reasonably certain in regards to viability and technical feasibility. Such expenditure is capitalized and amortized straight line over the estimated period of sale for each product, commencing in the year that sales of the product are first made. To date, the Company has not capitalized any such expenditures other than certain IPR&D & IP recorded in connection with certain acquisition or equity transactions.  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Management considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. A valuation allowance may be established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of the business, future changes in income tax law and variances between actual and anticipated operating results, management makes certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates.  The Company recognizes in the financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company records a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on the Company's tax return. To the extent that the assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. To the extent interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision. The Company incurred no liability and, therefore, did not need to record interest and penalties during the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Foreign Currency,  Items included in the financial statements are measured using their functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the company operates. The financial statements are presented in United States Dollar ("USD"), which is the company's functional and presentational currency.  Foreign currency transactions are translated using the rate of exchange applicable at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the re-translation at the year end of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the statements of operations.  Net Loss per Share  Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and warrants, using various methods such as the treasury stock or modified treasury stock method in the determination of dilutive shares outstanding during each reporting period. As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 there were no common equivalent shares.  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees  The Company offers stock-based compensation awards based on fair value as of the grant date. Management uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options on the dates of grant.  Given the limited history with employee grants, the "simplified" method is used for estimating the expected term for stock option awards. The "simplified" method, is calculated as the average of the contractual term and the average vesting period. Estimated volatility is based upon the historical volatility of similar entities whose share prices are publicly available, as the Company did not have sufficient trading history for its common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the stock option award is granted, with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option award. The expected dividend assumption is based on the current expectations about the Company's anticipated dividend policy.  The fair value of an award expected to vest on a straight-line basis is amortized over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the period from the grant date to the end of the vesting period. For awards with service only conditions and a graded vesting schedule, management elected to recognize costs on a straight-line basis. The Company uses historical data to estimate the number of future forfeitures.  Results of Operations  The following paragraphs set forth our results of operations for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended of September 30, 2016 and 2015 The following table sets forth the summary statements of operations for the periods indicated: For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Revenue $ - $ - Cost of revenue - - Gross profit - - Operating expenses: General and administrative 144,479 - Research and development 642,522 - Consultancy fees third parties 410,336 27,500 Consultancy fees related parties 87,500 87,500 Legal and professional fees 56,889 2,343 Total operating expenses 1,341,726 117,343 Loss from operations (1,341,726 ) (117,343 ) Other expense: Foreign currency transaction gain 50,356 - Other expense 50,356 - Net loss $ (1,291,370 ) $ (117,343 )  Revenues  There were no revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 because Rasna Therapeutics, Inc. does not have any commercial biopharmaceutical products.

Rasna Therapeutics, Inc. Closes Private Placement of $2 Million | Business Wire
























































Rasna Therapeutics, Inc. Closes Private Placement of $2 Million






December 27, 2016 07:16 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rasna Therapeutics, Inc. (OTCQB:RASP), a development stage biotechnology 
      company focused on the development of cancer drugs, today announced that 
      it has closed a private placement to accredited investors of an 
      aggregate 3,366,667 shares of common stock at $0.60 per share for gross 
      proceeds of $2.02 million. The Company intends to use the proceeds for 
      clinical development and working capital.
    

About Rasna Therapeutics, Inc.


      Rasna Therapeutics, Inc. is a development stage biotechnology company 
      focused primarily on the development of drug candidates for leukemia and 
      lymphoma. Abnormal epigenetic modification is recognized to play an 
      important role in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 
      leading to silencing of genes involved in tumor suppression and cellular 
      reproduction. Rasna’s focus on inhibition of lysine specific 
      demethylase-1 (LSD1), an enzyme involved in epigenetic control, 
      represents a promising and novel approach towards AML. Rasna has 
      developed novel irreversible and reversible LSD1 regulators that have 
      shown appropriate effects on the LSD1 gene in-vitro and in IND-enabling 
      pre-clinical studies.
    

Rasna Therapeutics Forward-Looking Statements


      This press release contains “forward-looking statements” as that term is 
      defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 
      regarding the research, development and commercialization of 
      pharmaceutical products. Such forward-looking statements are based on 
      current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, 
      including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and 
      could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from 
      current expectations. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. 
      Forward-looking statements in the press release should be evaluated 
      together with the many uncertainties that affect Rasna Therapeutics’ 
      business and Rasna Therapeutics undertakes no obligation to publicly 
      update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new 
      information, future events, or otherwise.

					Full Description



Rasna Therapeutics, Inc., formerly Active With Me Inc., incorporated on December 6, 2012, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. The Company is focused on the development of disease-modifying drugs candidates for leukemia and lymphoma. The Company is targeting nucleophosmin (NPM1)-mutated acute myeloid leukemi (AML) through direct and indirect disease-modifying approaches. AML includes acute and chronic. It is also exploring inhibition of lysine specific demethylase-1 (LSD1), an enzyme involved in epigenetic control, as approach against AML. The Company’s product candidate includes RASP-101, RASP-201 and RASP-301.RASP-101 is an anticancer therapeutic for treating nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Formulation of RASP-101 is being developed to conduct multi-center clinical trials in NPM1 mutated AML patients. RASP-201is used for lysine specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1 or KDM1A) for cancers including AML. LSD1 are attractive cancer therapeutics targets. GSK2879552 (GlaxoSmithKline) and ORY-1001 (Oryzon) represent irreversible small molecule LSD1inhibitors. LSD-1 targets the histone de-acetylation process responsible for driving cells into and embryo-like cancer state. RASP-301is in pre-clinical stage and it can be used for NPM1 diseases. The Company is developing orally available, small molecule inhibitor to disrupt NPM1 oligomerization.NPM1 inhibitors can prevent causing further damage to cells.
