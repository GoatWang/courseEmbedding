						 from   Sunshine Biopharma Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 



MONTREAL, May 25, 2011 /PRNewswire/ - Advanomics Corporation, the parent

                "The Future Of Medicine"           Topoisomerase II is an enzyme that aggressive cancer cells make too much of. When the cell is able to make a lot of the Topoisomerase II  enzyme, it becomes able to proliferate and metastasize; so, if you can inhibit or destroy the activity of Topoisomerase II, you would then be  able to prevent cancer cells from spreading.           Our  Proprietary Technology Our licensor, Advanomics Corporation, has developed a way to replace the diester bond with a Carbon-Difluoride bond which acts as a perfect diester isostere.  This technology allows us to create a large variety of therapeutic compounds that are completely stable and often more active than the original drugs.  This unique capability allowed us to create our Lead Compound, Adva-27a, an effective and highly specific Topoisomerase II (Top2) Inhibitor.      Our Carbon-Difluoride Technology is covered by issued and pending patents filed under PCT/FR2003/002330 and PCT/FR2007/000697     Adva-27a is 16-times more effective at killing multidrug resistant  breast cancer cells than Etoposide, the drug currently in use.  Adva-27a is unaffected by P-Glycoprotein, the enzyme responsible for making cancer cells resistant to anti-tumor drugs.  Adva-27a has excellent clearance time (half-life = 54 minutes) as indicated by human microsomes stability studies.  Adva-27a clearance is independent of Cytochrome P450, a mechanism that is less likely to produce toxic intermediates.  Adva-27a is an excellent inhibitor of Topoisomerase ll with an IC50 of only 13.7 micromolar.  Adva-27a has shown excellent pharmacokinetics profile as indicated by studies done in rats  Adva-27a's initial indication will be multidrug resistant breast cancer for which there are little or no treatment options        Our Published Data show that Adva-27a is a true Topoisomerase ll Inhibitor and is significantly more effevtive at killing aggressive cancer cells than Etoposide, the current drug of choice.        Check out SBFM's drug Adva-27a (27a) vs the leading chem drug Etoposide (2) - results are better in every category except two. And in the multi drug resistance breast cancer category (MCF7R) it's over 3x more effective.           Unique Features of Adva-27a    * Adva-27a can be taken orally. * Adva-27a is not a so-called me-too drug; our technology is unique. Adva-27a will be the only Topoisomerase ll Inhibitor on the Market. * Adva-27a's initial indication will be multi-drug resistant breast cancer. Adva-27a can be used to treat other Top2 Positive Cancer Types (Prostate, Colon, Lung, Stomach, Ovarian).   Sunshine Biopharma Drug Pipeline  Adva-27a - Completed Preclinicals Compound for Small-Cell Lung Cancer - In Preclinical Studies A Third RNAi-Based Drug    They have been changing the timeline for years Now “mid/late 2017” now to start phase 1. Anyone can review past quarterlies to see that it keeps on sliding to the right. Share structure will be raised to 3B as stated here http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1402328/000135448816006700/sbfm_10k.htm Yes, dilution is going nuts, and I sure wouldn’t mind the 35% discount. Pretty much the saga continues. Imo.  Just a few random excerpts. Mostly for my own notes.  1st Q 2016  Common Stock, $0.001 per share; Authorized 500,000,000 Shares; Issued and outstanding 232,876,353 and 198,265,118 at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively   Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding 215,596,040 78,942,780  Note 1 – Descriptions of Business In July 2014, the Company formed a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, Sunshine Biopharma Canada Inc. (“Sunshine Canada”) for the purposes of conducting pharmaceutical business in Canada and elsewhere around the globe. Sunshine Canada is currently working on securing a Drug Establishment License from Health Canada and signing manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution contracts for various generic pharmaceuticals for sale in Canada and overseas.  During the last three month period the Company has continued to raise money through stock sales and borrowings.  Note 4 – Notes Payable  A Note having a Face Value of $19,142 was entered into on December 31, 2015. This Note accrues interest at the rate of 12% per annum and a total of $574 in accrued interest was expensed during the quarter ended March 31, 2016. This is a Non-convertible Note due on December 31, 2016.  A Note having a principal balance of $83,000 as of December 31, 2015 was fully converted, together with $3,320 of accrued interest thereon, into $0.001 par value Common Stock during the three month period ended March 31, 2016. In connection therewith, 9,906,049 shares of $0.001 par value Common Stock valued at $146,658 were issued generating a loss of $63,658 on conversion.  A Note having a Face Value $203,036 with interest of 12% is due June 30, 2016. This Note is convertible after December 31, 2015 into $0.001 par value Common Stock at a price 35% below market value. During the period ended March 31, 2016, a total of $38,036 in principal was converted into $0.001 par value Common Stock leaving a principal balance of $165,000. In connection this conversion, 7,705,186 shares of $0.001 par value Common Stock valued at $231,156 were issued generating a loss of $193,120 on conversion.

The Note is convertible after 180 days from issuance into $0.001 par value Common Stock at a price 35% below market value. Note 5 – Notes Payable Related Entity On October 8, 2015, the Company acquired from Advanomics Corporation (a related party) U.S. Patent Number 8,236,935 (the “Patent”) for the anticancer compound, Adva-27a, which includes all rights to this intellectual property within the United States in exchange for an interest-free note payable for $4,320,000 with annual payments of $360,000 due and payable on or before December 31, commencing in 2016 and continuing until paid in full. The note is collateralized by the Patent. Pursuant to an amendment agreement effective December 28, 2015, this note was cancelled and replaced with a new note having a face value of $210,519, comprised of $155,940 in principal amount which is the seller’s (Advanomics Corporation, a related party) book value of the Patent plus $54,579 as an adjustment for the currency exchange difference, which was expensed immediately. This new, interest-free Note is automatically convertible into a fixed number of 80,968,965 shares of the Company’s $0.001 par value Common Stock upon the Company completing an increase in its authorized capital such that a sufficient number of Common shares is available for issuance. However, if the Company does not increase its capitalization within 90 days from the date of the Note, interest will begin to accrue at the rate of 10% per annum.  On December 28, 2015, the Company acquired from Advanomics Corporation (a related party) the worldwide issued and pending patents under PCT/FR2007/000697 and PCT/CA2014/000029 (the “Patents”) for the anticancer compound, Adva-27a, which include all worldwide rights to this intellectual property in exchange for a note payable for $12,822,499, with interest accruing at 2% per year beginning January 1, 2016 and quarterly payments of $70,000 plus interest commencing the end of March 2016 and continuing until December 2020 when the entire principal balance and all accrued interest will be due. The note is collateralized by the Patents. Pursuant to an amendment agreement, effective December 28, 2015, this note was cancelled and replaced with a new convertible note having a face value of $624,875, comprised of $462,870 in principal amount which is the seller’s (Advanomics Corporation, a related party) book value of the Patents, plus a $162,005 amount as an adjustment for the currency exchange difference, which was expensed immediately. This new, interest-free Note is automatically convertible into a fixed number of 240,336,451 shares of $0.001 par value Common Stock upon the Company completing an increase in its authorized capital such that a sufficient number of Common shares is available for issuance.

Of these, 17,611,235 shares having a market value of $377,814 have been issued reducing debt by $121,036 and interest payable by $3,120 and generating a loss on conversion of $253,658 for the period ended March 31, 2016. The Company issued 7,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value Common Stock for $105,000 Canadian (approximately $79,128 US). For services to be rendered, the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value Common Stock having a market value of $100,000 or $0.01 per share, to an unaffiliated company that is assisting the Company in the development of manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution contracts for various generic pharmaceuticals and biomedical products in Canada. These services are for a two year period and will be expensed ratably over a 24 month period commencing April 1, 2016.  Note 7 – Issuance of Series “B” Preferred Stock  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company authorized 500,000 shares of $0.10 par value Series “B” Preferred Stock.

All 500,000 shares of Series “B” Preferred Shares were issued to the CEO of the Company in exchange for services valued at $50,000. Note 8 – Earnings (Loss) Per Share  Earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding during the period. The Company has adopted ASC 260 (formerly SFAS128), “Earnings per Share”. Other than the shares to be issued for the purchased patents as specified under Note 5 above, the Company has no potentially dilutive instruments outstanding.  Note 9 – Financial Statements  For a complete set of footnotes, reference is made to the Company’s Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the audited financial statements included therein.   Note 10 – Income Taxes   Certain members of the Company’s management, including Dr. Steve N. Slilaty, our President, CEO and a Director and Camille Sebaaly, our CFO, Secretary and a Director, hold similar positions with Advanomics Corporation, the seller of the Adva-27a patents recently acquired by the Company (See Note 5 above).   The Company’s principal place of business is located at 469 Jean-Talon West, 3rd Floor, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, H3N 1R4. This is also the location of Advanomics, who continues to provide this space to the Company on a rent free basis as of the date of this Report. Dr. Steve N. Slilaty, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and a Director, is an Officer, Director and principal shareholder of Advanomics.   Note 12 – Subsequent Events In April 2016, the Directors of the Company were issued an aggregate of 36,000,000 shares of the Company’s $0.001 par value Common Stock (12,000,000 shares per Director) in consideration for services rendered through December 31, 2015 valued at $36,000. Our principal place of business is located at 469 Jean-Talon West, 3rd Floor, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3N 1R4. Our phone number is (514) 764-9698 and our website address is www.sunshinebiopharma.com.   We have not been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.  Comparison of Results of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 (excerpt) General and administrative expenses during the three month period ended March 31, 2016 were $69,682, compared to general and administrative expense of $124,825 incurred during the three month period ended March 31, 2015, a decrease of $55,143. This decrease is primarily attributable to the elimination of the $50,000 license fee we incurred during 2015 that we did not incur in the three months ended March 31, 2016 because we acquired the patent rights which were the subject of the license fee.  As a result, we incurred a net loss of $305,294 ($0.00 per share) for the three month period ended March 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $294,367 ($0.00 per share) during the three month period ended March 31, 2015.  Acquisition of Patents (excerpt)  ...we executed the aforesaid amendments to the original Patent Purchase Agreements which provided for (i) reduction of the purchase price of the Patents from $17,142,499 to $618,810, the Advanomics book value of the Patents, (ii) elimination of all cash payments obligations, and (iii) automatic convertibility of the new promissory notes for the new purchase price into an aggregate of 321,305,415 shares of Common Stock upon our increasing our authorized capital such that this number of Common Shares can be issued.  GMP Manufacturing (excerpt) In June 2015 we received a sample of the scale-up manufacturing process for evaluation and confirmation of adherence to specifications. Based upon our laboratory analyses, the sample meets all of the required chemical, physical and biological specifications. The amount of material (the “Yield”) generated by this pilot run was found to be significantly lower than anticipated and we are currently working towards finding possible solutions to increase the Yield. If the timetable for generating the 2-kilogram quantity is met, of which there can be no assurance, and subject to receipt of the necessary financing, also for which no assurances can be provided, we expect to move into Phase I of our clinical trials in mid to late 2017.  Pursuant to the terms of the Lonza Agreement, Lonza will manufacture our drug in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) in compliance with the regulations applicable in the U.S., Canada, Europe and other countries around the world relating to the manufacturing of medicinal products for human use. Lonza will build a master drug file for our Adva-27a drug and will have it ready for filing with regulatory authorities as may be required to secure ultimate drug approval. The Lonza Agreement provides for us to maintain one representative of our Company at their facility during the manufacturing process. Quality assurance and control is the responsibility of both Lonza and us during the process. http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1402328/000135448816007274/sbfm_10q.htm  http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1402328/000135448816006700/sbfm_10k.htm   =================================   January 29, 2014 S-4 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1402328/000135448814000422/sbfm_s4.htm  followed again by another withdrawel https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1402328/000135448814002116/sbfm_rw.htm  RCMP Canada. http://www.rcmp.gc.ca/en http://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/reportincident-signalerincident/index-eng.htm  SEC Complaint process https://denebleo.sec.gov/TCRExternal/index.xhtml ==================================================================           http://sunshinebiopharma.com/investor/press-releases/        Sunshine Biopharma Media Contacts: Renmark Financial Communications Inc.

Description:

FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to the field of transcriptome analysis and particularly to identification of RNA transcripts generated from DNA obtained from a population of cells. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe central dogma of molecular biology defined a general pathway where expression of genetic information stored in DNA is transcribed into transient mRNA and decoded on ribosomes with the help of adapter tRNA to produce proteins, which in turn perform all cell functions. According to this view, RNA plays an accessory role. In view of this, scientists have been collecting DNA sequence information from different organisms for decades. The highlight of this quest has undoubtedly been the joint international effort of the Human Genome Project to sequence, identify and determine the structure, regulation and function of the estimated 40,000 genes and their products. Therefore, once the human genome sequence was decoded, the field of proteomics, which is the study of all proteins within a cell, has recently gained enormous attention as the tool for advancing our understanding of the molecular basis of life and disease. However, over 20 years ago, the discovery of the catalytic properties of the RNA subunit of ribonuclease P and the self-splicing activity of group I introns (Stark et al., 1978) suggested that the functions of RNA go beyond a passive role in the expression of protein-coding genes. In this regard, genomic analysis shows that when the complexity of an organism increases, the protein-coding contribution of its genome decreases (Szymanski & Barciszewski, 2002). It is estimated that 98 % of the transcriptional output of eukaryotic genomes is RNA that does not encode proteins (Mattick, 2001), including introns and transcripts from non-protein coding genes, with the latter accosting for 50-75% of all transcription in higher eukaryotes (Mattick & Gagen, 2001). Therefore, in recent years, the importance of these non coding RNAs (ncRNA) that do not encode proteins but have cellular functions on their own or in complex with proteins, has begun to be addressed. To date, a functional classification of these ncRNA includes two general categories: housekeeping ncRNAs and regulatory ncRNAs. Examples of housekeeping ncRNAs include: transfer RNA (tRNA); ribosomal RNA (rRNA); small nuclear RNA (snRNA), including spliceosomal RNAs implicated in pre-mRNA splicing; small nucleolar (snoRNA), some involved in rRNA processing but most in rRNA modification (Elceiri, 1999). Some housekeeping genes are transcribed from their own promoter and terminator signals by RNA polymerase II (i.e. U3, U8, U13) or by RNA polymerase III (i.e. RNAse P and MRP RNAs), but the large majority are excised from introns of pre-mRNA. Almost all fall into 2 families: the "C/D box" which uses base complementarity to guide site-specific rRNA 2'-O-ribose methylations (Kiss-Laszlo et al., 1996; Nicoloso et al., 1996; Tycowski et al., 1996) and the "H/ACA" which guides rRNA pseudouridylations (Ganot et al., 1997; Ni et al., 1997). Catalytic function seems to be provided by enzymes associated to the snoRNAs and the specificity of the target base on the rRNA is provided by base complementarity to the snoRNA (Lafontaine & Tollervey, 1998; Wenstein & Steitz, 1999). Additional examples of housekeeping ncRNA include RNAse P RNA, which is involved in maturation of 5' ends of pre-tRNA; telomerase RNA, implicated in telomeric DNA synthesis; 4.5S RNA in bacteria, and its eukaryotic counterpart, 7SL RNA, which are mediators of protein export; mRNA, involved in trans-translation; and RNAse MRP, which functions in mitochondrial RNA processing.
Regulatory ncRNAs are mainly synthesized by RNA polymerase II and are polyadenylated and spliced (Erdmann et al., 2001). They may be divided into 2 groups, the transcriptional regulators and the post-transcriptional regulators. Transcriptional regulators are involved in chromatin remodeling associated with X-chromosome inactivation, dosage compensation in eukaryotes (i.e. roX, Xist/Tsix) and in regulation of expression of imprinted genes (i.e. HI9, IPW, LIT I).
Post-transcriptional regulators are implicated in repression or stimulation of translation of regulated mRNAs in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells via antisense RNA-RNA interaction (i.e. DsrA, micF, lin-4, let-7, microRNAs, HFE, LjPLP-IV), modulation of protein function via RNA-protein interactions (i.e. 6S RNA, oxy S, SRA) and regulation of RNA and protein distribution (i.e. Xlsirt, hsr-ω). As the number of known regulatory ncRNA continued to increase, they have been grouped in families like small non-coding RNAs (sncRNA), micro RNAs (miRNA), (a putative translational repression regulatory gene family), small temporal RNAs (stRNA, i.e. lin-4 and let-7 in C. elegans) and small interfering RNAs (siRNA), (double-stranded RNA cleaved into 21-25 nt that degrades homologous mRNA and leads to a loss-of-function phenotype by antisense complementarity(Elbashir et al., 2001; Hunter, 2000; Carthew, 2001; Sharp, 2001; Vance & Vaucheret, 2001). Gene identification is mainly based on 3 methods: cDNA cloning and expressed sequence tags (EST) sequencing of polyadenylated mRNAs (Liang et al., 2000; Ewing & Green, 2000), identification of conserved coding exons by comparative genome analysis (Roest Crouillis et al., 2000), and computational gene prediction (International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2001; Venter et al., 2001). However, these methods work best for large, highly expressed, evolutionary conserved protein-coding genes, and thus certainly underestimate the number of other genes, including small mRNA, since they are discarded by size from the RNA fraction used for preparing ESTs or cDNA, and they do not work for ncRNA, which produce transcripts that function directly as structural, catalytic or regulatory RNAs (Eddy, 1999, 2001; Erdmann et al., 2001a, b). Additionally, many RNA identification techniques rely on polyadenylation, a feature many biologically important RNAs lack. Early detection of ncRNAs was limited to biochemically abundant species and by chance. For example, some ncRNA are associated with ribonucleoproteins, and were discovered when these proteins were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies, i.e. U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNA (Lemer & Steitz, 1981; Yu et al., 1999; Burge et al., 1999). Others were isolated biochemically, sometimes deliberately, like snoRNA from nucleoli (Elcieri, 1999), others by chance, as when fractions of ribonucelase P were found to contain essential RNAs (Stark et al., 1978) or when the signal recognition "protein" was in fact found to contain a 7S RNA and was subsequently called "signal recognition particle" (Lewin, 1982; Walter & Blobel, 1982). An example of serendipitous identification of a ncRNA gene by genetics is that of lin-4 regulatory RNA in C. elegans, identified in a screen for mutations that affect the timing and sequence of postembryonic development (Horvitz & Sulston, 1980). Subsequently, another ncRNA with similar function was discovered, the small let-7 RNA, also thought to be a post-transcriptional negative regulator (Reinhart et al., 2000). Later on, more systematic approaches were pursued and a pioneer study found a few new RNA genes and ORFs in the yeast by doing Northern blots probed for expression transcripts in very large intergenic regions and by searching for consensus sequences of RNA polymerase III promoters (Olivas et al., 1997). Recent studies have carried out ncRNA gene identification screens along 3 main lines. The first type of screen for ncRNA gene identification is with the use of specially designed cDNA cloning screens for very small RNAs. To identify miRNA, for example, Lau et al. (2001) produced and sequenced a C. elegans cDNA library enriched for tiny RNA with 5'-monophosphate and 3'-hydroxyl termini. Lee and Ambros (2001) used a size-selected C. elegans cDNA library in addition to a computational approach to look for conserved sequences that can be folded into a stem loop similar to the lin-4 and let-7 precursors and Lagos-Quintana et al. (2001) used size-selected cDNA libraries in humans and Drosophila. The second type of screen for ncRNA gene identification is by the use of a general ncRNA gene-finding approach using computational comparative genomics. For example, Argaman et al. (2001) computationally analyzed intergenic regions in E. coli to identify loci that have promoter consensus sequences recognized by the major RNA polymerase σ70 factor within a 50-400 nucleotide (nt) distance of a terminator and which are significantly conserved in other bacterial genomes. In other approaches, Wassarman et al. (2001) looked for intergenic regions conserved in different genomes and their separation from the ORFs, the presence of putative promoter and terminator signals and significant RNA expression detected on whole genome high-density oligo-probes arrays, while Rivas et al. (2001) developed an algorithm to identify regions that conserve some particular type of RNA structure. The third type of screen for ncRNA gene identification is by cDNA cloning and sequencing tailored to find new ncRNAs. In this approach, termed Experimental Rnomics, total RNA was isolated and size selected (i.e. 50-500) on denaturing PAGE, eluted and reverse transcribed for cDNA by tailing with CTP using polyA-polymerase to generate specialized cDNA libraries (Tang et al., 2002; Huttenhofer et al., 2001). Following amplification by PCR, they were spotted in high-density arrays of filters hybridized with radiolabeled oligonucleotides directed against the most abundant known ncRNA. The clones exhibiting the lowest hybridization scores were sequenced and those that did not map to any previously annotated genes were considered as potential ncRNA candidates. To analyze its expression, Northern blots were done using oligonucleotides complementary to the respective RNA sequence. Although these methods have been useful in identifying new ncRNA, they also have important limitations. For example, computational identification of ncRNA is hampered by a lack of ORFs to aid in detection. Further, relying only on known conserved sequence/structural motifs will unlikely yield the complete set of ncRNA within a given organism. Searches limited to intergenic regions may be limited too because a number of hypothetical ORFs might not actually encode a protein but a ncRNA. In addition, ncRNA encoded by antisense transcripts located within known protein genes or ncRNA overlapping an ORF also would be missed when computer searches are limited to intergenic regions. Those based on the consensus sequence of major factors like σ70, will miss other factors like stress-specific transcription factors and/or alternative σ factors. Even though experimental RNomics may be able to overcome some of the problems faced by computational analysis, this approach also contains limitations of its own, since screens only comprise RNAs ranging from 50-500 nt. However, sizes ofncRNA range from very large i.e. 17 kb for Xist (Brown et al., 1992) to extremely small (21-23 nt) (Ambros, 2001) and many would be missed by this method. In addition, the size of the ncRNAs determined by Northern blot analysis were in many instances larger compared to the sizes of the cDNA, either due to the strategy used to construct the libraries, which interferes with cloning at the 5'-ends of the novel ncRNAs or to the fact that RNA structure or modification impeded a complete conversion of the ncRNA into cDNA. Therefore, there is a need for a new method to identify RNAs missed in such conventional genetic screens, including ncRNA and small mRNA. Further, to provide a more realistic picture of RNA transcripts generated in vivo, there is need for developing a method which uses wild type RNA polymerases from the cell population/tissue in which RNA transcript generation is to be analyzed. Sasaki et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, Vol. 95, pp. 3455-3460, March 1998) describe a method for DNA sequencing using RNA polymerase. Kwon et al. (Nucleic Acids Research, 2001, Vol. 29, No. 3 e11) describe DNA sequencing and genotyping by transcriptional synthesis of chain-terminated RNA ladders and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Gardner (J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 257, No. 7, pp. 3896-3904, 1982) describes initiation, pausing, and termination of transcription in the threonine operon regulatory region of Escherichia coli. The invention provides a method for direct identification of RNA transcripts generated from a DNA sample obtained from a eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell population, wherein the DNA sample comprises a genomic library or a portion of a genomic library, comprising the steps of: a) preparing DNA fragments from the DNA sample such that each fragment has only one RNA polymerase promoter and wherein each RNA polymerase promoter is endogenous to the genome of the cell population; b) providing a wild type RNA polymerase, wherein the RNA polymerase is endogenous to the cell population; c) transcribing the DNA fragments with the wild type RNA polymerase in the presence of ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) and transcription terminating nucleotides to obtain transcription termination products; d) separating the transcription termination products; and e) determining the sequence of the RNA transcripts from the separated transcription termination products. The invention also provides a method for direct identification of RNA transcripts generated from a DNA sample prepared from a eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell population, wherein the DNA sample comprises a genomic library or a portion of a genomic library, comprising the steps of: a) preparing DNA fragments from the DNA sample such that each fragment has only one RNA polymerase promoter and wherein each RNA polymerase promoter is endogenous to the genome of the cell population; b) transcribing the DNA fragments using a wild type RNA polymerase endogenous to the cell population to obtain RNA transcripts; and c) determining the sequence of the RNA transcripts. The invention also provides a method for detecting differences in the sequence of RNA transcripts generated from DNA samples prepared from two different cell populations comprising the steps of: a) providing a first DNA sample from a first population of prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells and a second DNA sample from a second population of prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells; b) preparing DNA fragments from the first and second DNA samples to obtain a first and second set of DNA fragments such that each fragment of the first set of fragments has only one RNA polymerase promoter, wherein each RNA polymerase promoter is endogenous to the genome of the first cell population; and each fragment of the second set of fragments has only one RNA polymerase promoter, wherein each RNA polymerase promoter is endogenous to the genome of the second cell population; c) transcribing the first and second set of DNA fragments using a wild type RNA polymerase, to obtain a first and second set of RNA transcripts; d) determining the sequence of the first and second set of RNA transcripts; and e) comparing the sequence of the first and second set of RNA transcripts to detect differences between the first and second set of RNA transcripts. This application describes a method for identifying RNA transcripts generated from DNA obtained from a cell population. The method comprises the steps of obtaining a DNA sample from a cell population, preparing segments of DNA such that each segment has only 1 promoter, allowing transcription to occur, and identifying and sequencing the resulting RNA transcripts. The DNA sample may be a genomic library or a portion of a genomic library. Because each segment of DNA has an endogenous promoter, the identification of transcripts that are driven by the respective promoters provides identification of potential RNA transcripts that are expected to be generated in vivo, particularly if a wild type RNA polymerase also endogenous to the source of the cell population is used. In one embodiment, the present method can be used identify, catalog and/or map RNA transcripts that can be generated in a cell population. This analysis can be carried out to obtain development related changes in RNA transcript population in an organism as well as changes due to onset of diseased conditions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThis invention provides a method for indirect transcriptome analysis in a cell population. Thus a method is provided for identifying RNA transcripts generated from DNA obtained from a cell population. DNA fragments are generated such that each fragment contains only one RNA polymerase promoter. Because each fragment of DNA has an endogenous promoter, the identification of transcripts that are driven by the promoter provides identification of possible RNA transcripts that are expected to be generated in vivo, particularly if a wild type RNA polymerase also endogenous to the source of the cell population is used. In one embodiment, the method enables the determination of the sequence of RNA transcripts not normally detected by conventional RNA detection means, such as by cDNA generation. This determination is achieved because the method allows identification of all types of RNA transcripts that can be generated in vivo, rather than being limited to amplified transcripts with particular characteristics, such as polyadenylated tails typically required for generation of cDNA libraries. In another embodiment, the method of the invention enables the determination of the sequence of a complete set of possible RNAs transcribed in an organism, otherwise known as the transcriptome. For the purposes of the specification and claims herein, a "wild type RNA polymerase" or "wild type polymerase" means an RNA polymerase that has not been genetically engineered, meaning the amino acid sequence of the polymerase has not been experimentally altered. RNA polymerases used in the method of this invention may be any wild type RNA polymerases. Examples of suitable RNA polymerases are those found in prokaryotes such as E. coli, eukaryotic microbes such as Saccharomyces cerivisiae, and mammals. Further, the wild type polymerase may be provided in the form of a purified polymerase, a partially purified polymerase or in a transcriptionally active cell extract (TACE). Purified RNA polymerases are available commercially. For example, E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme can be purchased from Epicentre® (Madison, WI, USA). Some preparations of TACE are commercially available. For example, TACE prepared from rabbit reticulocytes can be purchased from Promega® (Madison, WI), Novagen® (Madison, WI) or Ambion® (Austin, TX). TACE prepared from human HeLa cells can be purchased from Promega® (Madison, WI). Desired TACE preparations not commercially available can be prepared using previously described methods (e.g. Manley et al., 1993; Sambrook et al., 2001; Blow, 1993; Veenstra et al., 1999). DNA samples for use in the method of the invention can be obtained from any population of prokaryotic cells or any population of cells obtained from any organism and prepared by a variety of methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, DNA samples representing the entire genome or portions of the genome of an organism can be obtained by construction of shotgun libraries (Andersson et al., 1996), bacteriophage libraries, bacterial or yeast artificial chromosomes, and other suitable DNA vectors (See generally, Sambrook et al., 2001). Further, genomic libraries from various organisms are available commercially such as from Clontech®. In a preferred embodiment, the DNA sample is a genomic library or a portion of a genomic library divided into samples such that each sample comprises only one RNA polymerase promoter. According to the method of the invention, once a complete or partial genomic DNA library or other suitable DNA sample, such as a polymerase chain reaction amplification product, is obtained it is subjected to transcription reactions or transcription sequencing reactions using a wild type RNA polymerase obtained from the same type of organism. For example, if the DNA sample was obtained from a population of cells from a eukaryote, a wild type eukaryotic RNA polymerase may be used so long as the polymerase is able to recognize and drive transcription from a promoter endogenous to the population of cells from which the DNA is obtained. In another embodiment, the wild type polymerase is obtained from an organism of the same species from which the DNA sample is obtained. For example, if the DNA sample is obtained from a population ofE. coli cells, the wild type RNA polymerase used would also be obtained from E. coli. In another embodiment, the wild type polymerase is obtained from the same population of cells from which the DNA sample is obtained. For example, if the DNA sample is obtained from a population of cells from an individual human, such as a tissue sample, the wild type polymerase is also obtained from a sample of that tissue. Further, the method of the invention can be used to detect alterations in genomic DNA that result in the expression of different RNA transcripts between different populations of cells. For example, a wild type RNA polymerase obtained from an individual could be used to transcribe DNA from two different populations of cells (i.e., cancerous tissue compared to normal). The method disclosed herein would identify transcripts having different sequences when obtained from the cancerous, rather than normal cells due to alterations in the DNA that is transcribed. Determination of the sequence of the RNA transcripts can be achieved in a variety of ways. In one embodiment, labeled RNA transcripts are produced using the method of the invention for use in hybridization assays. For example, commercially available radiolabeled ribonucleotides can be used in a transcription reaction to label the RNA transcript. A typical example of a radiolabeled ribonucleotide so used is α-32P-UTP. Alternatively, the transcripts can be labeled with commercially available fluorescently labeled nucleotides, such as those available from Promega®, using methods known to those skilled in the art. The labeled transcripts can be hybridized to commercially available chips or DNA microarrays wherein the genome or a portion of the genome of the organism is represented on the chip of the array. Such DNA microarrays are available from, for example, Affymetrix, Inc. When hybridization between the labeled transcript and a location on the chip is detected, the sequence of the RNA can be determined by comparison with the sequence of the DNA at that location of the chip, wherein the RNA sequence is determined from the complementary with that DNA sequence. Similarly, the labeled transcripts can be used in hybridization assays to commercially available genomic library filters, wherein the location of hybridization is correlated with the sequence of DNA at the hybridization location and the sequence of the RNA transcript is determined from its complementarity with the DNA to which is has hybridized. In another embodiment, a population of RNA transcripts produced from a DNA sample obtained from an organism can be identified using RNA sequencing reactions. Performing RNA sequencing on a DNA sample from a promoter endogenous to the organism from which the DNA sample is taken using a wild type polymerase is disclosed herein for the first time. Accordingly, this embodiment differs from that of U.S. Patent No. 6,627,399 which discloses the use ofpolyamines to accelerate RNA polymerase activity, but does not demonstrate RNA sequencing. The synthesis of RNA transcription termination products for use in determining the sequence of an RNA transcript can be achieved by using ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates (NTPs) such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), guanosine triphosphate (GTP), cytosine triphosphate (CTP) and uracil triphosphate (UTP)) in combination with terminator nucleotides (3'-deoxynucleoside triphosphates (3'-dNTP's)) in a chain-terminating technique similar to that used in standard dideoxy DNA sequencing reactions. The term "3'-dNTP" collectively refers to 3'-dATP, 3'-dGTP, 3'-dCTP and 3'-dUTP. The 3'-dNTPs are useful in the method of the invention because incorporation of a 3'-deoxyribose at the 3' end of an elongating transcription product results in termination of transcription. Termination occurs because the formation of a subsequent phosphodiester bond at the 3' position is precluded. As a result, a series of truncated chains are generated that are each terminated by the 3'-dNTP at each of the four possible nucleotide positions occupied by the corresponding base in the DNA sample. Separation of the terminated products according to their lengths (molecular weight) indicates the positions at which the base occurs in the DNA sample acting as the transcription template. Once obtained, the transcription termination products are separated according to their relative molecular weights and the RNA transcript is identified by determining its sequence from the separated products. The separation of transcription termination products can be performed by any method which enables the separation of molecules having different molecular weights. Examples of such methods include gel electrophoresis and high pressure liquid chromatography. Detection of the separated RNA transcription termination products can be facilitated by using labeled 5'-ribonucleoside NTPs. The label can be fluorescent or radioactive. Electrophorectically separated RNA transcription termination products having incorporated label can be visualized by a variety of methods, such as by exposure to film or analysis by phosphorimager when the label is radioactive. When the label is fluorescent, the termination products can be detected using automated polynucleotide sequencers, such as an ABI 377. Once the sequence of the RNA is determined, the sequence can be used to locate the region of DNA that serves as the transcription template for the RNA transcript, as well as for RNA polymerase promoter sequences. For example, the sequence of the RNA transcript can be used to search through a database comprising the genomic sequence of the organism from which the DNA sample was obtained. Identification of a complementary location in the DNA determines the location of the coding region in the DNA which corresponds to the RNA transcript. Further, DNA sequences upstream of the transcriptional start site can be analyzed for homology with known promoter sequences or further analyzed to identify previously unknown promoters using standard molecular biology techniques. The method of the present invention is demonstrated by the following Examples which are not meant to be limiting in any way. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1This Example demonstrates the identification of an RNA transcript using commercially available, genetically engineered bacteriophage polymerases. pTS1 transcription sequencing by T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (materials included with CUGA sequencing kit purchased from Nippon Genetech®, Toyama, Japan) was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 0.05 to 0.15 pmol of pTS1 DNA were incubated in a mixture containing MnCl2, T3 or T7 enzyme solution, fluorescent-labeled nucleotide triphosphate (NTP)/terminator mixture and reaction buffer. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 1 h, after which the labeled RNA was separated from the unbound material by adding 25 µl of 0.1M EDTA and 95% ethanol for 15 min at room temperature. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the RNA-containing pellet, washed with 70% ethanol. After drying the pellet 15-25 µl of TSR buffer was added and the labeled RNA sequenced using an ABI PRISM® 310 Genetic Analyzer for which matrix standards were set-up according to manufacturer's instructions using the DT POP6 program from Dye terminator FS-kit. Briefly, each standard was reconstituted in 20 µl of TSR. A 47 x 50 cm capillary was used for sequencing on the ABI PRISM® 310 analyzer. The sequencing results are presented in Figure 1 which shows the predicted and experimental DNA sequence of pTS1 (SEQ ID NO:1) transcribed by T3 polymerase. The top line of nucleotides shows the predicted DNA sequence. The bottom line indicates errors found in the experimentally obtained sequence, where shaded nucleotides represent mismatches, nucleotides in italics indicate insertions and nucleotides in bold designate deletions. As can be seen, the experimental sequence is remarkably similar to the expected sequence, with approximately 3% errors, including the insertions, deletions or mismatches. The sequence was accurate up to approximately 450 nucleotides, after which the number of errors increased. A similar result was obtained when transcription controlled by T7 polymerase was tested and is provided in Figure 2 which has mismatches, insertions and deletions designated as in Figure 1. The experimental sequence for T7 sequencing (SEQ ID NO:2) was 96 % accurate with respect to the sequence predicted for a nucleotide chain length of about 580. In both cases, the majority of the errors were mismatch of C to T. EXAMPLE 2This Example demonstrates that E. coli RNA polymerase can be used to transcribe an E. coli gene from an E. coli promoter in vitro in the presence and absence of terminating nucleotides. β-lactamase or lacZ transcription controlled by E. coli RNA polymerase was performed as follows. Plasmid pUC19, which contains both the β-lactamase and the β-galactosidase (lacZ) genes, was linearized with either HindIII (for β-lactamase RNA expression) or SspI (for β-galactosidase RNA expression). Transcription was done essentially as described above in Example 1, with slight modifications as follows: 4 to 8 units of E. coli RNA polymerase were used; incubation times ranging from 1 to 16 hours were used; and 5 x E. coli RNA polymerase buffer containing 0.2 M Tris-HCl, 0.75 M KCl, 50 mM MgCl2 and 0.05 % Triton X-100 with or without 10 mM DTT was utilized. The results of the transcription reactions are depicted in Figure 3. The figure is a photographic representation of an electrophoretic separation of transcription products through an agarose gel. The lanes show transcription and control reaction using linearized pUC19 digested for transcription of β-galactosidase (lanes 1 and 2) or β-lactamase (lanes 3, 5 and 6), which were incubated in the presence (lanes 2, 3 and 5) or the absence (lanes 1 and 6) of 4 units of E. coli RNA polymerase. These incubations were performed in either the presence (lanes 2, 3, 5 and 6) or the absence (lane 1) of NTP/ terminator mixture for 5 hs at 37°C. In lane 4, pTS1 DNA was incubated in the presence of T7 enzyme and NTP/terminator mixture. Following ethanol precipitation (lanes 4 and 5), reaction products were run on an agarose gel. The arrow marks the RNA transcription products. As shown in this figure, transcription products can be detected for both β-lactamase and β-galactosidase on agarose gels, which is absent when no enzyme is included, thus demonstrating that E. coli polymerase can be used to transcribe a gene endogenous to E. coli under the control of an E. coli promoter. EXAMPLE 3This Example demonstrates that the method of the invention can be used to identify an RNA transcript using a wild type polymerase to perform a transcription sequencing reaction on a DNA sample that contains an RNA promoter and gene endogenous to the organism from which the wild type polymerase is obtained. pUC19 DNA (New England Biolabs) was linearized using HindIII (New England Biolabs) to inactivate the β-galactosidase promoter in order to drive RNA transcription only from β-lactamase promoter. E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme was purchased from Epicentre. This preparation is 100% saturated with sigma subunit (σ70) and thus initiates RNA synthesis specifically at promoter sequences on native bacterial or bacteriophage DNA. All four 3'-deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates were obtained from Trilink Biotechnology (San Diego, CA.). [α-32P]UTP of specific activity 3000Ci/mmol was purchased from Perkin Elmer. Unlabeled ribonucleotide triphosphates were obtained from Epicentre. Transcription reactions were carried out in 50µl reaction volume. A master mix for 5 reactions was prepared containing 50µl of E. coli RNA polymerase buffer (0.2M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.75M KCl, 50mM MgCl2, 0.05% Triton); 5µg of template DNA, 10mM DDT, 4mM Spermidine (Sigma), 10µg/ml BSA (Sigma), 3mM MnCl2 (Sigma), 400µM rNTPs (Epicentre). Volume was adjusted to 215µl with DEPC water. The solution was mixed gently by micropipette with out producing bubbles, then 100µCi of [α-32P] UTP was added and mixed well. 45µl of this mix was dispensed into each of four Eppendorf tubes. For nucleotide sequence analysis, the reaction mixtures were then supplemented with 400µM 3'-dATP or 3'-dGTP or 3'-dCTP or 3'-dUTP, prior to the addition of 3 units of E. coli RNA polymerase. The reactions were incubated at 37°C in a dry incubator for 5 hours and terminated by adding 10µl of 200µM EDTA containing 1mg/ml Yeast tRNA (Sigma) as a carrier. Transcripts were precipitated from the reaction mixture by the addition of 200µl of ice-cold 4M acetic acid followed by incubation for 10 minutes at 0°C and centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 15 minutes at 4°C. The pellets were washed with 500µl ice cold 2M acetic acid, centrifuged for 3 minutes, washed with 500µl of 70% ethanol, centrifuged for 3 minutes, and dried on the bench top. The RNA in each tube was resuspended in 6µl of Formamide Loading Dye containing (78% deionized formamide, 10mM EDTA pH 8, 0.1% Xylene Cyanol, 0.05% Bromophenol Blue in 1 X TBE buffer). The samples were stored at -20°C overnight. Electrophoresis was performed in an International Biotechnologies Inc. sequencing apparatus (IBI STS-45i). The unit has a gel dimension of 43cm X 36cm and a 0.4mm thick gel was poured with a shark smooth comb. All solutions were made with DEPC treated water. The polyacrylamide gel was prepared using a ratio of acrylamide:bisacrylamide of 29:1 and was cast in 7M urea, 89mM Tris-borate, and 20mM EDTA (pH 8.0) and was run in 89mM Tris-borate and 20mM EDTA (pH 8.0). The upper and lower chambers of the electrophoresis apparatus contained approximately 530 ml of running buffer each. The buffer was not recirculated and the gel was not cooled. The gel was pre-run for 1 hour at 50 mA and the temperature was monitored by gel temperature indicator (Rose Scientific Ltd.). Immediately before loading the gel, samples were heated to 95°C in a block heater for 3 minutes then chilled on ice. Four micro liters of each sample were applied to the gel and electrophoresis was continued at 50mA with a temperature reaching up to 50°C and stopped when the bromophenol blue dye front was one inch from the bottom of the gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed with 5% acetic acid (vol/vol) and 5% methanol (vol/vol), transferred to a 3MM Whatmann paper, covered with a Saran Wrap and exposed to a Kodak X-Omat film with a Corex Lighting-Plus intensifying screen from Du Pont at -80°C for 19hrs. To verify product formation, a sample was run in agarose gel (results not shown) and detected by ethidium bromide. Transcription products were observed for E. coli RNA polymerase under standard transcription conditions (no chain terminators included). For the chain termination reactions using 3'deoxy-rNTPs, we determined that an effective ratio of rNTPs : 3'deoxy-rNTPs is 1:1 for all four rNTPs. At this ratio, termination was an infrequent event that generated sequencing ladders. As shown in Figure 4, RNA transcript sequences obtained using E. coli RNA polymerase driving transcription from the E. Coli β-lactamase promoter on plasmid pUC19 were produced using these reaction conditions. The nucleotide sequence that was determined (SEQ ID NO:3) is in good agreement with the wild-type β-lactamase gene except for a gap of four nucleotides (Fig. 4). Thus, this Example demonstrates that the method of the invention can be used to identify an RNA transcript using a wild type polymerase to perform a transcription sequencing reaction on a DNA sample that contains an E. coli promoter driving expression of an E. coli gene.

Advanomics Corporation to acquire Garmen Laboratories
27-Aug-2013
Finance | North America 

Garmen will manufacture 1kg of Adva-27a anticancer drug candidate for Sunshine Biopharma

Advanomics Corporation, a subsidiary of Sunshine Biopharma, a Canadian pharmaceutical company focused on the development of cancer drugs for the treatment of various forms of cancer, is to acquire GMP laboratory Garmen Laboratories for an undisclosed sum.
Garmen, a privately held Canadian firm located in Montreal, employs 45 people and provides pharmaceutical manufacturing and testing services to a broad range of industrial, institutional and governmental agencies. With nearly 35 years of industry experience, the firm offers solutions to detect, identify and quantify trace-level chemical components in the nutraceutical, food and pharmaceutical industries.
Garmen will also manufacture 1kg of Adva-27a, Sunshine Biopharma's flagship anticancer drug candidate in development for multidrug resistant cancers at its good manufacturing practices (GMP) lab in Montreal.
Advanomics said the material will be used to complete the remaining studies required to file an Investigational New Drug Application with the US FDA and conduct the breast cancer Phase I clinical trial of Adva-27a at McGill University's Jewish General Hospital in Montreal.
The firm recently received $1.45m in research grants from the NSERC, NanoQuebec and Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), to advance the development of Adva-27a.

'We are extremely pleased with the acquisition of Garmen Laboratories as it puts us in a prime position to continue to advance our novel cancer drug,' said Steve Slilaty, CEO of Sunshine Biopharma. 'We are excited that our methodical business plan in the development of Adva-27a is coming to fruition.'

Canadian contract manufacturing and testing firm Garmen Laboratories will be acquired by Cancer drug developer Advanomics Corp in a deal announced today.
 


 
The proposed takeover – financial terms of which were not disclosed – will also see Garmen’s 45-strong workforce produce a 1kg batch of an anticancer drug being developed by Advanomics’ subsidiary Sunshine Biopharma at its good manufacturing practices (GMP) lab in Montreal.Advanomics said that: “The material will be used to complete the remaining studies required to file an investigational new drug application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and conduct the Breast Cancer Phase I clinical trial of Adva-27a.”News of the deal follows two weeks after Advanomics and academic partner Ecole Polytechnique received a C$1.4m (US$510,000) grant from Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) to advance development of the drug.Plant with anticancer pedigreeAdva-27a is a novel derivative of the non-alkaloid toxin lignan podophyllotoxin, which is extracted from the roots and rhizomes of the Podophyllum species of herbaceous perennial plants. Podophyllotoxin has been used in topical treatments for genital warts caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) in products sold under the brand names Condylox and Wartec. The compound is also used in the production of the anticancer drug etoposide.According to a study conducted by Ecole Polytechnique
 the extract Adva-27a should potential as an treatment for drug resistant tumours when testing in In the multidrug-resistant cell lines, MCF-7/MDR (breast cancer) and H69AR (small-cell lung cancer).  


“Our studies have identified Adva-27a as a novel topoisomerase II inhibitor with superior cytotoxic activity against multidrug-resistant human cancer cells and more desirable pharmacokinetic properties than etoposide.” In addition to providing contract manufacturing services Garmen also carries out analytical testing work on behalf of government agencies, academic institutions and customer in the pharmaceutical, food and nutraceutical industries.
