There is a substantial risk of loss in managed futures, and there can be no guarantee that any managed futures program or the Equinox Frontier Funds will meet their intended objective; accordingly, an investment in the Equinox Frontier Funds may not be suitable for everyone. The Funds are highly speculative and their success depends upon the ability of Equinox Fund Management, LLC to allocate assets to multiple strategies and commodity trading advisors (“CTAs”). The Funds also rely on each of the CTAs chosen in meeting the investment objectives. An investment in the Funds involve a high degree of risk due to substantial price volatility in domestic and foreign markets for financial instruments, currencies, energy, metals, and commodities and the uncertainty as to the ability of the CTAs to profit in the markets traded.
Futures, forward, and options trading are speculative, volatile, and highly leveraged; select markets and instruments may be subject to liquidity restrictions from time to time.
An investor could lose a substantial portion, or even all, of his or her investment.
An investor’s annual tax liability may exceed cash distributions.
There is no secondary markets for the units and the transfer of units is restricted. If you redeem all or portion of your class 1 units before the end of 12 months following your purchase, you will be charged a redemption fee of up to 2% of the purchase prices of the units being redeemed.
The Funds face the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the OTC contracts.
The Equinox Frontier Funds are not mutual funds and are not subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds. This and other important information about the Funds are in the relevant Prospectuses which can be obtained by calling 1.877.837.0600 The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
Administration: For the Equinox Frontier Funds, Gemini Fund Services, LLC manages NAV administration and Gemini Fund Services, LLC manages Transfer Agency Administration.

PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. THERE IS RISK OF LOSS. YOU CAN LOSE MONEY IN A MANAGED FUTURES PROGRAM.
*For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a funds’ monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.
Morningstar Rating is for the I share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics.
