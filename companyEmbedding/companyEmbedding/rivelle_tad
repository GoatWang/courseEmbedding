 Biography




 




April 7, 2012


Tad Rivelle holds degrees in physics and applied math, and like many with similar training, he's found a home for his skills on Wall Street. Rivelle's specialty is bonds, which he studied first at Hotchkis and Wiley and Pimco, before co-founding MetWest, an institutional investment firm that was bought in 2009 by Los Angeles-based TCW. He now oversees more than $30 billion in mutual funds offered by TCW and MetWest, and manages the flagship MetWest Total Return Fund (ticker: MWTRX), a $19.5 billion portfolio with a stellar...

TCW’s Rivelle Sees Day of Reckoning as Corporate Leverage Soars
By John Gittelsohn

September 20, 2016, 3:32 PM EDT










                Credit issuance topped $1 trillion for five years in a row
            



                ‘We’ve lived this story before,’ Rivelle says in note
            



Corporate leverage, which has exceeded levels reached before the 2008 financial crisis, is a sign that investors should start preparing for the end of the credit cycle, according to TCW Group Inc.’s Tad Rivelle.“The credit-fuelled expansion inevitably comes to a bad end,” Rivelle, chief investment officer for fixed income at TCW, said in a note sent to investors Tuesday. “We’ve lived this story before.”Other fixed-income investors, such as Bill Gross and Jeffrey Gundlach, have warned that central bank policies are fueling asset bubbles, which will eventually burst, triggering financial market turmoil.








Corporate leverage in America soared to new heights this month as sales of company bonds passed $1 trillion for the fifth consecutive year. Total company debt is at a record 2.4 times collective earnings as of June, according to a Sept. 9 estimate from Morgan Stanley. The ratio fell to 1.7 in 2010 when the U.S. economy started recovering from the Great Recession.Rivelle, whose firm oversees $195 billion, blames central bankers for fueling asset bubbles, which are bound to collapse as leverage goes up faster than income available to service debt.“Our counsel remains as it has been: avoid those assets that will be broken in the coming de-leveraging while keeping a ‘steady as she goes’ attitude towards the future purchase of those assets that will merely bend when the flood come,” Rivelle wrote.Rivelle’s $80.5 billion Metropolitan West Total Return Bond Fund has gained an average 4.6 percent over the past five years, outperforming 92 percent of its Bloomberg peers. The fund is up 4.7 percent this year, outperforming only 34 percent of peers.

Trading Secrets: Here Be Dragons

Economics

July 12, 2016

Tad Rivelle





Capital markets are information engines. When functioning properly, they reflect what investors know – or think they know – about the future. Future expectations are for all to see, discounted in today’s financial prices. Obviously, this doesn’t mean that capital markets are always “right,” for the future comes as it will,
caring not a whit whether it was the one we ordered up or not.
For the first time in recorded history, financial interest rates have gone negative. To say this makes no sense is almost tautological. Nobody pays to have their Amazon delivery delayed or their Uber pickup deferred. Consumption now is always prioritized over consumption later, which is why interest rates have been positive for centuries. Is there some set of future expectations that could possibly justify negative yielding debt?

Government Bond Yields

As of 7/11/16; Source: Bloomberg
Were an investor to accept that negative yields actually reflect future expectations, then the sovereign debt market must be calling for a ‘30s style price deflation! Go long canned green peas and head for the hills! Yet, is there not a fly in the ointment of this analysis? Stocks hitting record highs obviously do not reflect deflation expectations. Nor do investment grade corporate bonds yielding 2 ¾%. The risk markets violently disagree with the sovereign debt markets. Yet, how can it be that government bond yields are pathologically low while risk assets are priced atrociously high?
The Occam’s razor answer is this: the ECB, the BOJ, and yes the Fed too have blocked the capital markets from expressing their “unbiased” future expectations. Rather than let the capital markets reveal investor expectations, the central banks have imposed
a pricing regime that reflects what the academics believe to be “better” outcomes.
This is scary. If negative rates are merely the latest in a long line of artifices the central banks have resorted to so as to make
the risk carry trade profitable, then look out below! For once the central banks let go of the till (or have it pulled from their hands),
this whole financially engineered dynamic goes careening into reverse.
Without active suppression by the central banks, the bond market will call off-sides on negative yields, and sovereign rates will surely “normalize” back to positive rates. But higher government rates will also force cap rates higher everywhere: in stocks,
in real-estate, and in the real world where businesses calculate a demanded return in exchange for a capital allocation.
In the mind of the central banker, the capital markets must be stopped dead in their tracks whenever they threaten a “tantrum.” But, in so doing, capital markets are prevented from telling us what true market clearing levels are. And, without good information, coordination loses its effectiveness, leading to low growth and soggy productivity. Low growth – the consequence of inefficient resource use – then becomes the recurring justification for still more central bank rate suppression. The paradigm is not one
of self-correction but of doubling down. Keep doubling down and rather than having a series of corrections, you might just end
up with a crash.
Monetary central planning has not led to the uncorking of the champagne bottles. Instead, it has engineered a condition
of overvalued asset prices now propped up by the absurdity of negative rates.
The Fed, et al. are riding the tiger of a great global carry trade. Some have called this the “new normal.” But it is anything
but normal and it is also inherently unstable. How unstable?
While no one can say for certain, two metrics that have had a dispositive record of forecasting recession are (1) declining
corporate profits and (2) progressively flatter yield curves. We have both:
The Gap in GAAP Earnings

Source: Bloomberg, TCW
* Basic EPS before Extraordinary Items excludes the effects of discontinued operations, accounting standard changes, and natural disasters. Includes the effects of other one-time gains/losses. Uses weighted average shares excluding the effects of convertibles.
Flattening Treasury Curves Precede Recessions

Source: Bloomberg
There is really no mystery as to why these metrics matter. Lower profits force managements to defend their margins by curtailing business investment and by throttling back on hiring. The widening chasm between the “adjusted” earnings that companies report versus what their GAAP calculated earnings would be is yet another red flag. And, of course, flatter yield curves compress net interest margins making leverage less profitable. Less leverage means balance sheets shrink which forces a rationing of credit
and a tightening of lending standards. The writing is on the wall.
Our central bankers took the till away from the markets years ago, confident that their policies would chart a course to El Dorado. Instead, they have sailed us off the map, into places that financial markets have never been, and should never be.

TCW Total Return: Should You Stay or Go?



Eric Jacobson: Hi. I'm Eric Jacobsen with Morningstar. I'm the director of fixed income research, and I'm here with Tad Rivelle. Tad is the chief investment officer of Metropolitan West Asset Management, and as a result of a recent combination of his firm with TCW, also in charge of the high-grade bond area at TCW, as well. Tad, thanks so much for joining us.
Tad Rivelle: Thank you, Eric. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Jacobson: Tad, let me start with a few questions just about the combination of the firms. I know you've been asked some of these things before, but for now anyway--and you can explain that if necessary--is there any difference in the way that any of the portfolios on either side are being managed in terms of their mandates as a result of your team coming in?
Rivelle: Our prime directive is to maintain stylistic consistency, both with respect to the Met West portfolios as well as the TCW portfolios. So though the team is now able to draw upon the combined resources of both the TCW half as well as the Met West half, the management of the portfolios has been very consistent.
Jacobson: I know that with some of the changes that happened when you came in here, in particular the TCW Total Return Fund, it's been widely reported, had some pretty swift redemptions early on. I gather that it's tapered off some, but the numbers, they change from day to day, so maybe you can kind of give us an update as to where it stands now relative to day one when that started happening, and how you are feeling about managing that.

Rivelle: The flows have been very manageable, as was widely reported in the press. The numbers were very large for the first couple of days after the management changes. They have tapered off to a very small fraction of that number.
We were able to maintain a high degree of consistency with respect to the expression of the strategy in that fund. As we also reported, perhaps two-thirds, approximately, of the TCW Total Return bond fund was invested in agency-mortgage backed securities with the residual, the one-third, being in non-agency mortgage backed securities.
So we did have to engage in sales of both agency as well as non-agency mortgages, though sales went very smoothly. So from our standpoint, the flows are very manageable. And from the standpoint of being able to maintain the same expression of strategy, nothing has been altered.
Jacobson: You know, there's one issue that's very obvious, because of the TCW Total Return having a history as being a very mortgage-focused fund, a lot of questions coming up about your mortgage capabilities, and I know that they're extensive.
Maybe tell us a little bit about the development of those. I know that Mitch Flack and Brian Whalen--Mitch being an agency mortgage specialist, Brian more on the non-agency side--both came into the firm X number of years ago. And my impression certainly is that a lot of capabilities have been built up since then.
Maybe give us a little bit of narrative as to how the decision to make those changes, adding them, and also the investments that went into the firm to do so. Give us a little background.
Rivelle: Yeah, I'll give a little bit of a background and history of the team and the mortgage-backed market. For those that might be a little bit less familiar with the history of Met West Asset Management, we represent a team of portfolio managers that actually began our careers at PIMCO nearly 20 years ago. And our experience with mortgage-backed securities actually began at that shop, and then was further developed at another L.A.-based firm, Hotchkis & Wiley.
So the team has been managing agency as well as non-agency mortgages for decades. Additionally, you are quite right, the team was significantly augmented in terms of its skill and capabilities with the addition of Mitch Flack in 2001.
He brings with him roughly 25 years of experience in the mortgage-backed industry. I think he knows just about everything there is to know about agency mortgage-backed securities. You've spoken with him, you probably can confirm that. And he's a principal and a co-head of the mortgage desk here at TCW.
Brian Whalen is his co-head who focuses more on the non-agency, the more credit-intensive aspects of the mortgage market. He and the various PMs and traders and analysts that support him is the tip of the spear from the standpoint of analyzing non-agency mortgage-backed instruments on the desk.
His background includes having joined Met West about six years ago. Prior to that, he was a director at CSFB, Credit Suisse First Boston, and before that at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Brian was the individual who was primarily responsible for overseeing our effort as it related to development of proprietary analytics in non-agency mortgage-backed securities. Most specifically our loan level database, that absorbs 30 million residential mortgage loans from, roughly speaking, 12 or so servicers around the country, which combine with the existing TCW analytical systems, both of which, I think, have represented a very, very considerable CAPEX from the standpoint of both firms.
It gives us nearly 100% coverage of all of the residential mortgage loans in the country, and therefore, a highly detailed granular knowledge of how those loans are priced, or should be priced, and valued.
Jacobson: Well, I appreciate your time today, Tad. Thank you.
Rivelle: Thank you.
