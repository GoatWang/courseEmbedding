                                        How should I store my bottom loading water dispenser when going on vacation?                                    




Any time you intend to leave your dispenser for more than a week, the reservoir should have all water removed.  Unplug the dispenser, open the drain plug on the back and remove water from the hot reservoir.  Empty the cold reservoir by dispensing water from the cold tap at the front of the dispenser.  Leave the dispenser unplugged and dry until you are ready to begin use.

Primo does not have a deposit program in the United States. When you make the initial purchase of a 3 or 5-gallon pre-filled bottle from Primo, you are purchasing the bottle also. 
We offer an exchange program in which you can place your empty 3 or 5-gallon bottle into our recycling center at your local store and you will receive an exchange ticket that allows you to purchase your next pre-filled bottle at a reduced price. We will accept any 3 or 5-gallon bottle as an exchange.


If you are no longer interested in using Primo Water Exchange, we offer an empty bottle credit program.

To sterilize every six months:

1) Add ½ teaspoon of household bleach per gallon of water

3) Pour out and thoroughly rinse until water is clear and no scent can be detected
4) Air dry
5) Seal container

Our system incorporates three types of filtration:

1) Sediment Filtration - physically traps particles such as dirt and pipe scale from incoming water
2) Activated Carbon Filtration – eliminates chlorine which aids in the great taste of Primo® Water
3) Reverse Osmosis – the reverse osmosis membrane removes any remaining dissolved impurities in the water such as lead, arsenic, mercury and nitrates

Our process also includes ultraviolet sterilization to ensure safe, high-quality water.

                                Can I use the Primo® Water Refill station if a “boil alert” has been issued?                            




Your safety is our top priority at Primo. Though our systems are robust enough to remove contaminants, we shut down the system to ensure the safety of our customers.  Once the boil alert has been lifted, our refill stations will be fitted with new filters and membranes in addition to being completely sanitized.


Water samples are then submitted to an independent lab for testing to ensure Primo® Water meets safety and quality specifications. The refill stations will then become available for use once the “all clear” is given after lab tests and authorization is provided.

In recent trading, shares of Primo Water Corp have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $13.25, changing hands for $13.41/share.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
