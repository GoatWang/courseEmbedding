DMEPOS Product Classification List (PCL)
Find-A-Code is NOT responsible for maintaining the information in this list. For updates and changes to product information:

Coding verification by the PDAC is a voluntary process unless otherwise mandated by DME MAC policy.
Only products that have been submitted to the PDAC/SADMERC for coding verification are posted to the PCL.
Product information can be searched by manufacturer/distributor, product name, product/model number or HCPCS code
Products listed on the PCL with a comment stating, “Code Reverified” have been submitted for review multiple times. This comment indicates any changes to the product, based on a new coding verification review, have not affected the coding assignment.
If a product is not listed in the PCL, please email the PDAC Contact Center at pdac@noridian.com for coding assistance. 
It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to verify their DMEPOS product information is listed accurately on the PCL and education on the assigned code is provided to their distributors and/or suppliers. If any product information is inaccurate on the coding verification letter or on the PCL, the manufacturer should notify the PDAC immediately.
Manufacturers/Distributors are responsible to notify the PDAC of any changes involving their products posted on the PCL. Click on the Request Updates to DMECS link for instructions on requesting updates to the PCL.

HCPCS Codes - Procedures, DMEs, Supplies (A0000-Z9999)

HCPCS - Level II is a standardized coding system that is used primarily to identify products, supplies, and services not included in the CPT codes, such as ambulance services and durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) when used outside a physician's office.  Because Medicare and other insurers cover a variety of services, supplies, and equipment that are not identified by CPT codes, the level II HCPCS codes were established for submitting claims for these items.  The development and use of level II of the HCPCS began in the 1980's.  Level II codes are also referred to as alpha-numeric codes because they consist of a single alphabetical letter followed by 4 numeric digits, while CPT codes are identified using 5 numeric digits.
CPT® - Current Procedural Terminology® Medical Code Set (00000-99999)

The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code set is maintained by the American Medical Association through the CPT Editorial Panel.  The CPT code set accurately describes medical, surgical, and diagnostic services and is designed to communicate uniform information about medical services and procedures among physicians, coders, patients, accreditation organizations, and payers for administrative, financial, and analytical purposes. The current version is the CPT 2017.

DMEPOS Product Classification List (PCL)
Find-A-Code is NOT responsible for maintaining the information in this list. For updates and changes to product information:

Coding verification by the PDAC is a voluntary process unless otherwise mandated by DME MAC policy.
Only products that have been submitted to the PDAC/SADMERC for coding verification are posted to the PCL.
Product information can be searched by manufacturer/distributor, product name, product/model number or HCPCS code
Products listed on the PCL with a comment stating, “Code Reverified” have been submitted for review multiple times. This comment indicates any changes to the product, based on a new coding verification review, have not affected the coding assignment.
If a product is not listed in the PCL, please email the PDAC Contact Center at pdac@noridian.com for coding assistance. 
It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to verify their DMEPOS product information is listed accurately on the PCL and education on the assigned code is provided to their distributors and/or suppliers. If any product information is inaccurate on the coding verification letter or on the PCL, the manufacturer should notify the PDAC immediately.
Manufacturers/Distributors are responsible to notify the PDAC of any changes involving their products posted on the PCL. Click on the Request Updates to DMECS link for instructions on requesting updates to the PCL.


Billable HCPCS Codes vs. Payable HCPCS Codes
The PDAC receives frequent inquiries regarding a billable HCPCS code and a payable HCPCS code. One may think the two are the same; however this is not the case.
A billable HCPCS code is one that is submitted on a claim to the DME MAC. A billable HCPCS code will display as active on DMECS (no end date). If the HCPCS code is billable to the DME MAC it does not necessarily mean it is payable.
A payable HCPCS code is one that will be considered for payment by the DME MACs if the item meets the definition of DME, falls under a benefit category, and is covered under other general DME guidelines. Specific details can be found on the applicable DME MAC website for which you are billing.
When inquiring about a HCPCS code to determine if the code is billable or payable to a DME MAC, first check the National Coverage Determination (NCD), the Local Coverage Determination (LCD), and the DME MAC website to determine whether the code is billable and/or payable.
Example: HCPCS code A5510 is currently listed on DMECS as a billable code to the DME MAC. The current LCD states: "Items represented by code A5510 reflect compression molding to the patient's foot over time through the heat and pressure generated by wearing a shoe with the insert present. Since these inserts are not considered total contact at the time of dispensing, they do not meet the requirements of the benefit category and will be denied as non-covered". The LCD indicates that this HCPCS code is billable but not payable by the DME MACs.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
