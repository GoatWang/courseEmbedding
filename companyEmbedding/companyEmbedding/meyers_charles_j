Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.

Why Choose Meyers & Flowers



As a top Chicago attorney law firm, Meyers & Flowers have obtained millions of dollars in compensation for clients who would otherwise be limited to insurance policy limits which are usually woefully
        inadequate to fully handle medical and other costs.
Our trial attorneys are supported by a highly skilled team of paralegals, expert witnesses, top financial consultants and medical professionals. This team approach is what makes Meyers & Flowers stand out from
        the competition in that preparation is comprehensive and fast. We understand that many our clients are not only suffering from a personal injury but are also having to deal with a reduction in income.
While we are headquartered in Chicago, we have successfully taken on Big Pharma and other international corporations that are responsible for injuries caused by their products. We are considered a top Chicago
        law firm because we are not intimidated by these giant corporations. Meyers & Flowers have the internal resources to fully document the consequences of the injury to our client and to establish which entity
        must bear the burden of providing substantial and relevant compensation.
One of the services we provide to our clients is that of buffer between the incident response team of attorneys and our client. Offers to settle early in the negotiation process is a sign that the opposition
        hopes to avoid a trial and the much larger award that is likely to awarded by a jury. At Meyers & Flowers, we evaluate these offers against the needs of our client, including future needs, and advise
        accordingly. Taking on the role of advocate for our client means that we bear the brunt of the often aggressive negotiating that is done in these cases.
Since our reputation for winning large awards and settlements for our clients is nationwide, our negotiating power is considerable. We have been successful due to our hard work in meticulously preparing our
        cases for trial and our policy of forwarding the lawsuit to trial as quickly as possible. We don’t allow the other side to slow the process with meaningless legal tactics.







Get Full and Meaningful Compensation
Meyers & Flowers attracts clients from all over America due to our reputation for relentlessly achieving meaningful compensation for victims of corporate and institutional negligence. As a top Chicago law
        firm, we also attract the best lawyers in Chicago, paralegals, expert consultants and clerical staff. The combined talent of our team enables our clients to succeed against huge corporate litigation teams with
        unlimited finances and every reason to delay proceedings. We are a powerful force, fully focused on vigorously pursuing financial compensation for our clients who are dealing with life changing injuries or
        losses.
We enjoy the challenge of obtaining full compensation for our clients and their families. This comes in part from operating with the knowledge that our adversaries are primarily focused on reducing the
        financial impact a proper financial award will have on their client’s financial statements. One common tactic is to offer a settlement early on in the proceedings which appears fairly generous.
Early offers of settlements are almost always far short of the true financial impact the injury and loss will have on our clients lives going forward. These offers are made quickly to take advantage of the
        sudden financial and emotional stress that an injury or a death will have on a family. Understanding and countering the tactics employed by large corporations and institutions is one reason why we are
        considered among the best lawyers in Chicago.



Vigorous Case Preparation Gets Results



Client Trust
Recognizing that our clients place their trust in us to resolve issues that have profound effects on their family, our experienced team of some of the best attorneys in Chicago do everything that we can to
        earn that trust by our vigorous advocacy of our clients' interests. Throughout the entire process, the attorneys at Meyers & Flowers possess the work ethic along with the detailed personal attention that is
        necessary to fully understand and win cases.









Vigorous Case Preparation
We prepare every case very aggressively, pushing the other side to respond to our demands and effectively setting the stage for successful settlement negotiations. Part of our power stems from our stellar
        record of wins as well as our policy of preparing each case for trial regardless of the opposition’s assurances of impending settlement offers.
Our expert accountants and lifestyle consultants fully understand the current and future needs of our clients who have endured physical or mental injuries due to negligence. Our topa trial attorneys are well
        versed in communicating these financial requirements clearly, both in settlement negotiations and if necessary during trial. In wrongful death cases, we know how to expose the actual monetary loss that loss of
        a loved one, particularly the primary income earner, has on the family. Successfully making the case for meaningful compensation requires the full force of the top Chicago law firm of Meyers & Flowers,
        particularly when going against corporate giants with deep pockets.






“Each year, Meyers & Flowers brings positive outcomes to many individuals and families whose lives changed due to catastrophic injury, medical negligence, defective products or workplace injury.”


Excellent Results
Meyers & Flowers is a Chicago law firm operating from a simple basic philosophy: put the client first. With that as a guiding principle, Meyers & Flowers has grown from a small but dedicated group of trial
        attorneys and medical malpractice lawyers into one of the top law firms in Chicago, with a practice dedicated to obtaining full and just compensation for clients across the United States.

Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.
