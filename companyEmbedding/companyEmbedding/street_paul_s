“I am very happy to have the occasion to express my deepest esteem for St. Paul Street Evangelization. This apostolate…is doing a tremendous work in bringing Christ and his truth and love to all parts of the United States and also in other nations. I give my whole hearted support to the work and I pray for it daily that it will continue and grow for the sake of the salvation of many souls… I am happy on this occasion to recommend to you St. Paul Street Evangelization and urge you to become involved with it.” Raymond Cardinal Burke
