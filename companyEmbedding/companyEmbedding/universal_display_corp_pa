MX Gold Corp. Advances The Magistral Project Towards Production






GlobeNewswire



Jul 20, 2017 8:30 AM EDT













 




























































 VANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 20, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MX Gold Corp. (TSX-V:MXL) (FSE:ODV) (OTCQX:MXLGF) (the " Company" or " MX Gold") is pleased to announce that, in its Joint Venture with GracePoint Mining Corp a subsidiary or Firma Holdings Corp. (OTC:FRMA),  the Magistral project is progressing on schedule. The turn-key build out of the plant includes increasing throughput capacity to 1,000 tonnes per day.  The build out is on track to be completed, with the plant operational, by this November.  Mr. Dan Omeniuk, Chairman and CEO of MX Gold stated, "Despite the rainy season in the region, it is encouraging to see that the project business plan is being executed on schedule, and that our Joint Venture efforts with GracePoint  are producing positive outcomes. We are looking forward to the projected cash flow from Magistral, as it will serve as an integral part of our approach to building further value for MX Gold shareholders with a non-dilutive strategy." Mr. Bert McPherson, President stated, "Combined efforts with GracePoint have also allowed us to seek out potential new acquisitions in the area. We look forward to updating our shareholders after conducting our due diligence in weeks to come." The project includes a fully permitted 500 TPD Dynamic Cyanide counter current system plant. Construction of the plant was completed in 2013, for approximately $4.5 million. There is a current build out, underway, to bring the plant to 1,000 tonnes per day capacity. Additionally, the Magistral project includes the exclusive rights to process approximately 1.2 million tonnes of mineralized mill tailings, grading an average of 2.06 gold per tonne (79,000 ounces of gold).  We are actively sourcing additional toll tailings tonnages and expect to increase project life time near term.  About MX Gold MX Gold Corp. is a junior mining company focused on the exploration, development and mining of advanced projects located in British Columbia and Mexico. The Company's primary focus in British Columbia is its high-grade Willa gold and copper project located 12 kilometers south of Silverton, B.C. In 2015, MX Gold Corp. completed the accretive acquisition of the Willa project and the Max Molybdenum Mine and Mill Complex. This acquisition removed major costs and shortened timelines typically associated with mine project development. The Willa mine is located 135 kilometers south of the Max Mill. MX Gold Corp. can also elect to reopen the Max Molybdenum mining operation once world Moly prices improve.

As Apple (AAPL) readies its first smartphone with an OLED screen, a key supplier of technology and materials for OLED displays is seeing its shares surge in value.
XAutoplay: On | OffUniversal Display (OLED) stock rose 3.5% to 119.65 on the stock market today. It was the stock's fourth straight day of gains. Universal Display closed above its 50-day moving average in bullish action on Wednesday and hasn't looked back.
Universal Display is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings after the close Aug. 3. Analysts expected the Ewing, N.J.-based company to earn 73 cents a share, up 59% year over year, on sales of $85.6 million, up 33%.
Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 smartphone is expected to feature an OLED display, among other new features. Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays boast richer colors, darker blacks, a faster refresh rate and lower power consumption than liquid crystal display (LCD) screens. OLED displays also are thinner and flexible, allowing for new hardware designs.

IBD'S TAKE: Universal Display has an IBD Composite Rating of 97, meaning it has outperformed 97% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Universal Display, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.

The ramp in production of OLED screens also is benefiting equipment suppliers such as Applied Materials (AMAT) and Coherent (COHR).
Applied Materials shares rose 1.8% to 46.12 on Friday. Coherent climbed 1.8% to 271.96, after hitting a record high intraday of 277.90.
Apple's use of an OLED display in the iPhone 8 is expected to kick off a wave of imitators in the smartphone market. Samsung, the leading maker of OLED displays, uses them in its flagship Galaxy smartphones and is believed to be the initial sole supplier of OLED displays for the 11th-generation iPhone. Other display makers are working to get OLED production lines up soon.
On Thursday, Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz expressed doubt that iPhone users will upgrade to the latest model because of the OLED display.
"With OLED, we struggle to see the incremental benefits visually that would inspire a customer to replace an adequately-performing device," Moskowitz said in a report. "While battery life could improve with OLED, our conversations with industry participants suggest that most consumers will not notice any major 'must have' experience changes because of new OLED displays versus LCD. We think that this dynamic, if sustained, could limit the upside potential related to new OLED-based devices that likely sell for a premium, which could keep average selling prices from moving much higher."

The Importance Of Market Cap

In the latest look at stocks ordered by largest market capitalization, Russell 3000 component Universal Display Corp (NASDAQ:OLED) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example Assurant Inc (NYSE:AIZ), according to The Online Investor.  Click here to find out the top S&P 500 components ordered by average analyst rating �
Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons.  The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock.  Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much � that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist.  But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true "apples-to-apples" comparison of the value of two stocks.  In the case of Universal Display Corp (NASDAQ:OLED), the market cap is now $5.85B, versus Assurant Inc (NYSE:AIZ) at $5.80B.

Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of OLED vs. AIZ:

	
Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers � much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's).  This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock.  For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger.  Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and "tosses out" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller "up-and-comers" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals).  And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index.  So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.

	OLED,AIZ makes up 13111.79% of the iShares Russell 2500 ETF (SMMD)
At the closing bell, OLED is up about 0.8%, while AIZ is up about 1.3% on the day Wednesday.

UNIVERSAL DISPLAY CORPORATION ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2016 FINANCIAL RESULTS
Board Announces Quarterly Dividend of $0.03 per Common Share
EWING, N.J. – February 23, 2017 - Universal Display Corporation (Nasdaq: OLED), enabling energy-efficient displays and lighting with its UniversalPHOLED® technology and materials, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016.
 
For the full year 2016, the Company reported revenue of $198.9 million, up from $191.0 million for 2015, primarily driven by higher royalty and license fees and contract research services revenue from our recently completed acquisition, partially offset by lower revenue from commercial material sales. The Company posted operating income of $68.4 million for the year and net income of $48.1 million. These results compare to operating income of $32.3 million and net income of $14.7 million for 2015. The 2015 net income figure includes a $33.0 million write-down of inventory in the second quarter, primarily of an existing host material and associated work-in-process, resulting from a customer’s faster-than-expected reduction in demand for this material. Excluding this item and its associated $2.8 million reduction in income tax expense, non-GAAP net income for 2015 was $44.8 million or $0.94 per diluted share (see “reconciliation of non-GAAP measures” for further discussion of the non-GAAP measures).
 
 


                                The following information was filed by UNIVERSAL DISPLAY CORP PA on Thursday, February 23, 2017 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is a press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition. It may be helpful to assess the quality of management by comparing the information in the press release to the information in the accompanying 10-K Annual Report statement of earnings and operation as management may choose to highlight particular information in the press release.

oled_10k_2017-02-23_105_165Financial - ExpenseThe increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with bonus, retirement benefits, and stock-based compensation for certain executive officers, and increased salaries and salary-related expenses associated with new and existing employees.

oled_10k_2017-02-23_94_155Revenue - ProductThe decline in our host material sales was primarily due to a decrease in the number of grams sold due to what we believe was a result of our customers continuing to sell new products that do not include our host materials, as well as a reduction in the average price per gram sold.
oled_10k_2017-02-23_53_210Revenue - ProductCommercial material sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $16.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a decline in host material grams sold and average selling price per gram sold.

oled_10k_2017-02-23_120_247Revenue - GeographyWe anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications, that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINNCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes above.  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT  CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This discussion and analysis contains some "forward-looking statements." Forward-looking statements concern possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies and customer relationships. These statements often include words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "estimate," "seek," "will," "may" or similar expressions. These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate in these circumstances.  As you read and consider this discussion and analysis, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should understand that these statements involve substantial risk and uncertainty and are not guarantees of future performance or results. They depend on many factors that are discussed further in the section entitled (Risk Factors) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as supplemented by disclosures, if any, in Item 1A of Part II below. Changes or developments in any of these areas could affect our financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements.  All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be. We do not undertake any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  OVERVIEW  We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode, or OLED, technologies and materials for use in displays for mobile phones, televisions, tablets, wearables, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive interiors, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been exclusively engaged, and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue from the following:   sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing;   intellectual property and technology licensing;   contract research services, and   technology development and support, including government contract work and support provided to third parties for commercialization of their OLED products.  Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers' commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at time of shipment or at time of delivery depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties.  We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. For arrangements with extended payment terms where the fee is not fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue when the payment is due and payable. Royalty revenue and license fees included as part of commercial supply agreements are recognized when earned and the amount is fixed and determinable.  Currently, our most significant commercial license agreement, which runs through the end of 2017, is with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC) and covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display products. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, payable in semi-annual installments over the agreement term of 6.4 years. The installments, which are due in the second and fourth quarter of each year, increase on an annual basis over the term of the agreement. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. Ratable recognition of revenue is impacted by the agreement's extended increasing payment terms in light of our limited history with similar  agreements. As a result, revenue is recognized at the lesser of the proportional performance approach (ratable) and the amount of due and payable fees from SDC. Given the increasing contractual payment schedule, license fees under the agreement are recognized as revenue when they become due and payable, which is currently scheduled to be in the second and fourth quarter of each year.  At the same time we entered into the current patent license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the current supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum dollar amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum purchase commitment is subject to SDC's requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. The minimum purchase amounts increase on an annual basis over the term of the supplemental agreement. These amounts were determined through negotiation based on a number of factors, including, without limitation, estimates of SDC's OLED business growth as a percentage of published OLED market forecasts and SDC's projected minimum usage of red and green phosphorescent emitter materials over the term of the agreement.  In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The prepaid royalty amount is included in deferred revenue and a portion of this amount can be credited against total royalties due over the life of the contract. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the term of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. We expect to generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display's sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent dopants and host materials.  In 2016, we entered into an OLED Technology License Agreement and Commercial Material Supply Agreement with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma) which were both effective July 21, 2016 and run for five years. Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the agreement provides for the sale of phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products  In 2016, we entered into and consummated the transactions contemplated by an IP Transfer Agreement with BASF SE (BASF). Under the IP Transfer Agreement, BASF sold to us certain of its rights, title and interest to its owned and co-owned intellectual property rights relating to the composition, development, manufacture and use of OLED materials, including OLED lighting and display stack technology, as well as certain tangible assets. The intellectual property includes knowhow and more than 500 issued and pending patents in the area of phosphorescent materials and technologies.  In 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), a privately held contract research organization with 43 employees specializing in organic and organometallic synthetic research, development, and commercialization. Adesis is a technology vendor to companies in the pharmaceutical, fine chemical, biomaterials, and catalyst industries, and has worked with us over the last few years to help advance and accelerate a number of our product offerings. The transaction closed on July 11, 2016. Under the terms of the agreement, our subsidiary, UDC, Inc., acquired all outstanding shares of Adesis in a merger for $33.7 million in cash, and up to an additional $2.4 million in cash contingent upon Adesis' achievement of certain milestones within two years of acquisition. The acquisition was funded through use of existing cash and investments.  Contract research services is revenue earned by performing organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis for our customers. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from government contracts, development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, which include reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs we incur in relation to our government contracts. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved.  We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors:   the timing, cost and volume of sales of our OLED materials;   the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties, as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation;   the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development and patent-related activities; and   the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016  We had operating income of $12.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to operating income of $2.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the following:   an increase in material sales of $22.3 million partially offset by an increase in the cost of material sales of $5.6 million;   an increase in royalties and license fees of $1.7 million;   an increase in contract research services revenue of $1.8 million partially offset by an increase in the cost of contract research services of $888,000; partially offset by   an increase in operating expenses of $8.4 million.  We had net income of $10.4 million or $0.22 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to net income of $1.9 million or $0.04 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in net income was due to an increase in operating income of $9.5 million and interest income, net, of $347,000, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $1.4 million.  Revenue The following table details our revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, Increase 2017 2016 $ % REVENUE: Material sales $ 46,637 $ 24,304 $ 22,333 92 % Royalty and license fees 7,025 5,342 1,683 32 % Contract research services 1,904 57 1,847 3240 % Total revenue $ 55,566 $ 29,703 $ 25,863 87 %  Total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by $26.0 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in revenue was the result of an increase in material sales, royalty and license fees, and contract research services.  Material sales  The following table details our revenues derived from material sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):   Three Months Ended March 31, Increase 2017 2016 $ % Material Sales: Commercial material sales $ 35,803 $ 22,114 $ 13,689 62 % Developmental material sales 10,834 2,190 8,644 395 % Total material sales $ 46,637 $ 24,304 $ 22,333 92 %  Commercial material sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by $13.7 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, due to an increase in sales volume resulting from higher phosphorescent emitter demand.  Developmental material sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by $8.6 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, due to an increase in sales volume resulting from higher phosphorescent emitter demand.  Material sales included sales of both phosphorescent emitter and host materials which were comprised of the following for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):   Three Months Ended March 31, Increase (Decrease) 2017 2016 $ % Material Sales: Phosphorescent emitter sales $ 46,245 $ 23,864 $ 22,381 94 % Host material sales 392 440 (48 ) (11 )% Total material sales $ 46,637 $ 24,304 $ 22,333 92 %  Phosphorescent emitter sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased $22.4 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 due to an increase in sales volume resulting from higher demand for both red and green phosphorescent emitters.  Host material sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased by $48,000 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. Based on our current sales forecast, we anticipate that sales of existing host material will continue to be minimal. Our customers are not required to purchase our host materials in order to utilize our phosphorescent emitter materials and the host material sales business continues to be more competitive than the phosphorescent emitter material sales business.  Royalty and license fees  Royalty and license fees were as follows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):  Three Months Ended March 31, Increase 2017 2016 $ % Royalty and license fees $ 7,025 $ 5,342 $ 1,683 32 %  Royalty and license fees for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by $1.7 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 due primarily to an increase in royalty payments generated by higher licensed sales from our customers.  Contract research services  Contract research services were as follows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):  Three Months Ended March 31, Increase 2017 2016 $ % Contract research services $ 1,904 $ 57 $ 1,847 3240 %  Contract research services include revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which performs organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis for our customer. Contract research services also include technology development and support revenue earned on government contracts, development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, which includes reimbursement by the U.S. government for all or a portion of the research development expenses we incur related to our government contracts.  Contract research services revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by $1.8 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in contract research services revenue was related to contract research sales activities associated with Adesis, which was acquired on July 11, 2016.  Cost of material sales  Cost of commercial material sold for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands):   Three Months Ended March 31, Increase 2017 2016 $ % Commercial material sales $ 35,803 $ 22,114 $ 13,689 62 % Cost of commercial material sold 9,551 4,992 4,559 91 % % of commercial material sales 27 % 23 %  Cost of commercial material sold for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by $4.6 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 and was due to an increase in the level of commercial material sales. The increase in the cost of commercial material sold as a percentage of commercial material sales was primarily due to a decrease in the average selling prices per gram sold.  Commercial materials are materials that have been validated by us for use in commercial OLED products. Cost of commercial material sales includes the cost of producing materials that have been classified as commercial, shipping costs for such materials, and inventory write-downs, but excludes the cost of producing certain early development materials which are included in research and development expense. Depending on the amounts, timing and stage of materials being classified as commercial, we expect the cost of materials sales to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.  Research and development  Research and development expenses increased to $11.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to $10.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher third-party contract research services activities.  Selling, general and administrative  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $10.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to $6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to incremental costs associated with the addition of Adesis activity, as well as higher employee-related costs.  Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets  Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets increased to $5.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to $2.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was due to higher amortization expense of $2.7 million associated with the acquisitions of the BASF patent portfolio and intangible assets associated with the Adesis acquisition.  Patent costs  Patent costs increased to $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Royalty and license expense  Royalty and license expense increased to $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to $875,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was due to increased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC, and Michigan, resulting from an increase in qualifying material sales. See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  Interest Income, net  Interest income, net was $671,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared $324,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Income tax expense  On January 1, 2017, we adopted ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Accounting, which includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. Under the previous guidance, tax effects of deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation cost ("windfalls") were recorded in equity in the period in which the deductions actually reduced income taxes payable and any unrecognized tax benefits were tracked separately off the balance sheet. Under the new guidance, excess tax benefits and deficiencies are recorded in the income statement in the period in which stock awards vest or are settled, and any excess tax benefits not previously recognized because the related tax deduction had not reduced current taxes payable, are recorded through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the period of adoption  We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was 18.5% and 32.1%, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively and the Company recorded income tax expense of $2.3 million and $921,000, respectively.  Without the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 for the three months ended March 31,2017 the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 27.8% and $3.5 million.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and our short-term investments. As of March 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $96.1 million and short-term investments of $228.9 million, for a total of $325.0 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $139.4 million and short-term investments of $188.6 million, for a total of $328.0 million, as of December 31, 2016.  Cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $210,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 million was due to an increase in net income of $8.4 million and an increase in non-cash adjustments to net income of $4.2 million, partially offset by an increase in cash used in operating assets and liabilities of $11.2 million primarily as a result of an increase in accounts receivable.  Cash used in investing activities was $40.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $14.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in cash used in investing activities was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net purchases of $39.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to net sales of $14.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Cash used in financing activities was $4.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the payment of withholding taxes related to employee stock-based compensation of $1.5 million as well as the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $1.4 million.  Working capital was $350.5 million as of March 31, 2017, compared to $345.2 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and decrease in accrued expenses, partially offset by a reduction in inventory and other current assets.  We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months.  We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings, public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions.  We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, the valuation of certain investments, the valuation and recoverability of acquired technology and inventories, stock-based compensation, income taxes and our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, are our "critical accounting policies" as contemplated by the SEC.  Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies.  Contractual Obligations  Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for a discussion of our contractual obligations.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  . . .

Motorola will receive the proceeds from the resale of the shares of common 
stock. We will not receive any proceeds from the resale of the shares of common 
stock by Motorola.


The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete against
alternative flat panel display technologies, in particular LCDs, as well as
other OLED technologies. We also compete against other lighting technologies, in
particular inorganic LEDs.
 
Flat Panel Display Industry Competitors
 
Numerous domestic and foreign companies have developed or are developing LCD,
plasma and other flat panel display technologies that compete with our OLED
display technologies. We believe that OLED display technologies ultimately can
compete with LCDs and other display technologies for many product applications
on the basis of lower power consumption, better contrast ratios, faster video
rates and lower manufacturing cost. However, other companies may succeed in
continuing to improve these competing display technologies, or in developing new
display technologies, that are superior to OLED display technologies in various
respects. We cannot predict the timing or extent to which such improvements or
developments may occur.
 
Lighting Industry Competitors
 
Traditional incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps are well-entrenched
products in the lighting industry. In addition, compact fluorescent lamps and
solid-state LEDs have recently been introduced into the market and would compete
with OLED lighting products. Having attributes different than fluorescent lamps
and LEDs, OLEDs might not compete directly with these products for all lighting
applications. However, manufacturers of LEDs and compact fluorescent lamps may
succeed in more broadly adapting their products to various lighting
applications, or others may develop competing solid-state lighting technologies
that are superior to OLEDs. Again, we cannot predict whether or when this might
occur.
 
OLED Technology and Materials Competitors
 
Eastman Kodak Company has licensed its competing fluorescent OLED technology and
other patents to a number of display manufacturers, several of whom are
presently manufacturing OLED products. Another OLED industry participant,
Cambridge Display Technology, Ltd., licenses its competing polymer OLED
technology and recently entered into a joint venture with Sumitomo Chemical 
Company to develop polymer OLED materials. Many display manufacturers themselves 
are engaged in research, development and commercialization activities with 
respect to OLED technologies and materials. In addition, other manufacturers of 
OLED materials, such as Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd., are selling products that 
compete with our proprietary PHOLED materials.
 
Our existing business relationships with Samsung SDI and other product
manufacturers suggest that our OLED technologies and materials, particularly our
PHOLED technologies and materials, may achieve some level of market penetration
in the flat panel display and lighting industries. However, our competitors may
succeed in improving their competing OLED technologies and materials so as to
render them superior to ours. We cannot be sure of the extent to which product
manufacturers ultimately will adopt our OLED technologies and materials for the
production of commercial flat panel displays and lighting products.


Company Description
We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic
light emitting diode, or OLED, technologies and materials. OLEDs are thin,
lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices, highly suitable for use in
full-color displays and as lighting products. We believe OLED


 displays will
capture a share of the growing flat panel display market because they offer
potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to
brightness, power efficiency, viewing angle, video response time and
manufacturing cost. We also believe that OLED lighting products have the
potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their
high efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low heat generation and novel
form factors. Our technology leadership and intellectual property position
should enable us to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting
products as they enter mainstream consumer markets.

   Our primary business strategy is to further develop and license our
proprietary OLED technologies to manufacturers of products for display
applications, such as cell phones, MP3 players, laptop computers and
televisions, and specialty and general lighting products. In support of this
objective, we also develop new OLED materials and sell those materials to
product manufacturers. Through our internal research and development efforts and
our relationships with world-class partners such as Princeton University, the
University of Southern California, the University of Michigan, Motorola, Inc.
and PPG Industries, Inc., we have established a significant portfolio of
proprietary OLED technologies and materials. We currently own, exclusively
license or have the sole right to sublicense more than 750 patents issued and
pending worldwide.

   In 2006, three manufacturers purchased our proprietary OLED materials for use
in commercial OLED display products: Samsung SDI Co., Ltd. of South Korea, AU
Optronics Corporation of Taiwan and Tohoku Pioneer Corporation of Japan. We also
have entered into a patent license agreement with Samsung SDI, under which we
expect to soon start receiving royalties based on Samsung SDI’s commencement of
sales of active matrix OLED display products. In addition, we are working with
many other companies who are evaluating our OLED technologies and materials for
possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products, including Seiko
Epson Corporation, Konica Minolta Technology Center, Inc. and Sony Corporation.
                   
   Our corporation was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania in April 1985. Our business was commenced in June 1994 by a company
then known as Universal Display Corporation, which had been incorporated under
the laws of the State of New Jersey. On June 22, 1995, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of ours merged into this New Jersey corporation. The surviving corporation in
this merger became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours and changed its name to
UDC, Inc. Simultaneously with the consummation of this merger, we changed our
name to Universal Display Corporation. UDC, Inc. now functions as an operating
subsidiary of ours and has overlapping officers and directors.

   Our principal executive offices are located at 375 Phillips Boulevard, Ewing,
New Jersey 08618 and our telephone number is (609) 671-0980. Our website is
located at www.universaldisplay.com.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
