Nanophase Announces Strategic Collaboration
Jun 29, 2017
OTC Disclosure & News Service

                            
                                - 
ROMEOVILLE, Ill., June  29, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nanophase Technologies Corporation (OTCQB:NANX), a technology leader in nanomaterials and advanced nanoengineered products, today reported the execution of development, manufacturing and distribution agreements with Eminess Technologies, Inc., a premier manufacturer and distributor of products for polishing of critical surfaces, to enhance their mutual positions in supplying advanced material solutions to the surface finishing marketplace. 
“Our companies have known each other for quite some time.  We expect this relationship to extend the reach of our products to a broader market, allow for a higher degree of focus on customer support in polishing and surface finishing areas where Eminess is more deeply established than Nanophase, and also to foster the development of new markets and products that are squarely within the Eminess strategic focus.  We believe that our material solutions will offer Eminess a market advantage, while allowing Nanophase to quickly deepen a successful supply position in those markets,” stated Nanophase CEO, Jess Jankowski.  Dan Koharko, CEO of Eminess added, “These agreements enhance our ability to deliver the technology to our customers who require advanced materials and application knowledge to produce their critical, next generation products.  Our quick, efficient development, manufacturing, and supply chain ensures that current and future world-class Nanophase particle technology is accessible to all that would benefit from it.”     “Eminess will begin to manufacture selected Nanophase product lines, and exclusively distribute others.  Included in these arrangements, the companies will implement a royalty agreement for certain future sales, along with certain minimum revenue volumes to ensure ongoing benefit for both organizations while we work together to best serve customers in this market,” said Jankowski. “In terms of our transition, the shared goal of Nanophase and Eminess is to have all the commercial and organizational coordination completed in time for the Optifab 2017 exhibition to be held in Rochester, New York, beginning October 16th of this year.” Jankowski continued, “This collaboration reflects another step in executing the Nanophase strategy of focusing our business development resources on the continued rollout of our new fully formulated personal care, and solar-control solutions, while allowing us to remain engaged and continuing to profit from our well-proven capabilities in the surface finishing marketplace.”  About Nanophase TechnologiesNanophase Technologies Corporation (NANX), www.nanophase.com, is a leader in nanomaterials technologies and provides nanoengineered solutions for multiple industrial product applications. Using a platform of patented and proprietary integrated nanomaterial technologies, the Company creates products with unique performance attributes from two ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 14001 facilities. Nanophase delivers commercial quantity and quality nanoparticles, coated nanoparticles, and nanoparticle dispersions in a variety of media.  Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains words such as “expects,” ”shall,” “will,” “believes,” and similar expressions that are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements in this announcement are made based on the Company’s current beliefs, known events and circumstances at the time of publication, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company’s results of operations, performance and achievements to differ materially from current expectations expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the following: the Company’s ability to be consistently profitable despite the losses it has incurred since its incorporation; a decision by a customer to cancel a purchase order or supply agreement in light of the Company’s dependence on a limited number of key customers; the terms of the Company’s supply agreements with BASF Corporation, which could trigger a requirement to transfer technology and/or sell equipment to that customer; the Company’s potential inability to obtain working capital when needed on acceptable terms or at all; the Company’s ability to obtain materials at costs it can pass through to its customers, including Rare Earth elements, specifically cerium oxide, as well as high purity zinc; uncertain demand for, and acceptance of, the Company’s nanocrystalline materials; the Company’s manufacturing capacity and product mix flexibility in light of customer demand; the Company’s limited marketing experience; changes in development and distribution relationships; the impact of competitive products and technologies; the Company’s dependence on patents and protection of proprietary information; the resolution of litigation or other legal proceedings in which the Company may become involved; the impact of any potential new government regulations that could be difficult to respond to or too costly to comply with while remaining financially viable; the ability of the Company to maintain an appropriate electronic trading venue for its securities; and other factors described in the Company’s Form 10-K filed March 29, 2017. In addition, the Company’s forward-looking statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates. Except as required by federal securities laws, the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect new events, uncertainties or other contingencies.

Globe Newswire



ROMEOVILLE -- Nanophase Technologies Corp. has established development, manufacturing and distribution agreements with Eminess Technologies, Inc., a premier manufacturer and distributor of products for polishing of critical surfaces.
The partnerships will enhance the companies' mutual positions in supplying advanced material solutions to the surface finishing marketplace.





Eminess will begin to manufacture selected Nanophase product lines, and exclusively distribute others. Included in these arrangements, the companies will implement a royalty agreement for certain future sales, along with certain minimum revenue volumes to ensure ongoing benefit for both organizations while we work together to best serve customers in this market, according to Nanophase CEO, Jess Jankowski.
"Our companies have known each other for quite some time. We expect this relationship to extend the reach of our products to a broader market, allow for a higher degree of focus on customer support in polishing and surface finishing areas where Eminess is more deeply established than Nanophase, and also to foster the development of new markets and products that are squarely within the Eminess strategic focus," said Jankowski. "We believe that our material solutions will offer Eminess a market advantage, while allowing Nanophase to quickly deepen a successful supply position in those markets,"
The two companies plan to have commercial and organizational coordination completed in October.

EXHIBIT 99.1Nanophase Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Financial ResultsThe company’s financial conference call is scheduled for February 16, 2017 at 11am EST ROMEOVILLE, Ill., Feb.  15, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nanophase Technologies Corporation (OTCQB:NANX), a technology leader in nanomaterials and advanced nanoengineered products, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.   “2016 demonstrated continued financial growth on the top line and bottom line (from the base business, prior to launch costs for our new fully formulated personal care solutions), and featured our first outright quarterly profit during the second quarter,” commented Nanophase CEO and President Jess Jankowski.  “And with revenue starting to come in from these new products, we expect continued improvement heading into 2017.” Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 Financial Highlights Revenue for fiscal year 2016 was $10.8 million, vs. the $10.3 million reported during the same period of 2015. The net loss for fiscal year 2016 was $1.3 million, or a loss of $0.04 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.2 million, or $0.04 per share, for the comparable period of 2015. The Company finished the quarter with approximately $1.8 million in cash and cash equivalents; the Company had no debt.  Fourth Quarter 2016 Financial Highlights Revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.4 million in 2016 and $2.3 million in 2015. The net loss for the quarter was $0.7 million in 2016, or $0.02 per share, compared to a net loss of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per share, for 2015.  Jankowski continued, “We could have simply posted a slightly better result than the prior year, but our plan is to grow the top line significantly more in 2017 than we did during 2016, and we are investing in making that happen.  That most of our investment was covered by the business indicates we are moving in the right direction.  I believe we have the strategy, the solutions and the positioning to get this done.”  Shareholders and members of the financial community are encouraged to participate in the upcoming conference call, where Mr. Jankowski will discuss the company’s current and long-term prospects. Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Conference CallThe Nanophase conference call, to be hosted by Jess Jankowski, the Company’s President & CEO, is scheduled for February 16, 2017, at 10:00 a.m. CST, 11:00 a.m. EST. The conference call dial-in number for U.S. callers is 877-312-8776 and for international callers is 408-774-4007.  The conference ID is 5824085.  Please dial in to the conference at least five minutes before the call is scheduled to begin. The call may also be accessed through the company’s website, at www.nanophase.com, by clicking on Investor Relations, Investor News and the link in the conference call announcement release. Use of Non-GAAP Financial InformationNanophase believes that the presentation of results excluding certain items, such as non-cash equity compensation charges, provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors, facilitating the evaluation of performance across reporting periods. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures for internal planning and reporting purposes. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or net income per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. About Nanophase TechnologiesNanophase Technologies Corporation (NANX), www.nanophase.com, is a leader in nanomaterials technologies and provides nanoengineered solutions for multiple industrial product applications. Using a platform of patented and proprietary integrated nanomaterial technologies, the Company creates products with unique performance attributes from two ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 14001 facilities. Nanophase delivers commercial quantity and quality nanoparticles, coated nanoparticles, and nanoparticle dispersions in a variety of media.  Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains words such as “expects,” ”shall,” “will,” “believes,” and similar expressions that are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements in this announcement are made based on the Company’s current beliefs, known events and circumstances at the time of publication, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company’s results of operations, performance and achievements to differ materially from current expectations expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.
