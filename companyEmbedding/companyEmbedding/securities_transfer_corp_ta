Transfer Agents
Important Notes: 
Electronic Filing of Transfer Agent Forms 
Filing Date Adjustment for Electronic TA Submissions

Transfer agents record changes of ownership, maintain the issuer's security holder records, cancel and issue certificates, and distribute dividends.  Because transfer agents stand between issuing companies and security holders, efficient transfer agent operations are critical to the successful completion of secondary trades. Section 17A(c) of the 1934 Act requires that transfer agents be registered with the SEC, or if the transfer agent is a bank, with a bank regulatory agency.  There is no SRO that governs transfer agents.  The SEC therefore has promulgated rules and regulations for all registered transfer agents, intended to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and that assure the safeguarding of securities and funds.  The rules include minimum performance standards regarding the issuance of new certificates and related recordkeeping and reporting rules, and the prompt and accurate creation of security holder records and the safeguarding of securities and funds.  The SEC also conducts inspections of transfer agents.

Information About Transfer Agent Registration
Note: Persons interested in registering as a transfer agent must review all applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Securities Act of 1933, and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as well as the applicable rules promulgated by the SEC under those Acts, before registering as a transfer agent.
The following is a brief overview of the transfer agent registration process and the annual reporting requirement for registered transfer agents.  It is not intended to be, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for reviewing all applicable provisions of the securities acts, the rules promulgated thereunder, and the applicable forms.
Note: The Commission recently adopted rule amendments to mandate electronic filing of Forms TA-1, TA-2, and TA-W on the Commissions EDGAR database.  The amendments will be effective January 11, 2007.  For more information please see release number 34-54864.
Transfer Agent Registration
Who Must Register.  Pursuant to Section 17A(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, it is unlawful for a transfer agent to perform any transfer agent function with respect to any qualifying security unless that transfer agent is registered with its appropriate regulatory authority ("ARA").  A list of ARAs is provided below.  A "qualifying security" is any security registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
When to File.  Before a transfer agent may perform any transfer agent function for a qualifying security, it must apply for registration on Form TA-1 with its ARA and its registration must become effective. 
How and Where to File.  Each registrant must file Form TA-1 with its ARA.  A registrant may determine its ARA from the following: 
A national bank or a bank operating under the Code of Law for the District of Columbia, or a subsidiary of any such bank registers with the Comptroller of the Currency. 
A state member bank of the Federal Reserve System, a subsidiary thereof, or a bank holding company registers with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 
A bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (other than a bank which is a member of the Federal Reserve System) or a subsidiary thereof registers with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
All other transfer agents register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Addresses for the ARAs can be found in the instructions to Form TA-1.
Effective Date.  Registration of a transfer agent becomes effective thirty days after receipt by the ARA of the application for registration, unless the filing does not comply with applicable requirements or the ARA takes affirmative action to accelerate, deny, or postpone registration in accordance with the provisions of Section 17A(c) of the Act.
Transfer Agent Annual Reporting Requirement
Who Must File; When to File.  Every transfer agent that is registered on December 31 must file an annual report of its activities on Form TA-2 by the following March 31.  The SEC may reject a filing that does not comply with applicable requirements.  
Withdrawal from Registration as a Transfer Agent
How to Withdraw from Registration.  Any transfer agent seeking to withdraw its registration as a transfer agent must file appropriate notice with its ARA.  If the SEC is the ARA, the transfer agent's notice of withdrawal from registration shall be filed on Form TA-W in accordance with the instructions contained thereon.  All other transfer agents must contact their ARAs for appropriate instructions. 
Effective Date.  Notice to withdraw from registration filed by a transfer agent shall become effective on the 60th day after the filing thereof with the Commission or within such shorter period of time as the Commission may determine.  If a notice to withdraw from registration is filed with the Commission any time subsequent to the date of issuance of an order instituting proceedings pursuant to Section 17A(c)(3)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or if prior to the effective date of the notice of withdrawal the SEC institutes such a proceeding or a proceeding to impose terms and conditions upon such withdrawal, the notice of withdrawal shall not become effective except at such time and upon such terms and conditions as the SEC deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or in furtherance of the purposes of Section 17A.
Transfer Agent Items to Note:
Form TA-1: The form must be filed with and approved by the appropriate regulatory agency before a transfer agent can perform any transfer agent function for a qualifying security. 
Fingerprinting Requirement:  The partners, directors, officers, and employees of a registered transfer agent shall be fingerprinted and submit their fingerprint cards to the Attorney General of the United States for identification and appropriate processing, although some exemptions do apply.  See Section 17f(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 240.17f-2 promulgated thereunder. 
Denials of Registration:  The appropriate regulatory agency shall deny, suspend, or limit the registration of a transfer agent if the transfer agent or any person associated with the transfer agent has committed certain prohibited acts enumerated in Section 15(b)(4) of the Exchange Act or is otherwise barred from associating with a registered transfer agent.  See Section 17A(c)(3) and (4) of the Exchange Act. 
Ongoing Requirements of Registration: 
Form TA-2:  Every registered transfer agent, including transfer agents whose appropriate regulatory agency is not the Commission, must file an annual report on Form TA-2 with the Commission of its previous year's activities. 
Reporting and Recordkeeping:  A registered transfer agent must comply with Section 17A of the Act and with the various reporting, recordkeeping, and other requirements in the rules promulgated under Section 17A. 
Withdrawal from Registration:  A transfer agent may terminate its registration by filing a Form TA-W with the Commission or by terminating its registration with its appropriate regulatory agency. See Rule 17Ad-16 for transfer agent responsibilities upon ceasing to perform transfer agent functions.

Transferring securities can be a complex process , which includes special rules and procedures not required when transferring other kinds of property.
Our website provides an overview of different types of securities transfers. Our website also provides directions and instruction on how to transfer securities.
Please note: CST’s website does not deal with transfers of securities held by a broker or other financial services company in their name or a nominee name. To transfer those securities, you need to contact the company holding the securities.

Investor Assistance
What is a securities transfer?
A securities transfer occurs when a change in ownership of shares, warrants, bonds, debentures or other securities is recorded on the register of security holders kept by or on behalf of the company issuing the security. Most issuing companies use transfer agents to keep the registers of securities holders.



Investor Assistance
How can I tell who the transfer agent is?
The transfer agent is the company appointed by the issuer to keep records of all security holders and to transfer ownership of securities. To determine the transfer agent of a security, first check the securities certificate. You can also check the issuing company's annual report or website.
CST is Canadian transfer agent for more than 500 companies



Investor Assistance
What do I have to do to transfer securities?
To initiate a transfer of securities, the owner, their authorized personal representative or agent (such as a lawyer or broker) must send the securities and certain legal documents to the transfer agent requesting the transfer.
The legal documents vary depending on the nature of the parties to the transfer - it may be the owner themselves or someone acting on their behalf, e.g. under a will.
This section of our website provides more information about the various types of transfers and documents required to transfer shares.



Investor Assistance
Why is it complicated to transfer securities?
Transferring securities can be complex.  However, our website provides comprehensive information and direction on the steps needed to transfer securities.
There are three main factors to consider:
          
Value of the security — There is usually no limit to the potential value of a security. Therefore securities with a nominal value at the time of transfer can substantially increase in value over time.
Relationship with the investor — The issuer and transfer agent have no long-term relationship with the person requesting the transfer. As a result, they need a way to confirm quickly that they are dealing with the appropriate person to protect themselves against a later challenge of the transfer.
Strict requirements — Securities transfer laws and established industry practices contain protections for people buying securities, which must be offset by strict transfer requirements.

Consequently, specific practices and documents unique to transferring securities have been developed and are used by all transfer agents. In particular, you should note the requirement for signature guarantees on all transfers. Canadian Stock Transfer agents cannot process transfers without signature guarantees.



Investor Assistance
What types of transfers are covered on this website?
Our website provides information about four types of transfers under Canadian law:

Basic transfers — transfers of securities from one or more individuals to one or more other individuals or entities. 
            Estate transfers — transfers of securities belonging to a person who is deceased. 
            Corporate transfers — transfers of securities held in the name of a corporation. 
            Trust transfers — transfers of securities held in the name of trustees.

Consequently, specific practices and documents unique to transferring securities have been developed and are used by all transfer agents. In particular, you should note the requirement for signature guarantees on all transfers. Canadian Stock Transfer agents cannot process transfers without signature guarantees.



Investor Assistance
What if the securities certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed?
Requirements for replacing lost, stolen or destroyed certificates vary from issuer to issuer. If your certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, learn how to replace lost securities. Replacing a certificate is a process that can take up to 8-10 weeks to complete.



Investor Assistance
Can CST sell my securities?
With two exceptions,* CST does not handle securities sales or provide price information. If you need assistance with these transactions, we suggest you contact a stockbroker or investment dealer. Information on share prices is also available in the press and on various websites.
* CST will arrange for sales of the following: 

Shares of Manulife Financial Corporation held by Canadians and represented by a share ownership statement.
Shares of Sun Life Financial Inc. held by Canadians and represented by a share ownership statement.





Investor Assistance
How do I sign the form?
Each person whose name appears on the certificate or security ownership statement must sign the securities transfer form.
Their signature must replicate their name exactly as it appears on the certificate. For example, transfers of securities registered J.S. Brown must be signed J.S. Brown, transfers of securities registered John S. Brown must be signed John S. Brown.



Investor Assistance
What is a signature guarantee?
A signature guarantee is required when transferring securities so that the transfer agent can confirm your identity. The signature guarantee is given by a financial services company and assures the transfer agent that the person(s) signing the transfer is (are) the registered holder(s) named on the certificate.
Every signature on the securities transfer form must be signature guaranteed.



Investor Assistance
Where can I get the signatures guaranteed?
We recommend obtaining a signature guarantee from a stock broker or a  financial services company that uses a medallion guarantee. The next best source for signature guarantees is a major chartered bank but some banks may not be prepared to guarantee signatures. In addition it can sometimes be difficult for transfer agents to verify the bank signing officer’s signature.
According to established industry practice, transfer agents accept signature guarantees from:

Members of a recognized medallion guarantee program:

Securities Canadian Stock Transfer Agents Medallion Program (STAMP)
Stock Exchanges Medallion Program (SEMP) 
New York Stock Exchange, Inc Medallion Signature Program (MSP)

Investor Assistance
What is a securities transfer?
A securities transfer occurs when a change in ownership of shares, warrants, bonds, debentures or other securities is recorded on the register of security holders kept by or on behalf of the company issuing the security. Most issuing companies use transfer agents to keep the registers of securities holders.



Investor Assistance
How can I tell who the transfer agent is?
The transfer agent is the company appointed by the issuer to keep records of all security holders and to transfer ownership of securities. To determine the transfer agent of a security, first check the securities certificate. You can also check the issuing company's annual report or website.
CST is Canadian transfer agent for more than 500 companies



Investor Assistance
What do I have to do to transfer securities?
To initiate a transfer of securities, the owner, their authorized personal representative or agent (such as a lawyer or broker) must send the securities and certain legal documents to the transfer agent requesting the transfer.
The legal documents vary depending on the nature of the parties to the transfer - it may be the owner themselves or someone acting on their behalf, e.g. under a will.
This section of our website provides more information about the various types of transfers and documents required to transfer shares.



Investor Assistance
Why is it complicated to transfer securities?
Transferring securities can be complex.  However, our website provides comprehensive information and direction on the steps needed to transfer securities.
There are three main factors to consider:
          
Value of the security — There is usually no limit to the potential value of a security. Therefore securities with a nominal value at the time of transfer can substantially increase in value over time.
Relationship with the investor — The issuer and transfer agent have no long-term relationship with the person requesting the transfer. As a result, they need a way to confirm quickly that they are dealing with the appropriate person to protect themselves against a later challenge of the transfer.
Strict requirements — Securities transfer laws and established industry practices contain protections for people buying securities, which must be offset by strict transfer requirements.

Consequently, specific practices and documents unique to transferring securities have been developed and are used by all transfer agents. In particular, you should note the requirement for signature guarantees on all transfers. Canadian Stock Transfer agents cannot process transfers without signature guarantees.



Investor Assistance
What types of transfers are covered on this website?
Our website provides information about four types of transfers under Canadian law:

Basic transfers — transfers of securities from one or more individuals to one or more other individuals or entities. 
            Estate transfers — transfers of securities belonging to a person who is deceased. 
            Corporate transfers — transfers of securities held in the name of a corporation. 
            Trust transfers — transfers of securities held in the name of trustees.

Consequently, specific practices and documents unique to transferring securities have been developed and are used by all transfer agents. In particular, you should note the requirement for signature guarantees on all transfers. Canadian Stock Transfer agents cannot process transfers without signature guarantees.



Investor Assistance
What if the securities certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed?
Requirements for replacing lost, stolen or destroyed certificates vary from issuer to issuer. If your certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, learn how to replace lost securities. Replacing a certificate is a process that can take up to 8-10 weeks to complete.



Investor Assistance
Can CST sell my securities?
With two exceptions,* CST does not handle securities sales or provide price information. If you need assistance with these transactions, we suggest you contact a stockbroker or investment dealer. Information on share prices is also available in the press and on various websites.
* CST will arrange for sales of the following: 

Shares of Manulife Financial Corporation held by Canadians and represented by a share ownership statement.
Shares of Sun Life Financial Inc. held by Canadians and represented by a share ownership statement.





Investor Assistance
How do I sign the form?
Each person whose name appears on the certificate or security ownership statement must sign the securities transfer form.
Their signature must replicate their name exactly as it appears on the certificate. For example, transfers of securities registered J.S. Brown must be signed J.S. Brown, transfers of securities registered John S. Brown must be signed John S. Brown.



Investor Assistance
What is a signature guarantee?
A signature guarantee is required when transferring securities so that the transfer agent can confirm your identity. The signature guarantee is given by a financial services company and assures the transfer agent that the person(s) signing the transfer is (are) the registered holder(s) named on the certificate.
Every signature on the securities transfer form must be signature guaranteed.

Where can I get the signatures guaranteed?
We recommend obtaining a signature guarantee from a stock broker or a  financial services company that uses a medallion guarantee. The next best source for signature guarantees is a major chartered bank but some banks may not be prepared to guarantee signatures. In addition it can sometimes be difficult for transfer agents to verify the bank signing officer’s signature.
According to established industry practice, transfer agents accept signature guarantees from:

Members of a recognized medallion guarantee program:

Securities Canadian Stock Transfer Agents Medallion Program (STAMP)
Stock Exchanges Medallion Program (SEMP) 
New York Stock Exchange, Inc Medallion Signature Program (MSP)

Major Canadian Schedule I Chartered Banks
Major Canadian trust companies
