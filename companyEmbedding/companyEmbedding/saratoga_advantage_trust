Saratoga Advantage Trust

Saratoga Capital Management's Official Website




Increased volatility in the stock and bond markets, global economic changes, and an ever-expanding universe of investment alternatives can leave even the most seasoned investor wondering which way to turn.
	Asset Allocation is a sophisticated method of combining different classes of investments such as large stocks, small stocks, bonds, and money market funds to develop a comprehensive investment plan. The goal of asset allocation is to create a diversified investment portfolio in accordance with the investor's personal goals and objectives.
  	The Saratoga Advantage Trust consists of seven proprietary investment portfolios, each representing a major investment asset class. The Trust incorporates all of the traditional advantages and disciplines of professional money management, with two additional benefits:

Each investment portfolio is advised by a professional money management firm with a nationally recognized expertise in managing its specific asset class. These are firms of institutional quality and integrity that manage money for some of the world's largest corporations, pension plans, hospitals and municipalities.
Each portfolio invests only in its specific asset class within the Trust's explicit investment guidelines. This ensures that the Saratoga portfolios always work hand-in-hand with your specific asset allocation. Investors should note that in other portfolios, the portfolio manager may not be required to invest in a manner that is consistent with investors' asset allocation goals, and in fact may counter the investor's asset allocation strategy by imposing a different or contrary allocation within the portfolio.

The Institutional Method — Saratoga Capital Management, LLC









































Message from the President

The Institutional Investment Methodology




Download the Full BrochureHome








Dear Investor:Thank you for your interest in the Saratoga Advantage Trust. Saratoga is an investor-focused firm committed to providing state-of-the-art, institutional-based investment services to investors. The Saratoga Advantage Trust is a reflection of that commitment, providing investors with a program in which their assets are professionally managed by an experienced team of money managers selected from among the nation's leading institutional investment advisory firms. In an effort to protect capital and create wealth, successful institutional investors (large corporations and their pension plans) have typically followed a simple investment strategy:1.  Establish investment objectives based upon their financial goals;2.  Diversify investments to try to enhance returns and protect capital by allocating their money to several types of assets such as international stocks, U.S. stocks, bonds and money market funds;3.  Hire the finest money management firms to purchase and sell securities on their behalf within their established objectives; and4.  Monitor investment results on a regular basis to determine if all of their investment objectives are being met.This institutional method of investing has remained unchanged for years, yet the expense of following this proven philosophy has prevented many investors from deriving its financial benefits. In addition, access to top-quality money managers is usually limited to investors with very large multi-million dollar accounts. The Saratoga Advantage Trust was designed to give investors the same advantages and access to professional management that larger investors have. Through your financial advisor, you have a unique opportunity to participate in a comprehensive investment program and follow the same four-step philosophy of the institutional investors without prohibitive account minimums.Whether your goals include saving for your retirement, funding your child's education, or purchasing a home, I hope you will read through this website and choose to let us help you reach your financial objectives. Best wishes, Bruce E. VentimigliaChairman, President and Chief Executive OfficerThe Saratoga Advantage Trust
