FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Fidelity takes the top spot, with Interactive Brokers and TD Ameritrade right on its heels

 Biography




 




March 18, 2017


The bull market is on sale for online brokerage customers. In the run-up to our 22nd annual ranking of Barron’s Best Online Brokers, two developments topped all others: The three major indexes—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500, and the Nasdaq Composite—all set record highs, and six brokers slashed commissions and other fees. At the 16 brokers we reviewed this year, the average monthly cost of trading for an occasional investor had fallen 25% since early 2016, to $47.51 from $63.45. That means...

Schooner Funds Celebrates Three Year Anniversary of Their Flagship Mutual Fund, and the Launch of Their Newest Alternative Mutual Fund

Dec 15, 2011, 08:27 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Schooner Investment Group, LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 15, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Despite a difficult market, it's been smooth sailing for Schooner Investment Group's flagship mutual fund, The Schooner Fund (Ticker: SCNAX). The Fund recently celebrated its three-year mark.   The Schooner team has been very happy with its performance relative to its benchmarks, the S&P 500 Index and Morningstar's Long/Short category.  In addition, Schooner Fund recently received third party analysis and ratings from Morningstar, and Lipper after achieving its three year track record.
While traditional long-only mutual funds are inherently subject to market volatility, they are rarely able to take advantage of volatility pricing. The Schooner Fund represents a new breed of funds which attempts to profit from market fluctuations while aiming to limit the downside risks of a long only portfolio. 
The Schooner Fund combines the structure of mutual funds with the trading strategies and risk mitigation techniques utilized by hedge funds.  Schooner's strategy is built around equity volatility trades utilizing U.S. large cap stocks, options and convertibles. The firm's fund managers are hedge fund veterans with long track records of working with equity derivative strategies.
Greg Levinson, Chief Investment Officer and SCNAX Portfolio Manager since August 2008, is pleased with the Fund's results to date and comments, "Our objective from inception has been to outperform both the S&P 500 Index and other funds in our peer group over a full market cycle, and do it with meaningfully less volatility and dramatically lower drawdown risk. We are extremely happy with our results."
Schooner Investment Group continues to see increasing advisor use of liquid alternative products, and anticipates the trend to continue for years. "We have every intention of being a significant player in this space," adds Levinson. Most recently the firm launched their second mutual fund, The Schooner Global Absolute Return Fund (Ticker: SARIX), and has new products and strategies in the works for 2012 release. "As demonstrated with the Schooner Fund, we seek to bring a fresh perspective to delivering risk adjusted returns. We continue to develop complementary products that we believe address advisor needs…our goal is to not just be a player, but a leader, in the alternative mutual fund marketplace!"  For more information, contact Schooner at 484-580-8086 or visit www.schoonermutualfunds.com.  
Before investing, carefully consider Schooner Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Please see the prospectus containing this and other information. To obtain a prospectus please visit www.schoonermutualfunds.com and download a copy or call (866)-724-5997.  Read it carefully before investing.
The S&P 500 Index is a broad based unmanaged index of 500 stocks, which is widely recognized as representative of the equity market in general. 
The Schooner Fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible.  Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities.  The fund may also use options and futures contracts, which have the risks of unlimited losses of the underlying holdings due to unanticipated market movements and failure to correctly predict the direction of securities prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates. The investment in options is not suitable for all investors. The fund may hold restricted securities purchased through private placements. Such securities can be difficult to sell without experiencing delays or additional costs. 
The Schooner Global Absolute Return Fund will invest in derivatives, including futures, swaps and forward foreign currency contracts, which may be more volatile than investments directly in the underlying securities, involve additional costs and may involve a small initial investment relative to the risk assumed. In addition, derivatives are subject to futures risk, swap agreement risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Exposure to commodity markets through investments in commodities futures contracts may subject the Fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates will affect the value of what the Fund owns and the Fund's share price. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve political, economic and currency risks, greater volatility and differences in accounting methods. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Short selling involves the risk of potentially unlimited increase in the market value of the security sold short, which could result in potentially unlimited loss for the Fund. Because the Fund invests in ETFs, it is subject to additional risks that do not apply to conventional mutual funds, including the risks that the market price of an ETF's shares may trade at a discount to its net asset value ("NAV"), an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained, or trading may be halted by the exchange in which they trade, which may impact a fund's ability to sell its shares. The Fund is non-diversified, meaning it may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund. Therefore, the Fund is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. This investment may not be suitable for all investors. Investments in absolute return strategies are not intended to outperform stocks and bonds during strong market rallies.
