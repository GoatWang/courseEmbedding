Overview

 

The Buffalo High Yield Fund (BUFHX) was included in an article on Seeking Alpha, which analyzed income funds that preserved principal from 2006-2016, making note of the special year-end dividend the Fund pays annually.
“Retirement income investors should always consider whether an investment has proven that it can preserve their precious capital during periods of economic disruption. Achieving that goal requires a solid business strategy executed by competent investment managers. Investors can use price charts that span good times and bad to identify funds that have preserved investment capital.” ~ Thomas Cook, article author

Dividend payments are not guaranteed. The chart included in the article illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $1,000 investment made in the Fund on 1/1/2005. It assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. The chart does not imply future performance.

Overview

 

Elizabeth Jones, Portfolio Manager for the Buffalo Large Cap Fund, was profiled in an article for Money magazine, where she identifies several stocks that can have strong growth potential in 2016.
“Fear of failure drives many mutual fund managers to spread their bets widely. Actively managed U.S. stock funds hold an average of 152 different companies, reports Morningstar. World funds average 225. The stewards of the funds on the following pages are different. They invest in 50 companies or fewer, following their best ideas with conviction—and to great success.” ~ Carolyn Bigda, article author

Overview

 
 


 Fact Sheet

 
 
 


 
 



Investment Strategy

 

The investment objective of the Buffalo Dividend Focus Fund is primarily current income, with long-term growth of capital as a secondary objective. To pursue its investment objective, the Fund invests in dividend-paying equity securities, consisting of domestic common stocks, preferred stocks, and convertible securities. During normal market conditions, at least 80% of the Fund’s assets will be invested in dividend-paying equity securities, companies that declare and pay cash dividends on at least an annual basis.
While the Fund may invest in securities of companies of any size, the Fund managers expect the majority of common stocks purchased will be of large-cap companies, those with market capitalizations in excess of $10 billion at the time of initial purchase. In addition to investments in domestic securities, the Fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets in sponsored or unsponsored ADRs and securities of foreign companies that are traded on U.S. stock exchanges.

 
 


|

We are focused on buying dividend-paying companies that can have sustainable competitive advantages, generate strong return on capital and free cash flow, have conservative balance sheets, and have great management teams.
We seek to buy these companies at reasonable valuations and believe that holding them for the long-term will generate favorable risk adjusted returns.
~ Paul Dlugosch, Portfolio Manager
~ Scott Moore, Portfolio Manager

Commentary
 Commentary for Q1 2017

 
CAPITAL MARKET OVERVIEW

Equity markets got off to a strong start in the first quarter of 2017, thanks to an improving economic outlook. In February, small business optimism, as measured by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, was at its highest level in 12 years. In addition, the University of Michigan’s March consumer confidence survey showed that consumers were more confident in the economy than they have been at any time since 2000. Against this backdrop, growth stocks outperformed value stocks, led by technology, health care, and consumer discretionary companies. The recent strength in infrastructure companies, banks, and high-tax-rate stocks stalled late in the quarter when, following Congress’s failure to agree on a health care reform bill, investors began to question the Trump administration’s ability to enact elements of its pro-growth agenda. Within commodities, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil fell 6% during the quarter in response to better than expected U.S. oil inventories and production.
The Russell 3000 Index advanced 5.74% in the first quarter and larger cap stocks outperformed smaller cap stocks. The Russell 1000 Index returned 6.03%, followed by the Russell Mid Cap Index return of 5.15%, and the Russell 2000 Index result of 2.47%. The Russell Micro Cap Index advanced just 0.38% in the quarter. The Russell 3000 Growth Index outperformed the Russell 3000 Value Index by 5.64%. Technology was the best performing sector during the quarter while the energy sector was the worst performer, driven by the decline in crude oil.
 
 
PERFORMANCE COMMENTARY

The Buffalo Dividend Focus Fund posted a return of 6.56% for the quarter and outperformed the S&P 500 Index return of 6.07%. For the quarter, the Fund’s relative outperformance was driven by the Financials, Real Estate and Energy sectors while the top detracting sector was Information Technology. The top contributors on an individual security standpoint were Apple, Inc., Noble Midstream Partners and CoreCivic while Hess Corp., ExxonMobil Corp. and QUALCOMM, Inc. were the top detractors. Within the Financials sector, the Fund’s relative outperformance during the quarter was driven by stock selection as S&P Global, Inc. gained 22.13% and Visa, Inc. rose 14.14%. S&P Global’s performance was driven by strong fourth quarter earnings as each of its business segments (Ratings, Market Intelligence and Index) reported better than expected revenue results while margins also improved relative to expectations. Visa’s performance also reflected strong fourth quarter earnings driven by the continued shift towards electronic payments as well as the consolidation of Visa Europe.
Information Technology was a drag on relative results during the period due to the sector allocation impact. While the Fund’s holdings performed slightly better than the Index during the quarter the portfolio was underweight the second best performing benchmark sector which detracted from relative results. Taking a closer look at this area we note that most of the underperformance within the Information Technology sector was specific to the Internet Software & Services subsector, which does not consist of many dividend paying companies that meet our investment criteria.
 
 
OUTLOOK

We expect the market to experience continued volatility in the coming quarters as the Federal Reserve continues to normalize interest rates along with a focus on the ability of the Trump administration to enact infrastructure spending, deregulation, and corporate tax reform. Prospective tailwinds for the economy include further job growth, wage increases, lower tax rates, and simply more optimism from both businesses and consumers; all of which could lead to higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. On the other hand, potential headwinds include potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, further increases in interest rates, and valuation metrics that are above historical market averages leading us to believe that the stock market may have a hard time achieving further multiple expansion.
Despite the expectation of continued volatility we continue to focus on wide moat, large capitalization companies that are trading at reasonable valuations, in our view. As always, the Fund will continue to focus on competitively advantaged companies that can be purchased at a fair price, in our opinion. As the stock market has continued to climb, it is getting harder to find companies that fit our investment criteria, but we continue follow our process of finding new investment ideas and to be ready when market declines provide better opportunities.
 
 

The opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Manager(s) and are subject to change, are not guaranteed and should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell any security. Fund holdings and sector allocations are subject to change and are not recommendations to buy or sell any security.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

 

The Buffalo Dividend Focus Fund received 4 stars among 1223 Large Blend funds for the three-year period ending 6/30/17.

 

In each Morningstar Category, the 10% of funds with the lowest measured risk are described as Low Risk, the next 22.5% Below Average, the middle 35% Average, the next 22.5% Above Average, and the top 10% High. Morningstar Risk is measured for up to three time periods (three, five, and 10 years). These separate measures are then weighted and averaged to produce an overall measure for the fund. Funds with less than three years of performance history are not rated.

Investment Strategy

 

The investment objective of the Buffalo International Fund is long-term growth of capital. The International Fund invests primarily in equity securities of established companies that are economically tied to various countries throughout the world (excluding the U.S.). For purposes of the International Fund’s investments, “foreign securities” means those securities issued by companies:
Organized under the laws of, or with a principal office in, a country other than the U.S. and issue securities for which the principal trading market is in a country other than the U.S.; or
That derive at least 50% of their revenues or profits from goods produced or sold, investments made, or services provided in a country other than the U.S., or have at least 50% of their assets in a country other than the U.S.
Under normal circumstances, the International Fund does not expect its investments in emerging markets to exceed 35% of its net assets.

 
 


|

When it comes to investing internationally, we believe our approach to stock selection is distinct. We are focused on finding good companies and aren’t constrained by benchmark alignment to countries or industries. Our approach is based on finding companies with sound business models, exposure to long-term secular growth trends, and attractive risk/return growth and valuation characteristics, which we can own for the long-term.
~ Bill Kornitzer, Portfolio Manager

 
 
 
 



Read More...

In selecting securities for the International Fund, the Fund managers use a bottom-up approach in choosing investments, seeking companies expected to experience growth based on the identification of long-term, measurable industry, technological, global or other trends. Companies are screened using in-depth, in-house research to identify those which the Fund managers believe have favorable attributes, including attractive valuation, strong management, conservative debt, free cash flow, scalable business models, and competitive advantages. In making portfolio selections the Fund managers will also consider the economic, political and market conditions of the various countries in which the Fund may invest.

Commentary
 Commentary for Q1 2017

 
CAPITAL MARKET OVERVIEW

Equity markets got off to a strong start in 2017, thanks to an improving economic outlook around the globe. The post-election reflation trade which caused massive sector rotation towards financials, industrials and materials at the expense of growth sectors like technology and healthcare unwound toward the end of the first quarter of 2017, as investors better under-stood the amount of political capital required to accomplish Trump’s legislative agenda. An uptick in inflation in China, Japan, and Europe continued to keep international market participants hopeful that some of the world’s major economies continued to improve. Within that backdrop, international markets performed well, with the Russell Global ex-U.S. Index advancing 8.12% versus the S&P 500 Index which increased 6.07% in the quarter.
 
 
PERFORMANCE COMMENTARY

The Buffalo International Fund returned 10.63% for the quarter which outperformed the Russell Global ex-U.S. return of 8.12%. Outperformance in the period was primarily driven by stock selection with a small benefit coming from our sector allocation impact. The top contributors to the fund’s performance in the quarter were Jenoptik AG and Broadcom Ltd. Jenoptik AG is an optoelectronics group that offers optical systems, lasers and material processing. The company benefited from increased purchases of defense systems as well as increasing penetration of optical solutions for metrology. Broadcom, a stock we’ve owned almost since the Fund’s inception, is a semiconductor manufacturer continued to benefit as cellular handset and base station suppliers continued their roll-out of 4G capabilities, which requires greater use of semiconductor filters to handle the band-width and spectrum density.
Top detractors during the period included the leisure equipment company Amer Sports Oyj, the specialty retailer Yoox Net-A-Porter, and healthcare holding Teva Pharmaceuticals. Amer Sports Oyj develops and manufactures sports and fitness equipment and clothing, including the brands Wilson, Precor and Salomon. The brands had a poor showing during the holiday season, amid delays in new product launches. Yoox Net-A-Porter is a global online luxury retailer and although sales continued to grow strongly in the most recent quarter, the company failed to bring as much of that revenue to the bottom line as expected, as they continued to work on integrating disparate systems.
Overall the healthcare market is facing a great deal of uncertainty due to efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act as well as from intense scrutiny on pharmaceutical pricing practices. Teva has been a recipient of this scrutiny and the stock has suffered accordingly. In addition, Teva’s acquisition of Actavis hasn’t provided the anticipated synergies.
 
 
OUTLOOK

Having shrugged off hysteria caused by Britain’s vote to exit the European Union (BREXIT) in mid-year 2016, and gotten past a Fed rate hike last December, the outlook for global growth has turned positive with reflationary forces being felt in China, Europe, and Japan. We are however concerned that some of the reflationary forces being propagated are due to another credit push from China, which may not be sustainable in the medium turn. In any event, the markets are acting with relief that the worst has passed and perhaps Central Banks may be moving toward market price discovery among and between assets classes. Elections are front and center in the European Union (EU), but for now, polls seem to indicate that the status quo will continue. We believe the political uncertainty in Europe should ameliorate as we move to the second half of the year, and attention again will focus on future Central Bank actions.
Overall, we continue to expect modestly improving economic growth around the globe. Our investment process is designed to favor a long-term secular growth perspective coupled within the context of our valuation and country specific macro analyses. While our process remains unchanged, we are taking incremental risks were it makes sense, while continuing to keep an eye towards the pursuit of hedging capital from potential downside risks. We continue to look for opportunities to buy or add to companies that are exposed to secular growth, improving balance sheets and sustainable business models that possess valuations which could provide appropriate prospective returns for our investors.
 
 

The opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Manager(s) and are subject to change, are not guaranteed and should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell any security. Fund holdings and sector allocations are subject to change and are not recommendations to buy or sell any security.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

 

The Buffalo International Fund received 5 stars among 324 for the three-year and 4 stars among 275 Foreign Large Growth funds for the five-year period ending 6/30/17.

 

In each Morningstar Category, the 10% of funds with the lowest measured risk are described as Low Risk, the next 22.5% Below Average, the middle 35% Average, the next 22.5% Above Average, and the top 10% High. Morningstar Risk is measured for up to three time periods (three, five, and 10 years). These separate measures are then weighted and averaged to produce an overall measure for the fund. Funds with less than three years of performance history are not rated.

Investment Strategy

 

The investment objective of the Buffalo Emerging Opportunities Fund is long-term growth of capital. The Fund invests primarily in equity securities, consisting of domestic common stocks, preferred stocks, convertible securities, warrants and rights, of companies that, at the time of purchase by the Fund, have market capitalizations of $1 billion or less.

 
 


|

We believe investing in an actively-managed portfolio of premier, early-stage, growth companies could lead to growth of capital over time. We look for companies that could benefit from long-term industrial, technological, or general market trends, and are trading at what we view as attractive valuations.
~ Craig Richard, Portfolio Manager

 
 
 
 



Read More...
While the Fund’s investments in equity securities will consist primarily of domestic securities, the Fund may also invest up to 20% of its net assets in sponsored or unsponsored ADRs and equity securities of foreign companies that are traded on U.S. stock exchanges.
The Fund managers seek to identify companies for the Fund’s portfolio that are expected to experience growth based on the identification of long-term, measurable secular trends, and which, as a result, may have potential revenue growth in excess of the gross domestic product growth rate. Companies are screened using in-depth, in-house research to identify those which the Fund managers believe have favorable attributes, including attractive valuation, strong management, conservative debt, free cash flow, scalable business models, and competitive advantages.

Commentary
 Commentary for Q1 2017

 
CAPITAL MARKET OVERVIEW

Equity markets got off to a strong start in the first quarter of 2017, thanks to an improving economic outlook. In February, small business optimism, as measured by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, was at its highest level in 12 years. In addition, the University of Michigan’s March consumer confidence survey showed that consumers were more confident in the economy than they have been at any time since 2000. Against this backdrop, growth stocks outperformed value stocks, led by technology, health care, and consumer discretionary companies. The recent strength in infrastructure companies, banks, and high-tax-rate stocks stalled late in the quarter when, following Congress’s failure to agree on a health care reform bill, investors began to question the Trump administration’s ability to enact elements of its pro-growth agenda. Within commodities, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil fell 6% during the quarter in response to better than expected U.S. oil inventories and production.
The Russell 3000 Index advanced 5.74% in the first quarter and larger cap stocks outperformed smaller cap stocks. The Russell 1000 Index returned 6.03%, followed by the Russell Mid Cap Index return of 5.15%, and the Russell 2000 Index result of 2.47%. The Russell Micro Cap Index advanced just 0.38% in the quarter. The Russell 3000 Growth Index outperformed the Russell 3000 Value Index by 5.64%. Technology was the best performing sector during the quarter while the energy sector was the worst performer, driven by the decline in crude oil.
 
 
PERFORMANCE COMMENTARY

The Buffalo Emerging Opportunities Fund posted a return of 7.13% in the quarter and outperformed the Russell 2000 Growth Index return of 5.35%. The index returns this quarter were led by strong gains in the Healthcare and Information Technology sectors of 13.63% and 6.33%, respectively. This was in stark contrast to the previous quarter after the presidential election where these two sectors were two of the worst performing sectors as investors favored Financials and Industrials given the expectations for pro-growth policies and the anticipated impact on inflation/interest rates and infrastructure spending.
The fund’s outperformance during the period was led by the Industrials sector where the Fund’s holdings delivered an average of 10.37% return compared to the index return of 1.42%. Leading the way for the fund in Industrials were Kornit Digital and Installed Building Products. Kornit is the leading provider of digital direct to garment and roll-to-roll printing, allowing for high throughput of custom apparel and other use cases based on demand. With Kornit hardware and proprietary ink, online apparel designers can produce short runs of custom pieces based solely on demand. Kornit has been a prime beneficiary in the shift in consumer’s increasing desire to purchase apparel online and a desire to have more unique pieces of clothing. In January, Ama-zon selected Kornit to deliver a large number of its Avalanche 1000 printers in support of Amazon’s growing Merch program. In conjunction with this agreement, Kornit granted Amazon warrants that do not vest until Amazon purchases significant amounts of equipment and supplies from Kornit. Installed Building Products (IBP) posted strong returns in the quarter as the housing market continues to perform well in an era of solid job market, historically low interest rates, and a demographic boost from millennials entering the housing market. IBP is the second largest new residential insulation installer in the U.S. with over 100 locations. IBP has benefited from the scale of their operation, which provides them purchasing power with vendors and labor capacity to meet demand. We believe that demographics will continue to push new single family housing starts closer to historical levels as household formation trends could potentially benefit from millennials entering prime home buying ages.
The fund’s Technology sector holdings also contributed to the outperformance in the quarter, returning 11.63% on average compared to the Index’s return of 6.33% for the sector. Instructure was one of many contributors to the outperformance in the sector. The fund has owned Instructure, a provider of learning management systems for education institutions globally (online lessons, syllabi, grades, projects, etc.), since its initial public offering (IPO) in November 2015. The company has been a disruptor in the industry, delivering a cloud-based solution with an enhanced user interface, improved mobile usability, and less downtime and upkeep for its schools and universities compared to legacy providers such as BlackBoard and Moodle. The fund looks for disruptors of industries that can execute on their strategy and Instructure has fit the bill by continuing to take market share from the legacy providers, putting up revenue growth above 20%, and gross margins above 70% that point to the potential for an attractive bottom line margin profile as the company matures.
The Healthcare sector represented a modest drag to benchmark-relative performance results given our underweight in a quarter in which the sector was the strongest performer, delivering a 13.63% return for the index. Regarding stock selection in the sector, the fund’s return of 16.03% bested the index return and was led by Omnicell. Omnicell is a leading provider of medication dispensing cabinets and management systems for acute care hospitals and has been a multi-year holding in the fund. Their solutions provide hospitals with more effective control of medications from the time they hit the loading dock until they are given at the patient’s bedside. Much like Instructure in the previous paragraph, Omnicell has been a disruptor, taking share in a ratio of 50:1 in terms of win:loss ratio versus the legacy player and market leader that is now a subsidiary of Becton Dickinson. Omnicell is in the middle of a new medical cabinet hardware release in which the upgrade cycle should last five to seven years and could provide them with a revenue opportunity of $1.8 billion. While hospital spending could be a concern given the changing healthcare reimbursement landscape, we believe Omnicell’s multi-year technology lead over their peer and the up-grade cycle has the Fund positioned in the best disruptor in the industry.
We remain focused on valuations and fundamentals and continue to monitor the risk/reward profile of our holdings. We will make changes based on market moves intra quarter that could provide either an opportunity to trim or add to a position based on potential inefficiencies in the smaller end of the market cap spectrum. We ended the quarter with 59 holdings and continue to look for prudent ways to deploy cash as we remain long-term focused, aiming to be shrewd when the market environment presents opportunity.
 
 
OUTLOOK

As the daily political headlines pass, geopolitical tensions heat up, and the realization that getting legislation passed in Washing-ton is never easy, we aim to stay consistent to our strategy of building a portfolio of securities that should benefit from underlying secular growth trends that could have thriving business models over the long term regardless of the political climate. The Buffalo Emerging Opportunities Fund is focused primarily on identifying innovation within U.S. companies with North American revenue bases. Therefore the universe of companies we review for inclusion in the fund is typically much more U.S.-centric than most mid and large cap companies. We like this positioning given the dollar appreciation and foreign policy uncertainty. In addition, U.S. consumer and small business confidence are near or at all-time highs which should also bode well for our smaller, U.S.-centric companies. Additionally, we continue to believe the landscape for potential acquisitions could benefit the fund as larger companies continue to search out areas for growth as we enter year nine of the current bull market.
 
 

The opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Manager(s) and are subject to change, are not guaranteed and should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell any security. Fund holdings and sector allocations are subject to change and are not recommendations to buy or sell any security.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

 

The Buffalo Emerging Opportunities Fund received 2 stars among 599 for the three-year, 3 stars among 533 for the five-year, and 2 stars among 398 Small Growth funds for the ten-year period ending 6/30/17.

 

In each Morningstar Category, the 10% of funds with the lowest measured risk are described as Low Risk, the next 22.5% Below Average, the middle 35% Average, the next 22.5% Above Average, and the top 10% High. Morningstar Risk is measured for up to three time periods (three, five, and 10 years). These separate measures are then weighted and averaged to produce an overall measure for the fund. Funds with less than three years of performance history are not rated.

Share Article

















New faces and initiatives expected to ignite growth







This is a firm with a great story, great product offerings, and some really talented investment professionals.


MISSION, Kansas (PRWEB)
July 26, 2012
 Buffalo Funds is taking bold steps to reach new markets, expand brand awareness, and compete better in the crowded mutual fund marketplace.  Tony DeMarino was recently brought on board as Head of Global Distribution to lead the sales and marketing team in packaging and selling the Buffalo Funds family of ten no-load mutual funds.  Formerly with Scout Investments, DeMarino understands both the challenges and rewards he can expect in growing the firm’s AUM and reputation.
DeMarino explains, “I accepted this position because of the great opportunity – for me personally and for the Buffalo Funds.  This is a firm with a great story, great product offerings, and some really talented investment professionals.  I want my team to take that message nationwide and let the investment community know they need to give us a closer look.  You may not have heard of Buffalo Funds before, but we expect you’re going to hear a lot about us going forward.”
As part of the expansion efforts, sales representatives will be added to provide better coverage for the Intermediary channel in the Midwest and Eastern regions.  The Western U.S. will continue to be handled by Ned Meloni.  Dwight Twillman will continue in his role of sales consultant for the institutional/pension plan investors.
To learn more about the Buffalo Funds, visit http://www.buffalofunds.com or call 1-800-49-BUFFALO.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.
The Funds’ investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing.

Read carefully before investing.
While the Funds are no-load, management fees and other expenses will apply. Please refer to the prospectus for further details.

                BUFEX, BUFMX, BUFSX, BUFIX: Top Buffalo Funds for Retirement            


    By Brian Mathews | Updated August 24, 2016 — 3:01 PM EDT    






Share


















































Buffalo Funds is based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The founder, John Kornitzer, created the company in 1994 and has built a team of dedicated and experienced professionals to lead its fund lineup. Buffalo Funds has 10 different funds in the areas of income, domestic equity and international equity. Buffalo Funds provides its clients with a long-term investment option through patient investing backed by intelligent research.
Even though Buffalo Funds only offers 10 different options for investors, retirement diversification is still possible since most funds are style-specific according to market capitalization. An investor could use the following five funds to establish a well-diversified retirement portfolio.
Buffalo Large Cap Fund (BUFEX)
Buffalo Funds' flagship Large Cap Fund can be a core holding of any retirement portfolio. The fund's portfolio manager, Elizabeth Jones, has been at the helm since 2007. The fund looks to invest in large-cap stocks with strong management teams, little debt, free cash flow and other attractive valuations. As of Sept. 30, 2015, the fund has total assets of $49 million and it has an expense ratio of 0.94%.
The fund has given investors an average return of 7.78% on a 10-year basis. Although this is slightly less than the benchmark’s Russell 1000 Growth Index return of 8.09%, the fund takes considerably less risk. The fund has a beta of 0.88 and an alpha of 4.41, indicating that it performs better on a risk-adjusted basis than the benchmark. Investors looking for exposure to the large-cap sector with a good track record should look to the Buffalo Large Cap Fund.
Buffalo Mid Cap Fund (BUFMX)
Buffalo’s Mid Cap Fund is managed by Dave Carlsen and Bob Male using a comprehensive team approach. The managers look to maintain a fund with 50 to 70 stock positions of mid-cap companies that are fundamentally strong. The fund looks to purchase stocks that have been negatively affected by short-term events or that are underappreciated in value. Currently, the fund's total assets equal $405 million and it has an expense ratio of 1.01%.
The fund has performed on an average level over the long term. Over the 10-year average, the fund annualizes at 7.19%, which is 0.9% lower than the benchmark. The fund’s largest holdings are Hospira, Lions Gate Entertainment and WhiteWave Foods. The managers look to take advantage of positive forward trends, as it is overweight in the financial and industrials sectors of the market.
Buffalo Small Cap Fund (BUFSX)
The small-cap asset class is historically one of the most volatile investment classes, yet it has the potential to provide the greatest returns. The Buffalo Small Cap Fund is managed by Jamie Cuellar and Bob Male, and it holds $850 million in assets. Like its other equity funds, the Small Cap Fund looks to invest in 50 to 70 stocks that are fundamentally strong.
The Small Cap Fund has a superior longer-term track record, but it has underperformed in more recent years. Since the fund's inception in 1998, the fund has produced an average return of 10.94%. This is far above the benchmark's return of 4.89%. However, when looking at the five-, three- and one-year averages, the benchmark has outperformed. This volatile asset class is best held with a long-term perspective.
Buffalo International Fund (BUFIX)
The International Fund is the only fund in Buffalo's lineup with international exposure. Nicole and William Kornitzer run the fund; they have both been with the firm since 2004. The International Fund screens premier international growth companies with similar criteria as the domestic equity funds. The managers invest in 65 to 85 positions with a specific country analysis that helps frame risk versus reward for each position.
The fund has significantly outperformed its benchmark over every average period. The five-year annual average produced a return of 4.05%, versus the benchmark’s 1.82%. The fund also does well in terms of managing risk, with a beta of 0.78 and an alpha of 3.51. Investors seeking international exposure with excellent risk-adjusted performance should consider the Buffalo International Fund.
Buffalo High Yield Fund (BUFHX)
As the only true fixed income fund in Buffalo's lineup, the High Yield Fund rounds out the list for a diversified portfolio. Managed by a team of four Certified Financial Analysts (CFAs), the fund looks to generate current income while growing over the long term. The fund consists of 67% corporate bonds, 15% convertible bonds, and the rest in dividend and preferred stocks.
Overall, the fund has performed well versus the benchmark index on a long-term basis. On the three-year average, the fund annualizes a total return of 4.79% versus the benchmark's return of 3.46%. This return comes at a lower risk level, with the fund having a beta of 0.55 and an alpha of 2.81. Investors seeking a high current income of 3.46% should take a look at the Buffalo High Yield Fund.

$5 Million Awarded to Three Firms to Spur High-Growth Technology Commercialization 







WYSIWYGGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced $5 million has been awarded to three Upstate investment firms to spur new business and create jobs in communities across Upstate New York. The funding, part of the Governor's $50 million Innovation Venture Capital Fund program, will be matched by at least $5 million in private sector investment capital to enable new businesses to work with colleges and universities to accelerate the research and development and marketing of their technologies. Investment firms in Rochester, Buffalo and Syracuse will strategically invest the funds.  "By giving entrepreneurs the tools and resources that they need to succeed, we can turn ideas into real, marketable solutions," Governor Cuomo said. "The Innovation Venture Capital Fund does just that – it empowers creators to realize their potential, competitively attracting business and creating jobs in communities all across New York."   The three Upstate firms that will invest the funds are Excell Partners, LLC in Rochester, SCP Buffalo Incubator/Z80 Labs LLC in Buffalo, and CenterState CEO's Grants for Growth in Syracuse. Investment of funds by each firm will be leveraged with matching private sector investment capital at a ratio of at least 1:1. Recipients of the venture funding will receive pre-seed stage investments of up to $100,000.  The $50 million New York State Innovation Venture Capital Fund program supports the transition from ideas and research to marketable products or services, accelerates seed and early-stage business formation and provides investment funding to support, and attracts high growth, technology based companies to New York State. The fund is expected to leverage at least $100 million in private capital to support high growth areas including advanced materials, clean technology, life sciences/biotechnology and information technology.  Empire State Development President, CEO & Commissioner Kenneth Adams said, "The three firms approved for funding were selected based on their qualifications, track record and proposed investment strategy. Their equity investments into pre-seed companies will help ensure our State's innovative technologies have the support necessary to move from the lab to marketplace."  Excell Partners, a for-profit affiliate of the University of Rochester, was approved for $2 million in NYS Innovation Venture Capital funds to invest in pre-seed stage businesses, including those focused on life sciences, energy, software and consumer products located in the Southern Tier, Western New York, Finger Lakes, Capital, and Central New York regions. Excell has successfully invested in more than 41 seed stage companies since its launch in 2005. Excell was also selected as a participant in ESD's Innovate NY Fund investment program.  Excell Partners, Inc. CEO Theresa Mazzullo said, "We thank ESD for their ongoing confidence in Excell. This award is particularly important for upstate because its focus is on the pre-seed stage in life science, energy and advanced materials, three areas that are seriously challenged for capital. Excell is proud of its track record for investing in these industry segments. This award will allow Excell to continue to identify, invest and support high potential, high tech startups in New York."   SCP Buffalo Incubator/Z80 Labs LLC was approved for $1.5 million in NYS Innovation Venture Capital funds to invest in pre-seed stage companies in Western New York – a region that has strong growth potential in the internet broadband and life sciences spaces. The business and its managing partners will operate under the umbrella of Seed Capital Partners, a successful northeast early stage technology focused venture capital firm. SCP Buffalo Incubator/Z80 Labs was also selected as a participant in the Innovate NY Fund investment program.  "We are excited to receive this additional award that will allow us to continue the extraordinary momentum the Governor's Buffalo Billion initiative has generated including the 43North Buffalo Business Plan Competition, our Accellerator Z80 Labs and the addition of dozens of new start-ups that have begun to generate job, excitement and opportunity here in Buffalo," said Jordan Levy, General Partner Softbank Capital. "With the support of ESD to date, we have funded a dozen start-ups that are now employing almost forty people, now, with this new grant, we will be able to help a few dozen additional entrepreneurs get their business ideas off the ground and follow their dreams and at the same time build a new economy culture in our New York State."   Grants for Growth, managed by CenterState CEO, was approved for $1.5 million in NYS Innovation Venture Capital funding to manage the technology commercialization and pre-seed stage company investment by leveraging the support, mentoring and commitment of the state-funded Innovation Hot Spots in Central New York, the North Country and Southern Tier regions. By joining forces, the fund will extend its reach to cover 22 counties of Upstate New York, including leading regional sources of innovation, incubation and commercialization, plus research and technology transfer at institutions like Clarkson University, Cornell University, Syracuse University and upstate SUNY campuses.  "This fund builds on Grants for Growth's eight-year track record of supporting commercialization by uniquely aligning three of New York's Innovation Hot Spots," said Seth Mulligan, VP of Innovation Services at CenterState CEO. "The evolution and scale-up of this program would not be possible if not for the vision and commitment of New York State Senator John DeFrancisco, who has supported Grants for Growth since its inception. Now, with an even more robust network of academic partners, mentors and innovation resources, we are positioned to leverage the state's investment to successfully launch even more new startups and create new, high-quality jobs across these regions."  The three Upstate firms were chosen through a competitive process. Additional investments to spur business development and jobs through firms in the New York City, Long Island and Mid-Hudson regions will be announced soon.  About the NYS Innovation Venture Capital Fund  The NYS Innovation Venture Capital Fund is part of Governor Cuomo's broader commercialization agenda in order to encourage innovation and drive economic growth in communities across the State. It is being coordinated with the State's existing business resources and innovation investments, including the Governor's START-UP NY program, Innovation Hot Spots, the Regional Economic Development Councils, the Centers of Advanced Technology and Centers of Excellence networks and the SUNY 2020 Initiative.  As part of his Opportunity Agenda, the Governor has proposed expanding the program and doubling the fund to $100 million in the 2015-16 Executive Budget.
