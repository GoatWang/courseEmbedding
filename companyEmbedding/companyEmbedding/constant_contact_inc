History[edit]
The company was founded as Roving Software in 1995, taking its present name in 2004.[4]
In May 2010, Constant Contact acquired NutshellMail,[5] a free tool that lets users monitor their social media accounts from their email. As reported by Mashable.com,[6] Constant Contact recently released other social media features, such as Social Stats, which lets users see how often their emails or events have been shared on social media platforms.
On February 16, 2011, Constant Contact acquired social CRM start-up Bantam Live.[7]
In 2012, Constant Contact acquired two companies. On January 19, they announced the acquisition of CardStar, a mobile loyalty application.[8] On June 13, they also acquired digital storefront provider SinglePlatform for approximately $65 million.[9]
In April 2014, Constant Contact announced the launch of Toolkit, an all-in-one online marketing platform that integrates multi-channel marketing options - including email, social, mobile, and Web – to drive customer campaigns of all types. Toolkit offers 15 different campaign types along with real-time reporting metrics.[10] 2014 also saw the launch of Constant Contact's Small Business Innovation Program, an accelerator designed to help entrepreneurs and startups creating products and services for small businesses. The program is hosted in the company's 30,000 square foot InnoLoft office space, located in the Waltham, MA headquarters.[11]
In November 2015, Constant Contact was acquired for $1.1 billion by Endurance International.[12]

Self-promotion[edit]
In 2007, the company was criticized by blogger Darren Barefoot on the grounds that its current and former employees responded deceptively to negative reviews of its products, services, and business practices. They posted positive comments about the company while concealing their affiliation with Constant Contact.[13][14]
The company's response:

Kevin Mullins ... acknowledges that the comments on Barefoot's site were made by Constant Contact employees, but stresses that they acted against company rules. “They acted outside our corporate policy. They were disciplined, absolutely. And obviously, we educated them about the proper way to blog and to fully disclose who you are. We believe in being honest and up front about who you are.”[15]

History[edit]
The company was founded as Roving Software in 1995, taking its present name in 2004.[4]
In May 2010, Constant Contact acquired NutshellMail,[5] a free tool that lets users monitor their social media accounts from their email. As reported by Mashable.com,[6] Constant Contact recently released other social media features, such as Social Stats, which lets users see how often their emails or events have been shared on social media platforms.
On February 16, 2011, Constant Contact acquired social CRM start-up Bantam Live.[7]
In 2012, Constant Contact acquired two companies. On January 19, they announced the acquisition of CardStar, a mobile loyalty application.[8] On June 13, they also acquired digital storefront provider SinglePlatform for approximately $65 million.[9]
In April 2014, Constant Contact announced the launch of Toolkit, an all-in-one online marketing platform that integrates multi-channel marketing options - including email, social, mobile, and Web – to drive customer campaigns of all types. Toolkit offers 15 different campaign types along with real-time reporting metrics.[10] 2014 also saw the launch of Constant Contact's Small Business Innovation Program, an accelerator designed to help entrepreneurs and startups creating products and services for small businesses. The program is hosted in the company's 30,000 square foot InnoLoft office space, located in the Waltham, MA headquarters.[11]
In November 2015, Constant Contact was acquired for $1.1 billion by Endurance International.[12]

Self-promotion[edit]
In 2007, the company was criticized by blogger Darren Barefoot on the grounds that its current and former employees responded deceptively to negative reviews of its products, services, and business practices. They posted positive comments about the company while concealing their affiliation with Constant Contact.[13][14]
The company's response:

Kevin Mullins ... acknowledges that the comments on Barefoot's site were made by Constant Contact employees, but stresses that they acted against company rules. “They acted outside our corporate policy. They were disciplined, absolutely. And obviously, we educated them about the proper way to blog and to fully disclose who you are. We believe in being honest and up front about who you are.”[15]

History[edit]
The company was founded as Roving Software in 1995, taking its present name in 2004.[4]
In May 2010, Constant Contact acquired NutshellMail,[5] a free tool that lets users monitor their social media accounts from their email. As reported by Mashable.com,[6] Constant Contact recently released other social media features, such as Social Stats, which lets users see how often their emails or events have been shared on social media platforms.
On February 16, 2011, Constant Contact acquired social CRM start-up Bantam Live.[7]
In 2012, Constant Contact acquired two companies. On January 19, they announced the acquisition of CardStar, a mobile loyalty application.[8] On June 13, they also acquired digital storefront provider SinglePlatform for approximately $65 million.[9]
In April 2014, Constant Contact announced the launch of Toolkit, an all-in-one online marketing platform that integrates multi-channel marketing options - including email, social, mobile, and Web – to drive customer campaigns of all types. Toolkit offers 15 different campaign types along with real-time reporting metrics.[10] 2014 also saw the launch of Constant Contact's Small Business Innovation Program, an accelerator designed to help entrepreneurs and startups creating products and services for small businesses. The program is hosted in the company's 30,000 square foot InnoLoft office space, located in the Waltham, MA headquarters.[11]
In November 2015, Constant Contact was acquired for $1.1 billion by Endurance International.[12]

Self-promotion[edit]
In 2007, the company was criticized by blogger Darren Barefoot on the grounds that its current and former employees responded deceptively to negative reviews of its products, services, and business practices. They posted positive comments about the company while concealing their affiliation with Constant Contact.[13][14]
The company's response:

Kevin Mullins ... acknowledges that the comments on Barefoot's site were made by Constant Contact employees, but stresses that they acted against company rules. “They acted outside our corporate policy. They were disciplined, absolutely. And obviously, we educated them about the proper way to blog and to fully disclose who you are. We believe in being honest and up front about who you are.”[15]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Powerful Email Marketing, Made Simple.
Create professional emails that bring customers to your door.


























Email marketing is good for your business. $38-back-for-every-$1-spent kind of good.* And with a tool as powerful and easy to use as Constant Contact, you don’t need to be a marketing expert to see results.
*Direct Marketing Association 2015






Professional emails start with customizable templates.
First, drag. Then, drop. Editing is that simple. Our editor makes it easy to customize the email template of your choice to look like the business your customers know.




WATCH VIDEO1:23s






Mobile-responsive templates ensure your subscribers can see your email on any device.












Automatically send the right message at the right time.
Personalized welcome, birthday, and anniversary emails.
Personalized emails build connections, and our autoresponder makes it simple. Create a personalized email once, and set it to send automatically for triggers like birthdays or a customer milestone.
Set a series of emails for your contact lists.
Set it and forget it functionality, for your email. When you add new contacts to your automated list, they’ll start receiving a scheduled series of emails. Your audience stays engaged, and ready to take action.















Contact management, with less of the "management."
Easily upload your email list from Excel, Gmail, Outlook, and more. We’ll handle the rest: unsubscribes, bounces, and inactive emails update automatically.










No list? No problem.
Free tools let you easily add new contacts in-person, from your Facebook page, or on your website.












Get your message in front of more people. Track your success in real time.
Hit send and post your emails to your social networks (we’ll suggest the captions and images) all at once. Our email tracking tools tell you who's opening, clicking, and sharing your emails and social posts in real time, so you can plan your next steps.
98% of Constant Contact emails hit customers' inboxes. Only 77% of regular email does.















Tools to make your email work even harder.






Limitless Possibilities
Our PLUS features give you the power to extend your marketing beyond the inbox. So now you can start with email, and then connect with people to drive business in new ways, like live events, trackable coupons, online surveys, and more. And you can manage it all in one place.

You have questions? We have answers.





How do I get started?
Just sign up for a free trial, and you’ll get 60 days to check out all of our Email PLUS features. At the end of the trial, you can stick with Email PLUS or choose our Email package instead.


How will I be billed?
You'll be charged a monthly flat fee based on how many email addresses are in your Constant Contact account. If your contact list changes before the next billing cycle, we'll automatically adjust your fee. And we promise: No hidden per-email or per-credit fees.




Why don’t you offer email marketing for free?
We offer a free trial, but we believe in the power of email marketing to help businesses like yours succeed. We continuously invest in our features and services to deliver the best product and experience possible. As your favorite uncle says: You get what you pay for.


Do you offer discounts?
Yes! Prepay for six or 12 months at the time of purchase and we’ll discount your monthly price. Nonprofits can save even more. We also offer special plans for those needing multiple accounts, such as franchises and associations, and businesses with contact lists that surpass 10,000. If this is you, congrats! Call 855-783-2314.




How many emails can I send?
As many as you’d like. No matter how many subscribers are on your list, you get unlimited sends with both the Email and Email PLUS packages.


What’s the deal with your 30-day money-back guarantee?
It’s pretty simple: If you cancel within 30 days of activating your account, you'll receive a full refund. No questions asked.  View Terms & Conditions




What’s included in my free trial?
The trial allows you to kick the tires before making a commitment. You’ll have access to all of the tools, features, and live support offered in our Email and Email PLUS plans. Send unlimited emails—but only to 100 contacts while in trial. No credit card is required, so after two months we hope you’ll stay with Constant Contact.


I don’t have a mailing list. Can I buy one from you?
No. We do not sell lists, nor do we ever sell our customers’ proprietary lists. But we believe in your ability to grow your list organically. That’s why all of our plans include list-building tools for your website, Facebook page, in store, and on the go!




I’m busy. Can you help with my email marketing?
Absolutely! We’re experts at email marketing—and we love to help. Check out our Services offerings. And if you offer marketing services yourself and would like to partner with us, check out our Partner Program.


I love your plans, but I’m not the decision maker. What can I do?
We have a pricing plan PDF that you can download and print so you can discuss Constant Contact with the person who makes those decisions. You can also email the PDF if you’re ready to share the love right now.








Let's talk business.  Your business.
We're happy to discuss your email marketing needs—and to help you choose the right plan.

ABOUT


















The tools. The people.
The drive to help small business do more business.




















The Constant Contact Promise. Watch what we believe [3:08s]



Our Promise

One tool, for all your marketing. That’s the Constant Contact Toolkit. Our customers get real results through marketing campaigns like email newsletters, surveys, events, Facebook promotions, online listings, and more. But it’s not just about the product: award-winning support and free marketing resources are there to make the path to success smoother.


When we talk about our Promise, we’re talking about our commitment to helping small businesses and nonprofits succeed. How? Our customers get real results through email newsletters, surveys, events, Facebook promotions, online listings, and more. But it’s not just about the product: we knew our customers wanted to talk to real people when they had a question. And they needed help figuring out the right marketing strategy for their organization. So we made sure it was always just a phone call away, or with network of expert-taught classes and training, their neighborhood. It’s how we smooth our customers’ path to success.





Where it all started

Constant Contact was founded as “Roving Software” in 1995, setting up shop in a cramped attic in Brookline, Massachusetts. Back then, email was usually viewed as just a way for friends to communicate online. But our founders saw what it could be: a valuable marketing tool that would help small businesses level the playing field in the battle against big business.


By 2005, we surpassed 50,000 customers. Fenway Park couldn’t hold a crowd that big.


Just two years later we doubled the 50k mark it had taken us a decade to reach—introducing a second product and taking our company public in the process.


In 2009, Constant Contact reached all-new milestones: A third product (Event Marketing), more customers than ever (250,000), and a second office (Loveland, CO).


The next three years saw more new offices (San Francisco, UK) and powerful new products like Social Campaigns, SaveLocal, and SinglePlatform. To support it all, we ramped up our coaching and support operations, adding online chat, email, and tons of local classes and seminars for face—to—face learning.


In 2014, we unveiled our biggest innovation yet: a powerful new interface designed to be the all-in-one marketing solution. Through it all, we kept to our mission: to empower small businesses and nonprofits to grow customer relationships and succeed.


In 2016, Constant Contact was acquired by Endurance International Group—a deal that brought together two long-standing, successful Massachusetts companies to create a Boston-based public company of significant scale—and one absolutely passionate about helping small businesses succeed.


Today, Constant Contact operates as an Endurance business unit—the largest in its portfolio of brands, which also includes Bluehost, HostGator, and iPage. Endurance offers everything a small business needs to get online and grow online, including web hosting, domains, ecommerce, emarketing, and mobile business tools. We are five million small business customers strong…and growing.


Every day we challenge ourselves to find new ways to deliver on the promise of Endurance’s mission:  help small businesses navigate the promise, power, and potential of the web.

Here at Constant Contact, we are an industry leader in email delivery.  This is no accident.  All of our Terms and Conditions are designed to ensure the best possible delivery rate.  That being said, it’s expected that most email campaigns will have some level of bounces.  Knowing the cause and reasons behind these bounces can help you as a marketer to ensure you are mailing to the cleanest, most engaged list that you can.  Last month, I spoke about Non-Existent and Suspended Bounces, in this post I will be detailing Undeliverable and Blocked bounce types.

Knowing the cause and reasons behind these bounces can help you as a marketer ensure you are mailing to the most current, engaged list that you can. Over the next few months, I will be writing about Constant Contact’s various bounce categories to (hopefully) clear up any questions you may have. In this post, I will be focusing on Non-Existent and Suspended Bounces.

Business Response: Thank you for sharing your experience as we welcome and invite feedback so we can continue to improve the customer experience. In reviewing your case and the documentation provided to you, it appears there might be some confusion on how the pricing works. We charge monthly based off of the highest number of contacts from the previous billing cycle, so an account that fluctuates the number of contacts greatly could be affected by this. Our support team is always at the ready to help adjust your billing and settings accordingly to make sure every email marketing campaign is a success. We'd be more than happy to clarify any confusion or answer any question you have. Please feel free to reach out to our team at social_support(at)constantcontact(dot)com if you wish to speak with us further about any of your concerns.    5★on Google, Aug 03, 2016 Helen Lemoine   This is the best program by far for our nonprofit organization.

People entered the main entrance by climbing two flights of steps. There is also a parking garage underneath, and presumably there's a place for handicap entry as well.The lobby is impressive. Open, full of start-up rentals, computer and game kiosks, and snack bars stocked with food, drink coolers, and Flavia coffee machines.

The tables, long curved conference desks actually, have wheels and the whole room looks as though it's configurable for different types of events. There is a wireless network available for guests, the password posted prominently along the walls.The one flaw in the room is a giant pillar near the front that makes it difficult to see all the panelists if you sit on the left hand side of the room.A great place for a meeting, and thanks to Constant Contact for generously hosting these sessions. more » I attended a meeting of the Boston Entrepreneurs Network in the Constant Contact meeting room.
