	List of experiments which can be run on the TAXA platform







The TAXA platform has been specifically designed to enable anyone to undertake metabolic engineering of plants to create novel consumer applications.  The platform has four pillars, or components, and users can pick and choose which parts they need and what experiments to run in order to develop their specific application. 






Protein EngineeringOptimizing proteins in plants is hard, slow work; it can be  significantly more efficient to first optimize your target proteins in  bacteria, like E. coli. The key limitation here is the assay, of course. We have two systems that allow us to perform protein engineering on the entire pathway:Directed Evolution: we mutagenize the plasmid randomly and then screen for variations which improve performance. This is faster and cheaper than the saturation scan but produces more false positives which improve the genes in E. Coli but don't translate into plants (eg through codon optimization)Saturation Scan: We step through each codon in the pathway and substituted the other 19 possible amino acids that could be inserted at that point. We've tested this on pathways up to 2,000 amino acids long. Hits generated with this method are more likely to translate into higher performance in plants, but the process is more expensive than directed evolution.We've automated most of the process for doing this and hope to have a fully automated system working shortly. Automated DNA Assembly SystemWe've automated our DNA assembly system which means no more nights in the lab working on cloning. The additional bonus of working with us is that you get a whole library of standardized parts, including promotors, terminators and selectable markers that allow you to rapidly and affordably design and assemble many combinations of your target pathway genes for testing in vivo. Currently all of our parts are in the Golden Braid assembly system; we are in the process of adding support for MoClo parts. You can design your sequences using your favorite DNA editing software. The list and description of available parts can be found on github at https://github.com/Taxa/DNAlibrary.Transient ExperimentsTransient experiments are designed to enable you to test a DNA construct quickly and without the expense of a stable transformation. This allows a relatively large number of constructs to be tested quickly and affordably. Again the key bottleneck here is the assay. We are developing new protocols all the time - currently we offer the following experiments:Callus: Arabidopsis, N. tabacum, RoseSeedlings: Arabidopsis, N. tabacum, PetuniaLeaf tissue: N. tabacumPetal tissue: Rose, PetuniaEpidermis: OnionIf the assay you need isn't listed above then get in touch with us as it may be something we are already working on.Stable TransformationWe generally use the biolistic method for stable transformation, though we do have agro-bacterium methods available in case you want to prototype a construct more cheaply. While the biolistic method is slower and more expensive to generate a single plant, it's key advantage is that - if care is chosen with DNA parts used - the final product is immediately free for sale and distribution in the United States without requiring regulatory review. This saves years and millions of dollars from the budget for getting the product to market.Plant species which are currently available for transformation are listed in the table below. If there's another species you'd like to transform for a specific application please get in touch and we'll be happy to discuss what we can do to accelerate development of a transformation protocol for that species.

TAXA Biotechnologies





The TAXA platform has been specifically designed to enable anyone to perform metabolic engineering of plants without stepping into a lab. We provide access to protein engineering, DNA assembly, transient experiments and stable transformation as a service. The best thing is that anything "Powered by TAXA" is designed to be free from expensive regulatory approval, meaning the products are available for sale or distribution to consumers in the United States immediately after they are developed. For a detailed list of the experiments which can be run on our platform please see the Services page.  Our vision is a world where bio-engineering is as easy and commonplace as mobile application development is today. Game-changing technologies, like genetic engineering, should not be the exclusive preserve of large corporations and a wealthy elite. Democratizing the tools of creation enables anyone, anywhere, to genetically engineer plants and will unleash a wave of creativity to power an environment where ultimately what we create is limited only by our imagination.  The TAXA platform is our next step in the realization of that dream.  To get started with TAXA simply get in touch using the contact form below. We'll be in touch to discuss your idea and what you want to achieve and whether it can be developed with our current infrastructure.﻿

	About


	Who, what, where and why







TAXA is the plural of taxon. It's what we do: Powered by TAXA means the new organism has been engineered by combining genes from different taxons. We are at a unique period in history: the development of recombinant DNA techniques makes horizontal gene transfer possible for the first time in multi-cellular organisms. Previously, genetic developments which evolved in one taxon couldn't combine with genes which evolved in another taxon. Now they can, and we are just beginning to explore what that means. It's an exciting time to work in bio-engineering. Join our journey.TAXA is also unique as a biological word which can be spelled using the four DNA base pairs plus synthetically engineered base pair (X,Y).
Company history
The company was founded just before the successful Kickstarter campaign to make a Glowing Plant in April 2013. The crowdfunding campaign was a great success, exceeding it's goals by more than 700%. This gave us the opportunity, with backers support, to not just make a glowing plant by simply inserting the lux genes, but to go beyond and also improve the luminosity as much as possible. As with many things in synthetic biology, the key to improving the luminosity of the plant was to develop the infrastructure to design, assemble and test a large number of different DNA constructs in order to find the version which gives the greatest luminosity. It's this infrastructure which evolved into the TAXA platform.
Management

Antony Evans, CEO, focuses on the non-technical aspects of the business including business development, marketing, fundraising, external communication and regulation. He has an MBA with Distinction from INSEAD, an MA in Maths from the University of Cambridge and is a graduate of Singularity University’s GSP program. He is both a Louis Frank and Oppidan scholar and worked for six years as a management consultant and project manager at Oliver Wyman and Bain & Company. Prior to TAXA he lead the Glowing Plant Kickstarter campaign, led product development for the world’s first pure mobile microfinance bank in the Philippines and launched a mobile app in partnership with Harvard Medical School that has over 250,000 downloads.

2016 Annual Report



		4/30/2017
	



		0 Comments
	


 


It’s my pleasure to bring you our first Annual Report. Now that we have a large number of investors, following our successful Title III equity crowd-raise on WeFunder, we will use this report to keep you all updated on the condition of our business and any changes to our business plan as it evolves over time.

In this report you will find an update on our business strategy and plan, information on the Company and capital structure and our 2016 Financial Statements.

We plan to launch Orbella, our fragrant moss product, very soon. The design, packaging and branding work is all complete and we are just figuring out the final issues in manufacturing/production. When we do launch I hope you can help us by tweeting, Facebook sharing and otherwise spreading the launch online. If you have connections to journalists or online distributors now would also be a great time to introduce those to us.

Thank you once again for the trust and faith you have shown by investing in TAXA. It truly is an honor to have your support and I’m continually humbled by the belief you have shown in what we are working on, even more so given that we have not met many of you in person. Without that trust our mission to use biotechnology to create a more sustainable future would just not be possible.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions, comments, concerns or interesting ideas to share with us.

Antony Evans

TAXA platform launch enables anyone to design novel consumer plants without stepping into a lab



		4/23/2015
	



		0 Comments
	


 

We are excited to announce the launch of the TAXA platform at Synbiobeta.  The TAXA platform has been specifically designed to engineering novel metabolic pathways into plants for the development of new consumer applications without ever needing to step into a lab. We keep costs low using the latest automation technologies and our system allows insertion and optimization of pathways up to ten genes long.   But the best thing is that we make our plants in such a way that we can ship them to customers in the United states free from any regulatory approval process so that developers can sell and distribute them immediately they are ready. This dramatically reduces the cost and time of bringing a product to market, and allows pursuit of an agile product development strategy where bioentrepreneurs release successive versions of a product which improve over time. Working online also means developers can take a product to market no matter the restrictive local regulations on synthetic biology imposed by European bureaucrats.  The TAXA platform has been developed by the team behind the Glowing Plant project, we've taken the infrastructure we built to make the glowing plant brighter and are making it available to other third party app developers.   Our vision is a world where everyone has access to the tools of synthetic biology, where you don't need a phd or millions of dollars in funding to express your creativity and develop a new biological application. We expect that by reducing the barriers to engineering plants we can unleash a wave of creativity and develop hundreds and ultimately thousands of new genetically engineered apps.  For more information please visit http://www.taxa.com Contact  To learn more about this please contact:  Antony Evans, founder & CEO  665 3rd Street, Suite 230, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA Tel: +1-415-779-6333 antony@taxa.com

WHAT WE DOWe enable cheaper, faster, and better genetic engineering of plants. We offer our platform both as a service to other companies and use it internally to develop our own engineered plants. We make money from platform access service fees and from royalties on the sale of the final products. Our first product is a Glowing Plant, which was the first Kickstarter for a synthetic biology… · More application earning us over $600k in pre-orders. We are also close to shipping a Fragrant Moss.OUR AMBITIONGenetic engineering is among the most powerful technologies the human race has ever created, so everyone should have access to it. When powerful technologies are only available to those with power, they get used in ways the masses don't want. Our goal is to put biotechnology in the hands of everyone, starting at the consumer level, this will enable a shift to a circular economy where resources are not dug from finite supplies in the ground but produced sustainably, without CO2, when needed.

TAXA Biotechnologies Seeks Funds Through Title III Offering on WeFunder
 Tweet6 Share2 Share3 +1 Reddit Pin EmailShares 11

May 17, 2016 @ 11:19 am By Samantha Hurst 


On Monday, biotech startup, TAXA Biotechnologies, Inc., made history by being one of the first to use Title III rules of the JOBS Act. The company launched its initial on equity crowdfunding platform, WeFunder.
Founded in 2013, TAXA Biotechnologies consists of biologists and experts who use synthetic biology technologies to engineer new organisms, which can be nurtured at home as carbon-positive alternatives to existing products. The company provides access to a platform for protein engineering, automated DNA assembly, transient experiments and stable transformation as a service that is already being used by three partners. It became the first biotech investment by Y Combinator. 
“We offer our platform both as a service to other companies and use it internally to develop our own engineered plants. We make money from platform access service fees and from royalties on the sale of the final products. Our first product is a Glowing Plant, which was the first Kickstarter for a synthetic biology application earning us over $600k in pre-orders. We are also close to shipping a Fragrant Moss.”
Other TAXA Biotechnologies’ achievements include:

Has over $600,000 in pre-orders on for its Kickstarter product, Glowing Plant.
Has shipped the first ever kit that allows customers to genetically engineer a planet from home. 
Signed three collaborative research agreements with partner companies for its platform 

The company also noted:
“Our goal is to put biotechnology in the hands of everyone, starting at the consumer level, this will enable a shift to a circular economy where resources are not dug from finite supplies in the ground but produced sustainably, without CO2, when needed.”
TAXA Biotechnologies will be offering up to $1 Million at a $1 share price with a $7 million valuation cap.

TAXA Biotechnologies Set to Finish WeFunder Round With Over $250,000
 Tweet Share2 Share +1 Reddit Pin1 EmailShares 3

August 2, 2016 @ 11:42 am By Samantha Hurst 


On Tuesday, TAXA Biotechnologies, Inc. announced it had secured over $250,000 from 400 investors during its equity crowdfunding campaign on WeFunder. The biotech startup made history in May when it became one of the first companies to use Title III rules of the JOBS Act.
As previously reported, TAXA Biotechnologies, founded in 2013, consists of biologists and experts who use synthetic biology technologies to engineer new organisms, which can be nurtured at home as carbon-position alternative to existing products. The company currently provides access to a platform for protein engineering, automated DNA assembly, transient experiments and stable transformation as a service that is already being used by three partners. It was also named first biotech investment by Y Combinator.
The company recently revealed:
“We offer our platform both as a service to other companies and use it internally to develop our own engineered plants. We make money from platform access service fees and from royalties on the sale of the final products. Our first product is a Glowing Plant, which was the first Kickstarter for a synthetic biology application earning us over $600k in pre-orders. We are also close to shipping a Fragrant Moss.”
Other TAXA Biotechnologies’ achievements include:

Has over $600,000 in pre-orders on for its Kickstarter product, Glowing Plant.
Has shipped the first ever kit that allows customers to genetically engineer a planet from home. 
Signed three collaborative research agreements with partner companies for its platform 

Explaining why he and his team decided to use the Title III rules, after originally securing funds through reward-based crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, founder and CEO of TAXA, Antony Evans stated:

“We wanted to give our earlier crowdfunding supporters the opportunity to have equity in the company, and many of those people did come back and invest via Wefunder. This is a great, new fundraising model for startups, and we would absolutely come back and do it again. Wefunder made the process relatively easy for us, and their support and promotion of our offering was outstanding.”

Wefunder co-founder and CEO, Nick Tommarello, then added:

“We were excited to see TAXA’s early Kickstarter backers also invest on Wefunder. The success of the TAXA offering demonstrates that everyday Americans also want to invest in early-stage startups solving hard technical challenges.”

Our Ambition
Genetic engineering is among the most powerful technologies the human race has ever created, so everyone should have access to it. When powerful technologies are only available to those with power, they get used in ways the masses don't want. Our goal is to put biotechnology in the hands of everyone, starting at the consumer level, this will enable a shift to a circular economy where resources are not dug from finite supplies in the ground but produced sustainably, without CO2, when needed.

Why I Like TAXA Biotechnologies



The glowing plant might look like a novelty, but it turns out that the next big thing always gets dismissed initially as a toy. There’s a long history of interesting companies being born right at the point in time where emerging exponential technologies become accessible to hobbyists, as is happening right now with synthetic biology. The progression is from toys to useful products to industrial mega-applications.

IT LOOKS like an experimental cooking class as participants taste a green powder, pull faces and then mix it into a concoction of fruit and milk. But the event organised by Open Wetlab in Amsterdam has a more serious goal than to come up with new recipes for smoothies: finding ways to make spirulina-an algae which is full of proteins and vitamins, but tastes disgusting-more palatable.

                  What is your company making? What's novel about that?
                  



We have built a platform to enable cheaper, faster, and better genetic engineering of plants. We develop new plants with new characteristics, grow them, and sell them to consumers. We have already created two such products, a Glow in the Dark Plant and a Fragrant Moss. Using the platform, skillset and knowledge we have amassed, we intend to make many more.

As a company we generate revenues from two sources; we offer the platform as a paid service to other companies, earning royalties on the final product, and we also develop our own genetically engineered plants which we sell direct to consumers. We think we are the first company to open up plant engineering to other companies in this way.

We have two products that are close to being market ready. The first is our Glow in the Dark plant, which was the first ever Kickstarter campaign for a synthetic biology product, raising over $600,000 dollars in pre-orders. We have shipped an early version to a small number of early backers, demonstrating regulatory pathways and end-to-end working technology. We continue to work on improving the luminosity of the plant before shipping to others. The second is a Fragrant Moss that we’ve engineered as a replacement to chemical air fresheners.




                  What kinds of products are you engineering?

The second is a Fragrant Moss that we’ve engineered as a replacement to chemical air fresheners. The first version of the moss smells of Patchouli but we plan on expanding the range of flavors so that there's something for everyone.




                  How do you make money?
                  



The core way that we make money is by making engineered organisms that we sell to people, for example the Glow in the Dark plant and Fragment Moss. The business model is simple. We spend time developing products people want, grow them in large quantities and sell them.

As I mentioned in an earlier question, the margins on these, once you’ve made the organism, are very, very attractive. The development is complex, time consuming and there’s a pretty upfront hefty cost associated with the science and testing, but once they are developed the cost of growing them is low and the products are cash cows, not unlike the development of new drugs, only without the level of regulation.

As a company, we have absorbed the upfront costs in a couple of different ways. We have 4 different products in development now, and each of them were funded in slightly different ways.

The Glowing Plant is the one we’re most famous for. That was funded through pre-orders and has provided upfront market validation both that people want this product, and more importantly that they are willing to pay for it. We’ve been using the money from those pre-orders to develop the plant.

A second funding model has been used with the blue rose that we’re developing. In this case, we have entered into a partnership with a spin-out from the University of Southern Illinois. Our partner has developed a novel blue pathway, i.e. a new way of making blue in cells. The partner has shown that it works in E.coli, and has patents around that, owned by the University of Southern Illinois. The university has licensed those patents to a small startup that has its own investors. That startup, in turn, has been paying us to express that blue pathway in plants, and see if it works in plants.

If it does, then the idea is that we can make a truly blue rose, and potentially other types of plants as well, like a blue carnation, and maybe even cotton, so you wouldn’t have to dye cotton. You could have cotton that’s already a nice blue color. In that case, there’s a company that feels comfortable with the market potential of a blue rose: There’s a genetically engineered purple rose that’s been marketed as a blue rose in Japan that sells for up to $20 a stem. They’ve sold ten’s millions of those. I think there’s a pretty exciting potential for that product, if the pathway works in the plants. In that case, that company is paying us to develop that product at cost and then we have a revenue share model where we split the upside 50-50.




                  Why now? What trends do you see to make this the right time to build this company?
                  



There are a number of trends coming together to make this the right time to build this company: 1.	The cost of reading DNA is getting cheaper by the day2.	The cost of writing it is falling nearly as fast3.	Automation and custom robotics are enabling us to run more experiments, quicker and cheaper4.	People’s attitudes towards GE products are beginning to shift as improved knowledge and understanding start to overcome fear

It’s affordable, it’s quick, and people have already shown they want what we have to sell. We have already demonstrated the potential of what we can do, and with these market forces in place, the possibilities going forward are literally endless. Genetic engineering has long been an expensive and slow process, available only to the largest corporations and best laboratories. We stand on the cusp of the creation of streams of new products, and we have already shown that we can achieve this, in our very own lab, and at a fraction of the cost. We provide further detail below.

There is a phenomenal transition underway in the kind of technology needed to make our products. This is being driven principally by two key advances in our ability to read and write DNA.

1.	DNA sequencing, i.e. reading DNA from wild organisms, is experiencing a very, very rapid fall in cost. It is falling about 7 times faster than Moores law, leading to an explosion in our understanding of the underlying genetic pathways that govern all life form. The more we understand, the more we’re able to design new pathways.

2.	DNA synthesis, i.e. writing those novel genetic pathways, is falling in cost a little less quickly but still three times faster than Moore's law. It’s all very well to read DNA, but you also want to be able to write it in order to be able to create organisms that can do new and wonderful things. Today, DNA is cheaper to understand, and it is cheaper to create.

There is a third key technology that really powers what we do, which is the rise of automation and custom robotics. The lab is transitioning to a world in which scientists don’t have to do everything at a lab bench, but they’re able to program robots to do it which obviously allows you to do many more experiments much more cheaply, much more reproducibly. This adds fuel to the fire because now a highly trained scientist, with a Phd from Harvard or UC Berkeley, can use the knowledge they spent 10 or 20 years developing in school to write code that allows someone with much less experience to run those protocols.

Finally, we also see a softening in attitudes and resistance to GE products. There has historically been a massive disconnect between scientific consensus on safety of GE organisms and public perception. We do not think that disconnect is sustainable into the future, and the support for our initial products bears this out. Being at the forefront of the industry as these public perceptions begin to change is a huge opportunity.




                  With all the potential of this technology, why start with consumer products?
                  



There are a couple of important things to recognize about consumer products. The first is that these products have wonderful margins once they’re made. We sell our Glowing Plants online for $50, we can ship and package the seeds for under a dollar. This shows you the amount of cash that we will be able to generate once we have a plant bright enough to meet demand. We see a nice path to building a very strong cash flow from filling these early consumer products, which we can then reinvest back into our platform, allowing us to develop more complex, sophisticated products over time.

The second thing that consumer products do that is really important to us, is that we are able to combat some of the historical and misplaced resistance that people have about GMO. A lot of this resistance with GMOs has come from the fact that they’re being done by these huge mega corporations who perhaps don’t care about the interests of the environment, and aren’t using the technology in way people like. There are a lot of different applications for this technology. We think that by putting genetically engineered organisms into peoples’ homes, we will be able to change the way that they think about them and change the public perception of those organisms, which should encourage greater adoption of this technology over time.

The way I think about this has been really inspired by one of our customers. I had a lady come up to me in a conference and tell me that she had a daughter who is 17 years old and trying to work out what she should be majoring in in college. She wasn’t sure whether she wanted a scientific analytical career, or a creative one. She saw our products and she realized that science could be creative – that the dichotomy in choice was a false one. That’s the kind of change that we see happening when you get broader adoption of technology like this directly into peoples’ homes. It becomes a tangible thing that they have a real physical relationship with. Not something that’s abstract and scary that they only read about in the press. That’s another cool outcome of what we’re doing, and why we think it’s important to start working on consumer products.

But we can take this further. If you look at this history of powerful technologies, and genetic engineering may be the most powerful we've ever developed, they have a history of being controlled by groups which already have power. Then it gets used in ways people don't want and further exacerbates existing issues. I think this fear lies underneath resistance to GE crops.

The solution is for these technologies to become what we would call democratized. That's a word that often gets misused: The way we use it, it means the tools have to be used by everyday people. The creativity of the internet is such a good example of what happens if you get that right. So for us, it’s super important that we push that technology down to make it available to everyone, so the benefits of it can be accrued to everyone, not just trapped in complicated business models like using it to sell chemicals instead of actually focusing on the benefits that can be created with that technology. The big companies in this space, they like these regulatory barriers, because it stops other people from doing stuff and it protects their own interest. That’s not good for us, or for society.That's the driving philosophy behind our maker kit (and also the way we are funding the company!). The kit is all the ingredients you need to make a genetically engineered plant at home. We ship you agrobacterium, DNA and a few other reagents. Agrobacterium is this very clever little bacterium that, in the wild, has figured out a way to do genetic engineering of plants. In the wild, agrobacterium sticks in a gene into the plant that says, “Make me bacteria food.” Then the plant starts making bacteria food. Sometime in the 1980s scientists realized that they could hijack this process, and instead of the bacteria telling the plant to make bacteria food, we could tell the plant to make something else, and express a gene that we found elsewhere.

So this is pretty old technology. What we’ve done is repurposed that technology and packaged it in a way that you don’t need any specialized lab equipment to use it. In fact, the way that this particular plant can be engineered, you merely dip the flowers of the plant in the solution of the bacteria and then the bacteria will insert new genes into the newly formed seed. We are very excited about this kit, which is shipping in early beta. One of our beta testers is a high school teacher out on the East Coast and he's been using it with his students so we might just have enabled the youngest people ever to genetically engineer a plant which is great.




                  How do you address criticisms of GMOs?

                  Walk us step-by-step through the user experience of the kit.
                  



The first step is the permit process. Because the bacteria is regulated, you must have permission from the USDA to receive this. When they get that approved, we send them a box in the mail, which includes the bacteria, some seeds, the reagents, gloves, and the pipes to mix the different chemicals.

The first step is to introduce the glowing genes into the bacteria that will be transferring the DNA into the plant. This involves something called 'Cold Snap Transformation' which requires cooling the bacteria down to -109.3°F (or-78.5°C) using dry ice and then rapidly heating it to 86°F (or 30°C).

In parallel you plant the seeds and grow them until they’re ready for flowering. You then introduce the agrobacterium to the plant using the dropper, allow those flowers to grow up to seed, and when you plant those seeds, a small number will contain the gene you’re interested in. What we also include is an herbicide resistance marker. If you plant them with herbicide resistance, the plants that have the gene will grow, the rest will die. Voila. You have your plant with your target gene.




                  What is the business model in the short term?
                  



We make money by making the engineered organism we sell to people. The margins once you’ve made the organism, are very attractive. We have 4 different products in development now, and each of them were funded in slightly different ways. The glowing plant was funded through pre-orders, and now we’re validated.

A second example is the blue rose we’re developing. This a partnership with a spin out from the University of Southern Illinois. There’s a researcher there who has developed a new way to make blue in cells. The idea is we can make a truly blue rose, and potentially, other types of plants as well, like cotton that’s already a nice blue color and doesn’t need to be dyed.

There are companies willing to pay us to develop that. We have a 50/50 share of the proceeds on the downstream.




                  How big is the market?
                  



The way we think about the market is a series of layers, a bit like an onion. Each of those layers is a market segment and if we win that segment then we'll be able to expand out to target the next, larger segment. A growth strategy where you dominate a small initial market and then use that market power to expand into a larger segment has been key to many other startup companies’ success. Facebook is the canonical example – they started with Harvard Students (a tiny market!), then expanded to colleges, then international and finally opened up to everyone.

This is a much better strategy than going directly after the largest market first, which is what a lot of the first generation synthetic biology companies did with biofuels (eg Amyris, Solazyme). Big markets are often very efficient and commoditized which aren't features which are easy for startup companies to compete on: it's better to attack them from an existing, dominant, secure market position.

The seed in the middle of our onion is our Glowing Plant. We honestly don't really know what the market size is for Glowing Plants, and a lot will depend on how bright we can ultimately make it – but it's certainly not large enough to justify the market valuation we'd like to grow into.

The first layer then consists of consumer products like our Fragrant Moss or Blue Rose. US consumers spend $5.6BN on home fragrances and $28BN at florists and we have a number of other planned consumer products in the pipeline. We think we can build a substantial, multi-billion dollar business based on these consumer products – one day, in the same way every desk now has a PC, every home will have a number GE plants producing fragrance, cleaning the air and other yet to be identified applications.

Once we've cracked consumer products, which will take many years, we'll have the opportunity to enter the agricultural sector. Plants contribute trillions of dollars to the global economy but less than 14% of those have been engineered so far leaving a 'long tail' of currently unaddressed opportunities.

The final layer are the energy and industrial chemical markets. Fossil fuels are stored photosynthetic energy buried in the ground. It should be possible to use plants to make fuels and chemicals directly from today's sunlight, enabling a carbon neutral economy. Because of land and water resource constraints this is going to require the development of salt tolerant plants that can be grown on oceanic floating fields.




                  What do you understand about your business that others don't get?
                  



After the upfront investment in making the first plant, scaling and growth is almost free, due to the fact that our plants are self-reproducing. Gross margins of over 90% enable virtual goods type marketing techniques. Therefore, we are fundamentally a web marketing company and not just a biotech company. And as we showed with our initial Kickstarter and hopefully this equity crowdfunding campaign we have the skills to execute that.

In addition, because we hacked a regulatory path that allows us to distribute our plants without regulatory review we can apply continuous improvement/agile development processes to our plants, releasing early and using the profits from ongoing sales to rapidly improve the product and leave competition in the dust.




                  Who are your competitors and why do you have the upper hand?
                  



There are really big economies of scale in this industry, and that will allow capital to compete to get big fast. What we believe is that the first person to create a truly knockout consumer product, will become the market leader in that. The way we hope and anticipate that this market evolves, is by winning that first product we’ll generate sufficient free cash flow we can reinvest back into infrastructure we’re building in a way that nobody else can.

The parallel here is with the semiconductor industry. Once you’re able to build the next generation of the foundry, you’re able to create all these products others can’t, because they haven’t got the technological sophistication to.  If you have that next generation foundry, you are able to build the next generation of products 2 years before anyone else can. You capture the lion’s share of that wave of product category, that gives you the ability to reinvest back into your underlying technology infrastructure, which allows you to stay ahead.




                  How will you develop a long-term, sustainable competitive advantage?
                  



There is an extremely high level of technical sophistication to the products we are developing. This is not easy, nor is it easy to reproduce.

Engineering plants is also a slow process as it requires growing multiple generations to refine the sequences and create a saleable product. Even with the best skilled employees this takes time to imitate.

To put this in perspective, what we have been doing with the Glowing Plant in particular is actually super, super interesting on a technical level: we’re trying to put six different genes into a plant, and optimize that pathway. This is ground breaking work and a level of sophistication that other companies simply aren't focusing in on. If you look at all the genome crops on the market, they’re basically single genes, and they do this thing called 'stacking' where they then crossbreed but basically all the functionality is coming from a single gene.

Optimizing a whole pathway is a different challenge. The interesting thing is, we’ve done that. We had to build advances in technology to even make that possible. For example, we’ve had to be able to build a system to assemble six gene constructs. You can buy DNA up to 2,000 base pairs, but we want to put 20,000 or 25,000 into the plant and we wanted to test many more DNA designs in parallel so we had to build tools to automate that assembly – that wasn't something that was commercially available. So we are solving these problems that other people haven’t really focused on yet. That is super-valuable, because if you start solving problems other people haven’t looked at, you create capabilities that other people just don’t have, and will take a long time to catch up with. If we keep making those services available to others through an open platform then they’re better off coming to us, than they are rebuilding and competing.

Of course in a market as big as we think this is, that won't be sufficient. There are really big economies of scale in this industry, and that will allow capital to compete to get big fast. What we believe is that the first company to create a truly knockout successful consumer product, will become the market leader. The way we hope and anticipate that this market evolves, is that winning that first product will generate sufficient free cash flow that we’ll then be able to reinvest that back into the platform infrastructure we’re building in a way that nobody else can. The parallel here, I think, is a little bit with a semiconductor industry. Once you’re able to build the next generation of the foundry, you’re able to create all these kind of products that other companies just can’t create, because they haven’t got the technological sophistication to make them. In our case, that means the length and complexity of new genetic pathways going into plants.

If you have that next generation foundry, you are then able to build the next generation of products 1-2 years before anyone else can, you then capture the lion’s share of the products coming out of that generations biofoundry, that gives you the ability to reinvest back into your underlying technology infrastructure, which allows you to stay ahead, and maintain that advantage. That’s really how we see competitive advantage arising in this industry. As I said, I think that all comes down to being first to create a really successful consumer organism so that's our key strategic focus for now.




                  What are the biggest risks to the business?
                  



The company is dependent upon the retention and addition of high quality employees.

Taxa is dependent upon the continued support and involvement of key management, technical, and scientific personnel. Taxa’s success and ability to compete is dependent on its continuing ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly qualified employees with knowledge of the businesses in which Taxa operates. If any of Taxa’s key personnel were to cease their employment with Taxa, Taxa’s business may be adversely affected.

The company's operations could be adversely affected by regulatory change. Changes to Government regulation may reduce the volumes and or values of the products that the company seeks to sell.

Taxa’s business is dependent on the company’s ability to sell plants without going through regulatory review. Adverse regulatory change to this would negatively impact our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

The development of new products is a complex and lengthy process and may not be completed within anticipated timeframes. 

Taxa’s future results of operations depend, to a significant extent, on its ability to develop, manufacture and successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner. The development process is both time consuming and costly and involves a high degree of business risk. For example, Taxa may:-Fail to develop products that are sufficiently exciting to the consumer market.

-Fail to develop products that meet desired product characteristics

Taxa is dependent on consumer demand for its products.

Taxa is dependent on demand for the products it manufactures for its customers and has no control or influence over the market demand for its customers’ products. Demand for its customers’ products can be adversely affected by, among other things, consumer tastes, the emergence of competing products, Government regulation, and reputational issues. If the products Taxa develops do not gain market acceptance, its revenues and profitability will be adversely affected.

Taxa’s future revenues are dependent upon successful development of products.

While biology is becoming easier to engineer, it is still really challenging, and takes a long time. Due to the novelty of our research we regularly encounter unanticipated problems and can reasonably expect to encounter further unanticipated challenges again in the future. The development of the Glowing Plant is behind its original schedule and remains too dim for broad market acceptance. There is a chance we are never able to overcome all the issues and create a viable Glowing Plant that the market will accept. As our products are new to the market, there is a risk that consumers may not seek to purchase them. Failure to develop products of a sufficient quality may impact adversely the company’s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

Net Losses and Negative Cash Flow

Taxa has recorded net losses in prior years as it has looked to develop its products. While Taxa expects to generate increasing revenues from its products and in the future from it’s the company may not be able to generate a net profit, or if it does generate a net profit, to sustain profitability. The company has invested in its facility, processed and development of products and has required financing to support its operating and investing activities. The company may not generate operating cash flow or may be required to make significant additional investments in its business, either of which could have a Material Adverse Effect.

The company operates in a sector where other participants create competition. 

The company operates in a market that is growing and will attract competition. Competition is driven by proprietary technologies and knowhow, capabilities, consistency of operational performance, quality, price, value, alternative therapies, and speed. Some competitors may have greater financial, research and development, operational and marketing resources than Taxa and be able to bring competing products to market. Greater financial, research and development, operational and marketing resources and experience may allow Taxa’s competitors to respond more quickly with new, alternative or emerging technologies.

Insufficient Liquidity

In the past, Taxa has obtained the cash required for its operations primarily through funding from Kickstarter, Y Combinator and Collaborative Research Agreements. As at May 12th, 2016, prior to the Offering, Taxa has limited liquidity available to fund its business. Following the Offering, Taxa may require additional funding for the development and commercialization of its products and to keep pace with the expected business growth. While Taxa may consider funding its business in future through a combination of debt and equity financing, there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be obtained.

Trade Marks

Taxa will seek to own trade-marks that identify its processes and products. Although Taxa monitors the possible infringement or misuse of its trademarks, it is possible that third parties may infringe upon its intellectual property rights. Any unauthorized use of Taxa’s trademarks could harm its reputation or commercial interests. In addition, Taxa’s enforcement against third-party infringers may be unduly expensive or time-consuming, or the outcome may be an inadequate remedy.

Trade Secrets

Taxa also relies on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain its competitive position. Taxa seeks to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as Taxa’s employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, consultants, advisors and other third parties. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose Taxa’s proprietary information, including its trade secrets, and it may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. If any of Taxa’s trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, it would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with Taxa, which could harm Taxa’s competitive position.

Regulatory Compliance

Some of Taxa’s products exist in areas where, due to novelty, there are no legal precedents for interpreting regulations. As a result Taxa may misinterpret regulations which could result in financial or operational penalties.

Investment of net proceeds after the offering

Taxa will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the Offering. Investors in Taxa will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant economic, financial and other information regarding any investment or business activity undertaken by Taxa after the Offering. Taxa may pay operating and other expenses from the net proceeds of this Offering. The Corporation’s ability to achieve its investment objectives may be limited to the extent that net proceeds of the Offering, pending full investment, are used to pay expenses rather than to make investments. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that Taxa will be successful in investing the net proceeds of the Offering in investments or activities that will achieve its business objectives. An investment in the Company is speculative and may result in the loss of an investor’s entire investment. Only potential investors who can afford to lose their entire investment should consider an investment in the Company.




                  How did this all get started?
                  



I wanted to help build an economy that creates, in a circular fashion, all the resources we need to sustain ourselves.

I believe biotechnology will get us there. I started going to a place called BioCurious in Sunnyvale, which is a bio-hack space. It’s a lab where anyone can go and do biology, and do genetic engineering. I started talking about this idea for a glowing plant, and thought “Why don’t we do a Kickstarter?” It was just, “This is a cool project. Let’s raise some money, and then we can make it in the lab.”




                  Tell us about your other team members.
                  



The team has two lead scientists: Dr. Jihyun Moon is a plant biologist who originally comes from South Korea. She has a Phd and Post-Doc in plant biology from the University of Berkeley.

Dr Jamey Kain who focuses on the microbial side of things. Jamey has a Phd in molecular biology from Harvard University where he also did Post-doc work.

In addition we collaborate with Dr Henrik Simonsen who is a world expert on the bio-engineering of moss. Until recently he was an Associate Professor at the University of Copenhagen. He developed the initial prototype for our Fragrant Moss and we've been working with him to make a version we can sell to consumers.




                  Why is what you're doing so important? What's the grand vision?
                  



Genetic engineering is probably among the most powerful technologies that the human race has ever created. And everyone should have access to it. Powerful technologies have to be democratized. They have to become tools that can be used by everyday people, because if they don’t, then that technological power accumulates in places that already have power. It gets used in ways that people don’t want. It’s important we make that tech available to everyone, so the benefits of it can be accrued by everyone.

If we get that right then we'll be able to move to our ultimate goal. This is to empower a shift to a circular economy where resources are not dug from finite supplies in the ground but produced sustainably, without CO2, when needed. Biology in general, and photosynthetic plants in particular, are the ultimate sustainable technologies: plants are solar powered factories that take the suns energy and turn it into useful things. Now that we can engineer plants we can control what they make and this has an enormous potential to put us on a much better planetary footing.

The key to getting to there is shipping our first high-margin plant to generate the free cashflow to invest in the technology platform to advance towards that goal. That's our focus today.

I'm a stats junkie!  Show me an entire page of stats!

Some fine print:  1) These numbers include startups currently live on Wefunder if they pass their minimum target.  2) Some startups use two different laws at the same time (i.e., Regulation D and Regulation Crowdfunding).
