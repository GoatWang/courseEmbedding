Franklyn G. Prendergast's scientific contributionswhile working at Mayo Clinic - Rochester and other institutions  Publications (114)             Article:  Photoproteins as biological calcium indicators      J R Blinks ·     F G Prendergast ·     D G Allen   Abstract: This review is an attempt to summarize published information likely to be of value to investigators considering the use of calcium activated photoproteins such as aequorin for the detection of ionized calcium in biological systems.     Article · Apr 1976  · Pharmacological Reviews      Request full-text                Article:  Properties of the calcium-sensitive bioluminescent protein aequorin         F. Prendergast ·     D. Allen ·     J. Blinks              Article · Jan 1977      Request full-text                Article:  Aequorin Luminescence: Relation of Light Emission to Calcium Concentration-A Calcium-Independent Component      D G Allen ·     J R Blinks ·     F G Prendergast       Abstract: Light emission from the calcium-sensitive bioluminescent protein aequorin was measured at calcium ion concentrations of 10(-9)
to 10(-2) molar. At very low Ca2+ concentations, light emission is independent of calcium ion concentration. The maximum slope
of the log-log plot of light as a function of calcium ion concentration is about 2.5. The complete relation is well described
by a two-state model involving three calcium-binding sites.     Article · Apr 1977  · Science      Request full-text                Article:  Photoproteins as models of drug receptors      John R. Blinks ·     David G. Allen ·     Franklyn G. Prendergast ·     Gary C. Harrer   Abstract: The calcium-sensitive photoprotein aequorin has properties that make it well suited for studies of protein-ligand interactions. Its behavior resembles that of classical drug receptors in many ways. A two-state model reproduces many of the properties of aequorin, including two that are not consistent with the conventional occupancy model.     Article · Apr 1978  · Life Sciences      Request full-text                Article:  Chemical and physical properties of aequorin and the green fluorescent protein isolated from Aequorea forsk??lea         Franklyn G. Prendergast ·     Kenneth G. Mann   Abstract: The calcium-sensitive photoprotein aequorin and the green fluorescent protein were isolated and purified from Aequorea forskålea. Purified aequorin shows electrophoretic microheterogeneity but appears as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Amino-terminal sequence determination by the automated Edman technique revealed a single NH2-terminal sequence: Val-Lys-Leu-(Thr)-Pro-Asp- Phe-Asn-Asn-Pro-(-)-Trp-Ile-Gly-Arg-His-aequorin exists as a single...

Nesheim ·     Franklyn G. Prendergast ·     Kenneth G. Mann   Abstract: Dansylarginine N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide is a specific and potent inhibitor of thrombin. The apparent avidity and specificity of the inhibitor coupled with the fluorescence properties of the dansyl moiety suggested to us that the compound could be extremely useful as a probe for the study of thrombin and its interactions. The synthesis of the inhibitor was accomplished by coupling 4-ethylpiperidine to dansylarginine previously activated with N,N′-carbonyl-diimidazole. Although the...

Prendergast                  Article · Feb 1982  · Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology      Request full-text                Article:  Electron paramagnetic resonance of spin-labeled aequorin      Marvin D. Kemple ·     Bruce D. Ray ·     G K Jarori ·     B. D. Nageswara Rao ·     Franklyn G. Prendergast       Abstract: Aequorin is a Ca-activated bioluminescent protein from jellyfish. This protein contains two sulfhydryl groups, one of which is essential for its bioluminescence. Little information concerning the structure of and relationship between the metal binding sites of aequorin and the sulfhydryl group(s) is known. Aequorin was modified by attachment of either a maleimide spin-label [studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)] or the fluorescent label Acrylodan at the essential sulfhydryl in...

Prendergast ·     Philip D. Hampton ·     Berne Jones   Abstract: The CD, absorption, and fluorescence spectra and fluorescence lifetimes of three highly homologous, basic cytotoxic proteins isolated from wheat (alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-purothionins) and a moderately homologous protein isolated from Crambe abyssinica (crambin) have been measured. The purothionins each contain a single tyrosine, while crambin has two tyrosine residues. At neutral pH in buffered solution or in water, beta-purothionin showed a single fluorescence emission peak maximal at...

Prendergast       Abstract: Two-dimensional helical wheel diagrams and calculations of mean hydrophobic moments show mastoparan, mastoparan X, and Polistes mastoparan to have all the properties expected for amphiphilic helices. Circular dichroic properties are consistent with a random form for these peptides in dilute aqueous solution, but greater than 50% helix is apparent when the peptides are dissolved in 70% trifluoroethanol/water mixtures (v/v) or when the peptides are bound to calmodulin. Changes in the... Show More    Article · Jul 1985  · Biochemistry      Request full-text                Article:  Proton NMR of aequorin. Structural changes concomitant with calcium-independent light emission      Bruce D. Ray ·     Steffan Ho ·     Marvin D. Kemple ·     Franklyn G. Prendergast ·     B. D. Nageswara Rao   Abstract: Aequorin, a Ca(II)-sensitive bioluminescent protein from jellyfish, emits light at 469 nm from an excited state of a substituted pyrazine (oxyluciferin) which results from the oxidation of a chromophore molecule that is noncovalently bound to the protein. The chromophore is oxidized when Ca(II) or other activating metal ions are bound by aequorin. In the absence of Ca(II), spontaneous emission of light, referred to as Ca(II)-independent light emission, occurs at a rate less than 10(-6) of...

Walsh ·     Richard O. McCann ·     Franklyn G. Prendergast ·     Thomas C. Vanaman   Abstract: The Ca(II)-dependent photoprotein aequorin produces the luminescence of the marine coelenterate Aequorea victoria. The complete amino acid sequence of aequorin has been determined. A complete set of nonoverlapping peptides was produced by cyanogen bromide cleavage. These peptides were aligned by using the amino-terminal sequence of the intact protein and the sequences of selected arginyl and lysyl cleavage products. Although the aequorin preparations employed in these studies were...

Lukas ·     Wilson H. Burgess ·     Franklyn G. Prendergast ·     Wai Lau ·     D. Martin Watterson   Abstract: A protein kinase phosphorylation site in chicken gizzard myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) has been identified, and a synthetic peptide analogue of this site has been shown to be a high-affinity calmodulin binding peptide as well as a substrate for cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of the site in MLCK is diminished when reactions are done in the presence of calmodulin. A fragment of MLCK containing the phosphorylation site was shown to have the amino acid sequence...

Cristine Charlesworth ·     Robert J. Ryan ·     Franklyn G. Prendergast       Abstract: Human luteinizing hormone (hLH) has a single tryptophan residue occurring in the beta-subunit (beta hLH). This provides an intrinsic fluorescent probe, in native hLH and beta hLH, that is unambiguously assigned. The fluorescence intensities of hLH and beta hLH are, however, significantly different. This difference has been utilized in studying the interaction of fluorescent beta hLH with the nonfluorescent alpha-subunit. The accessibility of the tryptophan residue in native hLH and beta hLH...

Effects of altering a charge cluster in the helix that links the two halves of calmodulin      T A Craig ·     D M Watterson ·     F G Prendergast ·     J Haiech ·     D M Roberts   Abstract: Alteration of residues 82-84 in the alpha-helix that links the two halves of calmodulin results in a differential effect on activator activity. Previous studies (Lukas, T. J., Burgess, W. H., Prendergast, F. G., Lau, W., and Watterson, D. M. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 1458-1464) indicated the importance of positive charge clusters in the calmodulin-binding protein, myosin light chain kinase. This suggested the possible importance of complementary negative charge clusters in calmodulin. By using...

Brauner ·     Richard Mendelsohn ·     Franklyn G. Prendergast       Abstract: Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR FT-IR) has been used to monitor alterations in phospholipid organization in thin layers of 1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), induced by the membrane lytic peptide melittin, its fragments 1-15 (hydrophobic fragment) and 16-26 (hydrophilic fragment), and delta-hemolysin.

Hildebrandt ·     Robert A. Copeland ·     Thomas G. Spiro ·     Jacek Otlewski ·     Franklyn G. Prendergast       Abstract: Ultraviolet resonance Raman spectra with 229-nm excitation are reported for aqueous tyrosine and for ovomucoid third domain proteins from chicken [OMCHI3(-)] and from chachalaca [OMCHA(-)], as well as alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-purothionin. At this excitation wavelength interference from phenylalanine is minimized, and it is possible to determine the frequencies of the Tyr ring modes nu 8a and nu 8b. The nu 8b frequency decreases with the degree of Tyr H-bond donation, reaching a limiting...

Ricardo Alcala ·     Franklyn G. Prendergast       Abstract: It is now well established that proteins in their native conformation can exist in a large number of subconformations slightly different one from the other (Lakowicz & Weber, 1973; Austin et al., 1975; Careri et al., 1975, 1979; Karplus & McCammon, 1983). Subconformations originate from small structural fluctuations around the main conformation. The protein structure is very flexible and it allows rotations around the phi and psi angles of the polypeptide chain and around the C-alpha carbon...

Prendergast       Abstract: Several peptides exhibit calcium-dependent high affinity binding (dissociation constant ≃10-9M) to calmodulin (CaM), the ubiquitous calcium binding protein (Malencik and Anderson, 1983; Malencik & Anderson, 1984; Cox et al., 1985). These peptides, such as the three mastoparans, competitively displace enzymes (e. g. myosin light chain kinase) off the 1:1 CaM-enzyme complex to form the CaM-peptide complex (Malencik and Anderson, 1983).

Among the many reported sensors are small molecules that contain fluorophores such as flu- orescein [33,34], benzoxanthene [35], coumarin [36], naphthalene [37][38][39], BODIPY [40,41] , etc., as well as more sophisticated chemical entities such as quantum dots conjugated with fluorophores or proteins [42][43][44][45][46]. Pyrene is a well-studied fluorophore and one of the few species displaying the property of dual monomer/excimer fluorescence [47,48] . This feature has been exploited for the selective detection of several analytes [49], including protons [50][51][52][53][54]; however, it has been scarcely applied to pH sensing in the cellular environment [55]. Pseudopeptidic fluorescent on-off pH sensor based on pyrene excimer emission: Imaging of acidic cellular organelles[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: A pseudopeptidic compound comprising a central C2 symmetric bis(aminoamide) moiety derived from the amino acid serine and two pyrene groups at the ends, Et(SerPyr)2, has been efficiently prepared. In aqueous solution, it displays fluorescence bands typical of both monomer and excimer pyrene emission. In particular, the emission at 490 nm, due to the excimer, is strongly pH-dependent, with a linear 4.7-fold increase from pH 6.0 to pH 4.2. This feature makes Et(SerPyr)2 suitable for intracellular pH sensing in the acidic range. A fluorescence microscopy study revealed that Et(SerPyr)2 allows the visualization of acidic organelles in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, as well as their pH changes over time. Other advantages of this probe include its easy and modular synthesis, good photostability, high quantum yield, fast optical response, large Stokes shift (ca. 145 nm) and low cytotoxicity.Article · May 2016 Enrico FaggiJenny Serra VinardellMrituanjay D.

However, we note that the rotational correlation time of melittin in water is ;1.5 ns (Kemple et al., 1997; Zhu et al., 1998). Relaxation data suggest that the viscosity of 35% HFIP/water is higher than pure water (Yoshida et al., 2003) and a rotational correlation time for melittin of ;3 ns is estimated for our system, a value consistent with the observed translational diffusion coefficient of monomeric melittin if it is assumed that the peptide can be represented by a sphere of radius 10–14 A ˚ . Structure and Solvation of Melittin in 1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexafluoro-2-Propanol/Water[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Fluorinated alcohols can induce peptides and proteins to take up helical conformations. Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy experiments and analysis of C(alpha)H proton chemical shifts show that the conformation of melittin in 35% hexafluoro-2-propanol/water is alpha-helical from residues Ile-2 to Val-8 and from Leu-13 to Gln-25. As has been found in other solvent systems, the two helical regions are not colinear; the interhelix angle (73 +/- 15 degrees ) in 35% 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol/water is smaller than the angle found in other fluoroalcohol-water mixtures or in the crystal. Intermolecular (1)H(19)F and (1)H(1)H nuclear Overhauser effects were used to explore interaction of solvent components with melittin dissolved in this solvent mixture. The NOEs observed indicate that fluoroalcohol and water molecules are both tightly bound to the peptide in the vicinity of the interhelix bend. For the remainder of the molecule, solute-solvent NOEs are consistent with preferential solvation of the peptide by the fluoroalcohol component of the solvent mixture.

Bioluminescent reactions of photoproteins isolated from coelenterates are triggered by calcium ions, and the dependence of bioluminescence intensity on Ca 2+ concentration is a basis for current analytical applications of photoproteins in biomedical investigations[63][64][65][66]. It is known that calcium ions play a pivotal role in physiology and biochemistry of organisms and cells; and high calcium sensitivity, selectivity, and non-toxicity of photoproteins make them useful and promising calcium bioluminescent indicators. Variability of Fluorescence Spectra of Coelenteramide-Containing Proteins as a Basis for Toxicity Monitoring[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Nowadays, physicochemical approach to understanding toxic effects remains underdeveloped. A proper development of such mode would be concerned with simplest bioassay systems. Coelenteramide-Containing Fluorescent Proteins (CLM-CFPs) can serve as proper tools for study primary physicochemical processes in organisms under external exposures. CLM-CFPs are products of bioluminescent reactions of marine coelenterates. As opposed to Green Fluorescent Proteins, the CLM-CFPs are not widely applied in biomedical research, and their potential as colored biomarkers is undervalued now. Coelenteramide, fluorophore of CLM-CFPs, is a photochemically active molecule; it acts as a proton donor in its electron-excited states, generating several forms of different fluorescent state energy and, hence, different fluorescence color, from violet to green. Contributions of the forms to the visible fluorescence depend on the coelenteramide microenvironment in proteins. Hence, CLM-CFPs can serve as fluorescence biomarkers with color differentiation to monitor results of destructive biomolecule exposures. The paper reviews experimental and theoretical studies of spectral-luminescent and photochemical properties of CLM-CFPs, as well as their variation under different exposures – chemicals, temperature, and ionizing radiation. Application of CLM-CFPs as toxicity bioassays of a new type is justified. Full-text · Article · Apr 2017 Roza R. AlievaNadezhda S. KudryashevaRead full-text5. Although aequorin is reported to be stable in solution (Prendergast, 2000), we do not recommend storing cell samples with reconstituted aequorin (even on ice) for extended period of time, as this may cause fluctuations in the luminescence profiles.

[Ca 2+ ] cyt was calculated as described by Allen and co-workers (1977) [55], which normalized differences in Aequorin expression (i.e., total aequorin luminescence) in different strains, and which is the most commonly used equation in the mycology community. Albeit absolute [Ca 2+ ] cyt values obtained by this procedure may be offset from the calculated values due to the cytosolic aequorin environment, this effect should be similar in all yeast studies employing this formula. The Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) Channel Family in Colletotrichum graminicola: A Molecular and Physiological Analysis[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Calcium (Ca2+) is a universal second messenger in all higher organisms and centrally involved in the launch of responses to environmental stimuli. Ca2+ signals in the cytosol are initiated by the activation of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane and/or in endomembranes. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) contains a Ca2+-permeable channel of the TRP family, TRPY1, which is localized in the vacuolar membrane and contributes to cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) elevations, for example in response to osmotic upshock. A TRPY1 homologue in the rice blast fungus is known to be important for growth and pathogenicity. To determine the role of the TRP channel family in the maize pathogen Colletotrichum graminicola, proteins homologous to TRPY1 were searched. This identified not one, but four genes in the C. graminicola genome, which had putative orthologs in other fungi, and which we named CgTRPF1 through 4. The topology of the CgTRPF proteins resembled that of TRPY1, albeit with a variable number of transmembrane (TM) domains additional to the six-TM-domain core and a diverse arrangement of putatively Ca2+-binding acidic motifs. All CgTRPF genes were expressed in axenic culture and throughout the infection of maize. Like TRPY1, all TRPF proteins of C. graminicola were localized intracellularly, albeit three of them were found not in large vacuoles, but co-localized in vesicular structures. Deletion strains for the CgTRPF genes were not altered in processes thought to involve Ca2+ release from internal stores, i.e. spore germination, the utilization of complex carbon sources, and the generation of tip-focussed [Ca2+]cyt spikes. Heterologous expression of CgTRPF1 through 4 in a tryp1Δ yeast mutant revealed that none of the channels mediated the release of Ca2+ in response to osmotic upshock. Accordingly, aequorin-based [Ca2+]cyt measurements of C. graminicola showed that in this fungus, osmotic upshock-triggered [Ca2+]cyt elevations were generated entirely by influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular space. Cgtrpf mutants did not show pathogenicity defects in leaf infection assays. In summary, our study reveals major differences between different fungi in the contribution of TRP channels to Ca2+-mediated signal transduction.

Molecular structure and paramagnetic properties of bis-diisobutyl-dithiophosphinate complexes of neodymium(III), europium(III) and ytterbium(III) with 1,10-phenanthroline using NMR[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The features of the molecular structure and paramagnetic properties of Ln-containing complexes with the dithiophosphinate R2PS2- (R = i-Bu) and 1,10-phenanthroline ligands [Ln(1,10-Phen)((i-Bu)(2)PS2)(2)(NO3)] {where Ln = Nd3+ (I), Eu3+ (II), Yb3+ (III) and Lu3+ (IV)} in CDCl3 have been studied by H-1 NMR techniques. These complexes are of interest due to the prospect of using some of them as fluorescent sensors for biology and medicine. The structure of complexes was studied in detail by two independent H-1 NMR techniques: Analysis of lanthanide-induced shift (LIS) magnitudes and calculation of paramagnetic lanthanide-induced relaxation rate enhancements. The structure results obtained for these paramagnetic complexes by relaxation spectroscopy (RS) of NMR and LIS analysis in solution are mutually consistent with the results found for model complex of yttrium by X-ray analysis in the crystalline phase. Paramagnetic complexes (I, II and III) investigated in the paper represent a new type of thermometric NMR sensors and lanthanide paramagnetic probes for in situ temperature control in solution.

The enigmatic membrane fatty acid transporter CD36: New insights into fatty acid binding and their effects on uptake of oxidized LDL[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The scavenger receptor CD36 binds numerous small biomolecules, including fatty acids, and even large ligands such as oxidized LDL, for which it is considered a receptor. Although CD36 has often been postulated to “transport” fatty acids across the plasma membrane, fatty acids translocation (mass transport or kinetics) was not affected by expression of CD36 in HEK293 cells; however, esterification of fatty acids (cellular uptake) was increased. These recent results from our lab are consistent with the established mechanism of fatty acid entry into cells by passive diffusion (flip-flop) and also with the well-documented enhancement of uptake of fatty acids by CD36 in other cell types. A fascinating new discovery is that CD36 has multiple fatty acid binding sites on the extracellular domain of CD36. As illuminated by new methodologies that we have applied, these sites have high affinity and exhibit rapid exchange with the medium. In an initial study of functional consequences of binding, several dietary fatty acids enhanced uptake of oxidized LDL into HEK293 cells expressing CD36. This is the first established link between physical binding of fatty acids and a function of CD36, and has implications for obesity and atherosclerosis. New methods as those used in our study could also be applied to elucidate other functional roles of fatty acid binding to CD36. Full-text · Article · May 2016 Anthony G. JayJames A.

Insight into Protein-Backbone H-Bonds Contribution to Energetics of Protein-Peptide Binding[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Calmodulin/peptide interactions have been used as almost archetypical examples of binding versatility, because they are presumptively facilitated by the plasticity of calmodulin folding. Yet, the energetics of the CaM backbone have not been evidenced to play a role in the interaction of CaM with target peptides. Using the most direct technique for study of H-bond in solution, we observed significant response of H-bond h3JNC′ couplings in the holoCaM backbone to the binding of the PMCA pump peptide. The number of detectable H-bond couplings is greatly increased, indicating that ligand binding is probably substantially assisted by gains in H-bonds which can reduce backbone conformational enthalpy.

Modeling fatty acid delivery from intestinal fatty acid binding protein to a membrane[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) interacts with biological membranes and delivers fatty acid (FA) into them via a collisional mechanism. However, the membrane-bound structure of the protein and the pathway of FA transfer are not precisely known. We used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an implicit membrane model to determine the optimal orientation of apo- and holo-IFABP (bound with palmitate) on an anionic membrane. In this orientation, the helical portal region, delimited by the alphaII helix and the betaC-betaD and betaE-betaF turns, is oriented toward the membrane whereas the putative beta-strand portal, delimited by the betaB-betaC, betaF-betaG, betaH-betaI turns and the N terminus, is exposed to solvent. Starting from the MD structure of holo-IFABP in the optimal orientation relative to the membrane, we examined the release of palmitate via both pathways. Although the domains can widen enough to allow the passage of palmitate, fatty acid release through the helical portal region incurs smaller conformational changes and a lower energetic cost. Full-text · Article · Oct 2007 Maja MihajlovicThemis LazaridisRead full-textHowever, the conformation induction approach is not ideal for docking studies because computing the mutually dependent conformational changes of both ligand and receptor is time consuming. Alternatively, the conformation selection theory involves a scenario in which both ligand and receptor select their preformed conformations that are most compatible with each other to effect binding by shifting two equilibriums progressively from less-compatible to most-compatible conformations for both partners192021222324, where the preformed conformations are conformations at the local minima of their potential energy surfaces (i.e., local minimum conformations). When the most compatible conformers of ligand and receptor are the most prevalent, the conformation selection theory becomes the lock–key theory [18]. EUDOC on the IBM Blue Gene/L system: Accelerating the transfer of drug discoveries from laboratory to patient[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: EUDOC™ is a molecular docking program that has successfully helped to identify new drug leads. This virtual screening (VS) tool identifies drug candidates by computationally testing the binding of these drugs to biologically important protein targets. This approach can reduce the research time required of biochemists, accelerating the identification of therapeutically useful drugs and helping to transfer discoveries from the laboratory to the patient. Migration of the EUDOC application code to the IBM Blue Gene/L™ (BG/L) supercomputer has been highly successful. This migration led to a 200-fold improvement in elapsed time for a representative VS application benchmark. Three focus areas provided benefits. First, we enhanced the performance of serial code through application redesign, hand-tuning, and increased usage of SIMD (single-instruction, multiple-data) floating-point unit operations. Second, we studied computational load-balancing schemes to maximize processor utilization and application scalability for the massively parallel architecture of the BG/L system. Third, we greatly enhanced system I/O interaction design. We also identified and resolved severe performance bottlenecks, allowing for efficient performance on more than 4,000 processors. This paper describes specific improvements in each of the areas of focus. Full-text · Article · Feb 2008 Yuan-Ping PangTimothy J. MullinsBrent A. Swartz+1 more author...J. S.

In case of active obelin (II), a strong increase of fluorescence occurs at 420 and 500 nm (Fig. 3A, left panel) that might be attributed to heat-induced, calcium-independent oxidation of 2-hydroperoxycoelenterazine yielding bound coelenteramide (500 nm) [18] and probably some side-product (420 nm) [19] or to an obelin conformational state that assists in the formation of exited coelenteramide in its neutral state [20] . In case of Ca 2+ -discharged obelin with coelenteramide bound (IV) the heating procedure causes a decrease in fluorescence at 500 nm (Fig. 3B, left panel). Ligand binding and conformational states of the photoprotein obelin[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Many proteins require a non-covalently bound ligand to be functional. How ligand binding affects protein conformation is often unknown. Here we address thermal unfolding of the free and ligand-bound forms of photoprotein obelin. Fluorescence and far-UV circular dichroism (CD) data show that the various ligand-dependent conformational states of obelin differ significantly in stability against thermal unfolding. Binding of coelenterazine and calcium considerably stabilizes obelin. In solution, all obelin structures are similar, except for apo-obelin without calcium. This latter protein is an ensemble of conformational states, the populations of which alter upon increasing temperature.

MP-X presented around 61% a-helix in 40% TFE/water mixture (McDowell et al. 1985 ), corresponding approximately to 8-folded residues.

Selectivity in the mechanism of action of antimicrobial mastoparan peptide Polybia-MP1[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Many potent antimicrobial peptides also present hemolytic activity, an undesired collateral effect for the therapeutic application. Unlike other mastoparan peptides, Polybia-MP1 (IDWKKLLDAAKQIL), obtained from the venom of the social wasp Polybia paulista, is highly selective of bacterial cells. The study of its mechanism of action demonstrated that it permeates vesicles at a greater rate of leakage on the anionic over the zwitterionic, impaired by the presence of cholesterol or cardiolipin; its lytic activity is characterized by a threshold peptide to lipid molar ratio that depends on the phospholipid composition of the vesicles. At these particular threshold concentrations, the apparent average pore number is distinctive between anionic and zwitterionic vesicles, suggesting that pores are similarly formed depending on the ionic character of the bilayer. To prospect the molecular reasons for the strengthened selectivity in Polybia-MP1 and its absence in Mastoparan-X, MD simulations were carried out. Both peptides presented amphipathic alpha-helical structures, as previously observed in Circular Dichroism spectra, with important differences in the extension and stability of the helix; their backbone solvation analysis also indicate a different profile, suggesting that the selectivity of Polybia-MP1 is a consequence of the distribution of the charged and polar residues along the peptide helix, and on how the solvent molecules orient themselves according to these electrostatic interactions. We suggest that the lack of hemolytic activity of Polybia-MP1 is due to the presence and position of Asp residues that enable the equilibrium of electrostatic interactions and favor the preference for the more hydrophilic environment.

Ca2+-Mediated Synthetic Biosystems Offer Protein Design Versatility, Signal Specificity, and Pathway Rewiring[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Synthetic biosystems have been engineered that enable control of metazoan cell morphology, migration, and death. These systems possess signal specificity, but lack flexibility of input signal. To exploit the potential of Ca(2+) signaling, we designed RhoA chimeras for reversible, Ca(2+)-dependent control over RhoA morphology and migration. First, we inserted a calmodulin-binding peptide into a RhoA loop that activates or deactivates RhoA in response to Ca(2+) signals depending on the chosen peptide. Second, we localized the Ca(2+)-activated RhoA chimera to the plasma membrane, where it responded specifically to local Ca(2+) signals. Third, input control of RhoA morphology was rewired by coexpressing the Ca(2+)-activated RhoA chimera with Ca(2+)-transport proteins using acetylcholine, store-operated Ca(2+) entry, and blue light. Engineering synthetic biological systems with input versatility and tunable spatiotemporal responses motivates further application of Ca(2+) signaling in this field.Article · Dec 2011 Evan MillsKevin TruongReadNoteworthy is the fact that the switch-on and -off of this complex machinery is triggered by the influx and binding of Ca 2+ to the C subunit of the troponin complex.

Cardiac Troponin and Tropomyosin: Structural and Cellular Perspectives to Unveil the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Phenotype[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Inherited myopathies affect both skeletal and cardiac muscle and are commonly associated with genetic dysfunctions, leading to the production of anomalous proteins. In cardiomyopathies, mutations frequently occur in sarcomeric genes, but the cause-effect scenario between genetic alterations and pathological processes remains elusive. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was the first cardiac disease associated with a genetic background. Since the discovery of the first mutation in the ?-myosin heavy chain, more than 1400 new mutations in 11 sarcomeric genes have been reported, awarding HCM the title of the ?disease of the sarcomere.? The most common macroscopic phenotypes are left ventricle and interventricular septal thickening, but because the clinical profile of this disease is quite heterogeneous, these phenotypes are not suitable for an accurate diagnosis. The development of genomic approaches for clinical investigation allows for diagnostic progress and understanding at the molecular level. Meanwhile, the lack of accurate in vivo models to better comprehend the cellular events triggered by this pathology has become a challenge. Notwithstanding, the imbalance of Ca2+ concentrations, altered signaling pathways, induction of apoptotic factors, and heart remodeling leading to abnormal anatomy have already been reported. Of note, a misbalance of signaling biomolecules, such as kinases and tumor suppressors (e.g., Akt and p53), seems to participate in apoptotic and fibrotic events. In HCM, structural and cellular information about defective sarcomeric proteins and their altered interactome is emerging but still represents a bottleneck for developing new concepts in basic research and for future therapeutic interventions. This review focuses on the structural and cellular alterations triggered by HCM-causing mutations in troponin and tropomyosin proteins and how structural biology can aid in the discovery of new platforms for therapeutics. We highlight the importance of a better understanding of allosteric communications within these thin-filament proteins to decipher the HCM pathological state.
