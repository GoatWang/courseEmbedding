Education[edit]
Iansiti graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University in 1983, with an A.B. in Physics.[3] He subsequently went on to perform his Ph.D. in Physics at Harvard University Iansiti’s Ph.D. thesis focused on experimental low temperature electronics and semiconductor microfabrication techniques.[4] He won the Robbins Physics Prize in 1986, and was awarded his Ph.D. in September 1988. He was awarded an IBM post-doctoral fellowship for 1988–1989, and performed research on the design and fabrication of next-generation microelectronic devices at Harvard University.[5]
Career[edit]
Iansiti’s academic research at the Harvard Business School has focused on technological innovation, product development, entrepreneurship, and operations-specifically the drivers of productivity, flexibility, and adaptation in organizations.[6] He is the author or coauthor of more than 50 articles, papers, book chapters, cases, and notes. Iansiti has also taught a variety of Executive Education and MBA courses on innovation, entrepreneurship, and operations, and is the creator of two Harvard Business School courses: "Managing Product Development" and "Starting New Ventures" (with Harvard Business School Professor Myra Hart).
Iansiti has performed consultant and advisory roles focusing on strategy and innovation for a variety of Fortune 500 companies. He has also testified as an expert witness before the European Commission and United States Department of Justice regarding antitrust and intellectual property issues in the high-tech industry.[7]
Development of the field of Ecosystem Strategy[edit]
Iansiti helped develop the field of Ecosystem Strategy, which focuses on the creation of firm-level strategies that are intimately connected to the surrounding business ecosystem.[8] Iansiti built upon the previous work of James F. Moore,[9] the founder of the field of Ecosystem Strategy, and is considered the current thought leader in the field. Iansiti examined firms such as Microsoft Corporation and Walmart, and found that the success of these firms depended heavily on the sustained health of complex networks of customers, suppliers, and competitors:

"Many industries today behave like a massively interconnected network of organizations, technologies, consumers and products. Perhaps the most dramatic and widely known example is the computing industry. In contrast with the vertically integrated environment of the 1960s and 1970s, today’s industry is divided into a large number of segments producing specialized products, technologies and services. The degree of interaction between firms in the industry is truly astounding, with hundreds of organizations frequently involved in the design, production, distribution, or implementation of even a single product. And because of this increasingly distributed industry structure, the focus of competition is shifting away from the management of internal resources, to the management and influence of assets that are outside the direct ownership and control of the firm."[10]

Iansiti went on to define the roles required for a business ecosystem to be considered healthy, including Keystones that provide a foundation for connecting and supporting other organizations within the ecosystem. This field of strategy provides insights for industries in which interdependencies and engagement with customers and suppliers are critical.
Contribution to Understanding the role of Information Technology in Modern Businesses[edit]
Iansiti has made a significant contribution to the field of Information Technology (IT) strategy, developing a framework for the assessment of capabilities created through firm-level investment in IT.[11] Iansiti's work in this area built upon research by others that had explored the link between IT investment and enterprise growth,[12] breaking enterprise growth into the capabilities IT enables and examining the impact of these individual capabilities on enterprise performance. This more nuanced approach led to a framework for assessing an organizations' level of IT maturity, referred to as the IT Scorecard. This scorecard allowed the return on an organization's IT investment to be measured more accurately than had been possible previously, and provided a more action-oriented assessment that could be used, for example, to focus improvement efforts on under-developed IT capabilities.
Contribution to Understanding the Digital Transformation of Business[edit]
Iansiti more recently made a contribution to the field of Technology Strategy to understand the phenomenon of digital transformation.[13] Iansiti's work in this area is in collaboration with Prof. Karim Lakhani, also of the Harvard Business School. It explores the evolution of models for value creation and capture as businesses increase in digital content. Examples range from General Electric to Google.
Key publications[edit]
Books
• One Strategy: Organization, Planning, and Decision Making (Wiley, 2009). Iansiti writes with Steven Sinofsky of Microsoft Corporation on the gap that often develops between top-down, directed strategy and bottom-up, emergent behavior within an organization. Iansiti and Sinofsky discuss the approach Sinofsky took within the Windows and Windows Live Group at Microsoft to bridge this gap during the development of the Windows 7 operating system.
• The Keystone Advantage: What the New Dynamics of Business Ecosystems Mean for Strategy, Innovation, and Sustainability (Harvard Business School Press, 2004) Iansiti writes with Roy Levien about the concept of the business ecosystem, whereby complex business networks can be thought of as interdependent ecosystems.[14] Within this context, Iansiti discusses the role of Keystones, firms that create a platform that sustains and enhances the health and performance of the business ecosystem.
• Technology Integration: Making Critical Choices in a Turbulent World (Harvard Business School Press, 1997) Iansiti writes about the choices faced by high-tech firms regarding the adoption and integration of new technologies into the firm’s offerings. Iansiti assesses the performance of technology integration projects and makes suggestions for organizational best practices.

Education[edit]
Iansiti graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University in 1983, with an A.B. in Physics.[3] He subsequently went on to perform his Ph.D. in Physics at Harvard University Iansiti’s Ph.D. thesis focused on experimental low temperature electronics and semiconductor microfabrication techniques.[4] He won the Robbins Physics Prize in 1986, and was awarded his Ph.D. in September 1988. He was awarded an IBM post-doctoral fellowship for 1988–1989, and performed research on the design and fabrication of next-generation microelectronic devices at Harvard University.[5]
Career[edit]
Iansiti’s academic research at the Harvard Business School has focused on technological innovation, product development, entrepreneurship, and operations-specifically the drivers of productivity, flexibility, and adaptation in organizations.[6] He is the author or coauthor of more than 50 articles, papers, book chapters, cases, and notes. Iansiti has also taught a variety of Executive Education and MBA courses on innovation, entrepreneurship, and operations, and is the creator of two Harvard Business School courses: "Managing Product Development" and "Starting New Ventures" (with Harvard Business School Professor Myra Hart).
Iansiti has performed consultant and advisory roles focusing on strategy and innovation for a variety of Fortune 500 companies. He has also testified as an expert witness before the European Commission and United States Department of Justice regarding antitrust and intellectual property issues in the high-tech industry.[7]
Development of the field of Ecosystem Strategy[edit]
Iansiti helped develop the field of Ecosystem Strategy, which focuses on the creation of firm-level strategies that are intimately connected to the surrounding business ecosystem.[8] Iansiti built upon the previous work of James F. Moore,[9] the founder of the field of Ecosystem Strategy, and is considered the current thought leader in the field. Iansiti examined firms such as Microsoft Corporation and Walmart, and found that the success of these firms depended heavily on the sustained health of complex networks of customers, suppliers, and competitors:

"Many industries today behave like a massively interconnected network of organizations, technologies, consumers and products. Perhaps the most dramatic and widely known example is the computing industry. In contrast with the vertically integrated environment of the 1960s and 1970s, today’s industry is divided into a large number of segments producing specialized products, technologies and services. The degree of interaction between firms in the industry is truly astounding, with hundreds of organizations frequently involved in the design, production, distribution, or implementation of even a single product. And because of this increasingly distributed industry structure, the focus of competition is shifting away from the management of internal resources, to the management and influence of assets that are outside the direct ownership and control of the firm."[10]

Iansiti went on to define the roles required for a business ecosystem to be considered healthy, including Keystones that provide a foundation for connecting and supporting other organizations within the ecosystem. This field of strategy provides insights for industries in which interdependencies and engagement with customers and suppliers are critical.
Contribution to Understanding the role of Information Technology in Modern Businesses[edit]
Iansiti has made a significant contribution to the field of Information Technology (IT) strategy, developing a framework for the assessment of capabilities created through firm-level investment in IT.[11] Iansiti's work in this area built upon research by others that had explored the link between IT investment and enterprise growth,[12] breaking enterprise growth into the capabilities IT enables and examining the impact of these individual capabilities on enterprise performance. This more nuanced approach led to a framework for assessing an organizations' level of IT maturity, referred to as the IT Scorecard. This scorecard allowed the return on an organization's IT investment to be measured more accurately than had been possible previously, and provided a more action-oriented assessment that could be used, for example, to focus improvement efforts on under-developed IT capabilities.
Contribution to Understanding the Digital Transformation of Business[edit]
Iansiti more recently made a contribution to the field of Technology Strategy to understand the phenomenon of digital transformation.[13] Iansiti's work in this area is in collaboration with Prof. Karim Lakhani, also of the Harvard Business School. It explores the evolution of models for value creation and capture as businesses increase in digital content. Examples range from General Electric to Google.
Key publications[edit]
Books
• One Strategy: Organization, Planning, and Decision Making (Wiley, 2009). Iansiti writes with Steven Sinofsky of Microsoft Corporation on the gap that often develops between top-down, directed strategy and bottom-up, emergent behavior within an organization. Iansiti and Sinofsky discuss the approach Sinofsky took within the Windows and Windows Live Group at Microsoft to bridge this gap during the development of the Windows 7 operating system.
• The Keystone Advantage: What the New Dynamics of Business Ecosystems Mean for Strategy, Innovation, and Sustainability (Harvard Business School Press, 2004) Iansiti writes with Roy Levien about the concept of the business ecosystem, whereby complex business networks can be thought of as interdependent ecosystems.[14] Within this context, Iansiti discusses the role of Keystones, firms that create a platform that sustains and enhances the health and performance of the business ecosystem.
• Technology Integration: Making Critical Choices in a Turbulent World (Harvard Business School Press, 1997) Iansiti writes about the choices faced by high-tech firms regarding the adoption and integration of new technologies into the firm’s offerings. Iansiti assesses the performance of technology integration projects and makes suggestions for organizational best practices.

Education[edit]
Iansiti graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University in 1983, with an A.B. in Physics.[3] He subsequently went on to perform his Ph.D. in Physics at Harvard University Iansiti’s Ph.D. thesis focused on experimental low temperature electronics and semiconductor microfabrication techniques.[4] He won the Robbins Physics Prize in 1986, and was awarded his Ph.D. in September 1988. He was awarded an IBM post-doctoral fellowship for 1988–1989, and performed research on the design and fabrication of next-generation microelectronic devices at Harvard University.[5]
Career[edit]
Iansiti’s academic research at the Harvard Business School has focused on technological innovation, product development, entrepreneurship, and operations-specifically the drivers of productivity, flexibility, and adaptation in organizations.[6] He is the author or coauthor of more than 50 articles, papers, book chapters, cases, and notes. Iansiti has also taught a variety of Executive Education and MBA courses on innovation, entrepreneurship, and operations, and is the creator of two Harvard Business School courses: "Managing Product Development" and "Starting New Ventures" (with Harvard Business School Professor Myra Hart).
Iansiti has performed consultant and advisory roles focusing on strategy and innovation for a variety of Fortune 500 companies. He has also testified as an expert witness before the European Commission and United States Department of Justice regarding antitrust and intellectual property issues in the high-tech industry.[7]
Development of the field of Ecosystem Strategy[edit]
Iansiti helped develop the field of Ecosystem Strategy, which focuses on the creation of firm-level strategies that are intimately connected to the surrounding business ecosystem.[8] Iansiti built upon the previous work of James F. Moore,[9] the founder of the field of Ecosystem Strategy, and is considered the current thought leader in the field. Iansiti examined firms such as Microsoft Corporation and Walmart, and found that the success of these firms depended heavily on the sustained health of complex networks of customers, suppliers, and competitors:

"Many industries today behave like a massively interconnected network of organizations, technologies, consumers and products. Perhaps the most dramatic and widely known example is the computing industry. In contrast with the vertically integrated environment of the 1960s and 1970s, today’s industry is divided into a large number of segments producing specialized products, technologies and services. The degree of interaction between firms in the industry is truly astounding, with hundreds of organizations frequently involved in the design, production, distribution, or implementation of even a single product. And because of this increasingly distributed industry structure, the focus of competition is shifting away from the management of internal resources, to the management and influence of assets that are outside the direct ownership and control of the firm."[10]

Iansiti went on to define the roles required for a business ecosystem to be considered healthy, including Keystones that provide a foundation for connecting and supporting other organizations within the ecosystem. This field of strategy provides insights for industries in which interdependencies and engagement with customers and suppliers are critical.
Contribution to Understanding the role of Information Technology in Modern Businesses[edit]
Iansiti has made a significant contribution to the field of Information Technology (IT) strategy, developing a framework for the assessment of capabilities created through firm-level investment in IT.[11] Iansiti's work in this area built upon research by others that had explored the link between IT investment and enterprise growth,[12] breaking enterprise growth into the capabilities IT enables and examining the impact of these individual capabilities on enterprise performance. This more nuanced approach led to a framework for assessing an organizations' level of IT maturity, referred to as the IT Scorecard. This scorecard allowed the return on an organization's IT investment to be measured more accurately than had been possible previously, and provided a more action-oriented assessment that could be used, for example, to focus improvement efforts on under-developed IT capabilities.
Contribution to Understanding the Digital Transformation of Business[edit]
Iansiti more recently made a contribution to the field of Technology Strategy to understand the phenomenon of digital transformation.[13] Iansiti's work in this area is in collaboration with Prof. Karim Lakhani, also of the Harvard Business School. It explores the evolution of models for value creation and capture as businesses increase in digital content. Examples range from General Electric to Google.
Key publications[edit]
Books
• One Strategy: Organization, Planning, and Decision Making (Wiley, 2009). Iansiti writes with Steven Sinofsky of Microsoft Corporation on the gap that often develops between top-down, directed strategy and bottom-up, emergent behavior within an organization. Iansiti and Sinofsky discuss the approach Sinofsky took within the Windows and Windows Live Group at Microsoft to bridge this gap during the development of the Windows 7 operating system.
• The Keystone Advantage: What the New Dynamics of Business Ecosystems Mean for Strategy, Innovation, and Sustainability (Harvard Business School Press, 2004) Iansiti writes with Roy Levien about the concept of the business ecosystem, whereby complex business networks can be thought of as interdependent ecosystems.[14] Within this context, Iansiti discusses the role of Keystones, firms that create a platform that sustains and enhances the health and performance of the business ecosystem.
• Technology Integration: Making Critical Choices in a Turbulent World (Harvard Business School Press, 1997) Iansiti writes about the choices faced by high-tech firms regarding the adoption and integration of new technologies into the firm’s offerings. Iansiti assesses the performance of technology integration projects and makes suggestions for organizational best practices.

                           Uncertain and dynamic environments present fundamental challenges to managers of the new product development process. Between
                              successive product generations, significant evolutions can occur in both the customer needs a product must address and the
                              technologies it employs to satisfy these needs. Furthermore, even within a single development project, firms must respond
                              to new information or risk developing a product that is obsolete the day it is launched. This paper examines the characteristics
                              of an effective development process in one such environment -- the internet software industry. Using data on 29 completed
                              development projects we show that in this industry, a more flexible approach to development is associated with better performing
                              products. This approach is characterized by the ability to generate and respond to new information for a longer proportion
                              of a development cycle. It is underpinned by greater investments in architectural design, earlier feedback on product performance
                              from the market, and the use of a development team with extensive product-based experience. Our results further suggest that
                              investments in architectural design must play a dual role in a flexible process; first through the selection of an architecture
                              which maximizes product performance, and second, through the adoption of an architecture which facilitates process flexibility.
                              We provide examples from our field work to support this view

                           We report a low temperature study of very small superconducting tunnel junctions. The samples were fabricated by using electron-beam
                              lithography and thermal evaporation in single-junction, double-junction and eleven-junction- array configurations. The junctions
                              had normal resistances between 0.5 and 140 kilo-ohms and areas between 0.1 and 0.02 sq micron. We measured the current- voltage
                              characteristics of the devices at low temperatures (20 mk -4 K), using a dilution refrigerator. In general, the devices had
                              a large single electron charging energy E(c) is identical to sq e /2c of order 1 K. By varying the ratio of Ec to the Josephson
                              coupling energy E(j), we studied the crossover between the conventional Josephson regime, in which E(j)>>E(c), and the Coulomb
                              blockade regime, in which charging effects are dominant. For comparable charging and Josephson energies the I-V curve is resistive
                              at all currents, and exhibits a novel low-voltage resistance R(o) at currents less than the critical current Ic. (RH)

                           Many studies highlight the challenges facing incumbent firms in responding effectively to major technological transitions.
                              While some authors argue that these challenges can be overcome by firms possessing what have been called "dynamic capabilities,"
                              little work has described in detail the critical resources that these capabilities leverage, or the processes through which
                              these resources accumulate and evolve. This paper explores these issues through an in-depth exploratory case study of one
                              firm that has demonstrated consistently strong performance in an industry that is highly dynamic and uncertain

                              There is considerable confusion among academics and practitioners over how (or if) information technology (IT) impacts corporate
                                 performance. Can a typical company benefit from a focus on information technology to differentiate itself from competitors
                                 and achieve important business objectives? Our research has found this is indeed the case, but that the answer is not found
                                 in a simple measure of the dollars invested in IT. In our study we wanted to focus on what IT actually does for a business.
                                 To accomplish this, we developed an approach that measures the business capabilities IT can enable. Our results show a high
                                 correlation between IT capability and profitable business growth. Firms that build high capability IT systems grow faster
                                 than firms that do not, and do so while increasing both revenue and profits

                              This paper reports on an empirical study of the management of technological transitions. It focuses on project-level mechanisms
                                 for the generation of knowledge through experimentation and for its accumulation through individual experience. It proposes
                                 a model that links these mechanisms to effectiveness in the management of revolutionary and evolutionary development approaches.
                                 This argument is tested with data describing projects conducted by all major competitors in the semiconductor industry. Each
                                 project was aimed at a technological transition, defined as the introduction of a major new generation of process technology.
                                 The analysis shows substantial differences among competitors in the approach taken (i.e., evolutionary vs. revolutionary)
                                 and results achieved. Additionally, it shows that individual organizations can migrate, over time, from evolution to revolution
                                 and vice versa. The analysis further indicates that accumulating experience and generating knowledge through experimentation
                                 are significantly associated with project performance. While product performance improvement through revolution is associated
                                 with research experience and with parallel experimentation capacity, improvement through evolution is associated with project
                                 experience and minimum experimental iteration time

                              In this paper, we introduce a framework for understanding the implications for the management of innovation and operations
                                 in business ecosystems. We draw heavily from the fields of complexity theory and especially evolutionary biology, which provide
                                 a motivating framework and a source of inspiration for understanding the behavior of large, loosely-connected networks

                              In this paper, we examine the motivations of large information technology ("IT") vendors, to invest in open source software
                                 ("OSS"). What drives companies with large, proprietary software portfolios to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in OSS?
                                 We approach this question by grouping a sample of OSS projects into clusters and examining vendors' motivations for each cluster.
                                 We find one cluster has received almost no investment. Contributions to projects in this cluster are confined to the voluntary
                                 effort of the vendors' employees, and vendors are likely altruistically motivated. By contrast, the other cluster has received
                                 over 99% of vendor investments. Here, vendors are more likely economically motivated to invest in OSS projects that can serve
                                 as a complementary asset to vendors' core, proprietary businesses

Education[edit]
Iansiti graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University in 1983, with an A.B. in Physics.[3] He subsequently went on to perform his Ph.D. in Physics at Harvard University Iansiti’s Ph.D. thesis focused on experimental low temperature electronics and semiconductor microfabrication techniques.[4] He won the Robbins Physics Prize in 1986, and was awarded his Ph.D. in September 1988. He was awarded an IBM post-doctoral fellowship for 1988–1989, and performed research on the design and fabrication of next-generation microelectronic devices at Harvard University.[5]
Career[edit]
Iansiti’s academic research at the Harvard Business School has focused on technological innovation, product development, entrepreneurship, and operations-specifically the drivers of productivity, flexibility, and adaptation in organizations.[6] He is the author or coauthor of more than 50 articles, papers, book chapters, cases, and notes. Iansiti has also taught a variety of Executive Education and MBA courses on innovation, entrepreneurship, and operations, and is the creator of two Harvard Business School courses: "Managing Product Development" and "Starting New Ventures" (with Harvard Business School Professor Myra Hart).
Iansiti has performed consultant and advisory roles focusing on strategy and innovation for a variety of Fortune 500 companies. He has also testified as an expert witness before the European Commission and United States Department of Justice regarding antitrust and intellectual property issues in the high-tech industry.[7]
Development of the field of Ecosystem Strategy[edit]
Iansiti helped develop the field of Ecosystem Strategy, which focuses on the creation of firm-level strategies that are intimately connected to the surrounding business ecosystem.[8] Iansiti built upon the previous work of James F. Moore,[9] the founder of the field of Ecosystem Strategy, and is considered the current thought leader in the field. Iansiti examined firms such as Microsoft Corporation and Walmart, and found that the success of these firms depended heavily on the sustained health of complex networks of customers, suppliers, and competitors:

"Many industries today behave like a massively interconnected network of organizations, technologies, consumers and products. Perhaps the most dramatic and widely known example is the computing industry. In contrast with the vertically integrated environment of the 1960s and 1970s, today’s industry is divided into a large number of segments producing specialized products, technologies and services. The degree of interaction between firms in the industry is truly astounding, with hundreds of organizations frequently involved in the design, production, distribution, or implementation of even a single product. And because of this increasingly distributed industry structure, the focus of competition is shifting away from the management of internal resources, to the management and influence of assets that are outside the direct ownership and control of the firm."[10]

Iansiti went on to define the roles required for a business ecosystem to be considered healthy, including Keystones that provide a foundation for connecting and supporting other organizations within the ecosystem. This field of strategy provides insights for industries in which interdependencies and engagement with customers and suppliers are critical.
Contribution to Understanding the role of Information Technology in Modern Businesses[edit]
Iansiti has made a significant contribution to the field of Information Technology (IT) strategy, developing a framework for the assessment of capabilities created through firm-level investment in IT.[11] Iansiti's work in this area built upon research by others that had explored the link between IT investment and enterprise growth,[12] breaking enterprise growth into the capabilities IT enables and examining the impact of these individual capabilities on enterprise performance. This more nuanced approach led to a framework for assessing an organizations' level of IT maturity, referred to as the IT Scorecard. This scorecard allowed the return on an organization's IT investment to be measured more accurately than had been possible previously, and provided a more action-oriented assessment that could be used, for example, to focus improvement efforts on under-developed IT capabilities.
Contribution to Understanding the Digital Transformation of Business[edit]
Iansiti more recently made a contribution to the field of Technology Strategy to understand the phenomenon of digital transformation.[13] Iansiti's work in this area is in collaboration with Prof. Karim Lakhani, also of the Harvard Business School. It explores the evolution of models for value creation and capture as businesses increase in digital content. Examples range from General Electric to Google.
Key publications[edit]
Books
• One Strategy: Organization, Planning, and Decision Making (Wiley, 2009). Iansiti writes with Steven Sinofsky of Microsoft Corporation on the gap that often develops between top-down, directed strategy and bottom-up, emergent behavior within an organization. Iansiti and Sinofsky discuss the approach Sinofsky took within the Windows and Windows Live Group at Microsoft to bridge this gap during the development of the Windows 7 operating system.
• The Keystone Advantage: What the New Dynamics of Business Ecosystems Mean for Strategy, Innovation, and Sustainability (Harvard Business School Press, 2004) Iansiti writes with Roy Levien about the concept of the business ecosystem, whereby complex business networks can be thought of as interdependent ecosystems.[14] Within this context, Iansiti discusses the role of Keystones, firms that create a platform that sustains and enhances the health and performance of the business ecosystem.
• Technology Integration: Making Critical Choices in a Turbulent World (Harvard Business School Press, 1997) Iansiti writes about the choices faced by high-tech firms regarding the adoption and integration of new technologies into the firm’s offerings. Iansiti assesses the performance of technology integration projects and makes suggestions for organizational best practices.

Education[edit]
Iansiti graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University in 1983, with an A.B. in Physics.[3] He subsequently went on to perform his Ph.D. in Physics at Harvard University Iansiti’s Ph.D. thesis focused on experimental low temperature electronics and semiconductor microfabrication techniques.[4] He won the Robbins Physics Prize in 1986, and was awarded his Ph.D. in September 1988. He was awarded an IBM post-doctoral fellowship for 1988–1989, and performed research on the design and fabrication of next-generation microelectronic devices at Harvard University.[5]
Career[edit]
Iansiti’s academic research at the Harvard Business School has focused on technological innovation, product development, entrepreneurship, and operations-specifically the drivers of productivity, flexibility, and adaptation in organizations.[6] He is the author or coauthor of more than 50 articles, papers, book chapters, cases, and notes. Iansiti has also taught a variety of Executive Education and MBA courses on innovation, entrepreneurship, and operations, and is the creator of two Harvard Business School courses: "Managing Product Development" and "Starting New Ventures" (with Harvard Business School Professor Myra Hart).
Iansiti has performed consultant and advisory roles focusing on strategy and innovation for a variety of Fortune 500 companies. He has also testified as an expert witness before the European Commission and United States Department of Justice regarding antitrust and intellectual property issues in the high-tech industry.[7]
Development of the field of Ecosystem Strategy[edit]
Iansiti helped develop the field of Ecosystem Strategy, which focuses on the creation of firm-level strategies that are intimately connected to the surrounding business ecosystem.[8] Iansiti built upon the previous work of James F. Moore,[9] the founder of the field of Ecosystem Strategy, and is considered the current thought leader in the field. Iansiti examined firms such as Microsoft Corporation and Walmart, and found that the success of these firms depended heavily on the sustained health of complex networks of customers, suppliers, and competitors:

"Many industries today behave like a massively interconnected network of organizations, technologies, consumers and products. Perhaps the most dramatic and widely known example is the computing industry. In contrast with the vertically integrated environment of the 1960s and 1970s, today’s industry is divided into a large number of segments producing specialized products, technologies and services. The degree of interaction between firms in the industry is truly astounding, with hundreds of organizations frequently involved in the design, production, distribution, or implementation of even a single product. And because of this increasingly distributed industry structure, the focus of competition is shifting away from the management of internal resources, to the management and influence of assets that are outside the direct ownership and control of the firm."[10]

Iansiti went on to define the roles required for a business ecosystem to be considered healthy, including Keystones that provide a foundation for connecting and supporting other organizations within the ecosystem. This field of strategy provides insights for industries in which interdependencies and engagement with customers and suppliers are critical.
Contribution to Understanding the role of Information Technology in Modern Businesses[edit]
Iansiti has made a significant contribution to the field of Information Technology (IT) strategy, developing a framework for the assessment of capabilities created through firm-level investment in IT.[11] Iansiti's work in this area built upon research by others that had explored the link between IT investment and enterprise growth,[12] breaking enterprise growth into the capabilities IT enables and examining the impact of these individual capabilities on enterprise performance. This more nuanced approach led to a framework for assessing an organizations' level of IT maturity, referred to as the IT Scorecard. This scorecard allowed the return on an organization's IT investment to be measured more accurately than had been possible previously, and provided a more action-oriented assessment that could be used, for example, to focus improvement efforts on under-developed IT capabilities.
Contribution to Understanding the Digital Transformation of Business[edit]
Iansiti more recently made a contribution to the field of Technology Strategy to understand the phenomenon of digital transformation.[13] Iansiti's work in this area is in collaboration with Prof. Karim Lakhani, also of the Harvard Business School. It explores the evolution of models for value creation and capture as businesses increase in digital content. Examples range from General Electric to Google.
Key publications[edit]
Books
• One Strategy: Organization, Planning, and Decision Making (Wiley, 2009). Iansiti writes with Steven Sinofsky of Microsoft Corporation on the gap that often develops between top-down, directed strategy and bottom-up, emergent behavior within an organization. Iansiti and Sinofsky discuss the approach Sinofsky took within the Windows and Windows Live Group at Microsoft to bridge this gap during the development of the Windows 7 operating system.
• The Keystone Advantage: What the New Dynamics of Business Ecosystems Mean for Strategy, Innovation, and Sustainability (Harvard Business School Press, 2004) Iansiti writes with Roy Levien about the concept of the business ecosystem, whereby complex business networks can be thought of as interdependent ecosystems.[14] Within this context, Iansiti discusses the role of Keystones, firms that create a platform that sustains and enhances the health and performance of the business ecosystem.
• Technology Integration: Making Critical Choices in a Turbulent World (Harvard Business School Press, 1997) Iansiti writes about the choices faced by high-tech firms regarding the adoption and integration of new technologies into the firm’s offerings. Iansiti assesses the performance of technology integration projects and makes suggestions for organizational best practices.

The Revolution in Advertising: From Don Draper to Big Data

Advertising in the digital age bears little resemblance to the Mad Men depiction—the Don Drapers of advertising have been replaced by big data and the people who work with it. Professor John Deighton, the author of the case "WPP: From Mad Men to Math Men (and Women)," and Sir Martin Sorrell, founder and group chief executive of WPP and the protagonist in the case, discuss how WPP has been successful in the new advertising world order, where algorithms and robots rule.

One Strategy: Aligning Planning and Execution
by Sean Silverthorne

							
									Strategy as it is written up in the corporate playbook often becomes lost or muddled when the team takes the field to execute. In their new book, Professor Marco Iansiti and Microsoft's Steven Sinofsky discuss a "One Strategy" approach to aligning plan and action. Key concepts include: The book combines practical experience at Microsoft with conceptual frameworks on how to develop strategies that are aligned with execution in a rapidly changing competitive environment. "Strategic integrity" occurs when the strategy executes with the full, aligned backing of the organization for maximum impact. The chief impediment to strategy execution is inertia. The One Strategy approach is less about formal reviews and more about one-on-one conversation. Blogs can be a powerful asset in managing an organization.

Principles that Matter: Sustaining Software Innovation from the Client to the Web
by Marco Iansiti

							
									Despite the current strength and promise of the Internet software market, the future pace of growth and innovation is not assured. The principles of choice, opportunity, and interoperability were important in the growth of PC software and in the overall health of the information technology ecosystem, and these same principles will shape competition in Internet software, according to HBS professor Marco Iansiti. Given the unprecedented speed at which this industry is developing, consumers and the industry should watch carefully as different companies compete. Choice, opportunity, and interoperability should serve as an important lens, particularly when focused on companies with especially large footprints in the new markets. Key concepts include: Successful technology companies should not forget that innovation and growth in the technology sector is dependent on promoting a thriving ecosystem of complementary and interdependent products. The competitive principles of choice, opportunity, and interoperability are important in Internet software, because of the increased variety of possible software and hardware combinations and the increased interdependency in the applications and services they deliver.

Dynamics of Platform Competition: Exploring the Role of Installed Base, Platform Quality and Consumer Expectations
by Feng Zhu & Marco Iansiti

							
									What factors drive platform success, long-run market structure, and market efficiency? Conventional wisdom suggests that for a new platform to be successful, either it must make its technology compatible with the incumbent, or its technical advantage must offer so much value to consumers that it exceeds the combination of functionality, installed base, and complementary goods value offered by the incumbent. Zhu and Iansiti develop a dynamic model to examine the evolution of platform-based markets. They find that a huge quality advantage may not be necessary for an entrant to be successful. Using data from the video game industry, they find support for their theoretical predications. Key concepts include: A huge quality advantage may not be necessary for success. When market dynamics are driven by quality, a platform with a small quality advantage can also be successful. Xbox has a small quality advantage over Playstation 2 and the market dynamics are quality driven. These results help explain the successful entry of the Xbox console into this market and provide support for Zhu and Iansiti's theoretical model. Installed-base advantages do not necessarily provide a safety shield for the incumbent. To defend its leadership position, the incumbent needs to constantly enhance its quality.

The Business of Free Software
by Julia Hanna

							
									Breaking with a largely proprietary tradition, large IT vendors have invested several billion dollars into open-source software development. What's their motivation? The observations presented in research by professor Marco Iansiti and coauthor Gregory L. Richards suggest some fundamental changes in strategy used by technology companies. Key concepts include: IT vendors that traditionally have relied on proprietary-software development are increasingly turning to the open source software community to create pieces of their products. Many IT vendors invest in open source projects that draw customers to a vendor's mainly proprietary, core businesses—the razor/razor blade approach. This trend is changing some classic rules of strategy and forcing IT vendors to reconsider not only how they develop software but also where they derive value in their business models.

The Business of Free Software: Enterprise Incentives, Investment, and Motivation in the Open Source Community
by Marco Iansiti & Gregory L. Richards

							
									IBM has contributed more than $1 billion to the development and promotion of the Linux operating system, and other vendors such as Sun are ramping up open source software efforts and investment. Why do information technology vendors that have traditionally sold proprietary software invest millions of dollars in OSS? Where have they chosen to invest, and what are the characteristics of the OSS projects to which they contribute? This study grouped OSS projects into clusters and identified IT vendors' motives in each cluster. Key concepts include: Cluster 1, the "money-driven cluster," consisted of projects that have received almost all of vendor investments. The eighteen projects in this cluster have received over $2 billion in investment. Cluster 2, the "community-driven cluster," has a large number of projects that have received almost no vendor investment. IT vendors have generally ignored projects in this cluster and appear to have no coordinated strategy for dealing with them. Examining the impact of projects in both clusters shows that vendors have not invested uniformly in high-impact OSS projects. Instead, vendors invest in projects that can serve to draw revenues to their own (largely proprietary) core business.

Why IT Matters in Midsized Firms
by Marco Iansiti, George Favaloro, James Utzschneider & Greg Richards

							
									What does IT actually contribute to a business? Is IT a commodity like electricity or is it a crucial element of competitive advantage? In a study of over 600 medium-sized global firms to analyze the business benefits that IT can enable, the authors found that IT capability was key to profitable business growth. This was true in both the U.S. product and services sectors as well as in Germany and Brazil. Key concepts include: IT matters. IT enables firms to scale. The amount a company spends on IT is a poor indicator of IT functionality and business impact. Firms with business process scalability find it easier to overcome obstacles to growth, differentiate themselves from competitors, and quickly capitalize on opportunities.

Information Technology Ecosystem Health and Performance
by Marco Iansiti & Gregory L. Richards

							
									An IT ecosystem is "the network of organizations that drives the creation and delivery of information technology products and services." To understand the health and well being of the IT industry in the context of an ecosystem, the authors looked at three crucial IT ecosystem metrics: productivity, robustness, and innovation. Key concepts include: The IT ecosystem is strong in all three of the most important sectors of hardware, software, and services. Since the recession and retrenchment several years ago, the IT ecosystem has regained its health, competitiveness, and productivity. There are currently significant levels of innovation from both new market entrants as well as incumbent market leaders.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Education[edit]
Iansiti graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University in 1983, with an A.B. in Physics.[3] He subsequently went on to perform his Ph.D. in Physics at Harvard University Iansiti’s Ph.D. thesis focused on experimental low temperature electronics and semiconductor microfabrication techniques.[4] He won the Robbins Physics Prize in 1986, and was awarded his Ph.D. in September 1988. He was awarded an IBM post-doctoral fellowship for 1988–1989, and performed research on the design and fabrication of next-generation microelectronic devices at Harvard University.[5]
Career[edit]
Iansiti’s academic research at the Harvard Business School has focused on technological innovation, product development, entrepreneurship, and operations-specifically the drivers of productivity, flexibility, and adaptation in organizations.[6] He is the author or coauthor of more than 50 articles, papers, book chapters, cases, and notes. Iansiti has also taught a variety of Executive Education and MBA courses on innovation, entrepreneurship, and operations, and is the creator of two Harvard Business School courses: "Managing Product Development" and "Starting New Ventures" (with Harvard Business School Professor Myra Hart).
Iansiti has performed consultant and advisory roles focusing on strategy and innovation for a variety of Fortune 500 companies. He has also testified as an expert witness before the European Commission and United States Department of Justice regarding antitrust and intellectual property issues in the high-tech industry.[7]
Development of the field of Ecosystem Strategy[edit]
Iansiti helped develop the field of Ecosystem Strategy, which focuses on the creation of firm-level strategies that are intimately connected to the surrounding business ecosystem.[8] Iansiti built upon the previous work of James F. Moore,[9] the founder of the field of Ecosystem Strategy, and is considered the current thought leader in the field. Iansiti examined firms such as Microsoft Corporation and Walmart, and found that the success of these firms depended heavily on the sustained health of complex networks of customers, suppliers, and competitors:

"Many industries today behave like a massively interconnected network of organizations, technologies, consumers and products. Perhaps the most dramatic and widely known example is the computing industry. In contrast with the vertically integrated environment of the 1960s and 1970s, today’s industry is divided into a large number of segments producing specialized products, technologies and services. The degree of interaction between firms in the industry is truly astounding, with hundreds of organizations frequently involved in the design, production, distribution, or implementation of even a single product. And because of this increasingly distributed industry structure, the focus of competition is shifting away from the management of internal resources, to the management and influence of assets that are outside the direct ownership and control of the firm."[10]

Iansiti went on to define the roles required for a business ecosystem to be considered healthy, including Keystones that provide a foundation for connecting and supporting other organizations within the ecosystem. This field of strategy provides insights for industries in which interdependencies and engagement with customers and suppliers are critical.
Contribution to Understanding the role of Information Technology in Modern Businesses[edit]
Iansiti has made a significant contribution to the field of Information Technology (IT) strategy, developing a framework for the assessment of capabilities created through firm-level investment in IT.[11] Iansiti's work in this area built upon research by others that had explored the link between IT investment and enterprise growth,[12] breaking enterprise growth into the capabilities IT enables and examining the impact of these individual capabilities on enterprise performance. This more nuanced approach led to a framework for assessing an organizations' level of IT maturity, referred to as the IT Scorecard. This scorecard allowed the return on an organization's IT investment to be measured more accurately than had been possible previously, and provided a more action-oriented assessment that could be used, for example, to focus improvement efforts on under-developed IT capabilities.
Contribution to Understanding the Digital Transformation of Business[edit]
Iansiti more recently made a contribution to the field of Technology Strategy to understand the phenomenon of digital transformation.[13] Iansiti's work in this area is in collaboration with Prof. Karim Lakhani, also of the Harvard Business School. It explores the evolution of models for value creation and capture as businesses increase in digital content. Examples range from General Electric to Google.
Key publications[edit]
Books
• One Strategy: Organization, Planning, and Decision Making (Wiley, 2009). Iansiti writes with Steven Sinofsky of Microsoft Corporation on the gap that often develops between top-down, directed strategy and bottom-up, emergent behavior within an organization. Iansiti and Sinofsky discuss the approach Sinofsky took within the Windows and Windows Live Group at Microsoft to bridge this gap during the development of the Windows 7 operating system.
• The Keystone Advantage: What the New Dynamics of Business Ecosystems Mean for Strategy, Innovation, and Sustainability (Harvard Business School Press, 2004) Iansiti writes with Roy Levien about the concept of the business ecosystem, whereby complex business networks can be thought of as interdependent ecosystems.[14] Within this context, Iansiti discusses the role of Keystones, firms that create a platform that sustains and enhances the health and performance of the business ecosystem.
• Technology Integration: Making Critical Choices in a Turbulent World (Harvard Business School Press, 1997) Iansiti writes about the choices faced by high-tech firms regarding the adoption and integration of new technologies into the firm’s offerings. Iansiti assesses the performance of technology integration projects and makes suggestions for organizational best practices.

One Strategy: Aligning Planning and Execution
Every firm has two strategies. Unfortunately, these strategies often diverge







By Sean Silverthorne
 Published:  Jan 28, 2011

	Every firm has two strategies, we learn early on in the pages of One Strategy: Organization, Planning, and Decision Making. "Explicit" strategy is the one you read about in your company's planning memos and PowerPoint slides. The second, "implicit" strategy, is what emerges when middle managers and line employees attempt to execute the explicit strategy. Unfortunately, these strategies often diverge. They are not aligned. And so the potential of the enterprise becomes unrealized. "Strategy therefore becomes the product of the firm's incentives, structures, and patterns of behavior, not the other way around," writes Harvard Business School professor Marco Iansiti, an expert on innovation, entrepreneurship, and operations.  



Marco Iansiti is the David Sarnoff Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School

						
					This happened at computer maker Dell, says Iansiti. Ossified in a deep culture of direct sales to corporate customers, the company was slow to take advantage of a rapidly emerging consumer market—at least until founder Michael Dell returned to shake things up."Our past is littered with firms that failed to adapt to competitive changes," Iansiti says in an interview with HBS Working Knowledge. "Obtaining One Strategy in times of change means the organization will respond in a holistic fashion to new challenges, staying aligned for maximum competitive impact."The book follows Microsoft's Windows 7 development team, headed by Steven Sinofsky, as it encounters and overcomes many of these same challenges. Sinofsky's blog posts to his team provide a behind-the-scenes look at how the One Strategy approach works in practice.Sean Silverthorne: How did you get the idea for this book?Marco Iansiti: Steven Sinofsky and I have known each other for more than 10 years, and have often worked together on projects such as cases and articles. After spending over a decade with the Microsoft Office team, Steven was asked to manage Windows development in May 2006, as Windows Vista development was winding down. During his time with Windows, Steven wrote over 1,000 pages of blogs to communicate with his team. This provided an incredible wealth of information from which to draw and synthesize what we now believe are some pretty interesting insights. The book combines a selection of Steven's blogs with practical conceptual frameworks on how to develop strategies that are aligned with execution in a rapidly changing competitive environment.Q: Who will benefit from reading it?A: Our audience is senior managers in any industry. Specialists in the high-tech sector will find it particularly interesting because it reflects on crucial competitive dynamics in their space. However, managers outside the tech sector will still appreciate the general management lessons throughout the book.Q: What is strategic integrity, and why is it important?A: Every firm has two strategies. The first is top-down, "directed" strategy—what the CEO and the senior management team believe the firm should focus on. The second is bottom-up, "emergent" strategy, which is established by the actual decisions and behaviors in the organization.Directed strategy is what management believes needs to get done, while emergent strategy represents what actually gets done. Strategic integrity is when emergent and directed strategies are one and the same thing: when the strategy executes with the full, aligned backing of the organization for maximum impact. When a strategy lacks integrity it's like those war movie spoofs when the cavalry general goes on the attack, only to find that none of his troops actually follow him.The book provides a very pragmatic (and detailed) look at how to achieve strategic integrity. This is not a theory book, but a book that offers insights and tools one can put into practice. Steven and I describe in detail how to build organizational capabilities, set up a good structure, implement the right processes, and adopt an effective management style.Achieving strategic integrity is always important since managers naturally wish to maximize the impact of their strategies. However, the notion of strategic integrity is particularly important in times of change. Our past is littered with firms that failed to adapt to competitive changes. Obtaining One Strategy in times of change means the organization will respond in a holistic fashion to new challenges, staying aligned for maximum competitive impact.Q: What are the chief impediments to strategy execution?A: The chief impediment is inertia. Over time, organizations tend to optimize the efficiency of their operating model. Dell's direct model, during the 1995-2005 time frame, is the perfect example. Every process, every incentive, every cultural norm was optimized to deliver efficiently, bypassing the retail channel. When the strategy changed, the organization simply did not follow. Execution continued along the old inertial path, and the organization failed to adapt, despite the intentions of senior management. The structures, processes, and behaviors defined in the book are designed to break inertia, and maintain strategic alignment in times of change.Q: To plan or not to plan? Your own research sheds some light on the question of whether top-down project planning has become outdated in today's fast-moving environments. What did you discover, and how did Microsoft do it?A: Planning is key. Planning is the glue that holds the organization together, providing a way to test the strategy, determine its feasibility, improve it through collective feedback, and align capabilities to drive its execution.Planning is central to the One Strategy approach. But the planning process we describe is going to surprise many executives. It's not the usual top-down, rigid, budget-style race for resources, or a "brain trust"—driven process developed by a select set of the "top people."Planning for One Strategy is iterative and collaborative, defining a framework for executing on the strategic priorities, while refining the strategy and aligning the organization around its features. Planning is the process that more than any other activity works to align the organization around one set of goals, top-down, bottom-up, and "middle-out." By necessity, planning is a process that involves many people and empowers those closest to the knowledge and the work.	
		  
	
Q: One thing that struck me in Steven Sinofsky's blog was how relatively little of his time was devoted to formal product reviews. Going in I would have bet that these kinds of meetings would be huge at Microsoft. What did you make of this practice?A: In a review, the middle managers typically deliver a PowerPoint presentation that formalizes issues around project status to the executive in charge of the project. This makes no sense if you truly believe that the point is aligning the whole organization around the strategy, not convincing the one executive that you are following his or her ideas.The One Strategy approach is less about formal reviews and more about one-on-one conversation. The idea is to maintain as much as possible a rich, two-way, and informal exchange of ideas to make sure that the strategy is perfected and the priorities are universally shared. There is no point in spending days preparing slides that portray an often-artificial look at the project to convince your manager that you understand his or her views. The point is for everyone to contribute to perfect the approach, and do so in a collaborative fashion and with integrity. Beautiful, handcrafted slides don't cut it. What you want is free, informal discussion around the realities of the project.Q: The One Strategy approach is mirrored in your discussion of the "innovator's reality." The reality is that in designing new products innovators can't ignore the benefits users received from previous versions. How should companies think of existing products when it comes to creating new ones?A: Answering this question goes back to our definition of innovation. Innovation is invention times impact. Invention is nice, but if it has no economic or social impact it is useless.This view on innovation highlights the interesting role played by established firms. Traditionally, my academic field has argued that big companies have trouble innovating because their businesses are too complex, with assets, processes, and capabilities that make the organization inflexible. However, those same assets are also extremely valuable when it comes to achieving impact. Established enterprises have customer relationships, channels to market, technical capabilities, critical data and information about consumers, along with a myriad other factors that will increase the impact of any innovation they come up with. Apple, Microsoft, Google, and IBM are all established firms, each with a remarkable track record of innovations that built on past capabilities.The same assets, processes, and capabilities that make established firms complex and hard to manage also make them incredibly powerful and impactful. The innovator's reality is that in order for a product to be successful, it has to master the complexity of customer adoption—and customers are used to the richness of previous versions and traditional solutions (the first successful hybrid cars, for instance, had to have air bags just like their predecessors). This means that established firms start with a huge advantage in that they have already mastered answers to these problems. Rather than being helpless when confronted by start-ups, established firms should leverage their traditional capabilities and manage their way to success—as long as they can figure out how to get the organization aligned around the new strategies.Q: One way that Sinofsky communicates with his staff is via a quite detailed blog on his management philosophy. What did you think of this idea, and is it a model that other managers should follow?A: Blogs are a powerful asset in managing an organization. If you are responsible for hundreds or thousands of people, ensuring clear, consistent communication of your ideas to the entire group is a difficult challenge. As Steven demonstrates, blogs are highly effective in aligning an organization, jump-starting a two-way interaction that can really shape strategy and align the organization around it.Blogging, today, is increasingly common. In an informal poll in the School's General Management Program, which brings in executives from around the world, about 20 percent said they write a regular blog.Q: Care to comment on Toyota, which is held up as a model at the end of the book, but which has since suffered very public problems? I wonder if its admitted overemphasis on growth at the expense of quality might be an example of the dangers of separating strategy development from strategy execution?A: The Toyota story becomes more interesting every day. There is no question that decades of success at Toyota demonstrate the power of its management systems and approaches. At the same time, the roots of its current crisis appear very deep.It is difficult to understand exactly what happened since the questions have barely started, but it seems quite possible that Toyota's model may have ossified a bit, as what happened with the Dell example we discuss in chapter 1. Some of the accounts that I have seen point to an inability by management to detect long-term patterns across different recalls.Whether the organization was still aligned in both the strategic importance of quality and in the execution of a quality strategy might have contributed to the situation we see today. Clearly many questions remain.Q: What are you working on now?A: The main thing I am working on is a generalization of the One Strategy framework by running an empirical study across four industries, namely online services, foods, semiconductors, and health-care devices. Each of these sectors is undergoing a tremendous transformation, and I am following very closely the strategic behavior of key firms.

Drawn from Sinofsky's internal Microsoft blog where he communicated some of the management processes the team put to work while developing a 4,000 person, multi-year project - Microsoft Windows 7 - One Strategy shares the hard-won insights you can use to successfully make the leap from strategy to execution.

The Truth about Blockchain
Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani
Contracts, transactions, and records of them provide critical structure in our economic system, but they haven’t kept up with the world’s digital transformation. They’re like rush-hour gridlock trapping a Formula 1 race car. Blockchain promises to solve this problem. The technology behind bitcoin, blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that records transactions safely, permanently and very efficiently. For instance, while the transfer of a share of stock can now take up to a week, with blockchain it could happen in seconds. Blockchain could slash the cost of transactions and eliminate intermediaries like lawyers and bankers, and that could transform the economy. But, like the adoption of more Internet technologies, blockchain’s adoption will require broad coordination and will take years. The authors describe the path that blockchain is likely to follow and explain how firms should think about investments in it.

Digital Ubiquity: How Connections, Sensors, and Data Are Revolutionizing Business
Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani
When Google bought Nest, a maker of digital thermostats, for $3.2 billion just a few months ago, it was a clear indication that digital transformation and connection are spreading across even the most traditional industrial segments and creating a staggering array of business opportunities and threats.

The digitization of tasks and processes has become essential to competition. General Electric, for example, was at risk of losing many of its top customers to nontraditional competitors—IBM and SAP on the one hand, big data start-ups on the other—offering data-intensive, analytics-based services that could connect to any industrial device. So GE launched a multibillion-dollar initiative focused on what it calls the industrial internet: adding digital sensors to its machines; connecting them to a common, cloud-based software platform; investing in software development capabilities; building advanced analytics capabilities; and embracing crowd-based product development. With all this, GE is evolving its business model. Now, for example, revenue from its jet engines is tied to reduced downtime and miles flown over the course of a year. After just three years, GE is generating more than $1.5 billion in incremental income with digitally enabled, outcomes-based business models. The company expects that number to double in 2014 and again in 2015.

A Study of Economic Impact of Cloud Computing
Marco Iansiti and Gregory L. Richards
In this paper we find that advances in cloud computing likely will extend the IT induced economic growth in developed economies and foster growth in economies where IT penetration is not yet fully mature. We conclude that governments should work together to take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing.

Entry into Platform-based Markets
Feng Zhu and Marco Iansiti
This paper examines the relative importance of platform quality, indirect network effects, and consumer expectations on the success of entrants in platform-based markets. We develop a theoretical model and find that an entrant's success depends on the strength of indirect network effects and on the consumers' discount factor for future applications. We then illustrate the model's applicability by examining Xbox's entry into the video game industry. We find that Xbox had a small quality advantage over the incumbent, PlayStation 2, and the strength of indirect network effects and the consumers' discount factor, while statistically significant, fall in the region where PlayStation's position is unsustainable.

The Information Technology Ecosystem: Structure, Health, and Performance
Marco Iansiti and Gregory L. Richards
A number of modern industries are organized as complex networks of firms whose integrated efforts are necessary to deliver value to end customers. The complexity of these networks, or business ecosystems, and the associated interdependencies among firms, make traditional antitrust market analysis difficult. The information technology (IT) industry today consists of a rapidly evolving and massively interconnected network of organizations, technologies, products, and consumers. In the IT ecosystem, the vast majority of organizations provide applications. To assess the health and competitiveness of business ecosystems, three aspects of ecosystem health inspired by their biological metaphor and expressed in terms of their ecosystem analogy: robustness, productivity, and innovation are used. In conclusion, the ecosystem appears to be working well and recovering from the financial excesses of the late 1990s. Software and hardware platforms are witnessing significant innovation and evolution, which is in turn fueling innovation in a broad variety of applications and business models.

Managing the Ecosystem
Marco Iansiti
The days of the corporate lone wolf are over. In our increasingly interconnected world, standing alone is no longer a viable business model. Instead, smart companies rely heavily on networks of partners, suppliers, and customers to achieve market success and sustain performance. These networks look increasingly like a biological ecosystem, in which companies succeed and fail as a collective whole. They operate in a business environment of shared fates and business models, and see their ecosystems as helping them become more resilient to market changes and more responsive to customer needs. Business ecosystems are widespread within industries such as banking, biotechnology, insurance, and software. As with biological systems, the boundaries of a business ecosystem are fluid and sometimes difficult to define. Ecosystems traverse industries and encompass the full range of organizations that influence the value of a product or service.

Principles that Matter: Sustaining Software Innovation from the Client to the Web
Marco Iansiti
Economic analysis often reviews the role of principles—such as respect for intellectual property rights—in driving innovation. Given the interdependent nature of innovation in information technology, three core principles have emerged that work together to ensure that complementary, interconnected products coexist and compete. These core principles are particularly important when applied to platforms, which have played a central role in enabling the development and distribution of the variety of applications and services that drive the popularity of software. The first principle focuses on enabling choice: firms should allow consumers and partners to have a real choice between complementary products and services from otherwise competing firms (e.g., a browser should enable a consumer to choose a home page provided by a competitor). The second principle focuses on opportunity: specifically, opportunity that is facilitated by giving developers platform access and the ability to innovate and build on platform technologies to create new products and services. The third principle focuses on interoperability: vendors should enable products to work together so customers can realize the full benefit of complementary products offered by competing vendors. Following this principle enables products to connect to each other in appropriately defined ways, and ensures that users can port their data between products securely and reliably. This paper reviews the rationale for these principles and examines their impact on competition in the cloud computing ("internet software") environment.

Dynamics of Platform Competition: Exploring the Role of Installed Base, Platform Quality and Consumer Expectations
Feng Zhu and Marco Iansiti
This paper seeks to answer three questions. First, which drives the success of a platform, installed base, platform quality or consumer expectations? Second, when does a monopoly emerge in a platform-based market? Finally, when is a platform-based market socially efficient? We analyze a dynamic model where an entrant with superior quality competes with an incumbent platform, and examine long-run market outcomes. We find that the answers to these questions depend critically on two parameters: the strength of indirect network effects and consumers' discount factor of future applications. In addition, contrary to the popular belief that indirect network effects protect incumbents and are the source of market inefficiency, we find that under certain conditions, indirect network effects could enhance entrants' quality advantage and market outcomes hence could be more efficient with stronger indirect network effects. We empirically examine the competition between the Xbox and PlayStation 2 consoles. We find that Xbox has a small quality advantage over PlayStation 2. In addition, the strength of indirect network effects and consumers' discount factor in this market are within the range in which platform success is driven by quality advantage and the market is potentially efficient. Counterfactual experiments suggest that PlayStation 2 could have driven Xbox out of the market had the strength of indirect network effects more than doubled or had consumers' discount factor increased by fifty percent.

Indigo Agriculture
Marco Iansiti, Michael W. Toffel and Christine Snively
Indigo Agriculture had successfully developed and launched its first commercial product, microbe-enhanced cotton seeds, on an accelerated product development timeline. In late 2016, as the company was about to launch its second product, winter wheat, the management team proposed to again accelerate the development timeline and introduce six new products in four countries within the next 12 months. The CEO and Director of Business Development met to discuss the feasibility of accelerating the timeline, potential bottlenecks in the product development process, resource management, and the potential need for a more formalized development process.

Upwork: Reimagining the Future of Work
Feng Zhu, Rory McDonald, Marco Iansiti and Aaron Smith
Upwork, the world's largest freelance talent platform, was the result of a merger between the two leading online freelancing companies in 2014, Elance and oDesk. After the merger, the company operated as Elance-oDesk and continued to manage two online platforms—Elance.com and oDesk.com—independently of one another. However in 2015 the company relaunched as Upwork, with both a new brand and a new platform. The company began to migrate Elance.com members and functionalities over to the new platform, which was based on the technical infrastructure of oDesk.com. This case helps students consider the challenges and opportunities associated with such a platform merger, from strategy to implementation.

Aspiring Minds
Karim R. Lakhani, Marco Iansiti and Christine Snively
By 2015, India-based employment assessment and certification provider Aspiring Minds had helped facilitate over 300,000 job matches through its assessment tools. Aspiring Minds' flagship product, the Aspiring Minds Computer Adaptive Test (AMCAT), used machine learning algorithms to evaluate the abilities of job seekers and provide feedback by measuring not only skills and knowledge, but also personality and behavior traits. Since its founding in 2007, the company developed several new assessment products, including SVAR, a spoken-English evaluation, Automata, a programming skills evaluator, a customer service test, and TESLA, a suite of products that assessed and provided certification for vocational skills. The company had recently expanded into parts of Africa, the Middle East, the Philippines, the U.S., and most recently, China. Aspiring Minds had seen success as a business-to-business (B2B) entity, creating and selling technology products geared towards industry verticals. By 2015 the business-to-consumer (B2C) side of the business in India had been quite successful as well, generating revenues equal to that of the B2B side. As Aspiring Minds worked to establish a presence in China, co-founders Himanshu and Varun Aggarwal considered whether a B2B or B2C approach would best help the company achieve scale.

Facebook: The First Ten Years
Shane Greenstein, Marco Iansiti and Christine Snively
Facebook celebrated its ten year anniversary in February 2014. Over the past decade it has grown into the largest social network in the world with one billion users. After filing an IPO in 2012 at a $104 billion valuation (the third largest IPO in U.S. history), the stock price steadily declined, but recovered after the company implemented an effective advertising strategy. Facebook worked to maintain its "hacker ethos" and remain nimble as it matured. The company was worth close to $200 billion. Could this kind of value sustain itself for years to come?

Deflategate and the National Football League
Marco Iansiti and Christine Snively
On January 18, 2015, the New England Patriots faced the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship game. In the second quarter, a Colts player intercepted a pass from Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Colts equipment personnel alerted NFL officials that the ball's air pressure was below the required 12.5 PSI (pounds per square inch). Some argued that lower PSI provided a competitive advantage as it made the ball easier to grip and harder to fumble. At halftime, game officials found the air pressure in 11 of the 12 Patriots game balls to be under 12.5 PSI. The NFL launched an investigation into what became known in the media as "Deflategate," and commissioned attorney Ted Wells to investigate whether or not the balls had been intentionally deflated. Wells' team, with expert consultants, examined air pressure data recorded by referees, the temperature on game day, the behavior of Patriots players, and other evidence. Did the Deflategate investigation reveal any actual evidence of cheating? Were there flaws in Wells' investigation?

Ford Motor Company: Blueprint for Mobility
Karim R. Lakhani, Marco Iansiti and Noah Fisher
Mark Fields, Ford Motor Company's COO, had to ensure the company's current business model of building cars and trucks remained strong, while concurrently navigating the company into the rapidly expanding industry of personal mobility. Personal mobility required new technologies and business models that were untraditional at Ford, and Fields had to evaluate the traditional business model colliding with the new business model.
To direct these new technologies and business models, Ford released its "Blueprint for Mobility," which established near-, mid- and long-term goals to make mobility accessible and affordable to all.
The case focuses on the launch of three mobility experiments (car sharing, parking, and on-demand ride sharing), and asks students to determine how Fields should balance these types of experiments with the company's traditional operations. Further, was Ford doing enough in the mobility space, and if so, was it moving fast enough? What new sources of revenue could Ford derive from mobility solutions?

Samsung Electronics: TV in an Era of Convergence
Karim R. Lakhani, Marco Iansiti and Kerry Herman
From the late 1990s to 2006/2007, Samsung Electronics moved from one of 170 TV manufacturers to gain dominant TV market share year over year from 2007-2013. As digital technologies increasingly converged in 2013-2014, the industry faced new questions: What was the future of TV? The case considers Samsung Electronics TV Group's product development processes, as the company's mobile and TV offerings increasingly converged and consumer demands and behavior pushed the historically clear boundaries of product, content, engagement and interaction.

SAP 2014: Reaching for the Cloud
Karim R. Lakhani, Marco Iansiti and Noah Fisher
In May 2014, Bill McDermott will become the sole CEO of SAP AG, the world leader in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) field. The case occurs in January 2014 at SAP's investors meeting, at a time when the company's stock is near record high. A 2010 strategy committed the company to a transition to cloud computing. The main driver behind this transition was the development of SAP HANA, an in-memory computing technology that combined database, data processing, and application platform functionality. Ownership of cloud infrastructure was a key question. SAP could build, own, and operate its own data centers, or partner to locate SAP HANA and other products with other cloud infrastructure providers, such as Amazon, Microsoft, or IBM. McDermott also had to make decisions around the organization and leadership of the company's cloud efforts.

Managing with Analytics at Procter & Gamble
Thomas H. Davenport, Marco Iansiti and Alain Serels
Senior management at P&G has put a strong emphasis on using data to make "better, smarter, real-time business decisions." The Global Business Services (GBS) organization has developed tools, systems and processes to provide managers throughout P&G with direct access to up-to-date data and advanced analytics. In addition, GBS has embedded analysts within the business units to work alongside leaders and managers in driving real-time information-based decision making. Equipped with the tools provided by GBS, Alan Torres, vice-president of North America Fabric Care, must finalize the forecast for P&G's laundry detergent sales. Results for the two months since introducing concentrated powder laundry detergent in select retailers saw a surprising jump in sales of over 10%, but would the trend continue as the concentrated detergents were introduced across North America?

Microsoft Server & Tools
Marco Iansiti and Alain Serels
In 2011, Microsoft's Server & Tools Business (STB) was large, fast growing and highly profitable on the strength of traditional packaged product lines led by the Windows Server operating system. Even as the current packaged business was performing exceptionally well, Microsoft's leadership understood that cloud based solutions would become more prevalent in the future. As the newly appointed President of STB, Satya Nadella had to find a balance between managing the current packaged business and building the cloud offering.

CA Technologies: Bringing the Cloud to Earth
Marco Iansiti and Kerry Herman
Adam Famularo, general manager, Cloud Computing business, CA Technologies, and David Dobson, WVP and group executive, Customer Solutions Group, were preparing for a presentation on communicating and positioning CA Technologies' new strategy for cloud computing. Analysts had voiced concern over several 2010 acquisitions, and highlighted CA Technologies' need to clearly state its strategy and objectives and identify a compelling way to position and differentiate its cloud offerings. Industry pundits claimed the mainframe- CA Technologies' bread and butter- was dead and would go away. Famularo knew CA Technologies' line of products was anything but outdated, having evolved to help enterprises manage and secure their increasingly complex IT environments. In 2010, analysts reported that CA Technologies' mainframe business was strong and accounted for over 60% of the firm's revenues and a majority of its profits, with no sign of slowing down. But given the attractiveness of CA Technologies' current mainframe and distributed business lines, how firmly would the company back the emergent cloud business? Should CA Technologies' cloud business be positioned as an incremental, complementary addition to its mainframe and client-server businesses or should it be framed as a disruptive and entirely revolutionary technology?

SAP AG: Orchestrating the Ecosystem
Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani
Business ecosystems require careful orchestration and strategic choices regarding make/buy/partner decisions and membership access. This case examines the strategic and technological issues related to managing SAP's thriving ecosystem of user communities, software vendors, integration partners, and technology providers. It details how the ecosystem gets developed and the challenges in meeting the needs of the internal organization, large partners, and small up-and-coming firms. SAP executives, in this case, have to make a decision if a relatively small startup firm should be elevated to the highest strategic partnership level, normally reserved for very large firms.

Raymond V. Gilmartin, Marco Iansiti and Bianca Buccitelli
General Mills is an 80-year-old company that specializes in consumer foods such as cereal, snacks, baking, and dinner products. Although General Mills is, on the whole, a very successful company, they have, in the recent past, had to face challenges as a result the changing environment in the food manufacturing industry. Three main factors have affected this industry including: (1) the rise of Wal-Mart and the resulting shift of pricing power from the manufacturer to the retailer, (2) the infiltration of more private-label products into the market, and (3) the rise in commodity costs as a result of inflation (for example, the Producer Price Index (PPI) which tracks the inflation/deflation for raw materials used by food manufacturers increased by 5.9% from April 2003 to April 2004).

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company: Building a Platform for Distributed Innovation
Marco Iansiti and Marcin Strojwas
Surging costs of building a state-of-the-art fabrication facility were pushing firms to outsource manufacturing while advanced technologies were requiring a tighter coupling between design and manufacturing. Explores the development of strategy in this environment. Although Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) began as a pure-play manufacturer, its position in the industry grew, and it had the power to wield influence over several critical control points in the chip development process. The central issue is the decision TSMC must make regarding how to structure its dependencies and interfaces with its customers and technology suppliers.

Model N Inc.
Marco Iansiti and Alison Berkley Wagonfeld
The CEO of a Silicon Valley start-up needed to make organizational and product changes to deliver a new software solution to a Fortune 500 customer. He was wondering how he should structure the company to best meet the requirements for this particular customer, while also positioning the company for future growth. He was operating under a tight time frame and was considering options ranging from focusing the entire company on this one project to spreading out his team over several projects. The case raises such issues as developing a successful business model for a software company, outlining a distinction between software platforms and software applications, strategies for product development in tight time frames, leading a company through a transition, knowing when it is time to change directions, setting and communicating a new direction amid ambiguity, and judging how much change employees can handle at one time.

Motive Communications
Jeffrey F. Rayport, Marco Iansiti, Myra M. Hart, William W Chan and Find Findsen
The founders of Motive Communications, Inc., a recent start-up dedicated to reinventing the support chain involved in the delivery of information technology support services, put in place a development process hinged on extensive customer feedback. As part of this, a select group of "lighthouse customers" agreed to pay $50,000 to participate in beta testing--but as a deadline approached, none had sent in their checks. The founders therefore reevaluate the lighthouse policy and its rationale.

Lucent Technologies:  Optical Networking Group
Marco Iansiti and Barbara Feinberg
Set in June 1999, this case describes the development of a new platform product, the Wavestar OLS 400G, that responded both to a demand for greater "bandwidth" and aggressive competitors seeking to supply it. The 400G's development process took only 14 months and pioneered a number of new development approaches, while expanding customer and supplier bases. Yet traditional customers remained concerned that the 400G was not as "feature-rich" as they wanted, and many in Lucent's Optical Networking Group felt "burned out" by the hectic development pace. Students debate what should follow the 400G project. The first option is an evolutionary product, relatively consistent with the later releases of 400G but extending its performance by as much as a factor of two. The second option is to ignite another technological revolution, using a "clean sheet of paper" to completely redesign the 400G platform and potentially achieve more than a four-times performance improvement.

Innovation in Action: Product Development Projects and Action-Based Learning, Instructor's Note
Marco Iansiti
As a project-based course, Managing Product Development has been carefully designed so that classroom discussion and students' project team activities infuse each other: learning from course materials enhances project activities, which in turn enrich subsequent discussion. Projects enable students to experience the product (or service) development process in an environment that encourages experimentation and learning. Although the challenges are real, students can be flexible in how they organize and manage the process; as such, they are designing their own learning experience, experimenting with different managerial and organizational approaches, and testing different innovative methodologies. This note provides extensive background on the kinds of projects students participate in, how these unfold, the various milestones that help both instructors and teams keep activities on track, how classroom learning is linked to project work, and the pedagogical challenges (and satisfaction) involved. Appendices provide examples of student "archives," the principal output of the teams' efforts, and other relevant materials.

Managing Product Development: Matching Technology with Context, Instructor's Note
Marco Iansiti
This overview to Managing Product Development (MPD) both previews course material, cases, exercises, and lectures--and provides its conceptual and academic underpinnings. Additionally, this note links these materials to the activities students will be undertaking in their term projects. The overarching premise of the course is that product development performance is driven by a process that matches technological opportunities (i.e., what is possible) to their application environment (i.e., user needs, manufacturing exigencies, and strategic aims). This process is particularly characterized by the generation, retention, and integration of knowledge through carefully designed and sequenced iterations of experimentation. Product development performance itself is linked to a variety of managerial levers that help "fit" the details of this process to its environment. These range from investment in experimentation methodologies and tools to the specification of an appropriate sequence of activities, project stages, and milestones; from the selection of an appropriate project organization to the creation of an effective development strategy.

Introduction and Overview: Managing Product Development, Instructor's Note
Marco Iansiti
The first module, comprising three cases and a team exercise, provides an impressionistic look at all the issues raised in greater detail in subsequent classes. It thus enables students, who come to the course with a range of experience and skills, to get up to speed on product development essentials. In essence, it teaches students a common language and a common knowledge base that they will use not only in classroom discussions but in their own project activities. This note shows how the module material links both to subsequent material and to issues student teams are grappling with as their projects get underway.

Product Development Foundations, Instructor's Note
Marco Iansiti
As emphasized in the course overview, excellence in product development is built on three foundations: the activities aimed at generating, retaining, and integrating knowledge. They form the critical building blocks for the conceptualization and implementation of any new product. The module--and this note--focus on each of these foundations in detail and introduce a variety of methodologies and approaches. The six classroom sessions draw upon cases, conceptual notes, interactive lectures, and an exercise. The note shows how these are linked together, to subsequent module themes and materials, and to student project activities.

Product Development Process, Organization and Improvement, Instructor's Note
Marco Iansiti
Explores how development projects fit (or do not fit) within a firm's development strategy and its wider competitive goals. Module materials, and this note, focus on two broad approaches to process design (sequential and flexible) that were originally introduced in the first module (Introduction and Overview), detailing how they are organized, the environments for which they are most appropriate, and how process design itself can be a source of organizational improvement. In addition, the materials in this module integrate all the learning generated from previous modules, as well as the knowledge students have gained from their own projects.

Product Development Performance, Instructor's Note
Marco Iansiti
Focuses on what constitutes product development performance and how it is assessed. Performance, as explained in both the note and in the materials for this three-session module, refers to the performance of both the product and the organizational process producing it. Moreover, the two are not independent but should instead reflect each other. At the same time, there is no one, best, approach to achieving superior performance. However, as the course materials and the module note emphasize, excellence stems from the careful design and implementation of the activities constituting the three critical foundations introduced in the previous module, Product Development Foundations.

Team New Zealand (A)
Marco Iansiti and Alan D. MacCormack
The case describes the development process used by Team New Zealand to design their two yachts for the 1995 America's Cup. During development, the team makes extensive use of simulation and physical prototyping to improve the initial design concept. As they approach construction, they must decide whether to build both boats at the same time and, if so, whether to vary their designs. The decision hinges on evaluating the benefits of different experimentation strategies. Includes color exhibits.

New Perspectives on the Business Value of IT
David James Brunner, Bradley R. Staats and Marco Iansiti
We sought to unravel the link between IT investment and firm performance by examining deployed IT functionality (ITF). First, ITF appears to be an important link in the IT spend to business value chain. Second, ITF does not seem to be a commodity and has characteristics of a strategic resource. Third, firms with extensive ITF grow faster and on the margin breadth of ITF is more valuable than depth. Lastly, we find that faster growing firms may manage IT more efficiently than slower growers.
