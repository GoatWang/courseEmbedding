Experts in distressed securities
Established in 1995 by Jon Bauer, Janice Stanton and Gil Tenzer, Contrarian is a distressed investing specialist with one of the most stable portfolio management teams in the industry. Jon & Janice have been managing portfolios of distressed securities together since 1986 (joined by Gil in 1993) when they ran the Distressed Debt & Trade Claims businesses for Oppenheimer & Co. We believe this continuity of senior management provides Contrarian with a competitive edge in sourcing and analyzing investment opportunities, as well as navigating the portfolio through multiple business cycles.
Contrarian is 100% partner owned and has a team of highly experienced professionals, many of whom are involved with the portfolio management, research, sourcing and trading of our investments.
Our global headquarters is in Greenwich (CT), with regional investment research offices in London (England), Paris (France), São Paulo (Brazil), and Hong Kong (China SAR).
Contrarian has been registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since 1995* and is also a Qualified Professional Asset Manager with respect to certain of its accounts.

*Registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not imply approval or endorsement.

The Flagship Strategy
For more than 30 years the Contrarian team has been focused on identifying the best risk/reward opportunities in distressed assets in the U.S., Western Europe and Emerging Markets. Contrarian’s flagship strategy seeks to capitalize on all manners of distressed investing with particular emphasis on privately traded and complex distressed claims.
A global portfolio seeking equity like returns with the protection rights of a debt holder. Seeks to capitalize on all phases of the distressed cycle. Investments may include distressed U.S. performing debt, European performing debt, emerging markets, bankruptcy/trade claims, post-reorganized equity and opportunistic shorts.
The Contrarian team focuses on capital protection by conducting thorough fundamental analysis, applying conservative valuation metrics, diversifying the flagship portfolio among the most compelling global distressed opportunities and strict avoidance of leverage. The flagship strategy actively invests in “off the run” opportunities that have strong asset coverage, barriers to entry, and trade at significant discounts to similar publicly traded instruments.

our history
Contrarian was established in 1995 by Jon Bauer, Janice Stanton and Gil Tenzer as a specialist in distressed investing. Jon Bauer, who began his focus on investing in distressed opportunities at Bear Stearns in 1981, founded the Distressed Debt & Trade Claims businesses at Oppenheimer & Co. (“OPCO”)  in 1986. He and Janice Stanton, Jon’s first senior hire, began managing portfolios of distressed assets together at OPCO in 1986, marking the inception of what is now Contrarian’s flagship strategy. They were joined at OPCO by Gil Tenzer in 1993.
Today, the multi-billion dollar firm manages predominately institutional client assets, employing professionals across offices in Greenwich, Connecticut (global headquarters), Paris, London, São Paulo, and Hong Kong. While the firm has broadened the team and capabilities over time, Contrarian has consistently managed clients’ portfolios with a singular focus on distressed investing. With more than 30 years of distressed investing experience, the Contrarian team has particular expertise investing in private securities and complex claims, and maintains a keen focus on capital preservation.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Composite Score:





                        Contrarian Capital Management, LLC has received 0 out of 5 stars based on 0 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Experts in distressed securities
Established in 1995 by Jon Bauer, Janice Stanton and Gil Tenzer, Contrarian is a distressed investing specialist with one of the most stable portfolio management teams in the industry. Jon & Janice have been managing portfolios of distressed securities together since 1986 (joined by Gil in 1993) when they ran the Distressed Debt & Trade Claims businesses for Oppenheimer & Co. We believe this continuity of senior management provides Contrarian with a competitive edge in sourcing and analyzing investment opportunities, as well as navigating the portfolio through multiple business cycles.
Contrarian is 100% partner owned and has a team of highly experienced professionals, many of whom are involved with the portfolio management, research, sourcing and trading of our investments.
Our global headquarters is in Greenwich (CT), with regional investment research offices in London (England), Paris (France), São Paulo (Brazil), and Hong Kong (China SAR).
Contrarian has been registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since 1995* and is also a Qualified Professional Asset Manager with respect to certain of its accounts.

*Registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not imply approval or endorsement.
