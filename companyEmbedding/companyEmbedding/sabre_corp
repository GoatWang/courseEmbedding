History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1953, C.R. Smith, the president of American Airlines, met Blair Smith, an IBM salesman, on a flight and developed the Sabre (the Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment) concept.[14][15] The system was based on SAGE, the first major system to use interactive real-time computing, which IBM had developed for military use.[15] Sabre Corporation was founded in 1960 by American Airlines.[11][16] Sabre Corporation installed the first Sabre reservation system in Briarcliff Manor, New York that year.[14] The system consisted of two IBM 7090 mainframe computers and processed 84,000 calls per day.[14][15]
In 1964, Sabre's nationwide network was completed and became the largest commercial real-time data-processing system in the world.[15] Sabre Corporation handled 7500 passenger reservations per hour in 1965.[14] The Sabre system upgraded to IBM S/360 and moved to a new center in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1972.[17] In 1976, the Sabre system was installed into a travel agency for the first time.[16] This allowed travel agents to have instant access to flights.[16] By the end of the year, 130 locations installed the Sabre system.[15] Sabre introduced BargainFinder, the industry's first automated low-fare search capability, in 1984.[18] The following year, easySabre was launched.[19] It gave consumers with personal computers access to the Sabre system to make airline, hotel and car rental reservations.[19]
In 1996, the company launched Travelocity, an online travel agency.[20] Sabre formed a joint venture with Abacus International in 1998 to create the SabreSonic passenger solution, a customized version of Sabre's reservations system to Abacus subscribers in Asia.[21]
2000s[edit]
AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, spun off its controlling stake in Sabre Corporation in 2000 to form an independent company.[22] The following year, Sabre began migrating its old mainframe for air travel shopping and pricing to HP NonStop and Linux servers.[23] In 2005, the company acquired lastminute.com, an online travel and leisure retailer.[24]
Texas Pacific Group and Silver Lake Partners acquired Sabre Corporation in March 2007.[12][25][26] In March 2010, the company acquired Calidris, a revenue integrity and business intelligence solutions company.[27] Sabre Corporation acquired SoftHotel, a web-based property management solutions provider, in June 2011.[28] The company launched Sabre Red App Centre in March 2012.[13] In April 2014, Sabre Corporation went public on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol SABR.[8][10] The IPO sold for $16 per share and valued Sabre at $3.93 billion.[29][30] The company acquired Genares, a hospitality technology company, that September.[31]
In December 2014, Bravofly Rumbo Group acquired Sabre European Online Travel Agency, lastminute.com.
In January 2015, Sabre sold its Travelocity brand to Expedia, Inc. for $280 million.[32][33][34] In July 2015, Sabre acquired Abacus International, a global distribution system based in the Asia-Pacific region. The deal included long-term distribution agreements between Sabre and the 11 Asian airlines that previously shared ownership of Abacus.[35]
In June 2016, Sabre announced Tom Klein would be resigning as CEO by the end of 2016.[36]
Operations[edit]
The company is based in Southlake, Texas and has additional offices in London, Kraków, Bangalore, Montevideo and Buenos Aires.[11][37] In December 2013, the company handled approximately 85000 data transactions every second for customers according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.[38] At the time, the company did business with 70 airlines and 100,000 hotels.[38] It operates under the platforms Travel Network, Airline and Hospitality Solutions.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1953, C.R. Smith, the president of American Airlines, met Blair Smith, an IBM salesman, on a flight and developed the Sabre (the Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment) concept.[14][15] The system was based on SAGE, the first major system to use interactive real-time computing, which IBM had developed for military use.[15] Sabre Corporation was founded in 1960 by American Airlines.[11][16] Sabre Corporation installed the first Sabre reservation system in Briarcliff Manor, New York that year.[14] The system consisted of two IBM 7090 mainframe computers and processed 84,000 calls per day.[14][15]
In 1964, Sabre's nationwide network was completed and became the largest commercial real-time data-processing system in the world.[15] Sabre Corporation handled 7500 passenger reservations per hour in 1965.[14] The Sabre system upgraded to IBM S/360 and moved to a new center in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1972.[17] In 1976, the Sabre system was installed into a travel agency for the first time.[16] This allowed travel agents to have instant access to flights.[16] By the end of the year, 130 locations installed the Sabre system.[15] Sabre introduced BargainFinder, the industry's first automated low-fare search capability, in 1984.[18] The following year, easySabre was launched.[19] It gave consumers with personal computers access to the Sabre system to make airline, hotel and car rental reservations.[19]
In 1996, the company launched Travelocity, an online travel agency.[20] Sabre formed a joint venture with Abacus International in 1998 to create the SabreSonic passenger solution, a customized version of Sabre's reservations system to Abacus subscribers in Asia.[21]
2000s[edit]
AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, spun off its controlling stake in Sabre Corporation in 2000 to form an independent company.[22] The following year, Sabre began migrating its old mainframe for air travel shopping and pricing to HP NonStop and Linux servers.[23] In 2005, the company acquired lastminute.com, an online travel and leisure retailer.[24]
Texas Pacific Group and Silver Lake Partners acquired Sabre Corporation in March 2007.[12][25][26] In March 2010, the company acquired Calidris, a revenue integrity and business intelligence solutions company.[27] Sabre Corporation acquired SoftHotel, a web-based property management solutions provider, in June 2011.[28] The company launched Sabre Red App Centre in March 2012.[13] In April 2014, Sabre Corporation went public on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol SABR.[8][10] The IPO sold for $16 per share and valued Sabre at $3.93 billion.[29][30] The company acquired Genares, a hospitality technology company, that September.[31]
In December 2014, Bravofly Rumbo Group acquired Sabre European Online Travel Agency, lastminute.com.
In January 2015, Sabre sold its Travelocity brand to Expedia, Inc. for $280 million.[32][33][34] In July 2015, Sabre acquired Abacus International, a global distribution system based in the Asia-Pacific region. The deal included long-term distribution agreements between Sabre and the 11 Asian airlines that previously shared ownership of Abacus.[35]
In June 2016, Sabre announced Tom Klein would be resigning as CEO by the end of 2016.[36]
Operations[edit]
The company is based in Southlake, Texas and has additional offices in London, Kraków, Bangalore, Montevideo and Buenos Aires.[11][37] In December 2013, the company handled approximately 85000 data transactions every second for customers according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.[38] At the time, the company did business with 70 airlines and 100,000 hotels.[38] It operates under the platforms Travel Network, Airline and Hospitality Solutions.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1953, C.R. Smith, the president of American Airlines, met Blair Smith, an IBM salesman, on a flight and developed the Sabre (the Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment) concept.[14][15] The system was based on SAGE, the first major system to use interactive real-time computing, which IBM had developed for military use.[15] Sabre Corporation was founded in 1960 by American Airlines.[11][16] Sabre Corporation installed the first Sabre reservation system in Briarcliff Manor, New York that year.[14] The system consisted of two IBM 7090 mainframe computers and processed 84,000 calls per day.[14][15]
In 1964, Sabre's nationwide network was completed and became the largest commercial real-time data-processing system in the world.[15] Sabre Corporation handled 7500 passenger reservations per hour in 1965.[14] The Sabre system upgraded to IBM S/360 and moved to a new center in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1972.[17] In 1976, the Sabre system was installed into a travel agency for the first time.[16] This allowed travel agents to have instant access to flights.[16] By the end of the year, 130 locations installed the Sabre system.[15] Sabre introduced BargainFinder, the industry's first automated low-fare search capability, in 1984.[18] The following year, easySabre was launched.[19] It gave consumers with personal computers access to the Sabre system to make airline, hotel and car rental reservations.[19]
In 1996, the company launched Travelocity, an online travel agency.[20] Sabre formed a joint venture with Abacus International in 1998 to create the SabreSonic passenger solution, a customized version of Sabre's reservations system to Abacus subscribers in Asia.[21]
2000s[edit]
AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, spun off its controlling stake in Sabre Corporation in 2000 to form an independent company.[22] The following year, Sabre began migrating its old mainframe for air travel shopping and pricing to HP NonStop and Linux servers.[23] In 2005, the company acquired lastminute.com, an online travel and leisure retailer.[24]
Texas Pacific Group and Silver Lake Partners acquired Sabre Corporation in March 2007.[12][25][26] In March 2010, the company acquired Calidris, a revenue integrity and business intelligence solutions company.[27] Sabre Corporation acquired SoftHotel, a web-based property management solutions provider, in June 2011.[28] The company launched Sabre Red App Centre in March 2012.[13] In April 2014, Sabre Corporation went public on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol SABR.[8][10] The IPO sold for $16 per share and valued Sabre at $3.93 billion.[29][30] The company acquired Genares, a hospitality technology company, that September.[31]
In December 2014, Bravofly Rumbo Group acquired Sabre European Online Travel Agency, lastminute.com.
In January 2015, Sabre sold its Travelocity brand to Expedia, Inc. for $280 million.[32][33][34] In July 2015, Sabre acquired Abacus International, a global distribution system based in the Asia-Pacific region. The deal included long-term distribution agreements between Sabre and the 11 Asian airlines that previously shared ownership of Abacus.[35]
In June 2016, Sabre announced Tom Klein would be resigning as CEO by the end of 2016.[36]
Operations[edit]
The company is based in Southlake, Texas and has additional offices in London, Kraków, Bangalore, Montevideo and Buenos Aires.[11][37] In December 2013, the company handled approximately 85000 data transactions every second for customers according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.[38] At the time, the company did business with 70 airlines and 100,000 hotels.[38] It operates under the platforms Travel Network, Airline and Hospitality Solutions.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1953, C.R. Smith, the president of American Airlines, met Blair Smith, an IBM salesman, on a flight and developed the Sabre (the Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment) concept.[14][15] The system was based on SAGE, the first major system to use interactive real-time computing, which IBM had developed for military use.[15] Sabre Corporation was founded in 1960 by American Airlines.[11][16] Sabre Corporation installed the first Sabre reservation system in Briarcliff Manor, New York that year.[14] The system consisted of two IBM 7090 mainframe computers and processed 84,000 calls per day.[14][15]
In 1964, Sabre's nationwide network was completed and became the largest commercial real-time data-processing system in the world.[15] Sabre Corporation handled 7500 passenger reservations per hour in 1965.[14] The Sabre system upgraded to IBM S/360 and moved to a new center in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1972.[17] In 1976, the Sabre system was installed into a travel agency for the first time.[16] This allowed travel agents to have instant access to flights.[16] By the end of the year, 130 locations installed the Sabre system.[15] Sabre introduced BargainFinder, the industry's first automated low-fare search capability, in 1984.[18] The following year, easySabre was launched.[19] It gave consumers with personal computers access to the Sabre system to make airline, hotel and car rental reservations.[19]
In 1996, the company launched Travelocity, an online travel agency.[20] Sabre formed a joint venture with Abacus International in 1998 to create the SabreSonic passenger solution, a customized version of Sabre's reservations system to Abacus subscribers in Asia.[21]
2000s[edit]
AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, spun off its controlling stake in Sabre Corporation in 2000 to form an independent company.[22] The following year, Sabre began migrating its old mainframe for air travel shopping and pricing to HP NonStop and Linux servers.[23] In 2005, the company acquired lastminute.com, an online travel and leisure retailer.[24]
Texas Pacific Group and Silver Lake Partners acquired Sabre Corporation in March 2007.[12][25][26] In March 2010, the company acquired Calidris, a revenue integrity and business intelligence solutions company.[27] Sabre Corporation acquired SoftHotel, a web-based property management solutions provider, in June 2011.[28] The company launched Sabre Red App Centre in March 2012.[13] In April 2014, Sabre Corporation went public on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol SABR.[8][10] The IPO sold for $16 per share and valued Sabre at $3.93 billion.[29][30] The company acquired Genares, a hospitality technology company, that September.[31]
In December 2014, Bravofly Rumbo Group acquired Sabre European Online Travel Agency, lastminute.com.
In January 2015, Sabre sold its Travelocity brand to Expedia, Inc. for $280 million.[32][33][34] In July 2015, Sabre acquired Abacus International, a global distribution system based in the Asia-Pacific region. The deal included long-term distribution agreements between Sabre and the 11 Asian airlines that previously shared ownership of Abacus.[35]
In June 2016, Sabre announced Tom Klein would be resigning as CEO by the end of 2016.[36]
Operations[edit]
The company is based in Southlake, Texas and has additional offices in London, Kraków, Bangalore, Montevideo and Buenos Aires.[11][37] In December 2013, the company handled approximately 85000 data transactions every second for customers according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.[38] At the time, the company did business with 70 airlines and 100,000 hotels.[38] It operates under the platforms Travel Network, Airline and Hospitality Solutions.

                    SABRE is the only OC spray guaranteeing heat level or capsaicinoid consistency in every canister. Security Equipment Corporation's exclusive in-house HPLC laboratory scientifically ensures you will never have a bad-batch OC failure with SABRE. For maximum results on "goal-oriented" and drug-induced subjects, SABRE RED's 10% OC measures 1.33% Major Capsaicinoids to provide Level III Stopping Power. SABRE is backed by ISO 9001:2008 Certification.

Group-revenue-management solution helps airlines maximize revenue and minimize risks generated from group customers. The solution supports the completion of group reservations and requests effectively and efficiently, utilizing automated business processes that reduce error-prone manual interactions and time-to-completion.
In today’s environment, business challenges are escalating for airlines as the industry continues to evolve and become more complex and competitive. These mounting challenges continue to center around necessary requirements to increase profits, as well as analysts’ productivity. Added into this mix for airlines is the need to become more customer-centric in their approach, and in their service offerings.
One area of airline operations, in particular, that is affected by these complexities involves the group-reservations process. Group-revenue-management systems have been constrained by dated technology and/or cumbersome processes that inhibit accurate and expedient decision-making capabilities. This archaic practice continues to require airline personnel to perform numerous manual touchpoints supported by overnight batch processing, resulting in slower decision-making response times, slower time-to-value and decreased customer satisfaction.
This archaic practice continues to require airline personnel to perform numerous manual touchpoints supported by overnight batch processing, resulting in slower decision-making response times, slower time-to-value and decreased customer satisfaction.
The need to implement a new approach — involving technology and processes — is amplified by the fact that group reservations can contribute as much as 10 percent to an airline’s overall revenue and helps fill seats that may have otherwise gone unsold. Conversely, if handled improperly, group reservations — which are often offered at discount and/or special rates — can dilute an airline’s revenue and overall bottom line instead.
Optimizing group revenue management
To handle the unique challenges associated with the group-reservations process from initial request to fulfillment, airlines require a powerful decision-support tool.
Sabre AirVision Group Optimizer, Sabre’s next-generation group-revenue-management solution helps airlines control group reservations and requests effectively and efficiently.
The advantages of Group Optimizer to airlines are numerous. Developed as a robust and configurable tool, Group Optimizer facilitates the optimization of group revenue management across all of an airline’s revenue streams, including fares, ancillaries and partnerships.
Integrating real-time inventory
Group Optimizer’s real-time inventory integration provides more accurate and timely decision-making for airlines. It enables airline personnel to sense and respond to competitive pricing and inventory changes immediately to accurately forecast demand and maximize revenues via integrated user workflow, rules engine and expanded set of alerts flowing between inventory and revenue management

Forward-looking distribution methods are associated with greater personalization characteristics, resulting in improved opportunities for an airline to offer the right product at the right price to the right customer at the right time.
To get closer to their customers, travel suppliers including airlines, hotels, cruise lines and rental-car companies need to understand customer preferences and purchase behaviors to better serve customers across all channels of distribution. Demanding customers who have high expectations for personalized services are a reality in today’s extremely competitive airline marketplace.
Successful customer experiences are fundamental drivers for airline revenue growth, and those experiences represent heavy influences on product investments from suppliers, intermediaries and software vendors to help ensure customer loyalty.
Travel suppliers are also investing in advanced analytics to understand customer traits, behaviors and preferences to support customer acquisition, maximize revenue-generation potential from the customer base and retain the most profitable customers.
To enable customers with targeted options, next-generation applications collect information from customers in real-time. Analytics have advanced from descriptive analytics to predictive analytics (in other words, what will happen) to prescriptive analytics (recommending options).
Targeted content
A common theme across the travel value chain is to display targeted content to a given customer based on implicit or explicit information that is known about the customer. This type of deep understanding can be derived from alternate data sources such as transactional booking and ticketing data, demographic data, social media, survey data and other sources to segment and target customers with relevant offers.
Segmentation of customers based on purchase-behavior patterns is never perfect and should be refined on a periodic basis as there are new data sources and as customer behaviors change over time.
In the competitive marketplace, travel solutions should focus on products that resonate with customers to improve conversion rates and maximize revenues for suppliers with every interaction by offering the ideal product or bundle to a customer at the right price when he or she is ready to make a purchase based on customer-behavior data.

The capability of airlines to quickly and efficiently recover crew from disruptions and get their rosters back on schedule is one of the most critical factors necessary to succeed in the air transport marketplace. A next-generation crew-recovery solution, incorporating the best and latest advancements in technology, provides faster and better disruption management to airlines.
During disruptions, airlines are faced with the problem of recovering crew schedules and providing an adequate number of crewmembers for each flight. Airline crew coordinators have a primary critical objective to reassign crews while minimizing cancellations and additional crew costs.
An optimization-based decision-support system can greatly assist airline coordinators in producing better recovery solutions with substantial savings and improved passenger experience.
Sabre AirCentre Recovery Manager (Crew) has been designed and implemented to help airlines solve complex crew-recovery problems.
Through the combination of experience and the latest operations-research advancements, the next-generation product is based on a holistic optimization approach to generate deployable crew rosters, significantly improving an airline’s response time to disruptions, as well as reducing operational costs.
Success during severe storms
In 2015 and 2016, record snowfalls hammered the northeastern region of the United States, resulting in large cancellation packages for airlines operating in the area. An especially severe blizzard, which was given the name “winter storm Juno” by meteorologists, hit North America in January 2015. The storm produced record levels of snowfall, causing one of the largest totals of flight cancellations in history.
January 2015 also happened to be the effective date for FAR (Federal Aviation Regulations) Part 117 in the United States, which effectively imposed stricter crew flight and duty limitations, as well as higher crew rest requirements. Such rule changes considerably increase the complexity of rescheduling crewmembers during disruptions.
Dealing with this complex task, Recovery Manager (Crew) was successful in helping airlines recover 99 percent of disrupted crew schedules for all of the storms within the same day.
The end-to-end process using the solution was 10 times faster than the typical airline process, and it provided reduced disruption impact to passengers by providing crew to every flight possible. Quality of life for crewmembers was also improved due to faster communication and a lower number of unplanned flights.
Successful real-world utilization of Recovery Manager (Crew) during these storms produced further innovative ideas, which have been incorporated in the process of continual system enhancement, with the primary focus on improving solution quality, usability and speed. Read the full article.

Connecting the physical and digital worlds is one of the most critical tasks of modern marketing. Many businesses blend brick-and-mortar with a digital presence. Those businesses, such as restaurants, hotels, travel agencies, and even airlines, find increasing challenges in connecting potential customers’ digital behaviors with real-world actions.
This blend has been dubbed “the phygital” world, where both elements most co-exist in order to thrive. An isolated digital presence is about as damaging as an analog brick-and-mortar business. There is enormous opportunity along the path where the online and offline converge. A startup named Bubbl is helping businesses navigate this path by connecting users to businesses in the real world via mobile phones.
Given the phygital nature of many hospitality and travel businesses, this technology promises to build bridges to customers across the spectrum. To learn more about this appealing blend of physical and digital, Sabre Insights posed the five questions to Bubbl CEO Jo Eckersley.
For those that don’t know Bubbl, please explain what you do!
Bubbl’s geolocation plugin is a piece of technology that supercharges existing mobile apps and gives app owners the ability to set up real time marketing campaigns and customer service direct to consumers in specific locations. This means an app owner can instantly unlock in-the-moment customer engagement tools like messaging, surveys or instruction videos, and has new revenue stream potential, plus new ways to build increased loyalty.
Businesses/app owners get a private cloud based dashboard so they can easily set up virtual fences and as people enter, leave or hang around an area they can deliver pre-built location-aware push notifications, images, offers, videos, audio or surveys to consumers with the Business’s app on their phone.
A hotel might use push and pull messaging to inform guests in the hotel about last minute restaurant or beauty treatment availability and take a booking; a hotel booking app can use survey functionality to gauge immediate feedback from guests as they leave the hotel; a destination app (e.g. a Bath or Paris tourism app) can use location-triggered video, audio or and image notifications to promote tourist attractions, a music event app can send location-relevant e-commerce links to sell merchandise or run a ‘go backstage’ competition with the crowd, and bars can send audio samples to increase footfall at a last minute gig.
Of course, the potential of the technology goes well beyond travel and hospitality sector and includes music and sport events, retail, banking, education and many more.
The technology seems complicated. What does it take to get started with this?
It did take many months of development on our side, but we made sure we created an easy-to-use marketing platform that doesn’t require any coding knowledge or technical skills to get started! Bubbl’s complex geofencing technology is actually hidden behind just three lines of clever code and an effortless ‘drop-in’ implementation process. It seamlessly integrates with any Cordova, iOS or Android app within minutes.
What does it mean for businesses? Significantly reduced software development time, expertise and deployment costs, as even a junior developer can quickly plug Bubbl into any app, and the ability to run proximity marketing campaigns with no IT support needed to set up the geofences (as in case of many our competitors).
If you want to test out how easy it is to get started, simply email us on info@bubbl.tech or request a free 14-day demo, you can then start testing the technology straight away and see the magic of geofencing in the flesh. Your developers will be able to plug Bubbl into your existing app within minutes and we’re always happy to help if you need any support with integration.
Once this is done, you can easily map out your chosen locations on the digital map by simply clicking on the map to draft a virtual fence. Next step is setting up campaigns for your ‘fenced’ venue. With our pre-built tools you can then add rich media content and campaign trigger times, our clever technology is taking care of everything else.
Given what you’ve learned from current hospitality customers, what sorts of results can be achieved using this marketing channel?
Bubbl gives businesses the ability to hyperfocus their campaigns by specific location and time, helping them to improve their customer engagement and loyalty, understand the best times to reach customers with our valuable footfall analysis; or quickly react to customer feedback and improve the experience for current and future customers. Common outcomes include increased brand visibility, stronger mobile presence, better app engagement and tangible immediate responses to in the moment nudges for example with offers and surveys. For apartment owners for example just triggering ‘how to’ videos on arrival for guests saves a huge amount of call out time and creates a great first impression.
We need to remember though that to make the most out of proximity engagement and to provide the best results, brands and businesses should never overuse it and should always make sure that each campaign adds real value for their app users.
Direct customer feedback isn’t always easy to get. What are some steps that a business of small-to-medium size can take to begin connecting user feedback to specific experiences?
Yes, it’s not easy to get relevant customer feedback, and this is why we developed Bubbl in the first place. Location-based technologies make it possible to target customers in the right moment and the right place, when their responses are fresh and when a business is most able to respond if they need to.
A few quick questions as someone leaves a venue means the Business can firstly verify the response to the survey is genuine, as it wouldn’t fire if the person hadn’t been in the venue, and they can gather valuable real-time feedback and net promoter scores. A Business can connect with customers in specifically selected locations and get their opinions as they’re experiencing the service, or right when they’re leaving a venue. The data is delivered to the dashboard live as it happens, so you can measure the effectiveness of campaigns and quickly react to customers’ real-time feedback if anything goes wrong.
What about privacy? What is the process for users to engage with, and control, the communications?
There are a lot of solutions out there that use insidious location-tracking and have no regard for user privacy, and while most geolocation technologies turn to IP address tracking to establish user location (practices that already generate concern from both customers and mobile networks), our aim is to deliver a useful tool for brands and businesses, but without breaching a user’s privacy and without draining battery or mobile data.
We believe mobile marketing doesn’t have to mean annoying adverts or intrusive SMS, IP address tracking, location-tracking or behind the scenes customer predictive analytics and profiling. Bubbl doesn’t need to gather any personal data to function effectively, as it has been designed to seek user consent and has consumer controls to manage proximity triggered engagement.
This means users can remain anonymous or can opt-in and they can control the number of engagements they receive, whilst Businesses can still gain customer insight and effective relevant engagement when communicating with their customers.
In particular Bubbl will help apps to ensure that they don’t breach the new emerging privacy legislations such as the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (currently under revision; European Commission EC, 2016) and the General Data Protection Regulation (enforced from May 2018) that will sweep through the mobile ad and data analytics industry.

Back in 1909 – almost 100 years before the launch of the first iPhone – Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla envisioned that one day we would all have personal wireless devices that would enable us to send messages all over the world. In 1865, French novelist Jules Verne not only predicted man’s 1969 moon landing – but also the name of the ship, the number of crew on-board and the feeling of weightlessness they would experience in space.
In today’s hyper-connected world, technology is advancing exponentially; in the next 20 years, computers are expected to be up to a million times more powerful than they are today. And speculation is rife over what this might mean for us.
Today, predictions that sound as far-fetched as Verne and Tesla’s insights once did are being widely-referenced the world over. From using AI to “reincarnate” people that have died to driverless cars filling our roads, there is no shortage of theories on what our future will look like.
But the fate of many of these predictions depends in part on consumers’ willingness to embrace them. The concept of driverless cars might seem cool, but do people trust them enough to allow our roads to be full of them?
Connecting predictions to consumer expectations
As part of London Tech Week this year, Sabre conducted new research to gauge how consumers feel about various new technologies in order to help the travel industry understand how to gain its customers’ trust.
We asked 2,000 UK consumers whether or not they agreed with a number of widely-cited futurists’ predictions about technologies like artificial intelligence, driverless cars and 3D printing. Results found that the majority agreed with statements relating to 3D printing and driverless cars:

However, they were less optimistic about some of the more forward-thinking statements – particularly those relating to artificial intelligence.

Despite the apparent rejection of artificial intelligence, the capabilities of this technology today suggest that “radical” predictions like the above are perhaps not that far-fetched; we now have AI systems that are capable of learning from vast amounts of complex, unstructured data and turning it into actionable insights, for example. This is, of course, already used by companies like Netflix, Amazon and music site Pandora.
It’s all about a lack of trust
The lack of belief in artificial intelligence forecasts could be down to an absence of trust.
A recent study by insidesales.com found that 42% of Americans don’t trust AI. It’s not hard to imagine why. Hollywood has had a long-running obsession for dystopian AI narratives; starting way back in the ‘twenties with Fritz Lang’s Metropolis – and going on to include brilliant but disturbing classics like 2001: Space Odyssey, Terminator and The Matrix – it’s little wonder the term artificial intelligence invokes a certain “wariness” among the average consumer.
According to world-renowned economist Rachel Botsman, getting people to believe in some of the more “radical” technology predictions would involve something called a “trust leap” – when we take a risk to do something new or to do something differently from how we’ve always done it. “People don’t want the entirely new; they want the familiar done differently,” she said at a recent Sabre event.
A study by insidesales.com found that 42% of Americans don’t trust artificial intelligence.Share
Consider how to communicate benefits of new tech
What does all this mean for travel companies that are looking at new ways to serve travellers through technology? How do we persuade travellers to take a leap of trust? Our research found that consumers are generally indifferent towards the use of new technologies by service providers. However, almost one in three indicated trust would diminish in their companies upon the introduction of emerging tech.

For any company, it is important to convince consumers of the benefits of new technologies in order to win their trust. For travel companies, artificial intelligence is just starting to become a reality in 2017. For example, Hilton uses AI in its Watson-powered Connie robot, various airlines use Sabre’s Intelligence Exchange to turn customer data into contextual interactions, and Sabre’s Labs team recently created a prototype Facebook Messenger bot that can answer travellers’ questions about their trips. Persuading consumers to trust – and therefore adopt – these technologies lies in focusing on explaining the benefits of using them, such as ease, convenience and intuitiveness.
The above images are extracts from new Sabre research that was part of its London Tech Week event, TTX London – an industry discussion on the future of distribution and technology in the travel industry.  For the full report, please click the banner below.

What about privacy? What is the process for users to engage with, and control, the communications?
There are a lot of solutions out there that use insidious location-tracking and have no regard for user privacy, and while most geolocation technologies turn to IP address tracking to establish user location (practices that already generate concern from both customers and mobile networks), our aim is to deliver a useful tool for brands and businesses, but without breaching a user’s privacy and without draining battery or mobile data.
We believe mobile marketing doesn’t have to mean annoying adverts or intrusive SMS, IP address tracking, location-tracking or behind the scenes customer predictive analytics and profiling. Bubbl doesn’t need to gather any personal data to function effectively, as it has been designed to seek user consent and has consumer controls to manage proximity triggered engagement.
This means users can remain anonymous or can opt-in and they can control the number of engagements they receive, whilst Businesses can still gain customer insight and effective relevant engagement when communicating with their customers.
In particular Bubbl will help apps to ensure that they don’t breach the new emerging privacy legislations such as the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (currently under revision; European Commission EC, 2016) and the General Data Protection Regulation (enforced from May 2018) that will sweep through the mobile ad and data analytics industry.

Forward-looking distribution methods are associated with greater personalization characteristics, resulting in improved opportunities for an airline to offer the right product at the right price to the right customer at the right time.
To get closer to their customers, travel suppliers including airlines, hotels, cruise lines and rental-car companies need to understand customer preferences and purchase behaviors to better serve customers across all channels of distribution. Demanding customers who have high expectations for personalized services are a reality in today’s extremely competitive airline marketplace.
Successful customer experiences are fundamental drivers for airline revenue growth, and those experiences represent heavy influences on product investments from suppliers, intermediaries and software vendors to help ensure customer loyalty.
Travel suppliers are also investing in advanced analytics to understand customer traits, behaviors and preferences to support customer acquisition, maximize revenue-generation potential from the customer base and retain the most profitable customers.
To enable customers with targeted options, next-generation applications collect information from customers in real-time. Analytics have advanced from descriptive analytics to predictive analytics (in other words, what will happen) to prescriptive analytics (recommending options).
Targeted content
A common theme across the travel value chain is to display targeted content to a given customer based on implicit or explicit information that is known about the customer. This type of deep understanding can be derived from alternate data sources such as transactional booking and ticketing data, demographic data, social media, survey data and other sources to segment and target customers with relevant offers.
Segmentation of customers based on purchase-behavior patterns is never perfect and should be refined on a periodic basis as there are new data sources and as customer behaviors change over time.
In the competitive marketplace, travel solutions should focus on products that resonate with customers to improve conversion rates and maximize revenues for suppliers with every interaction by offering the ideal product or bundle to a customer at the right price when he or she is ready to make a purchase based on customer-behavior data.

The capability of airlines to quickly and efficiently recover crew from disruptions and get their rosters back on schedule is one of the most critical factors necessary to succeed in the air transport marketplace. A next-generation crew-recovery solution, incorporating the best and latest advancements in technology, provides faster and better disruption management to airlines.
During disruptions, airlines are faced with the problem of recovering crew schedules and providing an adequate number of crewmembers for each flight. Airline crew coordinators have a primary critical objective to reassign crews while minimizing cancellations and additional crew costs.
An optimization-based decision-support system can greatly assist airline coordinators in producing better recovery solutions with substantial savings and improved passenger experience.
Sabre AirCentre Recovery Manager (Crew) has been designed and implemented to help airlines solve complex crew-recovery problems.
Through the combination of experience and the latest operations-research advancements, the next-generation product is based on a holistic optimization approach to generate deployable crew rosters, significantly improving an airline’s response time to disruptions, as well as reducing operational costs.
Success during severe storms
In 2015 and 2016, record snowfalls hammered the northeastern region of the United States, resulting in large cancellation packages for airlines operating in the area. An especially severe blizzard, which was given the name “winter storm Juno” by meteorologists, hit North America in January 2015. The storm produced record levels of snowfall, causing one of the largest totals of flight cancellations in history.
January 2015 also happened to be the effective date for FAR (Federal Aviation Regulations) Part 117 in the United States, which effectively imposed stricter crew flight and duty limitations, as well as higher crew rest requirements. Such rule changes considerably increase the complexity of rescheduling crewmembers during disruptions.
Dealing with this complex task, Recovery Manager (Crew) was successful in helping airlines recover 99 percent of disrupted crew schedules for all of the storms within the same day.
The end-to-end process using the solution was 10 times faster than the typical airline process, and it provided reduced disruption impact to passengers by providing crew to every flight possible. Quality of life for crewmembers was also improved due to faster communication and a lower number of unplanned flights.
Successful real-world utilization of Recovery Manager (Crew) during these storms produced further innovative ideas, which have been incorporated in the process of continual system enhancement, with the primary focus on improving solution quality, usability and speed. Read the full article.

The travel trends never stop developing. From millennials roaring into the top spot on the list of most frequent business travelers, to the looming threat of a laptop ban on flights into the United States, there’s always something shifting in the travel industry. After all, it’s a kinetic business that serves a diverse and global clientele.
Within this diverse array of travelers, the business traveler is often a focus for travel brands. This is not only because this segment counts for a significant chunk of revenue, but also because travel preferences often become baked into business travelers. Loyalty can extend to leisure travel, for example.
And for companies, the health and happiness of business travelers is paramount. In Sabre/GBTA research to be released later this month, road warriors highlighted just how important the business travel experience is for overall job satisfaction: for 97 percent of Latin American business travelers and 79 percent of North American travelers, the experience affects job satisfaction either somewhat or to a great extent.
Given the active nature of the industry, many startups and other companies attempt to snag a chunk of the business traveler’s loyalty. Airbnb continues to make aggressive moves into the enterprise, while smaller entrants such as Upside are eager to make a dent in the normal way of doing business.

Group-revenue-management solution helps airlines maximize revenue and minimize risks generated from group customers. The solution supports the completion of group reservations and requests effectively and efficiently, utilizing automated business processes that reduce error-prone manual interactions and time-to-completion.
In today’s environment, business challenges are escalating for airlines as the industry continues to evolve and become more complex and competitive. These mounting challenges continue to center around necessary requirements to increase profits, as well as analysts’ productivity. Added into this mix for airlines is the need to become more customer-centric in their approach, and in their service offerings.
One area of airline operations, in particular, that is affected by these complexities involves the group-reservations process. Group-revenue-management systems have been constrained by dated technology and/or cumbersome processes that inhibit accurate and expedient decision-making capabilities. This archaic practice continues to require airline personnel to perform numerous manual touchpoints supported by overnight batch processing, resulting in slower decision-making response times, slower time-to-value and decreased customer satisfaction.
This archaic practice continues to require airline personnel to perform numerous manual touchpoints supported by overnight batch processing, resulting in slower decision-making response times, slower time-to-value and decreased customer satisfaction.
The need to implement a new approach — involving technology and processes — is amplified by the fact that group reservations can contribute as much as 10 percent to an airline’s overall revenue and helps fill seats that may have otherwise gone unsold. Conversely, if handled improperly, group reservations — which are often offered at discount and/or special rates — can dilute an airline’s revenue and overall bottom line instead.
Optimizing group revenue management
To handle the unique challenges associated with the group-reservations process from initial request to fulfillment, airlines require a powerful decision-support tool.
Sabre AirVision Group Optimizer, Sabre’s next-generation group-revenue-management solution helps airlines control group reservations and requests effectively and efficiently.
The advantages of Group Optimizer to airlines are numerous. Developed as a robust and configurable tool, Group Optimizer facilitates the optimization of group revenue management across all of an airline’s revenue streams, including fares, ancillaries and partnerships.
Integrating real-time inventory
Group Optimizer’s real-time inventory integration provides more accurate and timely decision-making for airlines. It enables airline personnel to sense and respond to competitive pricing and inventory changes immediately to accurately forecast demand and maximize revenues via integrated user workflow, rules engine and expanded set of alerts flowing between inventory and revenue management

The travel trends never stop developing. From millennials roaring into the top spot on the list of most frequent business travelers, to the looming threat of a laptop ban on flights into the United States, there’s always something shifting in the travel industry. After all, it’s a kinetic business that serves a diverse and global clientele.
Within this diverse array of travelers, the business traveler is often a focus for travel brands. This is not only because this segment counts for a significant chunk of revenue, but also because travel preferences often become baked into business travelers. Loyalty can extend to leisure travel, for example.
And for companies, the health and happiness of business travelers is paramount. In Sabre/GBTA research to be released later this month, road warriors highlighted just how important the business travel experience is for overall job satisfaction: for 97 percent of Latin American business travelers and 79 percent of North American travelers, the experience affects job satisfaction either somewhat or to a great extent.
Given the active nature of the industry, many startups and other companies attempt to snag a chunk of the business traveler’s loyalty. Airbnb continues to make aggressive moves into the enterprise, while smaller entrants such as Upside are eager to make a dent in the normal way of doing business.

Back in 1909 – almost 100 years before the launch of the first iPhone – Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla envisioned that one day we would all have personal wireless devices that would enable us to send messages all over the world. In 1865, French novelist Jules Verne not only predicted man’s 1969 moon landing – but also the name of the ship, the number of crew on-board and the feeling of weightlessness they would experience in space.
In today’s hyper-connected world, technology is advancing exponentially; in the next 20 years, computers are expected to be up to a million times more powerful than they are today. And speculation is rife over what this might mean for us.
Today, predictions that sound as far-fetched as Verne and Tesla’s insights once did are being widely-referenced the world over. From using AI to “reincarnate” people that have died to driverless cars filling our roads, there is no shortage of theories on what our future will look like.
But the fate of many of these predictions depends in part on consumers’ willingness to embrace them. The concept of driverless cars might seem cool, but do people trust them enough to allow our roads to be full of them?
Connecting predictions to consumer expectations
As part of London Tech Week this year, Sabre conducted new research to gauge how consumers feel about various new technologies in order to help the travel industry understand how to gain its customers’ trust.
We asked 2,000 UK consumers whether or not they agreed with a number of widely-cited futurists’ predictions about technologies like artificial intelligence, driverless cars and 3D printing. Results found that the majority agreed with statements relating to 3D printing and driverless cars:

However, they were less optimistic about some of the more forward-thinking statements – particularly those relating to artificial intelligence.

Despite the apparent rejection of artificial intelligence, the capabilities of this technology today suggest that “radical” predictions like the above are perhaps not that far-fetched; we now have AI systems that are capable of learning from vast amounts of complex, unstructured data and turning it into actionable insights, for example. This is, of course, already used by companies like Netflix, Amazon and music site Pandora.
It’s all about a lack of trust
The lack of belief in artificial intelligence forecasts could be down to an absence of trust.
A recent study by insidesales.com found that 42% of Americans don’t trust AI. It’s not hard to imagine why. Hollywood has had a long-running obsession for dystopian AI narratives; starting way back in the ‘twenties with Fritz Lang’s Metropolis – and going on to include brilliant but disturbing classics like 2001: Space Odyssey, Terminator and The Matrix – it’s little wonder the term artificial intelligence invokes a certain “wariness” among the average consumer.
According to world-renowned economist Rachel Botsman, getting people to believe in some of the more “radical” technology predictions would involve something called a “trust leap” – when we take a risk to do something new or to do something differently from how we’ve always done it. “People don’t want the entirely new; they want the familiar done differently,” she said at a recent Sabre event.
A study by insidesales.com found that 42% of Americans don’t trust artificial intelligence.Share
Consider how to communicate benefits of new tech
What does all this mean for travel companies that are looking at new ways to serve travellers through technology? How do we persuade travellers to take a leap of trust? Our research found that consumers are generally indifferent towards the use of new technologies by service providers. However, almost one in three indicated trust would diminish in their companies upon the introduction of emerging tech.

For any company, it is important to convince consumers of the benefits of new technologies in order to win their trust. For travel companies, artificial intelligence is just starting to become a reality in 2017. For example, Hilton uses AI in its Watson-powered Connie robot, various airlines use Sabre’s Intelligence Exchange to turn customer data into contextual interactions, and Sabre’s Labs team recently created a prototype Facebook Messenger bot that can answer travellers’ questions about their trips. Persuading consumers to trust – and therefore adopt – these technologies lies in focusing on explaining the benefits of using them, such as ease, convenience and intuitiveness.
The above images are extracts from new Sabre research that was part of its London Tech Week event, TTX London – an industry discussion on the future of distribution and technology in the travel industry.  For the full report, please click the banner below.
