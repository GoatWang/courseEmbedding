Brian T. Edwards













                    
                    Brian Edwards is the Crown Professor in Middle East Studies and Professor of English, Comparative Literary Studies, International Studies, and American Studies at Northwestern University, where he is also the founding Director of the Program in Middle East and North African Studies. Educated at Yale University (BA, MA, PhD), Edwards is the author of Morocco Bound: Disorienting America's Maghreb, from Casablanca to the Marrakech Express (2005), After the American Century: The Ends of U.S. Culture in the Middle East (2016), and co-editor of Globalizing American Studies (2010), a collection of essays that provides global perspectives on US history, politics, and culture. He is also the editor of On the Ground: New Directions in Middle East and North African Studies (2013), based on a long running project at Northwestern.  He has published essays, articles, and Op-Eds in publications including Salon, Chicago Tribune, Foreign Policy, Chronicle of Higher Education, The Believer, McSweeney's, and numerous leading scholarly journals.  Edwards has won major fellowships and awards from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, which in 2005 named him a Carnegie Scholar under their well-known Islam Initiative, and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, which in 2008 awarded him a New Directions Fellowship. In 2013, he was named an Emerging Leader by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, one of 20 young leaders from the Chicago area whose work will help equip the city to compete and thrive in the global era. Edwards has lectured extensively in the US and abroad, including in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon, Iran, Turkey, Qatar, Kyrgyzstan, and India, and has been visiting faculty at University of Tehran, Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris, and University College Dublin, as well as a Fulbright Senior Specialist at Cairo University and the University of Naples, Italy, and a Fulbright Scholar to Morocco.After the American Century is based on a decade of field research, this book examines the circulation of American culture in the contemporary Middle East and North Africa. He argues that because of the ways in which culture circulates in the digital age and the changed geopolitical status of the United States in the 21st century, we have entered a period after the American century, meaning that American culture, long popular internationally and assumed to have a positive benefit to US politics, is generally taken up by individuals in the Middle East and North Africa in ways that detach the cultural product from its American referent and thereby shatters the presumption of their close relationship.

How the BuildZoom Score works

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Washington:













Does Edwards, Brian T carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that impacts the value of real estate in Washington, requires a licensed contractor.
Edwards, Brian T currently holds license EDWARBT849D1 , which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Washington?



The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries requires licensees to maintain a bond and liability insurance for the protection of consumers.











Your liability risk when hiring Edwards, Brian T



Licensed contractors in Washington are required to maintain general liability coverage that includes a $50,000 property damage policy and $200,000 public liability policy; or $250,000 combined single limit policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Edwards, Brian T



Licensed general contractors in Washington are required to maintain a $12,000 bond and specialty contractors are required to maintain a $6,000 bond. This provides consumers with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The standard board recommendation is to get at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Achievements






My most significant accomplishment to date was co-founding Health Heritage (HH) with renowned physician researcher and informatics entrepreneur Bill Knaus. HH was developed over a decade by a team of multidisciplinary researchers and software developers to use data automatically curated from various clinical information systems to generate a comprehensive family health history and individualized risk assessments for all major heritable cancers. The report generated by the HH application and accessed by patients via the MyChart patient portal was accepted by numerous payers as adequate documentation of family history to justify reimbursement for genetic testing. My role on the HH team was to lead business development and marketing and in this capacity I pitched the company to legendary physician and entrepreneur Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong during a tour of his Los Angeles offices, a 15-minute meeting that resulted in NantHealth acquiring HH for $10 million in 2015.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREAfter The American Century: The Ends Of U.S. Culture In The Middle Eastby Edwards, Brian T.Building on a decade of fieldwork in Cairo, Casablanca, and Tehran, Brian T. Edwards maps new routes of cultural exchange. Shaped by the digital revolution, these paths are entwined with the growing fragility of American "soft" power. They indicate an era after the American century, in which popular American products and phenomena'such as comic books, teen romances, social-networking sites, and ways of expressing sexuality are stripped of their associations with the United States and recast in very different forms.General, Middle Eastern, Popular CultureCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
