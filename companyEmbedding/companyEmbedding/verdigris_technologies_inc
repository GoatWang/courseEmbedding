Verdigris Technologies is a venture-backed[1] B2B technology start-up founded in 2011 by Mark Chung, Thomas Chung, and Jonathan Chu.[2] Verdigris is an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled energy management platform for commercial facilities. Verdigris technology combines proprietary hardware, AI, and software applications to deliver insights about building operations.[3] In 2017, Fast Company named Verdigris one of the world’s 10 Most Innovative Companies in Energy.[4]
Based on the concepts of Nonintrusive load monitoring, the Verdigris energy platform monitors every electrical device in a building by means of monitoring the electrical feeds coming off of the building's circuit panel. Verdigris claims to provide data, actionable insights, and automation to help commercial facilities managers increasing the energy efficiency of their buildings. Areas that Verdigris works to impact include: reducing power usage during peak hours; identifying motor problems that could be using excess energy; and, detecting equipment faults before they occur.[5]
Verdigris’ customers include major hotels, corporate offices, hospitals, and manufacturers. Early customers included the City of San Jose, Autodesk, and Netflix.[6] Today, Verdigris has over 500 systems deployed[7] in the U.S. and around the world, including customers in the United Kingdom, Egypt, Brazil, and China.[8] Notable current customers include Jabil Circuit, Vention Medical, The W Hotel San Francisco (Starwood Hotels),[9] The Orchard Hotel in San Francisco,[10] and The Marriott Marquis in Washington, DC.[11]
To date, Verdigris has raised about $15 million in venture funding.[12] Most recently, Verdigris raised $6.7 million in an October 2016 venture capital round that was led by contract manufacturer Jabil and Verizon Ventures.[13]

Product Versions[edit]
The most recent (5th generation) version of the Verdigris energy platform, Einstein, was formally launched on August 30, 2016 with a live demo at the Jabil Blue Sky Center in San Jose, California.[14]
According to Engineering.com, “Verdigris claims that Einstein differs from their previous hardware because it is more straightforward to install, and it has an integrated cellular radio. Previous equipment from the company required an attachment to an external data connectivity system.”[15]
Services[edit]
“We provide analytics and workflow automation to 24/7 facilities teams to improve operational efficiency, reduce equipment downtimes, and save on energy, delivered as a SaaS,” said co-founder Thomas Chung to TechCrunch in March 2016.[16]
Verdigris smart sensors clamp onto electrical circuits to track a building’s energy consumption and sends the data securely over Wi-Fi or Verizon 4G/LTE to the cloud. Verdigris claims that its patented sensors track energy through an always-on AI that consumes more detailed information than any other solution. Its sensors take hundreds of millions more data points than a utility smart meters—every hour. This enables Verdigris AI technology and algorithms to “learn” a building’s equipment over time. It tracks energy output down to the microsecond and has equipment-level data.
Verdigris claims its sensors take hundreds of millions more data points per hour than a utility smart meter. Verdigris uses smart sensors that attach to a building’s electrical panel wiring. This allows Verdigris artificial technology and algorithms to “learn” about a building.
Verdigris has three analytics products: Web dashboard to provide insights on a building's energy consumption. Tracker, a configurable mobile app, to send alerts Lobby dashboard, a visual presentation of the building’s energy use that can be displayed on a screen in a building’s lobby.
Verdigris forecasting for demand management uses a deep learning recurrent neural network model. It reads a building's energy usage in real time, and, combined with weather or building occupancy, produces a probability distribution for estimated power consumption (kW).
The Verdigris system is certified for use in 38 countries including the United States, the European Union (32 countries), China, Malaysia, Mexico, India, Canada.
Company History[edit]
Verdigris co-founder and CEO Mark Chung came up with the idea for Verdigris when he returned home from vacation to a massive electricity bill. The local utility could not provide Chung with an itemized utility bill to show where he spent the extra electricity. Chung bought inexpensive kilowatt meters, hacked them to be wi-fi enabled, and built an electrical map to monitor every appliance in his house. He found the problem, a broken pool pump, and thought of a business idea to map commercial buildings that use a lot of energy.[17]
Verdigris participated in the Stanford accelerator, StartX, and as one of the StartX Notable Companies, was invested in by Stanford University. Verdigris was also one of the 10 inaugural winners of the Founder.org competition, and invested in by Founder.org Capital. NASA was also an early backer of Verdigris, and the two organizations have collaborated on projects including the Sustainability Base at Ames Research Center.[18] Verdigris is headquartered at the NASA Ames Research Park in Moffett Federal Airfield in Mountain View, California.
In December 2016, GreenBiz called Verdigris one of the ten companies to watch in the area of smart buildings.[19] CBInsights named Verdigris to the 2017 AI 100 list, recognizing the 100 most promising private artificial intelligence companies globally.[20] In 2017, Fast Company named Verdigris one of the 10 Most Innovative Companies in Energy.[21]
The name ‘Verdigris’ references the green patina that forms on copper left outside. “Copper is the elemental infrastructure of every single building in the world, what all of our electricity runs on,” said Chung.[22] “And what we have as a company mission is this desire to expose that to the world and make it green."

Verdigris smart sensors clamp onto electrical circuits to track a building’s energy consumption and sends the data securely over Wi-Fi or Verizon 4G/LTE to the cloud. Verdigris claims that its patented sensors track energy through an always-on AI that consumes more detailed information than any other solution. Its sensors take hundreds of millions more data points than a utility smart meters—every hour. This enables Verdigris AI technology and algorithms to “learn” a building’s equipment over time. It tracks energy output down to the microsecond and has equipment-level data.
Verdigris claims its sensors take hundreds of millions more data points per hour than a utility smart meter. Verdigris uses smart sensors that attach to a building’s electrical panel wiring. This allows Verdigris artificial technology and algorithms to “learn” about a building.
Verdigris has three analytics products: Web dashboard to provide insights on a building's energy consumption. Tracker, a configurable mobile app, to send alerts Lobby dashboard, a visual presentation of the building’s energy use that can be displayed on a screen in a building’s lobby.
Verdigris forecasting for demand management uses a deep learning recurrent neural network model. It reads a building's energy usage in real time, and, combined with weather or building occupancy, produces a probability distribution for estimated power consumption (kW).
The Verdigris system is certified for use in 38 countries including the United States, the European Union (32 countries), China, Malaysia, Mexico, India, Canada.
Company History[edit]
Verdigris co-founder and CEO Mark Chung came up with the idea for Verdigris when he returned home from vacation to a massive electricity bill. The local utility could not provide Chung with an itemized utility bill to show where he spent the extra electricity. Chung bought inexpensive kilowatt meters, hacked them to be wi-fi enabled, and built an electrical map to monitor every appliance in his house. He found the problem, a broken pool pump, and thought of a business idea to map commercial buildings that use a lot of energy.[17]
Verdigris participated in the Stanford accelerator, StartX, and as one of the StartX Notable Companies, was invested in by Stanford University. Verdigris was also one of the 10 inaugural winners of the Founder.org competition, and invested in by Founder.org Capital. NASA was also an early backer of Verdigris, and the two organizations have collaborated on projects including the Sustainability Base at Ames Research Center.[18] Verdigris is headquartered at the NASA Ames Research Park in Moffett Federal Airfield in Mountain View, California.
In December 2016, GreenBiz called Verdigris one of the ten companies to watch in the area of smart buildings.[19] CBInsights named Verdigris to the 2017 AI 100 list, recognizing the 100 most promising private artificial intelligence companies globally.[20] In 2017, Fast Company named Verdigris one of the 10 Most Innovative Companies in Energy.[21]
The name ‘Verdigris’ references the green patina that forms on copper left outside. “Copper is the elemental infrastructure of every single building in the world, what all of our electricity runs on,” said Chung.[22] “And what we have as a company mission is this desire to expose that to the world and make it green."

Too often we find ourselves wasting valuable resources resolving building issues, from broken equipments to high energy balances. We want to remove that burden from people with smart technology. This started with us gathering building data and turning them into actionable insights, resulting in a powerful energy management platform. However we’re not stopping there - we’re working hard to make it even more integrated so that buildings become autonomous and responsive to people.            Press & Media Access press releases, media resources, and archives.

Verdigris Technologies is a venture-backed[1] B2B technology start-up founded in 2011 by Mark Chung, Thomas Chung, and Jonathan Chu.[2] Verdigris is an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled energy management platform for commercial facilities. Verdigris technology combines proprietary hardware, AI, and software applications to deliver insights about building operations.[3] In 2017, Fast Company named Verdigris one of the world’s 10 Most Innovative Companies in Energy.[4]
Based on the concepts of Nonintrusive load monitoring, the Verdigris energy platform monitors every electrical device in a building by means of monitoring the electrical feeds coming off of the building's circuit panel. Verdigris claims to provide data, actionable insights, and automation to help commercial facilities managers increasing the energy efficiency of their buildings. Areas that Verdigris works to impact include: reducing power usage during peak hours; identifying motor problems that could be using excess energy; and, detecting equipment faults before they occur.[5]
Verdigris’ customers include major hotels, corporate offices, hospitals, and manufacturers. Early customers included the City of San Jose, Autodesk, and Netflix.[6] Today, Verdigris has over 500 systems deployed[7] in the U.S. and around the world, including customers in the United Kingdom, Egypt, Brazil, and China.[8] Notable current customers include Jabil Circuit, Vention Medical, The W Hotel San Francisco (Starwood Hotels),[9] The Orchard Hotel in San Francisco,[10] and The Marriott Marquis in Washington, DC.[11]
To date, Verdigris has raised about $15 million in venture funding.[12] Most recently, Verdigris raised $6.7 million in an October 2016 venture capital round that was led by contract manufacturer Jabil and Verizon Ventures.[13]

The most recent (5th generation) version of the Verdigris energy platform, Einstein, was formally launched on August 30, 2016 with a live demo at the Jabil Blue Sky Center in San Jose, California.[14]
According to Engineering.com, “Verdigris claims that Einstein differs from their previous hardware because it is more straightforward to install, and it has an integrated cellular radio. Previous equipment from the company required an attachment to an external data connectivity system.”[15]

“We provide analytics and workflow automation to 24/7 facilities teams to improve operational efficiency, reduce equipment downtimes, and save on energy, delivered as a SaaS,” said co-founder Thomas Chung to TechCrunch in March 2016.[16]
Verdigris smart sensors clamp onto electrical circuits to track a building’s energy consumption and sends the data securely over Wi-Fi or Verizon 4G/LTE to the cloud. Verdigris claims that its patented sensors track energy through an always-on AI that consumes more detailed information than any other solution. Its sensors take hundreds of millions more data points than a utility smart meters—every hour. This enables Verdigris AI technology and algorithms to “learn” a building’s equipment over time. It tracks energy output down to the microsecond and has equipment-level data.
Verdigris claims its sensors take hundreds of millions more data points per hour than a utility smart meter. Verdigris uses smart sensors that attach to a building’s electrical panel wiring. This allows Verdigris artificial technology and algorithms to “learn” about a building.
Verdigris has three analytics products: Web dashboard to provide insights on a building's energy consumption. Tracker, a configurable mobile app, to send alerts Lobby dashboard, a visual presentation of the building’s energy use that can be displayed on a screen in a building’s lobby.
Verdigris forecasting for demand management uses a deep learning recurrent neural network model. It reads a building's energy usage in real time, and, combined with weather or building occupancy, produces a probability distribution for estimated power consumption (kW).
The Verdigris system is certified for use in 38 countries including the United States, the European Union (32 countries), China, Malaysia, Mexico, India, Canada.
Company History[edit]
Verdigris co-founder and CEO Mark Chung came up with the idea for Verdigris when he returned home from vacation to a massive electricity bill. The local utility could not provide Chung with an itemized utility bill to show where he spent the extra electricity. Chung bought inexpensive kilowatt meters, hacked them to be wi-fi enabled, and built an electrical map to monitor every appliance in his house. He found the problem, a broken pool pump, and thought of a business idea to map commercial buildings that use a lot of energy.[17]
Verdigris participated in the Stanford accelerator, StartX, and as one of the StartX Notable Companies, was invested in by Stanford University. Verdigris was also one of the 10 inaugural winners of the Founder.org competition, and invested in by Founder.org Capital. NASA was also an early backer of Verdigris, and the two organizations have collaborated on projects including the Sustainability Base at Ames Research Center.[18] Verdigris is headquartered at the NASA Ames Research Park in Moffett Federal Airfield in Mountain View, California.
In December 2016, GreenBiz called Verdigris one of the ten companies to watch in the area of smart buildings.[19] CBInsights named Verdigris to the 2017 AI 100 list, recognizing the 100 most promising private artificial intelligence companies globally.[20] In 2017, Fast Company named Verdigris one of the 10 Most Innovative Companies in Energy.[21]
The name ‘Verdigris’ references the green patina that forms on copper left outside. “Copper is the elemental infrastructure of every single building in the world, what all of our electricity runs on,” said Chung.[22] “And what we have as a company mission is this desire to expose that to the world and make it green."

Get started            Why should you focus on improving operations?  For many building managers, the day-to-day needs of the job can’t be easily defined. Except to say that you’re constantly fighting one fire after another:   Broken Equipment – figuring out what’s not working, why, and repairing the problem Unexpected Scheduling – someone on staff changes the BMS schedule incorrectly Undiagnosed Issues – you learn about problems in your building from occupants, not your staff Today’s process is labor intensive: daily walk-throughs to check equipment and preventative maintenance schedules to guess when something might break.   Today’s process too often relies on complaints. You shouldn’t have to wait for occupants to tell you about building problems. Your building needs a 24/7 watchman.            How Verdigris helps Verdigris delivers this information to you by email and mobile-friendly website. Access your crucial information anywhere, at any time. The Verdigris Energy Tracker App also provides real-time alerts of critical issues when they arise. No more guessing where problems might be – know where problems are, when they happen.    Unexpected operation or unplanned shutdown    Excessive power cycling and unbalanced multi-phase load    Signature anomalies that could point to equipment faults    Scheduling errors – linked systems not operating together, excessive pre-cooling, etc.           Take it to the next level: Predictive Equipment Failure At the heart of Verdigris is our powerful artificial intelligence. Our algorithms learn and adapt to the specifics of your building and your equipment. Instead of just fixing things as they break, imagine if you already knew where the problems were. Verdigris can free your staff up to spend your valuable time on making your building world class.           Company | Verdigris                                              About Us Sustain and enrich human life with responsive energy intelligence             Our Mission Our goal is simple - make buildings responsive With people spending 92% of their time in buildings, we want to create a world where buildings take care of people, not the other way around. Too often we find ourselves wasting valuable resources resolving building issues, from broken equipments to high energy balances. We want to remove that burden from people with smart technology. This started with us gathering building data and turning them into actionable insights, resulting in a powerful energy management platform. However we’re not stopping there - we’re working hard to make it even more integrated so that buildings become autonomous and responsive to people.            Press & Media Access press releases, media resources, and archives.

How do you know that your energy retrofits and upgrade projects are doing what they should? Verdigris measures at the circuit-level in addition to mains, so that we can tell you exactly how much energy each component saves.   Compare your building’s energy end uses ( lighting, HVAC, etc.) to national CBECS standards Measure and verify planned efficiency upgrades like VFDs or LEDs Identify motor problems that could be using excess energy            How Verdigris helps Verdigris combines proprietary, high-speed sensors with our powerful artificial intelligence platform. Our patented algorithms drive real insight into your efficiency efforts. Weekly and monthly reports tell you how to improve. Instant notifications make sure you don’t miss a thing.    Make informed energy efficiency investment decisions through smart, measured tests    Isolate and quantify the results of large retrofit projects and “audit” vendor claims    Identify accumulated inefficiencies across large facilities    Go beyond the “low-hanging fruit” to get real results           Advanced Efficiency: Live Testing and Ongoing Commissioning In the Verdigris dashboard, see where you’re winning on energy spend and find improvements. Once you have a few ideas, our team of Professional Engineers can help design an efficiency program. We’ll show you where you can improve. Want to replace an out-of-date chiller? Install a variable fan drive? Test a water-side economizer? we measure and quantify the real value you’re receiving at the device. And we continue to provide usable data over time, to hold your vendors and your team accountable.
