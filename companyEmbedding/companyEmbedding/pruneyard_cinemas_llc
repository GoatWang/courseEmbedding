CAMPBELL, Calif., Oct. 21, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Today Ellis Partners announced the purchase (together with a capital partner) of The Pruneyard, a 27-acre mixed use landmark asset located in the heart of Campbell, CA. The Pruneyard is comprised of over 365,000 square feet of office space, over 250,000 square feet of retail space and the 171-room Doubletree (Hilton) hotel. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
Located at the intersection of Campbell and Bascom Avenues only a quarter mile from thriving downtown Campbell, immediately accessible from State Route 17, and proximate to some of Silicon Valley's highest profile residential neighborhoods including Willow Glen, Los Gatos, Saratoga, Cupertino, and Los Altos, The Pruneyard is well-positioned for growth. Ellis Partners will draw on its experience with other properties including Town and Country Village in Palo Alto to make strategic cosmetic upgrades to the facility, creating an improved experience for visitors and a more attractive gathering space for the local community. 
"We look forward to working with the City of Campbell on developing a plan for The Pruneyard that enhances its unique character while allowing for better connectivity for the variety of uses at the site," said James Ellis, Co-Founder and Managing Principal of Ellis Partners. 
"We are thrilled to have the opportunity to be part of the Campbell community," said Melinda Ellis Evers, Managing Principal who co-founded Ellis Partners with her brother James. "Ellis Partners is a regional, family-owned company with decades of experience in managing important community assets. We are working with best-in-class consultants and contractors to create a vision for The Pruneyard that reflects the Campbell community's needs and values."
"The Pruneyard has been a premier West Valley office location for businesses large and small for over four decades," said Jason Morehouse, Partner and Director of Acquisitions at Ellis Partners, who also noted the unparalleled 360-degree views and ease-of-access enjoyed by the office tenants.  "With strategic investments in the site and the adjacent retail center, we believe we can further bolster the value proposition for our nearly 85 office tenants by creating an even more robust and dynamic retail and entertainment amenity package.  Silicon Valley tenants are clearly favoring those locations that can provide an interesting, non-formulaic, and walkable retail environment, which we believe we can provide in spades."  Morehouse also noted plans to finish the renovation of the 171-room hotel that was started by EOP as part of the 2013 conversion to a Hilton DoubleTree, which contains multiple event and meeting room venues for both hotel guests and the office tenants.  
The Pruneyard first opened its doors in 1969, with the 18-story office tower following soon after in 1970 and the second 10-story tower in 1972.  The Pruneyard Inn (now the Doubletree) was first constructed in 1989 and renovated and expanded in 1998. In the early 1990′s The Pruneyard was purchased by William Wilson and Associates, who overhauled the shopping center, creating the "Main Street" which allows visitors to enter the shopping center and travel straight through to the office buildings. Equity Office purchased The Pruneyard in 1999 and completed the hotel conversion to a Hilton Doubletree in 2013, which included a $2M-$3M renovation.  
The Pruneyard was acquired from Equity Office Properties. Key tenants of the Pruneyard include Marshall's, Sports Basement, Trader Joe's, and Camera Cinemas

By Jasmine Leyva | jleyva@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News GroupPUBLISHED: March 7, 2017 at 5:00 am | UPDATED: March 7, 2017 at 5:26 amCamera 7 Cinemas at the Pruneyard Shopping Center will close in April so management can get to work on construction that will change the theater-going experience.
The seven-screen movie theater at 1875 S. Bascom Ave. will be remodeled to include a restaurant and full bar and will be renamed Pruneyard Cinemas. Owner Jack Nyblom and his partner Ed Rathmann said they hope to begin construction in April with a reopening in September.
“We’re designing it right now,” Rathmann told this newspaper. “It won’t look anything like it does now because we’re taking over the Pizza My Heart space.”
The pizza joint is located inside the lobby of the theater. The space will be transformed to accommodate a kitchen, and the former Boswell’s bar next door will be remodeled into a full bar, according to Nyblom and Rathmann.
Planned improvements in the theater include installing 500 reclining seats; constructing a 60-seat restaurant; expanding the lobby and concession area and making room for new offices, storage and an employee room. Patio seating is planned.
All seven theater screens will remain.
“It will be a completely different experience,” Rathmann said. “I think what’s happening is that every theater in the country wants to do this or is doing this because the old style of ‘come watch a movie’ isn’t working as well.”
According to Nyblom, the new restaurant and bar will be open to the public and will not require a movie ticket. Movie-goers will also have the option to purchase tickets online, reserve their seats ahead of time and have food delivered to their seats.
Nyblom said names for the restaurant and bar have not been finalized yet.


The theater will also see its ownership structure change. According to a business plan, Pruneyard Cinemas, LLC will purchase Camera 7 Cinemas limited partnership, which has four years left on the current lease. The theater will enter a 30-year lease with shopping center owner Ellis Partners, who will provide at least $1 million to tenant improvements and equipment.
Nyblom and Rathmann will stay on as principals of Pruneyard Cinemas.
“The new owners of the Pruneyard are doing a massive remodel,” Rathmann said. “They want us to be the focal point on it. So they are investing a lot of money into the theater to make it happen.”
Nyblom is the founder and managing partner of Camera Cinemas. Rathmann is the managing partner of Willow Street Wood Fired Pizza and Main Street Burger.
Ellis Partners received approval from the city late last year to do a four-phase project that will bring five new retail buildings, 100,000 square feet of office space and 680 new parking spaces. Renovations to existing commercial buildings and new landscaping are planned. The first phase kicked off in January, and will see the reconfiguration of pedestrian crossings and construction for public gathering areas.
