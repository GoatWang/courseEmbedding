Pembina Pipeline Corporation Reaches Major Milestone by Placing Approximately $2.8 Billion of Integrated Assets into Service
			  



























































 















CALGARY, July 4, 2017 /CNW/ - Pembina Pipeline Corporation ("Pembina" or "the Company") (TSX: PPL; NYSE:  PBA) announced that it has placed approximately $2.8 billion of integrated capital projects into service, including its Phase III pipeline expansion ("Phase III Expansion") and two connected major delivery points: the Company's third fractionator at Redwater ("RFS III") and its Canadian Diluent Hub ("CDH"). 
"At the outset of these projects, we committed to constructing large-scale, multiyear-build assets on time and on budget, and I'm proud to say that we've successfully delivered on that promise, with the overall portfolio coming in under budget by approximately 8 percent and either on time or ahead of schedule," said Mick Dilger, Pembina's President and Chief Executive Officer. 
Phase III Expansion
The Phase III Expansion, which is underpinned by long-term contracts with take-or-pay commitments, was placed into service on June 30, 2017 on time and under budget from the $2.44 billion expected capital. The entire Phase III Expansion program, which was initiated in 2013, included installing over 900 kilometres ("km") of new pipeline primarily along the Company's existing Peace and Northern system rights-of-way, as well as upgrading and adding new mainline pump stations. Initial work for the Phase III Expansion included debottlenecking segments of existing pipeline systems from Taylor, British Columbia to Gordondale, Alberta and adding a new pipeline from Wapiti to Fox Creek, Alberta to accommodate increased volumes upstream of Pembina's Fox Creek tie-in point. In support of handling the increased product, 420,000 barrels per day ("bpd") of incremental capacity was added in the Fox Creek to Namao corridor of Alberta through the construction of two pipelines: a 16 inch and a 24 inch diameter pipeline, each spanning approximately 290 km. 
With the Phase III Expansion now complete, Pembina has four pipelines between Fox Creek and Namao, allowing the Company to transport four distinct hydrocarbons – ethane-plus, propane-plus, condensate and crude oil – each in its own segregated pipeline, plus upstream capacity to handle higher volumes driven by the development of the Montney, Duvernay and Deep Basin resource plays.
"Placing our Phase III Expansion into service is an exciting milestone for Pembina as we've now successfully completed the largest capital project in our history," said Paul Murphy, Pembina's Senior Vice President, Pipeline and Crude Oil Facilities. "Our customers will benefit from the newly increased capacity, as our pipelines were previously under apportionment, and they will also realize enhanced service offerings and operational efficiencies from being able to flow segregated product in separate pipelines. In addition, we will be able to provide a ratable flow of ethane-plus and propane-plus into both Pembina and third-party fractionators in the Fort Saskatchewan region, which will help to optimize operations at these facilities." 
In aggregate, Pembina now has over 850,000 bpd of combined capacity between its Peace and Northern Pipeline systems which connect into the delivery point at Namao. Given continued customer demand, the Company recently announced that it secured contracts to add an additional 180,000 bpd of capacity via the addition of two pump stations on the new 24 inch pipeline between Fox Creek and Namao through its Phase IV Expansion, subject to regulatory and environmental approval. It also is working on the Phase V Expansion, which entails looping its pipeline between Lator and Fox Creek to provide additional upstream capacity. Beyond these expansions, which are expected to be placed into service in late 2018, Pembina is able to increase capacity on the 24 and 16 inch pipelines in the Fox Creek to Namao corridor by another 250,000 bpd through additional pump stations – which would bring total capacity into the Namao hub to almost 1,300,000 bpd. 
RFS III
In conjunction with the Phase III Expansion, RFS III was also placed into service on June 30, 2017, ahead of schedule and under budget. Backstopped by long-term, take-or-pay contracts, RFS III added 55,000 bpd of additional propane-plus fractionation capacity and leveraged the designs of Pembina's first and second fractionators. Pembina's Redwater complex now has an aggregate fractionation capacity of approximately 210,000 bpd – the largest in the Canadian energy infrastructure sector.  
"Based on our customers' volume projections supporting the Phase III Expansion, we secured contracts to build RFS III so that pipeline and fractionation capacity would be better aligned within the Fort Saskatchewan area," said Stuart Taylor, Pembina's Senior Vice President, NGL and Natural Gas Facilities. "Along with increased fractionation capacity with RFS III, our Redwater complex provides customers with efficient storage and market access through our well-established facilities at Redwater and our new Canadian Diluent Hub." 
"Looking ahead, we are focused on providing market access solutions for our customers for the products coming off the back end of our fractionators – particularly propane – which will ultimately help add value to the incremental barrels and serve to increase producer netbacks. In support of this, we are working to further expand our service offering down the value chain by proposing to develop both an integrated propylene and polypropylene production facility and a west coast liquefied petroleum gas export terminal," concluded Mr. Taylor. 
CDH
Also aligned with the in-service of the Phase III Expansion and RFS III, on June 30, 2017, Pembina placed additional condensate connections at CDH into service on time and under budget. CDH, which operates commercially as a fee-based hub, provides direct connectivity for growing condensate volumes transported on Pembina's pipeline systems and offers diluent services for oil sands customers. Currently, the facility's pipelines are capable of delivering approximately 400,000 bpd of condensate to regional third-party diluent pipelines, with connections to the Access, Cold Lake, Fort Saskatchewan (FSPL) and Polaris pipelines. By the end of 2017, CDH is also expected to have additional third-party connections as well as 500,000 barrels of above ground storage in operation. 
"The Canadian Diluent Hub was driven by the development of the Montney and Duvernay resource plays in our service areas," said Mr. Murphy. "Increasing production from these plays fueled infrastructure development, such as our Phase III Expansion and RFS III. With our access to growing condensate supply through our existing and new infrastructure, customers were supportive of us expanding diluent market access and service offerings."
Several additional factors supported the development of CDH, including its Alberta Industrial Heartland location, which is proximal to oil sands and diluent pipelines, as well as associated terminals. Development in this location enabled Pembina to avoid costly and congested construction in the greater Edmonton area. Further, given Pembina had reached its maximum capacity into the existing Edmonton-area condensate infrastructure, the Company foresaw that additional infrastructure would be required to accommodate higher volumes. Through CDH, Pembina now offers incremental solutions for its customers by expanding on the condensate services the Company already provides. 
Summary
"Looking back only a few years ago when our extensive growth plans were in their infancy, to the transformation of where our company is today, I commend all of the hard work and dedication of our teams who worked tirelessly to achieve such extraordinary results in bringing our growth plans successfully into fruition – all while maintaining our outstanding safety record," commented Mr. Dilger. "I am also very proud of the relationships and trust we have built over this timeframe with the communities, stakeholders, customers and First Nations and Métis in the areas where we operate and look forward to continuing to foster these relationships in the future."  
"Now through 2018 – including growth projects of Veresen, pending successful close of the transaction we announced in May this year – we will be placing an additional $3 billion of assets into service on top of the $2.8 billion we announced in service today," said Mr. Dilger. "These projects, with their low-risk, fee-for-service cash flows, will contribute significantly to our projected adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2018 between $2.55 and $2.75 billion."

Forward-Looking Statements & Information
This document contains certain forward-looking statements and information (collectively, "forward-looking statements") that are based on Pembina's current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as "expects", "will", "would", "could", "plans", "anticipates", "schedule", "potential" and similar expressions suggesting future events or future performance.
In particular, this document contains forward-looking statements, including certain financial outlooks, pertaining to, without limitation, the following: anticipated timing, in-service dates and capacities for ongoing growth projects; the anticipated timing acquisition of Veresen; the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including anticipated adjusted EBITDA projections for the combined entity, as well as anticipated synergies; Pembina's corporate strategy; the ongoing utilization and development relating to expansions and additions to Pembina's asset base; financial results related to and growth opportunities associated with the assets of the combined company after the acquisition of Veresen.. 
The forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions that Pembina has made in respect thereof as at the date of this news release, including:, the abilities of the parties to satisfy the conditions to closing of the Veresen acquisition; that favourable circumstances continue to exist in respect of current and future growth projects of Pembina and Veresen (including the ability to finance operations and such projects on favourable terms); continued oil and gas industry exploration and development activity levels and the geographic region of such activity; ongoing utilization and future expansion, development, growth and performance of Pembina's business and asset base; future demand for processing, fractionation and pipeline transportation services and new opportunities; prevailing commodity prices and exchange rates and the ability of Pembina to maintain current credit ratings; future operating costs and cash flow; geotechnical and integrity costs; that any required commercial agreements can be reached; that all required corporate, regulatory and environmental approvals can be obtained on the necessary terms in a timely manner; that counterparties will comply with contracts in a timely manner; that there are no unforeseen material costs relating to the facilities which are not recoverable from customers; interest and tax rates; prevailing regulatory, tax and environmental laws and regulations; maintenance of operating margins; the amount of future liabilities relating to environmental incidents; and the availability of coverage under Pembina's insurance policies (including in respect of Pembina's business interruption insurance policy).
Although Pembina believes the expectations and material factors and assumptions reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date hereof, there can be no assurance that these expectations, factors and assumptions will prove to be correct. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to: the ability of Pembina and Veresen to receive, in a timely manner, the necessary court, securityholder, stock exchange and other third-party approvals; the ability of the parties to satisfy the other conditions to the Veresen acquisition; the failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of the Veresen acquisition following closing due to integration issues or otherwise, and expectations and assumptions concerning, among other things: customer demand, planned synergies, capital efficiencies and cost savings; applicable tax laws; future production rates; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities; lower than anticipated results of operations and accretion from Pembina's business initiatives; the ability of Pembina to raise sufficient capital; the regulatory environment and the ability to obtain required regulatory, corporate, environmental approvals; the impact of competitive entities and pricing; labour and material shortages; strength and operations of the oil and natural gas production industry and related commodity prices; non-performance or default by counterparties to agreements which Pembina or one or more of its affiliates has entered into in respect of its business; fluctuations in operating results; adverse general economic and market conditions in Canada, North America and elsewhere, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices; and certain other risks detailed from time to time in Pembina's public disclosure documents available at www.sedar.com. This list of risk factors should not be construed as exhaustive. In addition, the closing of the Veresen acquisition may not be completed, or may be delayed if the parties' respective conditions to the closing of the acquisition, including the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, are not satisfied on the anticipated timelines or at all. Accordingly, there is a risk that the acquisition may not be completed within the anticipated timeline, or at all, on the terms currently proposed, or at all.
Readers are cautioned that events or circumstances could cause results to differ materially from those predicted, forecasted or projected. The forward-looking statements contained in this document speak only as of the date of this document. Pembina does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, except as required by applicable laws. Readers are cautioned that management of Pembina approved the financial outlooks contained herein as of the date of this press release. The purpose of the financial contained herein is to give the reader an indication of the combined company's financial results, and the information may not be appropriate for other purposes. The forward-looking statements contained in this document are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.
Non-GAAP Measures 
In this news release, Pembina has used certain terms that are not defined by GAAP but are used by management to evaluate the Veresen acquisition. Since non-GAAP measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by international financial reporting measures ("IFRS") and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, securities regulators require that non-GAAP measures are clearly defined and qualified. The intent of non-GAAP measures is to provide additional useful information with respect to the proposed acquisition to investors and analysts. 
In particular,  Pembina has used the term adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted EBITDA"). Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated as earnings for the year plus share of profit (loss) from equity accounted investees (before tax, depreciation and amortization) plus net finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (included in operations and general and administrative expense) and unrealized gains or losses on commodity-related derivative financial instruments. The exclusion of unrealized gains or losses on commodity-related derivative financial instruments eliminates the non-cash impact of such gains or losses. Adjusted EBITDA also includes adjustments for loss (gain) on disposal of assets, transaction costs incurred in respect of acquisitions, impairment charges or reversals and write-downs in respect of goodwill, intangible assets and property plant and equipment, and non-cash provisions. These additional adjustments are made to exclude various non-cash and other items that are not reflective of ongoing operations. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors as it is an important indicator of the issuer's ability to generate liquidity through cash flow from operating activities, and is also used by investors and analysts for assessing financial performance and for the purpose of valuing an issuer, including calculating financial and leverage ratios. Other issuers may calculate this non-GAAP measure differently. For additional information regarding non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to measures recognized by GAAP, please refer to Pembina's financial reports, which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and at www.pembina.com.
All financial figures are in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted.

Employee Giving













Follow the Yellow Brick PATH - Pembina encourages our employees to give back to the communities where they live, work and play through the PATH program (Pembina’s Actions That Help). The PATH program allows employees to engage more closely not only with the communities they live in, but also to create a culture whereby employees feel supported by the company in their philanthropic efforts. Just think of Pembina’s Community Investment team as the Wizard, of a sort. Only instead of ruby slippers, we are here to hand out donation matches, volunteer support and team building assistance through PATH.
In addition, Pembina works closely with those organizations for which we provide funding to through our Corporate Community Investment Program to create opportunities for employee volunteerism throughout the year.







                        Giving Smart - Matching Gifts









Pembina's gift matching branch of the PATH program encourages employee contributions to registered charities. Pembina will match any donation made by an employee to an eligible registered charity to no limit.










                        Showing Heart - Employee Volunteerism









Pembina offers a $500 contribution per employee per year to those organizations for which employees volunteer at least 50 hours of time. The volunteer matching program is designed to encourage employee volunteerism in the community, whether it's volunteering at a local food bank or coaching the kids' community soccer team. 
			 










                        Building Courage - Employee Team Fundraising









Pembina encourages employees to come together as teams while supporting those causes that are important to them. Pembina offers corporate volunteer opportunities throughout the year so that staff can give back to their communities. In addition, each employee, as part of a Pembina team, may access $50 per year per employee to go towards  registration fees in a given sport-related fundraising activity (think Ride to Conquer Cancer).
			 










                        The Emerald Award - Because of the Wonderful Things You Do









To recognize the employees who help to make Pembina such a great community partner, we offer the Emerald Award for community involvement. This award is distributed quarterly to an employee who goes above and beyond in giving back to their community, with the recipient offered a $500 grant on behalf of Pembina to donate to the charity of their choice.










                        There's No Place Like Home - United Way Campaign






Each year, Pembina conducts a Company-wide staff United Way Campaign. We are proud to say that employee donations are 100%  matched by the Company – to no limit – and each of our offices holds their own United Way Campaign (if a location does not have a United Way, they are able to fundraise for the community organization of their choice).
Pembina has been a proud supporter of the United Way for over 25 years. Through our long campaign history, we have invested over $9 million in the Calgary community, and are consistently ranked inth top ten for both participation and dollars raised.

For our efforts, Pembina has received several awards, including a President's Award, two Awards of Excellence (United Way’s most prestigious award) and a Because Award from the United Way of Calgary & Area, a Quantum Leap Award from the United Way of Grande Prairie, and the Richard White Day of Caring Award from the Sarnia-Lambton United Way in Ontario. 
 
"Pembina understands the importance of a healthy and vibrant community - and we feel the United Way plays an important role. We encourage our employees, directors and retirees to give back to the communities where we live, work and play, and we are proud to support an organization so integral to the community."
- Mick Dilger, President & CEO

Phase III Pipeline System Expansions












Overview
On December 16, 2013, Pembina announced we obtained commercial support in the form of binding, long-term agreements with our customers to proceed with expanding our pipeline systems. The expansion program, which we refer to as the Phase III Expansion, entails constructing new pipeline following and expanding upon certain segments of our existing pipeline systems from Taylor, British Columbia southeast to Edmonton, Alberta to fulfill capacity needs for our customers.

Since the original project announcement, Pembina has continued working with its customers. On September 10, 2014, we announced that due to strong customer demand, we plan to expand the Phase III Expansion by constructing a new 16" diameter pipeline from Fox Creek, Alberta into Namao, Alberta and a new 12" diameter pipeline from Wapiti, Alberta into Kakwa, Alberta.

Pembina is committed achieving excellence in every aspect of our business, from how we design, construct and operate our pipelines and facilities to how we interact with community neighbours, customers and employees. For the Phase III Expansion, we have consulted with applicable regulatory authorities, First Nations, landowners and other stakeholders on the project plans. Please refer back to this page for future updates on consultation activities. If you have any questions or concerns, please email FCNamao@pembina.com.

Pembina has completed an expansion between Simonette and Fox Creek. The pipeline was placed into service in early August 2014.











Fox Creek to Namao

          The core of the Phase III Expansion is a new 270 km 24" diameter pipeline from Fox Creek, Alberta, to the Edmonton area. On September 10, 2014, we announced plans to expand the original Phase III pipeline expansions by constructing a new 16" diameter pipeline that will be built in the same right-of-way as the proposed 24" diameter pipeline from Fox Creek to Namao. Once the 24" diameter and 16" diameter pipelines are complete (subject to regulatory approval), Pembina will have four pipelines in the Fox Creek to Edmonton corridor with an ultimate capacity of over 1,000,000 barrels per day ("bpd"). This will allow us to transport four distinct hydrocarbons -- propane-plus, ethane-plus, condensate and crude oil - each in its own segregated pipeline. This is great for Pembina and for our customers as we will be able to realize operational efficiencies, such as minimizing or eliminating batch interface between the products and streamlining storage requirements. In addition, we will be able to provide a ratable flow of propane-plus and ethane-plus into industry fractionators, including our Redwater fractionator, which will help to optimize operations at these facilities.

Wapiti to Kakwa

          The Wapiti to Kakwa Pipeline was completed in Q3 2016 and is intended to debottleneck a portion of Pembina's existing pipeline system. The pipeline will traverse from Wapiti, Alberta to Kakwa, Alberta. It will be approximately 70 km in length and is expected to have an initial capacity of approximately 95,000 bpd. This debottleneck will ultimately allow product to be delivered into the Company's core segment of the Phase III Expansion between Fox Creek and Namao. As part of this project, Pembina also plans to build two new pump stations.

Project Fact Sheet















NEBC Expansion





        Pembina has received regulatory approval for and initiated construction on a $235 million expansion to its pipeline infrastructure in northeast British Columbia (the "NEBC Expansion"). The NEBC Expansion will transport condensate and natural gas liquids for various producers in the liquids-rich Montney resource play and entails the construction of approximately 160 kilometres,12-inch diametre pipeline with a base capacity of up to 75,000 bpd that will parallel the Company's Blueberry pipeline system northwest of Taylor, B.C. to the Highway/Blair Creek area of B.C. Subject to regulatory and environmental approval, Pembina anticipates bringing the NEBC Expansion on-stream in late 2017.

The Project is underpinned by a long-term, cost-of-service agreement with an anchor tenant and volumes aggregated by the NEBC Expansion will feed into Pembina's Phase III Expansion.

PDH/PP Facility 











Overview

          The proposed integrated propylene and polypropylene production facility ("PDH/PP Facility") is a project being developed by Canada Kuwait Petrochemical Corporation ("CKPC"), a joint venture between Pembina and Petrochemical Industries Company K.S.C. ("PIC").

The Project would be located on land owned by Pembina in Sturgeon County, Alberta. The facility would use propane as its feedstock, converting it to propylene, and then further process it into polypropylene. Once operational, the PDH/PP Facility could consume approximately 22,000 barrels per day of propane sourced from Pembina's Redwater complex as well as other regional fractionation facilities and produce over 1.2 billion pounds per year of polypropylene. For Pembina, this investment represents a material extension of our natural gas liquids value chain strategy and creates a significant incremental local market for western Canadian hydrocarbons. The preliminary capital cost estimate of the PDH/PP Facility is $3.8 to $4.2 billion (gross).
        






                            About our CKPC Partner
                       
                   
                   
                   Petrochemical Industries Company K.S.C ("PIC"), founded in 1963, is a subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation ("KPC"). With world-scale manufacturing facilities around the world, PIC manufactures and markets chemicals that are the essential building blocks for countless products that people use every day and that serve diversified markets worldwide. In addition to manufacturing and marketing fertilizers, olefins and aromatics in Kuwait, PIC participates in multiple joint ventures that also produce and market petrochemical products both locally and internationally. PIC has been operating in Alberta since 2004 through various investments including those in the petrochemical industry.

View PIC's Website











Project Background

          This Project is an opportunity to develop crucial new market demand for propane in the Province of Alberta. Over the past decade, approximately 85 percent of Alberta's propane production has been exported across North America. Developing Alberta-based, value-add infrastructure will increase local propane demand benefitting Alberta's oil and gas producers, as well as the Province, by increasing regional economic activity and tax base.

The polypropylene would be transported in a pellet form to markets across North America and internationally. Polypropylene is one of the world's most commonly used polymers. Traditional uses include automobile plastics, medical supplies, home appliances, transparent containers as well as numerous other applications.

With access to the largest supply of propane in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, CKPC is ideally suited to facilitate the development of this Project. Pembina’s completion of its third fractionator at the Redwater site, brings its total fractionation capacity over 200,000 barrels per day and approximately 60,000 barrels per day of propane supply in the Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta area.

RFS II, which is fully contracted by take-or-pay agreements, essentially was a twin the Company's existing 73,000 bpd ethane-plus fractionator at Redwater and was built to address a portion of the anticipated shortfall in fractionation capacity within the Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta area. On April 1, 2016, Pembina placed RFS II into service on budget and one quarter later than expected.


RFS III:
RFS III is a new 55,000 bpd propane-plus fractionator at Pembina's existing Redwater fractionation and storage complex and is underpinned by long-term take-or-pay contracts with multiple producers. Pembina expects RFS III to cost approximately $400 million and, subject to regulatory and environmental approval, to be in-service in the third quarter of 2017.











Duvernay I













On November 5, 2015, Pembina announced that it plans to construct, own and operate a new 100 MMcf/d shallow cut gas plant, the Duvernay I Facility, that is in close proximity to Pembina's Fox Creek Terminal. The expected capital cost for the project, including supporting infrastructure, is expected to be approximately $125 million.

Duvernay I, which is underpinned by a long-term, substantial take-or-pay agreement with a large and diversified investment-grade oil and gas producer, is expected to have NGL extraction capacity of approximately 5,500 bpd, subject to gas compositions. Pembina anticipates bringing Duvernay I in service in the second half of 2017.

Duvernay I Facility News Release


        On May 31, 2016, Pembina announced that it entered into agreements with a multinational, investment grade customer to construct associated infrastructure relating to Duvernay I. The supporting infrastructure includes condensate, gas and water field handling (the Field Hub), a gas gathering trunk line and a fuel line for a total expected capital cost of approximately $145 million. 

The Field Hub is committed under a long-term, fixed-return agreement. To align with Duvernay I, Pembina anticipates bringing the Field Hub and associated infrastructure into service in the second half of 2017.  

Additionally, Pembina executed a long-term, fee-for-service gas processing agreement at the Duvernay I facility. With this agreement, Duvernay I is now fully contracted and Pembina has begun preliminary engineering for a 'twin' Duvernay II facility.

Duvernay I Infrastructure and Agreements News Release













Terminalling Services - Sturgeon Refinery













        Pembina announced on May 21, 2015, that it will provide terminalling services for the North West Redwater Partnership ("North West") with respect to North West's planned refinery (the "Sturgeon Refinery").

The terminalling services will be provided by Pembina to North West under a long term, fixed return agreement and a 10-year fractionation agreement related to the third fractionator Pembina is constructing at its Redwater site.

Pembina expects a capital investment of $180 million will be required to construct the terminalling facilities. The facilities include truck and rail loading, storage, as well as handling and processing equipment for a variety of products delivered from North West. The storage facilities are expected to be in service in early 2017, with the remaining facilities to be phased in with completion expected by late 2017. 
      












Canadian Diluent Hub


        Pembina is constructing the Canadian Diluent Hub ("CDH"), a large-scale condensate and diluent terminal at its Heartland Terminal site near Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta.

CDH is expected to be a primary access point for Oilsands producers to source a significant and growing supply of domestically produced condensate from the Montney, Deep Basin and Duvernay developments delivered from Pembina's Peace pipeline and Redwater fractionators.

The CDH development will include 500,000 barrels of above ground storage, multiple inbound and outbound pipeline connections, and associated pumping and metering facilities. Take-away capacity will be in excess of 400,000 barrels per day via delivery to third-party diluent pipelines: IPL Polaris pipeline, Access pipeline, IPL Cold Lake pipeline and Keyera FSPL.
      

        The new facilities augment Pembina's existing diluent handling facilities at RFS, which includes rail import capacity, 500,000 barrels of underground storage and approximately 180,000 bpd of existing delivery capacity to third-party diluent delivery pipelines. The Company expects CDH to become a new market hub for condensate and other diluents by offering customers:
 

direct access to a growing and diverse diluent supply through Pembina and third-party pipeline connections;
direct connectivity to third-party market terminals and pipelines that supply and serve oil sands producers;
marketing services to facilitate supply aggregation; and
above ground and cavern storage services.

Construction commenced in May 2016. Pembina anticipates full connectivity and service offerings through CDH in mid-2017.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Pembina Pipeline: A Great Monthly Dividend Stock For A Roth IRA - Pembina Pipeline Corp. (NYSE:PBA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Pembina Pipeline: A Great Monthly Dividend Stock For A Roth IRAJun. 9.17 | About: Pembina Pipeline (PBA) Gold Mining Bull Long only, gold & precious metals, oil & gas, contrarianMarketplaceThe Gold Bull PortfolioSummaryI started buying shares of Pembina Pipeline in a Roth IRA earlier this year, and I continue to buy more.Pembina pays a solid monthly dividend and yields close to 5%, and there's a good chance dividends will grow in the future following an acquisition.I break down the value of Pembina's stock and why holding the stock in a retirement account is recommended, especially for U.S. investors.Pembina Pipeline: Why You Should Buy it in a Roth IRA 

 PBA data by YCharts Pembina Pipeline (NYSE:PBA) is a Canadian petroleum and natural gas pipeline operator, which recently announced a mega acquisition of competitor Veresen in a $9.7 billion stock and cash deal. With a dividend yield approaching 5% (and a monthly dividend payout), a low-risk, fee-based business model with predictable cash flows, and the potential for long-term dividend and earnings growth, I think the stock is an excellent buy here and a particularly good fit for a Roth IRA. Here's what you need to know about Pembina: the company is a high-yield stock with some impressive growth opportunities, but it also operates a low-risk business. The stock has performed quite well over the past 10 years. It has grown its dividend by 5% annually and paid $5.1 billion in dividends. Total shareholder returns are 18% on average, with a 440% total return since 2006, according to its corporate presentation. Last year, Pembina reported a record of $1.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $2.54 in adjusted cash flow per share, and has maintained a conservative balance sheet with 4X debt/adjusted EBITDA. Following the takeover of Veresen, the company is aiming for up to $2.55 to $2.75 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2018. Its enterprise value of $33 billion will place it right below Enbridge (NYSE:ENB), which carries a $40 billion enterprise value.
 Approximately 87% of its Pembina's cash flows will come from "fee-for-service" throughout 2022 following the acquisition, up from 80%. This gives it more stable, predictable cash flows. Pembina currently pays a monthly dividend of $.17 per share and yields 4.58%. However, the company is planning an immediate 5.9% dividend increase upon closing of its transaction With Veresen. I think the buyout is a no-brainer. The result will be a larger, more diversified company with stronger cash flows and additional growth opportunities: Pembina estimates that its growth projects will increase by $1.5 billion to $6 billion, with an additional $20 billion in unsecured growth opportunities, according to its corporate presentation. 

 (Credit: Pembina presentation) Above is a highlight of the pro forma company estimates for 2018, which shows it will be a more diversified company, have a larger portion of its EBITDA come from the United States, and have slightly less counterparty exposure to non-investment-grade companies. What does this all mean for Pembina's earnings and cash flow? The company is targeting 8% to 10% cash flow per share growth throughout 2022. Notice that this is per-share growth and not total growth, as the company is looking to grow value on a per-share basis. U.S. investors should note that Pembina's dividends are considered qualified dividends and are subject to Canadian withholding tax. However, this tax can be avoided; as of 2009, Canadian corporate dividends and interest income are exempt from this 15% withholding tax as long as the investment is held in an IRA or 401(k). This is one reason I'm focused on adding Pembina shares to my Roth IRA. I expect solid, long-term returns driven by the acquisition of Veresen. Dividends should continue to grow at a pace of at least 5% per year if cash flow per share grows as planned. Holding shares in a Roth allows investors to avoid paying any taxes or capital gains as long as you don't make withdrawals until you're 59 1/2.
 Monthly payment of dividends also means the total returns will actually be better than if dividends were paid quarterly. For example, a $5,000 investment that earns 10% per year with monthly compounding ends up equally $99,187 after 30 years; the same investment with the same exact returns compounded quarterly turns into $96,791 (use this compound interest calculator to see for yourself). In conclusion, Pembina Pipeline is a solid, dividend-paying stock, which should only grow stronger following its takeover of rival Veresen. I'm expecting long-term average annual total returns of 8% to 12%, including re-invested dividends. I plan on buying more shares on future weakness. Along with Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), Magellan (NYSE:MMP) and Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD), this is one of my favorite energy stocks to own.

Pembina Pipeline Corporation
Sector Focus: Energy



Located in Calgary in Alberta, Canada, Pembina Pipeline Corporation is an energy  transportation and service provider that serves North America. When the head office outgrew its space, the company had the opportunity to significantly expand at a new location in Calgary's West Tower of Eighth Avenue Place. The company  used the move to reimagine the way it would work, making openness and collaboration its major design objectives. The move also afforded Pembina Pipeline Corporation the chance to more evenly distribute amenities between private offices and workstations, making workspaces more comfortable and versatile.
Seeking a modern aesthetic that would match Pembina's culture, the company worked with Sizeland Evans Interior Design, Inc., Knoll representative Insight Agencies and Knoll dealer Element Integrated Workplace Solutions to devise a suite of office systems that would be consistent across workstations to executive offices. For visual continuity, the team used the same finishes and components throughout: white with classic walnut veneer on worksurfaces, tables and files. Side seating like Florence Knoll Lounge Chairs and Bertoia Side Chairs were chosen for their clean, classic aesthetic, a mid-century counterpoint to clean-lined Dividends Horizon® and Generation family that support more active work.
At the workstations, the team set out to optimize employee control and ease of use, balancing the desire for an open, light-filled space with the need for individual privacy. To this end, the team used low-horizon Dividends Horizon® panels with frosted glass that would allow natural light to cross the space. Electronic sit-to-stand Universal Height Adjustable Table bases were provided for all work surfaces, enabling multiple work styles and postures. Generation by Knoll® task seating and Sapper XYZ Monitor Arms were chosen to deliver dynamic, ergonomic support.
Further recognizing the need for flexibility and the office's culture of casual collaboration, the team outfitted mobile Template® storage pedestals with cushion tops, a detail that invites guests to sit comfortably for short periods while saving space when the seat is not needed. MultiGeneration by Knoll® provided additional side seating for longer support.
A major aspect of the new design was expanding collaborative types of spaces. The team planned and designed open and closed meeting areas, huddle rooms, a kitchen and lounge area, and training room, which combine to support a mix of formal and casual meetings, as well as the community spaces to foster the planned and unplanned social encounters that can help drive new aspects of business in surprising ways.
"Our goal is for Pembina to be an employer of choice, and part of that is providing a workspace that we can all be proud of," says Jennifer Harker, Senior Manager, Facilities Management and Office Services and Corporate Secretary, Pembina Pipeline Corporation.
The design decisions have had an impact. Pembina's employees responded positively to an employee engagement survey. Asked to provide feedback about their work environment, employees described the new space as open, modern, comfortable, and with a warm atmosphere. And employee work styles and experiences have shifted now that there are more places to collaborate.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
