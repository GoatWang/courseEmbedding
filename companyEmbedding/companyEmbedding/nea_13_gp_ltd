Item 3.    Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.


On October 25, 2016, the Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Issuer (File No.333-213917) in connection with its initial public offering of 7,049,230 shares of Common Stock of the Issuer (the "IPO") was declared effective.  The closing of the IPO took place on October 31, 2016, and at such closing NEA 13 purchased an aggregate of 338,462 shares of Common Stock at the IPO price of $13.00 per share.  In addition, prior to the IPO NEA 13 purchased from the Issuer in a series of private transactions (i) 12,447,605 shares of Series A Preferred Stock ("Series A Stock"), (ii) 4,689,657 shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock ("Series B-1 Stock"), (iii) 4,362,472 shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock ("Series B-2 Stock") and (iv) a certain warrant to purchase  up to an aggregate of 80,658 shares of Common Stock (the "Warrant Shares") for an aggregate purchase price of $18,680,573.69.  Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, these shares of Series A Stock, Series B-1 Stock and Series B-2 Stock automatically converted into 3,071,388 shares of Common Stock of the Issuer.  In addition, immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, the Warrant Shares automatically exercised for such number of shares issuable pursuant to a cashless net exercise provision, resulting in the Issuer withholding 435 of the Warrant Shares to pay the exercise price and issuing to NEA 13 the remaining 80,223 shares.  NEA 13 now holds a total of 3,490,073 shares of the Issuer's Common Stock (the "NEA 13 Shares").


The working capital of NEA 13 was the source of the funds for the purchase of the NEA 13 Shares.  No part of the purchase price of the NEA 13 Shares was represented by funds or other consideration borrowed or otherwise obtained for the purpose of acquiring, holding, trading or voting the NEA 13 Shares.
 


Item 4.    Purpose of Transaction.


NEA 13 acquired the NEA 13 Shares for investment purposes.  Depending on market conditions, its continuing evaluation of the business and prospects of the Issuer and other factors, NEA 13 and other Reporting Persons may dispose of or acquire additional shares of the Issuer.  Except as set forth above, none of the Reporting Persons has any present plans which relate to or would result in:






(a)
The acquisition by any person of additional securities of the Issuer, or the disposition of securities of the Issuer;









(b)
An extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries;









(c)
A sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries;









(d)
Any change in the present board of directors or management of the Issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board;









(e)
Any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer;









(f)
Any other material change in the Issuer's business or corporate structure;









(g)
Changes in the Issuer's charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the Issuer by any person;









(h)
Causing a class of securities of the Issuer to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association;









(i)
A class of equity securities of the Issuer becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or
