About 

Tradition seeks companies with strong sustainable businesses.  These businesses will exhibit above average profitability and free cash generation and above average secular growth.  Stock purchases made at discounts to our estimate of intrinsic value, or with margins of safety, help produce strong risk-adjusted returns. Our seasoned professionals combine experience, insight, discipline and research in our investment process.  We strive for above average returns over the course of a full market cycle.  Margin of safety, preservation of capital, and positive risk-adjusted returns drive our mandates.   We believe in participating in the growth of quality companies purchased at reasonable prices.
Our experienced, knowledgeable and dedicated investment team is passionate about owning individual stocks of quality companies, and our investment results are the foundation of our efforts for clients.  We also manage fixed income both as a stand-alone or part of a balanced portfolio.  Tradition’s investment committee is comprised of highly-experienced and seasoned members, each demonstrating over a quarter century, on average, of professional investing experience.  We are a research and process driven asset manager focused on long-term performance.  Tradition works to build a portfolio of securities that meets our clients' varied needs through each of our given strategies.  Tradition is an SEC Registered Investment Adviser with a fiduciary responsibility to always put our clients' interests first.
Tradition invests our clients' capital in quality securities selling at reasonable prices.  We are not traders trying to outguess the market; rather, we are business and security analysts making an investment that, in our opinion, will provide a suitable risk-adjusted long-term return.  Our own personal investments are focused on securities that we own for clients, thus aligning our personal interests with those of our clients.  Our internal investing guidelines assure that our clients get our best investment ideas and that we, as a firm, are focused on the investments that impact clients.
We were founded in 2000 as a growth at a reasonable price investment firm and those principals of quality, profitability, growth and value continue today.  Our founders worked together at Brundage, Story and Rose (BS&R) in New York City. We are still owned exclusively by our employees.  Our Chief Investment Officer was a Partner and Director of Research at BS&R, which managed over four billion dollars, prior to the founding of Tradition in 2000.  Tradition’s team currently includes a total of five former employees of Brundage, Story and Rose, but also includes additional talented investors that increase our skills and capabilities.  Our team is experienced, knowledgeable and disciplined.  We strive for insights and opportunities to help our clients grow their capital.

Tradition manages both stock and bond portfolios as stand-alone and balanced accounts.  Within our equity portfolios, we seek companies with strong sustainable businesses.  These businesses will exhibit above average profitability and free cash generation and above average secular growth.  Stock purchases made at discounts to our estimate of intrinsic value, or with a margin of safety, help produce strong risk-adjusted returns.  Margin of safety, preservation of capital, and positive risk-adjusted returns drive our mandates.  We believe in participating in the growth of quality companies purchased at reasonable prices.  We also selectively include asset or value plays that have a catalyst—like new management, restructuring or a product launch that will improve the business and set the company on a course for quality growth going forward.
Our experienced, knowledgeable and dedicated investment team is passionate about owning individual stocks of quality companies.  We are not traders trying to outguess the market; rather, we are business and security analysts making an investment that, in our opinion, will provide a suitable risk-adjusted long-term return. Our process is focused on getting to know the business drivers: products, services, brands, assets, research pipeline, patents, networks, competitors, and supply/demand.  Estimating the value of the business and buying the stock at a discount to this estimate of intrinsic or business value.  We are a research and process driven asset manager focused on long-term performance.
Tradition claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS ®) and has verification for the performance reports detailed below.  These are available upon request.

Diversified Global Strategies
Diversified Global Strategies match a client with a diversified portfolio that meets specific goals of income, safety and capital appreciation.  Diversifying across low-correlated asset classes helps lower a Strategy’s risk at a similar expected return. While Tradition is skilled at selecting individual stocks and bonds, we outsource client capital to leading asset managers to bring the additional diversifying benefits of alternatives, global and other unique asset classes to our clients. These proven complementary investment assets diversify and improve a portfolio’s risk-adjusted expected return profile.  We recognize the benefits of including alternatives and global assets to provide a complete investment solution. Alternative assets are a broad term that generally refers to almost any asset that is not a plain vanilla stock or bond such as: Risk Arbitrage, Covered Call Strategies, Reinsurance, Alternative Lending, Distressed Debt, Real Assets, Variance Risk Harvesting, and Bond Arbitrage to name a few. Global assets allow participation in opportunities around the world whether they are stocks or bonds or in the emerging markets or developed world. The common theme to both Global and Alternative is finding assets that move at an independent, or low (un)correlated pace and direction compared to U.S. stocks and bonds.
A sound asset allocation strategy is driven by complex statistical modeling that includes expected return, expected standard deviation and a correlation matrix.  Optimizing Asset Allocation is a more complex process than simple diversification, but the goal is the same—risk reduction.  Asset allocation is the process of selecting a mix of asset classes that closely matches goals and objectives. It is based on the premise that the different asset classes have varying cycles of performance, and that by investing in multiple classes, the overall investment returns will be more stable and less susceptible to adverse movements in any one class. All investments involve some sort of risk, whether it’s market risk, interest risk, default risk, inflation risk, or liquidity risk. Asset allocation strategies seek to mitigate the risks of any one asset class through diversification and balance. Risk tolerance, cash flows, and market realities determine a Strategic Allocation and the actual Tactical Implementation. Longer investment horizons naturally reduce risk as it diminishes the negative impact on any one year. Long duration also allows a portfolio to bear increased expected risk in exchange for increased expected return as time will have the benefit of allowing patience and recovery, from any one bad year, before the capital is needed.

Investing  For  the  Knowledgeable  Investor
Tradition invests in multiple markets to generate and preserve real wealth for our clients. We believe that wealth is enhanced through the ownership of individual stocks of quality companies.  Individual stocks are tax-advantaged investments in their own right as long-term capital gains and dividends receive preferential tax treatment and capital gain taxes are deferred until the stock is sold.  We also place client capital with leading asset managers and funds to bring the additional benefits of alternatives, global, and unique asset classes.  These complementary investments diversify and improve your portfolio’s risk-adjusted expected return profile.
  
 







 
Trusted Adviser 
We are an SEC Registered Investment Adviser (RIA) with a fiduciary responsibility to always put our clients’ interests first.  We are dedicated to providing investment management and wealth strategies that are right for you. Simply put, we strive to be your trusted adviser. 
 







    
Philosophy  
Investment results are the center of our clients’ Trusted Adviser mandate.  We strive to build portfolios that will withstand turbulent markets while providing reasonable risk-adjusted returns.  A portfolio of quality individual stocks forms the foundation supplemented by diversifying (risk reducing) assets such as bonds, reinsurance, alternatives, and international investments. 
 







     
Our Process
We strive to gain your trust while building our knowledge of your goals so that we can advise on any and all of your financial issues and earn the privilege of becoming your Trusted Adviser. Meeting your current need with solutions from our broad skill set will include the application of our investment expertise as well as our advice and counsel in financial, tax, retirement, and estate planning matters. 
 

 










Investments 
Individual tax efficient stock portfolios help clients build and preserve their wealth.  We can manage this equity portfolio on a stand-alone basis or as part of a diversified total portfolio.  Your diversified portfolio could include tax-advantage municipals, alternatives, reinsurance, equities or other assets.  The portfolio is built to meet your specific needs and objectives. 
 










Diversified Strategies
Diversification across asset classes can reduce portfolio risk and can limit portfolio losses in a declining stock market.





 

Equities
Individual equities are tax-advantaged investments and are a proven avenue for growing and protecting wealth.






 

Tax-Advantaged Municipals
We buy individual municipal bonds to provide a diversifying (risk lowering) asset and to provide tax-advantaged (sometimes tax free) income.







 

Taxable Fixed Income
Individual taxable bonds provide a set return and thus stability and diversification for clients’ tax free accounts like profit sharing plans, IRAs or associated charities.






 

Alternatives, Global and Unique Assets
Assets that are not highly correlated with U.S. stocks may provide a risk reduction benefit. Their independent performance can allow for a lower-risk total portfolio.






Wealth Strategies
Your wealth strategy will be very dependent on your personal circumstances as our team helps build a strategy that fits your goals whether ranging from charitable giving and generational strategies to retirement planning and insurance.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
