How Our Technology Works


  No Magnets UsedNOTE:  We do not use any magnets in our products, only Frequency Technology!People are amazed when they discover the instant improvement in their overall strength and balance when they wear True Frequency Products “TFP” frequency/grounding products. Why is that?
The earth vibrates at a resonance of 7.83HZ, better known as the Schumann Resonance. Everything in the entire world vibrates, everything is literally vibration. This vibration of 7.83HZ is considered the natural state of everything.
True Frequency Products LLC has developed a proprietary method of imprinting this same frequency of the Earth (7.83 Hz, Schumann Resonance) into our products.  This is known as “Grounding Technology.”
Grounding Technology products work by utilizing the principle known as sympathetic resonance. Sympathetic resonance is a harmonic phenomenon wherein a vibration responds to an external vibration to which it has a harmonic likeness.  The classic example is demonstrated with two similar tuning forks, one of which is mounted on a wooden box. If the other one is struck, placed on the box, and then muted, the un-struck mounted fork will be heard.
You can verify for yourself how grounding works by standing bare footed on the wet earth and do any of the muscle tests we do and you’ll feel the same strength and energy grounded to the earth. Wearing our products will give you the same effects, 24/7.
Wearing our frequency/grounding products may help to counteract possible destructive vibrations or frequencies that come from radio waves, electro-smog, electromagnetic radiation (EMF), from cell-phones, computers and other electronic devices that surround us. Our infused frequency/grounding products accomplish this by aiding your body’s ability to overcome these harmful frequencies.
Thousands of people over a number of years have dramatically improved their balance, flexibility, strength, and overall wellness by wearing TFP products. TFP does not claim that by wearing their products you will be “healed” of anything, and we cannot guarantee your pain will instantly go away. However, many people have reported back that when they wear TFP products they discover that they help to take an edge off of their pain issues. Your general well-being could be improved as your health is stabilized on a long-term basis. TFP products may give you a new quality of life and more vitality.
Simply put, the human body recognizes its natural frequency, and those man-made frequencies no longer have any effect.  The result?  A healthier and more energetic life, and potentially a reduction or elimination of pain.
True Frequency Products offers a 100% Money-Back Guarantee and a Lifetime Warranty on the imprinted frequency/resonant technology in all of our products (click image below for more information).

50 Hz Products


Power Factor Correction Solutions
The PF Guard capacitor bank will reduce the demand on your electrical equipment, resulting in improved electrical system capacity and a more effective power supply.
 


Global Harmonic Solutions
TCI offers a wide selection of 50 Hz solutions that reduce or eliminate harmonic distortion, including passive harmonic filters and line reactors.



HGP
 



HarmonicGuard Passive 5% Passive Harmonic Filter

Performance of 5% or lower THD with loads as low as 50%
Performance of 5% or lower THD with background voltage distortion as high as 5%
True 100kA SCCR
Meets most stringent requirements of IEEE 519
Generator compatible
Internal fusing to prevent capacitor damage




 
 


HG7
 



HG7 7% Passive Harmonic Filter
			The HG7 not only limits current distortion to less than 7% THD, it also improves true power factor. Multiple package options result in the right filter configuration for the application.


 
 


KDR
 



KDR Line Reactor
			The addition of a KDR Line Reactor will limit the inrush current to the rectifier, rounding the waveform, reducing the peak currents and lowering the harmonic current distortion.



 
 

 
Global Motor Protection Solutions
The MotorShield eliminates harmful dv/dt to result in a sinewave output. The V1k dv/dt filter provides motor protection by limiting voltage spikes below 1,000 volts for long lead applications.



MotorShield
 



MotorShield Sinewave Filter
			The MotorShield filter eliminates harmful dv/dt to result in a sinewave output.


 
 


V1k
 



V1k dv/dt Motor Protection Filter
			Greatly reduces motor failures on VFD applications by limiting the magnitude of voltage spikes to levels below 1000 Volts and slowing down the rate of change of PWM switching by a factor of three or more.


 
 


KDR
 



KDR Output Line Reactor
			The addition of a KDR unit to the output of a drive will dampen overshoot peak voltage, reduce motor heating and audible noise, helping to extend the life of the motor.



 
 

 
Global High Frequency Noise Solutions
Unwanted high frequency electrical noise can cause equipment to malfunction. EMI (Electro Magnetic Interference) and RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) are two types of electrical noise.



KRF
 



Learn more about the KRF
			The KRF filters use a combination of high requency inductors and capacitors to reduce noise in the critical 150kHz to 30MHz frequency range.
