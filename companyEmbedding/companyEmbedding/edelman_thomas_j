IF you had  a large co-op on Park Avenue in one of those sprawling prewar buildings designed by Rosario Candela with the grand interior spaces, would you ever move? Many residents of Park Avenue never sell, preferring to let their apartments pass into the hands of heirs or estate lawyers after their last breath is drawn.But Thomas J. Edelman, a longtime oil industry executive and a founder and managing partner of White Deer Energy, a private equity firm specializing in energy, is an exception. He put his duplex apartment at 770 Park Avenue on the market recently for $11 million. A sad farewell, perhaps, to an 11-room apartment on the eighth floor of a building often ranked among the best in the city.There are the high ceilings, herringbone floors, intricate woodwork, a wood-burning fireplace and a gracious 14-by-17-foot entrance gallery.But, alas, all is not perfect in the building’s D-line. The 28-foot-long corner living room faces East 73rd Street rather than Park Avenue, though the listing, by John Burger of Brown Harris Stevens, notes some long views of Central Park. “Glorious light and charming city views abound,” the listing says.

Cry not for Mr. Edelman, or Mr. Candela (who died in 1953) for that matter. Last year, as the price of oil was soaring toward a record of nearly $150 a barrel, Mr. Edelman bought a bigger, and arguably better, duplex apartment just across the street, at 775 Park Avenue, another building designed by Mr. Candela.

Property records show that Mr. Edelman paid $22 million for a duplex on the sixth and seventh floors, an apartment with Park Avenue views from the 32-foot-long living room, the adjacent library and three bedrooms upstairs, a total of more than 100 feet of Park Avenue frontage.

That apartment had been the home of Frances Todman, the widow of Bill Todman, who produced classic game shows with his partner, Mark Goodson, including “Beat the Clock,” “The Price Is Right,” “To Tell the Truth” and “What’s My Line?”

Ms. Todman died in January 2008. Her co-op was listed a few weeks later with Mr. Burger for $24 million. Within 10 days it was in contract to Mr. Edelman,  and it closed in May 2008.Mr. Edelman quickly put his old apartment at 770 Park on the market for $16.75 million, while he began renovations on the new space.But when the luxury real estate market sank along with the economy later that year, the listing was pulled. When it went back on the market earlier this month, the asking price had been cut by $6 million, or more than 34 percent.

Eleanor L. Edelman, 87










 | January 19, 2012 - 11:44am 



 




	    Eleanor L. Edelman, a past board member of the East Hampton Historical Society who was dedicated to architectural preservation, died unexpectedly in her sleep at her Bronxville, N.Y., home on Jan. 7. She was 87.
	    Mrs. Edelman, who was called Elly, and her husband, Albert Edelman, who died in 2003, had been married for 53 years. They commuted between Bronxville and East Hampton, where they owned a house on Middle Lane that had been built in 1720. Mrs. Edelman also had lived in Bedford, N.Y., and New York City.
	    Eleanor Louise Weisman Edelman grew up in St. Louis, where she was born on Jan. 17, 1924, one of three daughters of Benjamin Weisman and the former Hilda Ackerman. After graduating from Mary Institute in St. Louis, she received a bachelor’s degree from Wellesley College. In 1984, after her children were grown, she returned to college for a Master of Science in Historic Preservation from Columbia University.
	    In partnership with a friend, Sophia Schachter, who also summered in this area, Mrs. Edelman formed Edelman Schachter, a firm providing research on architecturally significant houses in the New York City area. In addition to the board of the East Hampton Historical Society, she had been on the boards of the Family Consultation Service and the South Fork-Shelter Island chapter of the Nature Conservancy. She was founder and first president of the Bronxville Skating Club, the Loft Film and Theater Center of Bronxville, and the Friends of the Sarah Lawrence Library.
	    Mrs. Edelman is survived by four children: Gwen A. Edelman and Thomas J. Edelman, both of New York City, Cornelia Edelman Moss of London, and Jennifer B. Edelman of Tel Aviv. Four grandchildren also survive. Two sisters predeceased her.
	    Rabbi David Posner officiated at a service for Mrs. Edelman on Friday at Temple Emanuel in Manhattan. Burial  followed at the Independent Jewish Cemetery in Sag Harbor.
	    The family has suggested memorial donations to the Friends of the Sarah Lawrence Library, 1 Mead Way, Bronxville, N.Y. 10708, attention of Sha Fagen.
