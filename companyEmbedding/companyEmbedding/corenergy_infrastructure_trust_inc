Energy & Power Industry Focused Portfolio




Upstream — assets used in the production of energy resources such as natural gas and crude oil, including dedicated specialized pipelines, above-ground storage facilities, and water disposal facilities.

High barriers to entry due to strategically located real property assets

CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust |   Strategy














































































 





































 





Strategy
Uncomplicated Direct Investor Access to U.S. Energy Infrastructure















CorEnergy’s focus on identifying and acquiring critical infrastructure enables energy companies to benefit from the monetization of assets, while remaining operationally and commercially in control. Our Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) structure provides investors with direct access to energy infrastructure in a tax-efficient manner. Eligible assets include pipelines, storage terminals, offshore platforms, rights-of-way, and electric transmission and distribution lines.


  





Uncomplicated Direct Investor Access to U.S. Energy Infrastructure
CorEnergy’s REIT structure provides tax-efficient exposure to infrastructure for a wider range of investors than other types of infrastructure investments. REITs issue a 1099 tax form, not a burdensome K-1 form, and do not generate unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) or effectively connected income (ECI) making the investment accessible to institutional, tax exempt and non-U.S. investors.

 





Our investment approach emphasizes overall asset operational and financial performance with the potential for enhanced returns through incremental asset growth, capital appreciation and minimization of downside risk.

 


Our process involves:

Assessment of the overall energy subsector in which the asset is operated
The operating company’s specific competitive position
Asset engineering due diligence
Analysis of commodity price, supply and demand and regulatory concerns
The stability of the asset’s cash flows
The prospective operating company’s management track record
Our ability to structure an attractive investment


 
 





Asset Fundamentals

Long-lived assets critical to tenant operations
High barriers to entry with strategic locations
Contracts provide predictable revenue
Limited sensitivity to price/volume changes


 


Investment Characteristics

High cash flow component of total return
Attractive potential risk-adjusted returns
Diversification vs. other asset classes
Potential inflation protection


 



Operating Partner Characteristics
CorEnergy selects operating partners with a longstanding track record of success, measured by quantitative and qualitative achievement. Our team’s extensive experience as energy operators qualifies us to complete due diligence on each new asset acquisition: from the quality and maintenance of the physical property, to the business’s operational strategy, to the qualifications of the management team.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
