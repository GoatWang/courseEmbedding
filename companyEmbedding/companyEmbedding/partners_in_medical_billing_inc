You’ll also work faster and more safely, with e-prescribing through Surescripts® and discrete data capture for flexible, detailed clinical reporting.
Practice Partner helps your practice improve revenue with more accurate claims coding and reduce labor costs. Your staff can reduce complexity and simplify billing, with less data entry and automated payments. Dashboards provide rapid access to schedules, task lists, messages, results, overdue orders and other relevant information so nothing slips through the cracks. This integrated solution is your key to delivering exceptional care, and service, to your patients.
