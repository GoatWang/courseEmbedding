The Fund seeks capital appreciation and current income by investing in a diversified portfolio of common stocks, debt securities and money market instruments.
Fund Information for Mutual of America's Group Products (Except Defined Benefit and Pension Investment Contract), SEP and SIMPLE Contracts Separate Account No. 2 - Standard Pricing Composite FundPrincipal Investment StrategiesReturn to TopThe Fund invests a portion of its assets in equity and in fixed income (including money market) securities, where the portion in each category of securities will vary based on Mutual of America Capital Management LLC's (the "Adviser") view of current economic and market conditions.

The equity portion of the Fund is invested in stocks in the S&P 500® Index, as selected by the large cap equity manager of the Adviser. The Adviser generally invests in stocks that it considers undervalued, or to have attractive growth potential, and with the potential for investment returns that outperform their peer companies.
The fixed income portion of the Fund is invested primarily in investment-grade debt securities issued by U.S. corporations or by the U.S. Government or its agencies, including mortgage-backed securities, as managed by the fixed income and mortgage-backed securities managers of the Adviser. The Adviser evaluates each security to be purchased and selects securities based on maturity, credit quality as determined by fundamental analysis and interest income anticipated to be generated.
The money market portion of the Fund invests in debt securities with a remaining maturity of 397 calendar days or less that present minimal credit risks.Fund Information for Mutual of America's Group Products (Except Defined Benefit and Pension Investment Contract), SEP and SIMPLE Contracts Separate Account No. 2 - Standard Pricing Composite FundPrincipal Investment RisksReturn to TopAn investment in the Fund is subject to the following risks which are described in more detail in the Statutory Prospectus.

General risk: The Fund may not achieve its investment objective. An investment in the Fund could decline in value, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.
Company risk: The price of the stock of a particular company can vary based on a variety of factors, such as the company's financial performance, changes in management and product trends, and the potential for takeover and acquisition. The prices of equity securities of smaller companies may fluctuate more than for more established companies. The equity securities of smaller companies may not be traded as often as for larger companies, therefore it may be difficult to trade securities at a desirable price. Investments in companies with small market capitalizations generally offer greater opportunities for appreciation, but are associated with more risks than for established companies.
Market risk: The risk that prices of securities will go down because of the interplay of market forces may affect a single issuer, industry or sector of the economy or may affect the market as a whole.
Large Cap risk: Larger, more established companies may be unable to respond quickly to new competitive challenges and also may not be able to attain the high growth rate of successful smaller companies.
Mortgage risk: The duration of mortgage-related securities and interest rates tend to move together. As interest rates rise, the duration of mortgage-related securities extends (referred to as "extension risk") and as interest rates fall, mortgage-related securities are often prepaid at a faster rate (referred to as "pre-payment risk"). Because of interest rate changes, it is not possible to predict the realized yield or average life of a mortgage-backed security. Mortgage-backed securities issued by private corporations generally have more credit risk than securities issued by U.S. Government agencies.
Stock risk: The value of your investment will go up or down, depending on movements in the stock markets. The investment results may be better or worse than the results for the stock markets taken as a whole, or than the results of other funds that invest in the same types of securities. It may be more difficult for the Fund to sell a small capitalization stock or any stock that trades "over-the-counter," than a larger capitalization stock or stocks that trade on a national or regional stock exchange. 
Fixed Income risk: The value of your investment will go up or down depending on movements in the bond markets.

Investment management risk: The Fund's investment results may differ from the results of a comparable bond market and from the results of other funds that invest in the same types of securities or particular debt securities.
Interest rate risk: Fixed income securities have an inverse relationship to interest rates, such that as interest rates rise, bond values decrease, and the Fund faces a heightened level of interest rate risk under current conditions because interest rates are at historically low levels.
Corporate Debt risk: During periods of economic uncertainty, the value of corporate debt securities may decline relative to the value of U.S. government debt securities. Debt obligations are subject to the risk that issuers may not be able to pay off the principal and interest when due.
Credit risk: Debt obligations are generally subject to the risk that the issuer may be unable to make principal and interest payments when they are due.
Call risk: When interest rates decline, an issuer may have an option to call the securities before maturity, resulting in reduced income.
Non-investment grade debt risk: Non-investment grade debt obligations, known as "junk bonds," have a higher risk of default and tend to be less liquid than higher-rated securities.
Liquidity risk: The prices of debt securities may be subject to significant volatility, particularly as markets become less liquid due to limited dealer inventory of corporate bonds.Money Market instrument risk: Money Market instruments may decline in value, based on the performance of the issuer or changes in prevailing interest rates. The returns on money market instruments can be adversely affected when yields on eligible investments are low.

 The performance data shown represent past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and unit values will fluctuate so that units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Investment Fund total return performance currently may be lower or higher than the figures stated above.  The total return performance data are based on a hypothetical investment of $1,000, which is redeemed at the end of the periods shown. The total return figures reflect the reinvestment of investment income and capital gains and losses, and are net of expenses which include a contract fee, an expense risk fee, administrative charges, a distribution expense charge and Underlying Funds fees and expenses. The total return figures for periods extending beyond a year are average rates of return and do not reflect the Funds' actual year-to-year results, which varied over the periods shown. Contributions or withdrawals made within a period would experience different rates of return based on the unit values on the dates of such transactions.

Figures shown are past results and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. View fund expense ratios and returns.
Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Returns with sales charge for Class A shares reflect payment of the 5.75% maximum sales charge.
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus.
There may have been periods when the fund(s) lagged the index(es). Certain market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.
Funds are managed, so holdings will change.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Read details about how waivers and/or reimbursements affect the results for each fund. View results and yields without fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement

Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
The portfolio managers shown are as of the fund's most recent prospectus dated 04/07/2017.
Lipper ratings for Consistent Return reflect funds’ historical risk-adjusted returns at NAV, adjusted for volatility, relative to peers. Lipper ratings for Expense reflect funds’ expense minimization relative to peers with similar load structures. Lipper ratings for Preservation reflect funds’ historical loss avoidance relative to other funds within the same asset class. Preservation ratings are relative, rather than absolute, measures, and funds named Lipper Leaders for Preservation may still experience losses periodically; those losses may be larger for equity and mixed equity funds than for fixed income funds. Lipper ratings for Tax Efficiency reflect funds’ historical success in postponing taxable distributions relative to peers. Tax Efficiency offers no benefit to investors in tax-sheltered accounts such as 401(k) plans. Lipper ratings for Total Return reflect funds’ historical total return performance relative to peers. The Lipper ratings are subject to change every month and are based on an equal-weighted average of percentile ranks for the Total Return, Consistent Return, Preservation, Tax Efficiency and Expense metrics.
  The highest 20% of funds in each classification are named Lipper Leaders for Total Return, the next 20% receive a rating of 4, the middle 20% are rated 3, the next 20% are rated 2, and the lowest 20% are rated 1. Lipper ratings are not intended to predict future results, and Lipper does not guarantee the accuracy of this information.

Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.
Calculated by Morningstar. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by American Funds.
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Past results are not guarantee of results in future periods. Morningstar Rating is for Class A only; other classes may have different performance characteristics.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
YTD (year-to-date return): the net change in the value of the fund's shares (in percentage terms) from January 1, 2017, to the current date shown above.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
Source for Lipper expense ratio comparison: Lipper, based on front-end load funds, excluding funds of funds, for the most recent fiscal year-ends available as of 06/30/2017.
The Morningstar Ownership Zone™ provides detail about a portfolio's equity investment style by showing the range of stock sizes and styles. A portfolio's Ownership Zone™ is derived by plotting each stock in the fund's portfolio within the proprietary Morningstar Style Box™. The shaded area represents the center 75% of the fund's assets, and it provides an intuitive visual representation of the area of the market in which the fund invests. A "centroid" plot in the middle of the Ownership Zone represents the weighted average of all the fund's holdings. A fund that is concentrated will have a small ownership zone relative to the area of the style box, and broadly diversified fund will have an ownership zone that stretches across many sizes and style. Over a period of time, the shape and location of a fund's ownership zone may vary.
The SEC yield reflects the rate at which the fund is earning income on its current portfolio of securities while the distribution rate reflects the fund’s past dividends paid to shareholders. Accordingly, the fund's SEC yield and distribution rate may differ.

Terms and Definitions


Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
Historical  Short-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate.
Historical  Special Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
Morningstar rating: In an effort to classify funds by what they own, as well as by their prospectus objectives and styles, Morningstar developed Morningstar Categories. While the prospectus objective identifies a fund's investment goals based on the wording in the fund prospectus, the Morningstar Category identifies funds based on their actual investment styles as measured by their underlying portfolio holdings (portfolio and other statistics over the past three years).  
R-Squared: R-squared is a measure of the correlation between a particular fund's return and that of its benchmark index. A measure of 100 indicates that all of the fund's return can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. Calculated by Morningstar.
S&P 500: A market capitalization-weighted index based on the results of 500 widely held common stocks.
Share Class: Each share class available for a fund has different fees and expense structures, but all of the classes for a particular fund invest in the same pool of securities. 
Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.
Valuation  Price-to-Cash Flow: Price-to-cash-flow (P/C) ratio is the average price to cash flow ratio of the individual stocks within a fund.
Valuation  Price-to-Earnings Ratio: Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio takes the current price of a stock divided by its earnings per share. The ratio reflects the cost of a given stock per dollar of current annual earnings and is the most common measure of a stock's expense. The higher the P/E, the more investors are paying, and therefore the more earnings growth they are expecting.
Valuation: Price-to-book ratio compares a stock's market value to the value of total assets less total liabilities (book value). Adjusted for stock splits. Price-to-cash-flow (P/C) ratio is the average price to cash flow ratio of the individual stocks within a fund. Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio takes the current price of a stock divided by its earnings per share. The ratio reflects the cost of a given stock per dollar of current annual earnings and is the most common measure of a stock's expense. The higher the P/E, the more investors are paying, and therefore the more earnings growth they are expecting.

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
You could lose money by investing in American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. The fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will do so at any time.
  
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness.
The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds. American Funds Strategic Bond Fund may engage in frequent and active trading of its portfolio securities, which may involve correspondingly greater transaction costs, adversely affecting the fund's results.
Fund shares of U.S. Government Securities Fund are not guaranteed by the U.S. government.
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. Diversification does not eliminate the risks of investing; losses are possible in diversified portfolios. Small-company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. The value of fixed income securities may be affected by changing interest rates and changes in credit ratings of the securities. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Investments in mortgage-related securities involve additional risks, such as prepayment risk, as more fully described in the prospectus. While not directly correlated to changes in interest rates, the values of inflation-linked bonds generally fluctuate in response to changes in real interest rates and may experience greater losses than other debt securities with similar durations.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund or underlying fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus. Investment allocations for funds of funds may not achieve fund objectives. There are expenses associated with the underlying funds in addition to fund-of-funds expenses. The funds' risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds, as described herein. Each target date fund is composed of a mix of the American Funds and is subject to the risks and returns of the underlying funds. Underlying funds may be added or removed during the year. Although the target date funds are managed for investors on a projected retirement date time frame, the funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' retirement goals will be met. The target date is the year in which an investor is assumed to retire and begin taking withdrawals. American Funds investment professionals manage the target date fund's portfolio, moving it from a more growth-oriented strategy to a more income-oriented focus as the fund gets closer to its target date. Investment professionals continue to manage each fund for 30 years after it reaches its target date. The target allocations are as of January 1, 2017, and are subject to the Portfolio Oversight Committee's discretion. The funds’ investment adviser anticipates that the funds will invest their assets within a range that deviates no more than 10% above or below these allocations. Investment professionals gradually adjust the portfolio over time so that it becomes more preservation-oriented. The funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' education savings goals will be met. The target date is the year in which the beneficiary is expected to begin taking withdrawals. Investors and their advisors should periodically evaluate their investment to determine whether it continues to meet their needs. The Retirement Income Portfolio Series' investment allocations may not achieve fund objectives, and adequate income through retirement is not guaranteed. There are expenses associated with the underlying funds in addition to fund-of-funds expenses. The funds’ risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds. Payments consisting of return of capital will result in a decrease in an investor’s fund share balance. Higher rates of withdrawal and withdrawals during declining markets may result in a more rapid decrease in an investor’s fund share balance. Persistent returns of capital could ultimately result in a zero account balance.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes . Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the Application. The complete Application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch, 450 Fifth St., NW., Washington, DC 20549 (tel. (202) 942-8090).
Applicants' Representations
1. The Investment Company is a Maryland corporation that is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end management investment company. It currently has nine investment portfolios (each a “Fund”): the Equity Index Fund, All America Fund, Mid-Cap Equity Index Fund, Aggressive Equity Fund, Composite Fund, Bond Fund, Mid-Term Bond Fund, Short-Term Bond Fund and Money Market Fund. Currently, the Investment Company sells shares of the Funds to the respective separate accounts of Mutual America Life Insurance Company (“Mutual of America”) and The American Life Insurance Company of New York (“American Life”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Mutual of America, as investment vehicles for Variable Contracts issued by such companies. The Investment Company may offer additional investment portfolios in the future (each a “Future Fund”) (the current Funds and the Future Funds are collectively referred to as the “Funds”).
2. Capital Management is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and serves as the investment adviser to the Investment Company. Capital Management is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Mutual of America.
3. Mutual of America has entered into an agreement to sell American Life to an unaffiliated third party. As of the date of such sale, American Life will no longer be an affiliate of Mutual of America and the Investment Company, and the provisions of Rules 6e-2 and Start Printed Page 636486e-3(T) under the 1940 Act will no longer be available. As of such date, the Investment Company will enter into separate agreements (each a “Participation Agreement”) with Mutual of America and American Life covering the sale of Fund shares to such companies and their respective separate accounts.
4. Mutual of America, American Life and all other insurance companies which in the future may purchase shares of the Funds or of the portfolios of the Future Investment Companies through their respective separate accounts to fund Variable Contracts are together referred to as the “Participating Insurance Companies” (and individually as a “Participating Insurance Company”). Each of Mutual of America and American Life as of the date of the sale of American Life, and each of the other Participating Insurance Companies as of the date of its initial purchase of shares of the funds or of portfolios of Future Investment Companies: (a) Will have one or more separate accounts established in accordance with applicable insurance laws (“Separate Accounts”) in connection with the issuance of Variable Contracts and the obligation to satisfy all applicable requirements under both state and federal law; and (b), on behalf of its Separate Accounts, will have entered into a Participation Agreement with each of the relevant Investment Companies. Under the Participation Agreements, the Investment Companies will be obligated, among other things, to offer the shares of their portfolios to the participating Separate Accounts and to comply with any conditions that the Commission may impose upon granting the order requested herein.
5. Applicants also propose that the Investment Companies may offer and sell shares of their portfolios to Qualified Plans that are not funded through Separate Accounts. Such shares sold to Qualified Plans would be held by Plan trustees as required by Section 403(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”). To the extent permitted under applicable law, Capital Management or one of its affiliates may act as investment adviser or trustee to Qualified Plans that purchase shares of the Funds or of portfolios of Future Investment Companies.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. In connection with the funding of scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered as a unit investment trust (“UIT”) under the 1940 Act, Rule 6e-2(b)(15) provides partial exemptions from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act to the extent those sections require “pass-through” voting with respect to an underlying fund's shares. These exemptions are available only when all the assets of the  UIT are shares of management investment companies “which offer their shares exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance company.” Accordingly, the relief granted by Rule 6e-2(b)(15) is not available with respect to a scheduled premium life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to a variable annuity or flexible premium variable life insurance separate account of the same company. The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of the same life insurance company and any affiliated life insurance company is referred to as “mixed funding.”
2. The relief granted by Rule 6e-2(b)(15) also is not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of any underlying fund that also offers its shares to separate accounts funding Variable Contracts of unaffiliated life insurance companies. The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for variable annuity and/or variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated life insurance companies is referred to as “shared funding.”
3. Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) similarly provides partial exemptions from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act in connection with the funding of flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the 1940 Act as a UIT. These exemptions are available only where all the assets of the separate account are shares of one or more registered management investment companies which offer to sell their shares “exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life insurance company, offering either scheduled contracts or flexible contracts, or both; or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company.” Accordingly, Rule 6e-3(T) permits mixed funding but does not permit shared funding.
4. Neither Rule 6e-2 nor Rule 6e-3(T) contemplates that shares of an underlying portfolio funding Variable Contracts might also be sold to Qualified Plans. The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for Qualified Plans as well as for variable annuity and variable life separate accounts of affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies is referred to herein as “extended mixed and shared funding.”
5. Applicants state that changes in the federal tax law have created the opportunity for the Investment Companies to substantially increase their assets by selling shares to Qualified Plans. Section 817(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), imposes certain diversification standards on the assets underlying Variable Contracts, such as those in the Funds or the portfolios of Future Investment Companies. The Code provides that Variable Contracts will not be treated as annuity contracts or life insurance contracts, as the case may be, for any period (or any subsequent period) for which the underlying assets are not, in accordance with regulations issued by the Treasury Department (the “Regulations”), adequately diversified. On March 2, 1989, the Treasury Department issued Regulations (Treas. Reg. 1.817-5) which established specific diversification requirements for investment portfolios underlying Variable Contracts. The Regulations generally provide that, in order to meet these diversification requirements, all of the beneficial interests in such portfolios must be held by the segregated asset accounts of one or more life insurance companies. The Regulations, however, contain an exception to this requirement. This exception permits trustees of Qualified Plans to hold shares of an investment company portfolio which are also held by insurance company segregated asset accounts without adversely affecting the status of such portfolio as an adequately diversified underlying investment for Variable Contracts issued through such segregated asset accounts (Treas. Reg. 1.817-5(f)(3)(iii)). Applicants maintain that, as a result of this exception to the general diversification requirement, Qualified Plans may select the Funds or the portfolios of Future Investment Companies as investment options without endangering the tax status of the Variable Contracts issued through Participating Insurance Companies.
6. Applicants note that the Commission promulgated Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) prior to the issuance of the Regulations which permit shares of an investment company portfolio to be held by the trustee of a Start Printed Page 63649Qualified Plan without adversely affecting the holding of shares in the same portfolio by separate accounts supporting Variable Contracts. Thus, the sale of shares of the same underlying portfolio to both separate accounts and Qualified Plans was not contemplated at the time when Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) were adopted.
7. Section 9(a)(3) of the 1940 Act provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter of any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that investment adviser or principal underwriter is subject to a disqualification enumerated in sections 9(a)(1) or (2). Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(i) and (ii) and Rules 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(i) and (ii) under the 1940 Act provide exemption from Section 9(a) under certain circumstances, subject to the limitations on mixed and shared funding. These exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to those affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in the management of the underlying management company.
8. Applicants state that the relief provided by Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(ii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(ii) permits the life insurance company to serve as the underlying fund's investment adviser or principal underwriter, provided that none of the insurer's personnel who are ineligible pursuant to section 9(a) participates in the management or administration of the fund. This partial relief from the requirements of section 9 serves to  limit the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with section 9 to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of that section. Applicants state that Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) recognize that the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act do not require application of section 9(a) to individuals in a large insurance company complex, most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies within such a complex. These rules further recognize that it is unnecessary to apply section 9(a) to individuals in unaffiliated insurance companies (or their affiliated companies) that may utilize an investment company as the funding medium for Variable Contracts. In Applicants' view, no regulatory purpose is served by extending section 9(a) monitoring requirements in the context of extended mixed or shared funding. The Participating Insurance Companies and Qualified Plans are not expected to play any role in the management of the Investment Companies. The individuals who manage the Investment Companies will remain the same regardless of which Separate Accounts or Qualified Plans invest in the Investment Companies. Applicants further submit that the costs of such extended monitoring may result in increased costs for Participating Insurance Companies and Qualified Plans and may thereby adversely affect contract owners and Plan participants.
9. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii) provide exemptions from the pass-through voting requirements with respect to several significant matters. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii)(A) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A) provide that an insurance company may disregard contract owners' voting instructions which would change the sub-classification or investment objectives of an underlying fund, or any contract between such a fund and its investment adviser, when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority (subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(7)(ii)(A) of Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T)). Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii)(B) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A)(2) provide that an insurance company may disregard contract owners' voting instructions which would initiate any change in an underlying fund's investment policies, principal underwriter, or investment adviser, provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii), (b)(7)(ii)(B), and (b)(7)(ii)(C) of Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T).
10. With respect to Qualified Plans, which are not registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act, there is no requirement to pass-through voting rights to Plan participants. Indeed, applicable law expressly reserves voting rights associated with Plan assets to certain specified persons. Under section 402(a) of ERISA, mutual fund shares sold to a Qualified Plan must be held by the trustees of the Plan. Section 403(a) also provides that Plan trustees) must have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the Plan, except: (a) When the Plan expressly provides that the trustee(s) are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee, in which case the trustees are subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the Plan and not contrary to ERISA, and (b) when the authority to manage, acquire, or dispose of Plan assets is delegated to one or more investment managers pursuant to Section 402(c)(3) of ERISA. Unless one of these two exceptions applies, Plan trustees have the exclusive authority and responsibility for voting proxies.
11. When a named fiduciary to a Qualified Plan appoints an investment manager, the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held by the Plan unless the right to vote such shares is reserved to the trustees or the named fiduciary. Qualified Plans may have their trustee(s) or other fiduciaries exercise voting rights attributable to investment securities held by the Qualified Plans in their discretion. Some Qualified Plans, however, may provide for the trustee(s), an investment adviser (or advisers), or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from Plan participants.
12. Applicants state even if a Qualified Plan were to hold a controlling interest in an open-end management investment company, Applicants do not believe that such control would disadvantage other investors in such company to any greater extent than is the case when any institutional shareholder holds a majority of the voting securities in an underlying fund. In this regard, Applicants submit the investment in an underlying fund by a Plan will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by mixed funding or shared funding. Unlike mixed funding or shared funding, Plan investor voting rights cannot be frustrated by veto rights of insurers or state regulators.
13. Applicants state that shared funding by unaffiliated insurance companies does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several or all states. A particular state insurance regulatory body could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of other states in which the insurance company offers its policies. The fact that different insurers may be domiciled in different states does not create a significantly different or enlarged problem.
14. Applicants further state that shared funding by unaffiliated insurers, in this respect, is no different that the use of the same investment company as the funding vehicle for affiliated insurers, which Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) permit. Affiliated insurers may be domiciled in different states and subject to differing state law requirements. In Applicants' view, affiliation does not reduce the potential, if any exists, for differences in state regulatory requirements. Applicants submit that the conditions set forth in the Application and included in this notice are designed to safeguard against, and provide procedures for resolving, any adverse effects that differences Start Printed Page 63650among state regulatory requirements may produce. If a particular state insurance regulatory's decision conflicts with the position of a majority of other state regulators, then the affected insurer will be required to withdraw its Separate Account's investment in the Investment Companies. This requirement will be provided for in the Participation Agreements.
15. Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) give the insurance company the right to disregard the contract owners' voting instructions in certain specific circumstances. This right does not raise any issues different from those raised by the authority of state insurance administrators over separate accounts. Applicants submit that affiliation does not eliminate the potential, if any exists, for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment policies, principal underwriter or investment adviser initiated by contract owners. The potential for disagreement is limited by the requirements in Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) that the insurance company's disregard of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific good-faith determinations.
16. Applicants state that a particular insurer's disregard of voting instructions could, nevertheless, conflict with the majority of contract owners' voting instructions and with the determinations of all or some other insurers (including affiliated insurers) that contract owners' voting instructions should prevail. It could either preclude a majority vote approving a change or represent a minority view. If the insurer's judgment represented a minority position or precluded a majority vote, then the insurer might be required, at the relevant Investment Company's election, to withdraw its Separate Account's investment from the affected portfolio. No charge or penalty would be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. This requirement will be provided for in the Participation Agreements.
17. Applicants submit that there is no reason why the investment policies of an underlying fund would or should be materially different depending on whether such underlying fund funds only variable annuity contracts or only variable life insurance policies, whether flexible premium or scheduled premium policies. Each type of insurance product is designed as a long-term investment program. Applicants represent that each of the Funds and the portfolios of Future Investment Companies will be managed to attempt to achieve its investment objective or objectives, and not to favor or disfavor any particular Participating Insurance Company or type of insurance product.
18. Applicants state that no one investment strategy can be identified as appropriate to a particular insurance product. Each pool of variable annuity and variable life insurance contract owners is composed of individuals of diverse financial status, age, and insurance and investment goals. An underlying fund supporting even one type of insurance product must accommodate these diverse factors in order to attract and retain purchasers. Permitting mixed and shared funding will broaden the base of contract owners which will facilitate the establishment of additional funds serving diverse goals.
19. As noted above, section 817(h) of the Code imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of Variable Contracts held in an underlying mutual fund. The Code provides that a Variable Contract shall not be treated as an annuity contract or life insurance, as applicable, for any period (and any subsequent period) for which the investments are not, in accordance with Regulations, adequately diversified.
20. Regulations issued under section 817(h) provide that, in order to meet the statutory diversification requirements, all of the beneficial interests in the investment company must be held by the segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies. The Regulations, however, contain certain exceptions to this requirement, one of which allows shares in an underlying mutual fund to be held by the trustees of a Qualified Plan without adversely affecting the ability of such shares also to be held by separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their Variable Contracts (Treas. Reg. 1.817-5(f)(3)(iii)). The Regulations thus specifically permit “qualified pension or retirement plans” and separate accounts to invest in the same underlying fund. For this reason, Applicants have concluded that the Code, Regulations and Revenue Rulings thereunder do not present any inherent conflicts of interest.
21. Applicants note that while there are differences in the manner in which distributions from Variable Contracts and Qualified Plans are taxed, these differences will have no impact on the Investment Companies. If, at the time distributions are to be made, a Separate Account or Qualified Plan is unable to net purchase payments against distributions, each will redeem shares of the relevant underlying funds at their respective net asset values in conformity with Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act (without the imposition of any sales charge) to provide proceeds for distribution needs. A Participating Insurance Company will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of its Variable Contract, and a Qualified Plan will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
22. Applicants considered whether, and determined that it is possible, to provide an equitable means of giving voting rights to contract owners in Separate Accounts and, if necessary or desirable, to Qualified Plans. In connection with any meeting of shareholders, the Investment Companies will inform each separate Account and Qualified Plan of its respective shares of ownership in the Funds or the portfolios of Future Investment Companies. Each Participating Insurance Company will then solicit voting instructions in accordance with Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T), as applicable, and its obligations under Participation Agreements with the Investment Companies. Qualified Plans and Separate Accounts will each have the opportunity to exercise voting rights with respect to their shares in the Funds or the portfolios of Future Investment Companies, although only the Separate Accounts are required to pass-through their votes to contract owners. The voting rights provided to a Qualified Plan with respect to shares of the Funds or portfolios of Future Investment Companies would be no different from the voting rights that are provided to Qualified Plans with respect to shares of mutual funds sold to the general public. Furthermore, if a material irreconcilable conflict arose because a Qualified Plan decided to disregard Plan participants' voting instructions, if applicable, and that decision represented a minority position or precluded a majority vote, a Plan which had entered into a Participation Agreement could be required, at the election of the relevant Investment Company, to withdraw its investment in the particular Fund or portfolio of a Future Investment Company, with no charge or penalty imposed as a result of such withdrawal. 
23. Applicants also considered whether a “senior security,” as such term is defined under section 18(g) of the 1940 Act, may be created with respect to any Variable Contract owner as opposed to a participant under a Qualified Plan. Applicants concluded that the ability of the Investment Companies to sell shares of each Fund or portfolio of a Future Investment Company directly to Qualified Plans does not create a “senior security” which is defined under Section 18(g) to Start Printed Page 63651include “any stock of a class having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends.” Regardless of the rights and benefits of participants under Plans or contract owners under Variable Contracts, the Plans and the Separate Accounts only have rights with respect to their respective shares of the Funds and the portfolios of Future Investment Companies. They only can redeem such shares at net asset value. No shareholder of a Fund or of a portfolio of a Future Investment Company has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distribution of assets or payment of dividends. 
24. Applicants also considered whether there are any conflicts between contract owners of the Separate Accounts and participants under the Plans with respect to state insurance commissioners' veto powers over investment objectives. Applicants note that a basic premise of corporate democracy and shareholder voting is that not all shareholders may agree with a particular proposal. That the interests and opinions of shareholders may differ does not mean that inherent conflicts of interest exist between or among shareholders. State insurance commissioners have been given the veto power in recognition of the fact that insurance companies usually cannot simply redeem their separate accounts out of one fund and invest in another. Generally, time-consuming, complex transactions must be undertaken to accomplish such redemptions and transfers. Conversely, the trustees of Qualified Plans, or participants in participant-directed Qualified Plans, can make such decisions quickly and redeem their interests in a fund and reinvest in another funding vehicle without the regulatory impediments faced by the Separate Accounts or, as is the case with most Qualified Plans, even hold cash pending suitable investment. Applicants believe that issues where the interests of contract owners and Qualified Plans are in conflict can be almost immediately resolved since the trustees of (or participants in) the Plans can, on their own, redeem the shares out of underlying funds. 
25. Applicants also considered whether there is a potential for future conflicts of interest between Participating Insurance Companies and Qualified Plans as a result of future changes in the tax laws. Applicants do not see any greater potential for material irreconcilable conflicts between the interests of participants in Qualified Plans and contract owners of the Separate Accounts resulting from future changes in the federal tax laws than that which already exists between variable annuity contract owners and variable life insurance contract owners. 
26. Applicants state that the foregoing list, while not all inclusive, is representative of issues which Applicants believe are relevant to this Application. Applicants believe that the discussion contained in the Application demonstrates that the sale of shares of the Funds and of portfolios of Future Investment Companies to Qualified Plans does not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts of interest. Further, Applicants submit that the use of the Funds and portfolios of Future Investment Companies with respect to Qualified Plans is not substantially dissimilar from their anticipated use with respect to Variable Contracts in that both are generally long-term retirement vehicles. 
27. Applicants note that various factors have kept more insurance companies from offering Variable Contracts than currently offer them. These factors include the costs of organizing and operating a funding medium, the lack of expertise with respect to investment management (principally with respect to stock and money market investments), and the lack of public name recognition of certain insurers as investment experts with which the public feels comfortable entrusting their investment dollars. For example, some smaller life insurance companies may not find it economically feasible, or within their investment or administrative expertise, to enter the Variable Contracts business on their own. Use of investment company portfolios such as the Funds or portfolios of Future Investment Companies as common investment media for Variable Contracts would reduce or eliminate these concerns. Applicants submit that mixed and shared funding also should provide several benefits to Variable Contract owners by eliminating a significant portion of the costs of establishing and administering separate funds. Applicants maintain that Participating Insurance Companies will benefit not only from the investment and administrative expertise of the Investment Companies, but also from the cost efficiencies and investment flexibility afforded by a large pool of funds. Mixed and shared funding also would make greater amounts of assets available for investment by the Funds and the portfolios of Future Investment Companies, thereby promoting economies of scale, permitting increased safety through greater diversification, and making more feasible the addition of new Funds and portfolios. Therefore, making the Investment Companies available for mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies to offer Variable Contracts, and this should result in increased competition in both Variable Contract design and pricing and hence in more product variation and lower charges. Applicants assert that the sale of shares of the Funds and of portfolios of Future Investment Companies to Qualified Plans, in addition to Separate Accounts, should enhance these results. 
28. Applicants submit that, regardless of the type of shareholder in the Funds or portfolios of Future Investment Companies, the Investment Companies are or will be contractually and otherwise obligated to manage those Funds or portfolios solely and exclusively in accordance with their respective investment objectives, policies and restrictions as well as any guidelines established by the Board of Directors of the applicable Investment Company (the “Board”). The Investment Companies will work with pools of money and will not take into account the identities of shareholders. Thus, each of the Funds and the portfolios of Future Investment Companies will be managed in the same manner as any other mutual fund.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants have consented to the following conditions:
1. A majority of the Board of each of the Investment Companies will consist of persons who are not “interested persons” of such investment company, as defined by section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, and as modified by any applicable orders of the Commission, except that if this condition is not met by reason of the death, disqualification, or bona-fide resignation of any director or directors, then the operation of this condition will be suspended: (a) For a period of 45 days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the Board; (b) for a period of 60 days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies; or (c) for such longer period as the Commission may prescribe by order upon application.
2. The Board of each of the Investment Companies will monitor such investment company for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict among the interests of the contract owners of all Separate Accounts and the participants under Qualified Plans investing in such investment company and will determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to such conflicts. A material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a Start Printed Page 63652variety of reasons, including: (a) An action by any state insurance regulatory authority; (b) a change in applicable federal or state insurance, tax or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private letter ruling, no-action or interpretative letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax, or securities regulatory authorities; (c) an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding; (d) the manner in which the investments of such investment company are being managed; (e) a difference in voting instructions given by variable annuity contract owners, variable life insurance contract owners, and trustees of Qualified Plans; (f) a decision by a Participating Insurance Company to disregard the voting instructions of contract owners; or (g) if applicable, a decision by a Qualified Plan to disregard voting instructions of Plan participants.
3. The Participating Insurance Companies, any Qualified Plan that executes a Participation Agreement upon becoming an owner of 10 percent or more of the assets of any of the Funds or the portfolios of Future Investment Companies (a “Participating Qualified Plan”), and Capital Management or any other investment adviser to the Investment Companies (collectively, the “Participants”) will report any potential or existing conflicts to the relevant Board. Participants will be responsible for assisting the relevant board in carrying out its responsibilities under these conditions by providing the Board with all information reasonably necessary for it to consider any issues raised. This responsibility includes, but is not limited to, an obligation by each Participating Insurance Company to inform the relevant Board whenever contract owners' voting instructions are disregarded, and, if pass-through voting is applicable, an obligation by each Participating Qualified Plan to inform the relevant Board whenever such Plan has determined to disregard Plan participants' voting instructions. The responsibility to report such information and contracts, and to assist the Board, will be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies and Participating Qualified Plans under their Participation Agreements with the Investment Companies, and this responsibility will be carried out with a view only to the interests of the conflict owners or Plan participants, as applicable.
4. If it is determined by a majority of a Board, or a majority of its disinterested members, that a material irreconcilable conflict exists, then the relevant Participant will, at its expense and to the extent reasonably practicable (as determined by a majority of the disinterested directors), take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict, up to and including: (a) Withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the Separate Accounts or Participating Qualified Plans from the relevant Fund or portfolio of a Future Investment Company and reinvesting such assets in a different investment medium, including another such Fund or portfolio, or in the case of Participating Insurance Companies submitting the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected contract owners and, as appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate group (i.e., annuity contract owners or life insurance contract owners of one or more Participating Insurance Companies) that votes in favor of such segregation, or offering to the affected contract owners the option of making such a change; and (b) establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a decision by a Participating Insurance Company to disregard contract owners' voting instructions, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, then such insurer may be required, at the election of the relevant Investment Company, to withdraw such insurer's Separate Account's investment in such Investment Company, with no charge or penalty imposed as a result of such withdrawal. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a Participating Qualified Plan's decision to disregard Plan participants' voting instructions, if applicable, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, such Plan may be required, at the election of the relevant Investment Company, to withdraw its investment in the relevant Investment Company, with no charge or penalty imposed as a result of such withdrawal. The responsibilities to take remedial action in the event of a Board determination of a material irreconcilable conflict and to  bear the cost of such remedial action will be contractual obligations of all Participating Insurance Companies and Participating Qualified Plans under the Participation Agreements, and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of contract owners or Plan participants, as applicable.
For purposes of this Condition 4, a majority of the disinterested members of a Board will determine whether or not any proposed action would adequately remedy any material irreconcilable conflict, but in no event will any of the Investment Companies or their investment advisers be required to establish a new funding medium for any Variable Contract. No Participating Insurance Company will be required by this Condition 4 to establish a new funding medium for any Variable Contract if any offer to do so has been declined by vote of a majority of the contract owners materially and adversely affected by the material irreconcilable conflict. Further, no Participating Qualified Plan will be required by this Condition 4 to establish a new funding medium for such Plan if (a) a majority of the Plan participants materially and adversely affected by the material irreconcilable conflict vote to decline such offer, or (b) pursuant to documents governing the Plan, the Plan makes such decision without a vote of Plan participants.
5. A Board's determination of the existence of a material irreconcilable conflict and its implications will be made known in writing promptly to all Participants.
6. Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to all contract owners so long as the Commission continues to interpret the 1940 Act to require such pass-through voting. Accordingly, such Participants, where applicable, will vote shares of the applicable Fund or portfolio of a Future Investment Company held in their Separate Accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely received from contract owners. Participating Insurance Companies will be responsible for assuring that each of their Separate Accounts investing in a Fund or portfolio of a Future Investment Company calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent with other Participating Insurance Companies. All Participating Insurance Companies will contractually agree to calculate voting privileges as providing in this Application, pursuant to their Participation Agreements with the Investment Companies. Each Participating Insurance Company will vote shares for which it has not received timely voting instructions as well as shares it owns that are not attributable to Variable Contracts in the same proportion as it votes those shares for which it has received voting instructions. Each Participating Qualified Plan will vote as required by Start Printed Page 63653applicable law and governing Plan documents.
7. Each of the Investment Companies will comply with all provisions of the 1940 Act requiring voting by shareholders (which for these purposes shall be the persons having a voting interest in the shares of the respective Funds or portfolio of Future Investment Companies) and, in particular, will either provide for annual meetings (except insofar as the Commission interprets or may interpret section 16 of the 1940 Act not to require such meetings) or comply with section 16(c) of the  1940 Act (although the Investment Companies are not trusts of the type described in section 16(c)), as well as with section 16(a) of the 1940 Act and, if and when applicable, section 16(b) of the 1940 Act. In addition each of the Investment Companies will act in accordance with the Commission's interpretation of the requirements of section 16(a) with respect to periodic elections of directors and with such rules as the Commission may promulgate with respect thereto.
8. Each of the Investment Companies will notify all Participants that it may be appropriate to include in Separate Account or Plan prospectuses or other disclosure documents disclosure regarding potential risks of mixed and shared funding. Each of the Investment Companies will disclose in its prospectus that: (a) Shares of such investment company may be offered to insurance company separate accounts of both variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts and, if applicable, to Qualified Plans; (b) due to differences in tax treatment and other considerations, the interests of various contract owners participating in such investment company and the interests of Qualified Plans investing in such investment company, if applicable, may conflict; and (c) its Board will monitor events in order to identify the existence of any material irreconcilable conflicts and to determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to any conflict.
9. If and to the extent that Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) under the 1940 Act are amended, or proposed Rule 6e-3 under the 1940 Act is adopted, to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the 1940 Act or the rules promulgated thereunder with respect to mixed or shared funding, on terms and conditions, materially different from any exemptions granted in the order requested in this Application, then the Investment Companies and/or Participating Insurance Companies and Participating Qualified Plans, as appropriate, shall take such steps as may be necessary to comply with Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T), or Rule 6e-3, as such rules are applicable.
10. The Participants, at least annually, will submit to each relevant Board such reports, materials, or data as such Board reasonably may request so that the directors may fully carry out the obligations imposed upon the Board by the conditions set forth in the Application, and said reports, materials, and data will be submitted more frequently if deemed appropriate by such Board. The obligations of Participating Insurance Companies and Participating Qualified Plans to provide these reports, materials, and data to a Board, when it so reasonably requests, will be a contractual obligation under the Participation Agreements.
11. All reports of potential or existing conflicts received by a Board, and all Board action with regard to determining the existence of a conflict, notifying Participants of a conflict, and determining whether any proposed action adequately remedies a conflict, will be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board or other appropriate records, and such minutes or other records shall be made available to the Commission upon request.
12. None of the Investment Companies will accept a purchase order from a Qualified Plan if such purchase would make such Plan an owner of 10 percent or more of the assets of one of the Funds or the portfolios of Future Investment Companies unless such Plan executes a Participation Agreement with the relevant Investment Company that includes the conditions set forth in the Application to the extent applicable. A Plan will execute an application containing an acknowledgment of this condition at the time of its initial purchase of shares of any such Fund or portfolio.
Conclusion
For the reasons summarized above, Applicants believe that the requested exemptions, in accordance with the standards of section 6(c), are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

Product Overview












Why would you consider a Mutual of America Rollover IRA?
							If you will be retiring or leaving employment soon, you may want to transfer or "roll over" your assets from a 
							qualified retirement plan to our IRA variable annuity contract. Before rolling over funds from plans with other providers, you should 
							review the accounts you have with them to determine the fees and expenses you currently pay and whether there are any surrender charges 
							that may result and to ensure that it is in your best interest to roll over your other accounts to a Rollover IRA.
							
If you're retiring...
							If you will soon be retiring and plan to withdraw your money from your employer's pension or retirement plan, you 
							may be able to roll over your benefit to an IRA. An IRA allows you to defer federal income taxes on the rollover amount. 
							Any interest and investment earnings will also accumulate free from federal income taxes until withdrawn. Withdrawals are 
							subject to income tax at your ordinary income tax rate at the time of withdrawal, and if made prior to age 59½, a 10% 
							federal tax penalty.
						




If you're leaving your current job...
							If you're not retiring but will soon be leaving your current employer, you may be able to roll over the assets in 
							your current retirement plan to an IRA when you leave. Rolling over your retirement plan assets to an IRA allows you to 
							continue to defer federal income taxes and avoid the 10% early withdrawal penalty if under age 59½. In addition, interest 
							and investment earnings will continue to accumulate free from federal income tax until withdrawn.
							
If you want to change IRA providers...
							You can transfer from another Traditional IRA (with another provider) to Mutual of America's IRA and continue to 
							enjoy federal income tax deferral on any interest and investment earnings.
							
Direct transfers
							If you already have a Traditional IRA with another financial institution or a trustee, you may be able to make a nontaxable 
							direct transfer to a Mutual of America IRA.
							
Long-term tax advantages
							All of the interest and/or investment earnings credited to your account accumulate tax-deferred until they are withdrawn.
							
Single sum distributions
							If, instead of a direct rollover, you take a single sum distribution of your retirement assets, 20% will automatically be 
							deducted for mandatory withholding tax. If you're under age 59½, you'll also pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty and regular 
							income tax on the amount received. Provided the rollover is made within 60 days of the distribution, it will not be currently 
							taxable. Distributions not handled by means of a direct rollover to a Traditional IRA are subject to mandatory 20% federal 
							tax withholding.
							
							Learn more about Features & Benefits.
							
							Rollover IRA is a variable annuity contract and is issued on form 3814-IRA or a similar form specific to your state of 
							residence. In the states of Maine, Oregon and Utah, the variable annuity contract is issued on form IRA-2004, or a similar 
							form specific to your state of residence. This contract does not provide additional income-tax deferral advantages beyond 
							those available in an IRA. You should carefully consider an annuity contract's other features before making a decision, as 
							well as the potential for a loss of account value due to the Rollover IRA's variable investment choices.
						









		Before investing, you should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the variable annuity contract and the underlying investment funds. This and other information is contained in the
		contract prospectus or brochure and underlying funds prospectuses and summary prospectuses. 
        Please read the contract prospectus or brochure and underlying fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses carefully before investing. The contract prospectus or brochure and underlying fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses can be obtained by mail or by calling 1-800-468-3785.
         


			Mutual of America's IRAs are individual variable annuity contracts and are suitable for long-term investing, particularly for 
			retirement savings. The value of a variable annuity contract will fluctuate depending on the performance of the Separate Account 
			investment funds you choose. Upon redemption, you could receive more or less than the principal amount invested. A variable annuity 
			contract provides no additional tax-deferred treatment of benefits beyond the treatment provided to any qualified retirement plan or 
			IRA by applicable tax law. You should carefully consider a variable annuity contract’s other features before making a decision. 

			Form IRA-2004 or applicable 
			state variation.
