About







Committed to Building Success from the Ground Floor Up
We are a best-in-class owner, operator and manager of Class A office properties.
Our trophy buildings are some of the most sought after addresses in New York City, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.
Since our founding in 1978, we have been the landlord of choice for the world’s largest names in the financial, legal, professional services and media industries –
a true testament to the quality and location of our properties combined with our sterling reputation for hands-on tenant service.
As a vertically-integrated enterprise, we employ a highly experienced in-house team of commercial real estate professionals across all facets of our business, which includes asset management, leasing, acquisitions, redevelopment and financing. Our senior management team, led by Chairman, CEO and President Albert Behler, is highly regarded in the industry for its proven track record of success.
We live and breathe excellence in everything we do. We demonstrate integrity in every transaction and relationship. These values are our lifeblood, and permeate our entire organization from the top down. This is what sets us apart and allows us to maintain our dominant position in a highly competitive and dynamic industry. This is what makes us Paramount.

Capitalizing on Opportunity. Cultivating Success. Creating Value.
Our business strategy is simple and proven – focus on the best markets, own the best assets, provide superior tenant service and hire and retain the best people. This approach has defined the way we function since our inception. It is directly responsible for the success we have achieved to date, and our ability to create value for our tenants and investors over time. We believe in staying true to what we know and do best. This is our formula for sustained success.

Washington, D.C.














Class A in the Capital City
As the capital of the United States, Washington, D.C. is a gateway city that is famous throughout the world. Washington, D.C. is home to the White House, Congress and numerous international embassies. The city has a well-developed infrastructure, world-class museums and other cultural attractions and a number of highly-regarded universities. A lack of land, the high cost of construction and a strict regulatory environment lead to high barriers to new supply, while a large government presence and strong demand from tenants in a variety of industries support stability in the local office market.

Leaders in defence & security innovation.







Innovation


Paramount was formed in South Africa in 1994 with the bold goal of helping African governments better protect their countries. Today, we’re a global corporation, leading the way in global defence and aerospace innovation. We have more than 3000 employees, working with sovereign governments across across five continents and manufacturing in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
We believe that our unique, solutions-focused approach has contributed enormously to our success.  Many companies manufacture products and then take them to market. Paramount starts by assessing the security and defence challenges faced by the governments and agencies we work with. We then apply our unparalleled knowledge, wealth of experience and vast capabilities to craft world-class solutions to directly address these needs.Our competitive edge allows us to source the best products and technologies through our global network of partners and suppliers.  This makes us the unrivalled supplier of security, peacekeeping and defence packages to a variety of markets.


 


Responsible Global Citizen
The organisation is registered with several governments around the world and complies with responsible international conventions governing the global peacekeeping, defence and internal security industries. We operate within the international regulatory frameworks of the United Nations, African Union, South African government and other relevant governments throughout the world and conduct our business in an ethical and responsible manner. In addition to national and international conventions, the Paramount Group has implemented stringent internal measures and review processes to ensure that consistently high standards are applied to all our contracts and operations.Download company profile




 


Portable manufacturing
Our revolutionary portable manufacturing model allows for in-country manufacturing. This in turn facilitates the transfer of technology and skills, and the creation of local employment.
Flexible finance Solutions
We provide a wide range of funding structures, compliant with IMF and World Bank requirements, which enable clients to procure affordable, best in class equipment and services.
CHALLENGING CONVENTION
We embrace state-of-the-art technology and clean-sheet design. Through continuous innovation, we are able to develop tailor-made solutions to even the most challenging requirements.
DEFENDING THE DEFENDERS SINCE 1994

Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							Find Your Paramount Model Number						



							When you need replacement parts for your Paramount hedge trimmer, edger, or blower, the best place to start is with the model number. That way you won’t have to guess at what might or might not work with your tool when you’re browsing our parts. If you still have the owner’s manual that came with your lawn equipment, you can find the model number in the first few pages there. Otherwise, you will need to search a bit on your tool to find the information you need. 

First, check around the engine housing. Look for a metal tag that’s hidden from view to help prevent the wear and tear that lawn equipment sees on a regular basis. If you don’t see it there, check on the nameplate, the shaft, and on the back side of the tool. Depending on the model, Paramount may place the model number in any of these locations. 

Once you find the model number, just enter it above to bring up a parts diagram specific to your tool. If you’re still having trouble, don’t fret it. Just give us a call and we’ll happily help you find the model number and parts you need for your repair. 						






							Help with Your Paramount Repair						

							So you received a new carburetor for your hedge trimmers, or perhaps a new gas tank for your leaf blower. And you just can’t wait to get your equipment up and running again. But there’s one problem: you aren’t really sure where to begin. But you don’t have to worry. That’s because we do more than just help you find the parts you need for your repairs, we can help you get through your repairs too. 

First, you should check out our Repair Center. Here we post hundreds of articles on a variety of repair topics, including replacing gas tanks in blowers, cleaning carburetors, and much, much more. The articles include detailed, step-by-step descriptions, pictures, and video to ensure you never get lost during a repair again. 

If you don’t find a solution there, visit our forums. You can register in minutes, and once you do, you’ll have thousands of posts at your fingertips. You can ask the community of DIY pros a question about your repair, share some of your own advice, or just chat about the DIY culture at large. With eReplacementParts.com, you never have to get lost during a repair again!
