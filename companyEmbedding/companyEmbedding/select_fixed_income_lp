FIS will focus primarily on structured products, but will also provide access to traditional equity and debt investment securities such as convertible bonds, preferred stocks and government agency issues. Access to Merrill Lynch’s structured products will enable RIAs and IBDs to offer clients fully-integrated investment solutions that respond to a wide range of complex financial needs.






Monument, CO (PRWEB)
March 20, 2006
 Fixed Income Securities LP (FIS) announced today that it has reached an agreement with Merrill Lynch to distribute a select group of Merrill Lynch’s products to Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) and Independent Broker/Dealers (IBDs) as part of a strategic alliance. FIS will focus primarily on structured products, but will also provide access to traditional equity and debt investment securities such as convertible bonds, preferred stocks and government agency issues. 
“We are very enthusiastic about this distribution relationship,” said Scott Colyer, President and CEO of Fixed Income Securities. “We believe that the combination of FIS' distribution system and industry experience with the highly-regarded products and proven expertise of Merrill will bring considerable value to the financial marketplace as well as to the investing public. The RIAs and Registered Representatives we serve will gain access to some of Wall Street’s most prestigious products. FIS will continue to provide the service and education that our clients need to fully integrate these products into their portfolio models.”
Access to Merrill Lynch’s structured products will enable RIAs and IBDs to offer clients fully-integrated investment solutions that respond to a wide range of complex financial needs. Investment in structured products has grown dramatically in the last five years and has become an important investment option for investors. The structured products industry is the fastest growing segment of the financial services industry. In 2005 alone there was a 16% growth in the number of new issues and nearly $50 billion in new structured products were launched. Merrill Lynch has been a pioneer in the structured products arena.
Mr. Colyer added, “We see this new relationship as a significant milestone. We look forward to providing the products and services that will help RIAs and IBD Registered Representatives stay on the forefront of today’s rapidly changing investment climate.”

About this fund












Fund Manager
Perpetual Investment Management Limited













Asset Class
Cash and fixed income













Suggested Length
2 years or longer









Investment Objective
Aims to:
- provide members with income and capital stability through investment in a diversified portfolio of fixed income and floating rate investments (including mortgages)
- outperform (before fees and after tax), over rolling three-year periods, a composite benchmark (refer to PDS for more information) reflecting the underlying fund's target allocation at any time to the various asset types.
Investment Approach
The investment option combines specialist investment managers with different investment styles and philosophies. This can help reduce the volatility of the investment option by avoiding over exposure to a particular specialist investment manager.The currency exposure of international assets is monitored and hedging strategies may be implemented (using derivatives) with the aim of reducing the impact of adverse currency movements.

If so, I will return to buy many more.

Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping. Your prices are much lower than the big box stores. I am on Social Security and this discount  really helps.Thank You!

A bit more definition would be helpful                                 Overall Rating:               Would Shop Here Again:               Likelihood To Recommend:   Full ratings for this review »                Paradigmpi                           Jul 27, 2017            I really like your inks - have used your brother inks for about 10 years and have found them EXCELLENT.

Jul 27, 2017  I did not realize how bad my first replacements were when I ordered a 2nd set. I now know they are not very good or my first order was ok. I really do not know. I learned a  lesson.
