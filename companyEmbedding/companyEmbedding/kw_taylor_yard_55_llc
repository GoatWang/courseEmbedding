     45 kw to 95 kw diesel generators 
            







45kw to 95kw Diesel Generators

For small and medium-sized businesses, a 50 kw John Deere generator up to a 95 kw John Deere generator will provide reliable, clean, and affordable standby power. During a power outage due to interruption in utility service or natural forces such as windstorms and hurricanes, a business can lose considerable revenue, not to mention open itself up to security risks that might have been easily circumvented with a 60 kw John Deere generator. For a range of fully packaged, high-quality diesel generators from top manufacturers, choose General Power Limited. Our inventory includes everything from a 10 kw Mitsubishi generator to a 40 kw Cummins generator up to 2000 kw diesel generators for industry applications. In addition, we sell generator parts and accessories such as automatic voltage regulators. Quotes are available online through the website, and our staff of experts is available to answer your questions about fulfilling your power requirements. Never worry about another blackout; rely on power generation solutions from General Power Limited.

Wajam Year in Review 2012



Wajam Adds Recommendations From Your Friends Directly in Google Maps and Safari on iPhone



Wajam Integrates Social Search Results into Google Maps



Wajam Unveils New Social Search Experience for Google



Our Halloween Recruiting Video







 

One of the most promising players in social search besides Google and Microsoft. Frederic Lardinois
          


 

Wajam has created a more useful social search experience for Google than Google could. Sarah Kessler
          


 

Wajam is going beyond the desktop with social recommendations for iOS users. Kelly Clay
          


 

Wajam can mash-up social signals from all of the biggest players to give users a one-stop shop for social search. Ki Mae Heussner
          


 

The social search service Wajam has figured out a hack to insert its content on Apple’s default apps Liz Gannes
          


 

Wajam’s social search seems nonintrusive, is completely opt-in, and has one very important feature Google’s Search Plus Your World lacks: incorporated Facebook and Twitter results. Miranda Miller
          


 

Is place-based social network data useful when placed beside search results? Maybe. I like the idea a lot. Marshall Kirkpatrick
          


 

For those who like the idea of social search but not Google's approach to it, there is another way. David F. Carr
          


 

A handy tool for anyone who values the opinions of their networks. Brodie Beta
          





Serial entrepreneur Martin-Luc Archambault has found a solid niche in the online world of social searching with Montreal-based Wajam Inc. Craig Elias
          


 

Wajam's developers were right: [opinions from friends] were of far more use to us than any professional restaurant critic's review. CNET staff
          


 

What's nice about Wajam is that it can present you with search results from Facebook, Twitter and Google+ including private results if you give it the clearance to do so. Frederic Lardinois
          


 

Wajam named one of 5 Montreal startups to watch in 2012. Alain McKenna
          


 

I think these guys are getting social search better than just about everybody. Chris Crum
          


 

Wajam appears to be miles ahead of the efforts of search giants which are looking for ways to make Web searches more social. Jason Magder
