Q and A: Mitel CEO Rich McBee



Q and A: Mitel CEO Rich McBee
A wide-ranging discussion includes cloud and virtualization strategies, go-to-market, economic trends, and possible further acquisitions.


A wide-ranging discussion includes cloud and virtualization strategies, go-to-market, economic trends, and possible further acquisitions.

					In January 2011, Rich McBee became the CEO of Mitel. It seemed like an odd career choice. The stock had lost more than half its value in the past seven months. Just a few months earlier, the prior CEO was honored as CEO of the Year by the Ottawa Business Journal. The prior month (December 2010) Mitel missed its Q2 numbers, causing analysts to downgrade the stock, and Microsoft launched its competitive Lync 2010 solution. McBee would be joining the Mitel board, which included company founder and well-established entrepreneur Sir Terry Matthews as well as venture capital investors. 

McBee, a 20-year IT and telecommunications veteran, left his position as president of the Communications & Enterprise Group of Danaher Corp., where he managed revenue of more than $700 million. He had become an employee of Danaher when it acquired Tektronix in 2007. McBee had been hired into Tektronix Product Marketing and over his 15-year term had worked his way up to General Manager. 

Prior to joining the private sector, McBee was in the Air Force, having graduated from the Air Force Academy with a Bachelor of Science in 1986. He later received a Master's degree in Business Administration from the Chapman School of Business and Economics. 

Although Mitel is headquartered in Ottawa, McBee has set up shop in Dallas, and now several other executives are based out of the Texas office. He has an 18-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son who keep him mobile, including coaching youth football. He enjoys the outdoors, and McBee and his wife Alisha are both master fly anglers. 

McBee describes himself as a technology early adopter with an extensive collection of computer and electronic gadgets. He also considers himself highly competitive. When it comes to his views on the industry, our conversation went like this: 

DM: As a telecom veteran that's new to our industry, what has surprised you the most about the enterprise UC segment?
RM: One of the biggest surprises for me was how many old systems are out there. I'm a technology gadget kind of guy. I haven't counted recently but I probably have a double-digit number of personal devices on or near me at any given time, and I want to upgrade as soon as the beta is available, but for many of our customers, it takes them a long time to adopt new technology. There are always those customers who want it yesterday, but most are extremely thoughtful and realize the decision they are making, they will live with for a decade or more. 

There's a light bulb moment when you realize that our industry is not about technology. It's about what a technology investment can do to drive growth, revenue, productivity, and process improvements for a business. That's the same way Mitel runs. We look at every dollar we spend--and I'll admit we've got some museum-worthy systems in our company (not our UC!) that probably should be upgraded. But at some point good enough is good enough if it gets the job done. My litmus test for spending on new systems is--do they have customer impact, and, will they generate growth? If so, they get spending priority. It's the same for our customers. 

DM: Your first external message as CEO was that Mitel won't compete with its channel. Yet Mitel still directly sells both products and its cloud services. Also, Mitel's cloud services compete with service providers using Mitel technology. Can you clarify your go-to-market approach?
RM: I made it clear out of the gate that Mitel needed to align with our channel, and as a result we have made big changes to move the majority of our direct accounts to our channel partners. We were also clear that there would be house accounts, namely certain accounts that we sell direct to and those accounts that have complex financial leasing programs where it doesn't make sense to transition them to the channel. I make no apologies for that. That number is capped and will remain capped, and frankly I haven't heard many, if any, channels confused or complaining about our approach there. 

With respect to competing in or for the cloud, I think that's a red-herring created by the overly analytical. Everybody is seeing a portion of their business go to cloud. If you aren't thinking about it, you're going to be left behind quickly. Mitel has been a CLEC for years, which is an advantage, not a threat, for our channel. Truth is, many of our most progressive and ambitious service provider partners are actively planning or evaluating how to offer their own cloud services, powered by Mitel. That we can play both offense and defense is a huge competitive advantage for Mitel, and for our partners. 

DM: Mitel has been very aggressive with virtualization, a bit ahead of the market. It's a lot of change for an established channel network. How do you encourage your partners to keep up?
RM: Simple age-old Business 101 principle--follow the money. Mitel channel partners who lead with virtualization enjoy a greater than 20% annual growth rate in their Mitel business, more than double the industry average. Those who don't leverage virtualization are declining at the exact same rate. That's not because of anything we're doing--it's because that is what the market is looking for. 

End customers are calling the play for our partners, and they are increasingly asking about virtualization. The interesting part is that customers who give us the full drill on cloud or virtualization are as likely to go with an on-premise solution as they are to adopt a cloud solution, but they want to know how they're going to get to the cloud once they are ready to make the transition, and whether or not Mitel, and our channel, can take them there. 

When I got to Mitel, I was really surprised by the longevity of our channel--in some cases, stretching back to the founding of our company 40 years ago. We value our partners and the people we work with, and we know that a change in our business or offering has a direct impact on whether they remain in business. That's a big responsibility, so we do everything that we can to get partners up to speed and current through our certification program. 

Make no mistake about it though, to compete and win I need partners that are premise experts, cloud experts and virtualization specialists all at the same time--and our partners need that too. Doesn't matter how big or small you are--it's a hard truth for all businesses that if you're not growing, you're dying. If you're a vendor or an SMB channel, and you're not adapting to that market change, your competitors are going to send you to the wood chopper. 

DM: The industry has gone through some big revolutions: TDM to VoIP to UC, mobility, and cloud. What do you see as the next big transition?

RM: At the risk of sounding simple, simplification is the next big transition for our industry. Making what we've got really work seamlessly. The truth is as an industry, we're not there yet. 

I'm less interested in chasing theoretical technical rainbows and more interested in simplifying how customers deal in reality. We can try to predict and guess what the next big technology wave will be all we want, but the only true barometer that accurately gets it right each time is customer demand. So, we follow the customer. 

Mitel's vision is to enable our customers to communicate and collaborate, anywhere, over any medium, with the device of their choice. And we're passionate about trying to make that seamless, which is easy to say but very hard to do. Pants first, then shoes.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
