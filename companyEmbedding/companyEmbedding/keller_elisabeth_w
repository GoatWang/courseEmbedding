Discover our Purely Essential Collection

Inspired by summers spent on Elizabeth's ranch in the Sierra Nevada mountains, the Purely Essential Collection is nature at its very best. The herbal fragrances of lavender, rosemary and cucumber bring an extra element of earthiness with their infusion of California Poppy, the state flower for California. Packed with healing properties, the California Poppy is known for its ability to soothe and relax.

Hot/Cold Packs

Want Soothing relief from aches and pains?
Well so did my mother.  A number of years ago, I set about developing a warming pack to soothe her aches and pains. After a comprehensive analysis of fillings, sewing countless prototypes, and testing different materials, a design took shape for the elizabethW HOT/COLD PACK, and it really works.  The heart of the design is its zone control whereby the cotton pack is segmented into sections to allow for even distribution of heat. We use flaxseed as it has excellent temperature balance, and unlike other fillings, flaxseed is nearly 40% oil - not water that evaporates over time. Equally important, flaxseed conforms to the body so the pack nestles into the neck or wraps around knees with ease. The silk or wool outer cover is removable and the pack comes in a vinyl bag for storage.
To use, simply warm in a microwave for relief from common ailments, stress and tension. Another benefit, freeze the pack and use on sprains, swelling and bruising.
