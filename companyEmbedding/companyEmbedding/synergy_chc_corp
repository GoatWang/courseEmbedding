"We believe UrgentRx will continue to thrive as it joins Synergy's expanding product portfolio while leveraging the momentum of the platform and multiple economies of scale it provides," said Jordan Eisenberg, CEO of UrgentRx. "This is a tremendous opportunity for UrgentRx to continue to be consumers' best choice for fast, convenient relief. I am thrilled to join Jack Ross and the Synergy Management Team. I believe we have a real opportunity to build a world-class consumer healthcare business bolstered by the most exciting and innovative brands in the industry." 
"We are pleased to add another unique offering to our portfolio; it is consistent with the company's strategy to grow by further acquisition. We are deliberately seeking to generate shareholder value through the addition of products that help improve the lives of customers while leveraging our existing distribution relationships. We will continue to be active on the acquisition trail," said Jack Ross, President and CEO of Synergy. 
About UrgentRx UrgentRx produces a line of fast-acting, portable OTC medications that provide right now relief for today's busy, on-the-go consumer. UrgentRx® Fast Powders™ are innovative, fast-acting flavored powder medications in patented credit card-sized packets. They can be taken without water, providing immediate relief for a wide variety of everyday ailments, whenever and wherever they strike. UrgentRx produces medications to treat allergy attacks, headaches, aches and pains, heartburn, and upset stomach, as well as a heart attack first aid that has helped save multiple lives. 
UrgentRx is successfully disrupting and bringing much-needed innovation to the OTC category by offering products that fit contemporary consumers' lifestyles. Answering these consumers' unmet needs, UrgentRx is rapidly becoming the "go-to" brand for on-the-go relief. The line is sold in over 35,000 stores nationwide, including many leading national food, drug, mass, convenience and travel retailers. Notably, UrgentRx pioneered the use of "found space" displays that take advantage of previously-unutilized space at checkout.
The company was originally funded by Sam Zell, David Bonderman, Herb Simon, Academy Award-winning actress Hilary Swank, worldwide talent agency WME, as well as multiple family offices. UrgentRx has been featured on national talkshows The Doctors, Ellen and The View and has received coverage in The New York Times, Entrepreneur, Fortune, CNN, The Wall Street Journal, CNBC and Forbes. In 2015, UrgentRx won the prestigious Inc5000 and was ranked as the 168th fastest-growing company in America.
Based in Denver, Colorado, UrgentRx was founded by two-time Goldman Sachs "Most Intriguing Entrepreneur" Jordan Eisenberg.
CREO Capital Securities, LLC was the investment bank for UrgentRx and its shareholders in this transaction. Joel Montminy, President & CEO of CREO said "The Synergy team adeptly analyzed and efficiently closed on this highly complementary combination. Under their watch, we believe UrgentRx will achieve exciting performance in the years ahead."

Neuragen® reduces the spontaneous firing of damaged peripheral nerves. By calming these firings at the source, Neuragen® is clinically shown to reduce shooting and burning pains quickly and without the side effects of orally taken medications. This is in part due to the small lipophilic molecules found in Neuragen® which rapidly carry the active ingredients through the rough outer layer of the skin to the site of the pain. Neuragen is available over the counter in most local pharmacies either in the diabetic section or the analgesic (pain) section. www.neuragen.comForward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
