Abstract
            Production of corn masa-based products is flourishing in the United States, as is the generation of masa processing waste. Masa by-products have potential for value-added utilization, an option which could produce less pollution in the environment and economic benefits for masa processors. Physical and nutritional properties of these byproducts are needed for the proper design of processing operations and by-product applications, but information concerning masa byproducts is not currently available. Thus the objective of this study was to fully characterize typical masa by-product streams. The masa by-products studied had moisture contents between 88.15% and 89.29% (w.b.), water activity values between 0.999 and 1.000, densities between 1030.85 and 1047.32 kg/m3 , yield stress values between 1440.04 and 1618.08 N/m2 , pH values between 6.17 and 6.30, Hunter L values between 35.15 and 49.13, a values between 0.27 and 0.98, and b values between 6.85 and 9.38. Drying curves were developed to predict drying behavior. The dried by-products had protein contents between 4.76% and 4.90% (d.b.), crude fat contents from 0.74% to 5.76% (d.b.), ash contents between 17.41% and 19.09% (d.b.), and carbohydrate contents from 71.93% to 75.41% (d.b.), which was due primarily to fiber, with hemicellulose levels of 20.82% to 24.06% (d.b.) and cellulose between 30.55% and 31.83% (d.b.). Dry masa by-products also consisted of 4.68% (d.b.) calcium. Therefore, dehydrated masa by-products seem very suitable for use as livestock feed additives.

Title: Autumn StreamArtist: Kurt ShafferProduct Type: Canvas ArtSize: 12" x 19"Made in the USA.Kurt Shaffer has been a self-taught photographer since age thirteen.  He continues to learn the fine art of photography, especially in this fantastic digital age.  Though Kurt does not manipulate his fine art photography, digital enhancement is a valuable tool in his business.  He states that if he were to change anything in his work it would be to make it look more like the original photo.  Kurt's love of the earth feeds his photographic creativity and he defines it as his truest form of therapy.  When photographing people, capturing the nature in his subjects is what Kurt strives to do.This 12" x 19" canvas art is ready to hang.  Giclee (jee-clay) is an advanced printmaking process for creating high quality fine art reproductions.  The attainable excellence that Giclee printmaking affords makes the reproduction virtually indistinguishable from the original piece.  The result is wide acceptance of Giclee by galleries, museums, and private collectors.  Gallery wrap is a method of stretching an artist's canvas so that the canvas wraps around the sides and is secured to a hidden, wooden frame.  This method of stretching and preparing a canvas allows for a frameless presentation of the finished print.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreArea RugsArea rugs provide both functional and stylistic value to a bedroom. They protect your floor from wear and tear (and your feet from a cold floor!), as well as enhance a room’s personality with the various colors, patterns, textures, shapes and sizes that area rugs come in.  When choosing a  bedroom rug, take the following rule of thumb into consideration: Extend the carpet 12-18 inches around the bed. For a king or queen bed, the rug should extend 18 inches out from the sides; for a twin or a full bed, it should extend at least 12 inches out. Depending on the size of the room there can be more extension around the bed, but most definitely not less, as that would make the room look imbalanced and cover the entirety of the rug design with the bed. A few other things to consider — what is your lifestyle like? Do you have pets or children? A white carpet might not be the best alternative in this case, and a sturdier, long-lasting material like wool or jute should be considered. What is your decor style? Make sure you choose a rug that complements and enhances your current aesthetic. How easy is it to clean? Consider if your rug will need to be dry cleaned or if standard vacuuming and carpet cleaning will suffice. Pillows & ThrowsAdding decorative pillows and throw blankets to a bedroom is one of the easiest and most effective ways to enhance your  decor. However, before you start your hunt for the perfect pillow and throw blanket assemblage, consider your current bedroom design. If you have a neutral color palette of soft grays and whites, a few brightly colored pillows or blankets will provide energetic pops of color. If you already have a colorful home, throwing in some subtler shades and patterns might be exactly what you need to complement your style and put the focal point on your polychromatic decor. In general, you should place two to six decorative pillows on your bed. This will be enough to add a new element of style and color, but not so much that you’ll have to spend 20 minutes removing pillows before you go to sleep. Throw blankets can be great arranged at the end of your bed, showcasing their texture and pattern, or elegantly draped over an armchair, ready to snuggle up with.Table LampsTable lamps are one of those great decor items with a dual purpose — they are a complementary accent to your home while providing much-needed light. When choosing lamps, consider this design rule: You should not be able to see the neck of the light bulb, or bulb socket, from a standing or seated position. If you can see it, the lamp is likely too tall for your room and will cause glare for anyone standing or sitting in your bedroom (most likely you!). However, if you find a tall base that you just have to have, get a larger lamp shade to cover the bulb and you’re all set! Tall lamps definitely contribute to an elegant ambience and elevate your room design to new heights (literally). If you want mood lighting or just a more decorative piece, utilize an opaque shade; if you’re an avid reader or need more light in your room, use a translucent lampshade that distributes light throughout the space. Wall Decor & MirrorsThe decor in your  bedroom should be reflective of this space’s purpose - your bedroom is your refuge, your retreat from the real world, and it should make you feel happy, content and inspired. Put up items that create a sense of peace; if you have any specific pictures or pieces that make you happy or remind you of fun times, these are great to include in your design. If you have a large piece of wall art to hang, put it in a place where it can be a focal point and won’t be overshadowed by clutter or other decor.  Hanging and placing mirrors throughout your bedroom will reflect light and make it look larger, as well as provide you ample opportunity to check out your outfit before work.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreMix and match wall decorations for a custom look.Who’s to say novelty signs, mixed-media art and metal wall art don’t belong on the same surface? The key to getting your personalized style right is to pick the pieces that you can’t live without, regardless of their medium or composition. Drawings, paintings, prints and posters have just as much of a right to be together as peanut butter and jelly. That’s not to say that a collection of coordinating photographs can’t look just as stunning, but it’s ultimately your preference that matters.Think beyond the typical home wall decor.Framed photos and pretty pictures are nice, but they aren’t your only option when it comes to decorating bare walls. Consider hanging up a unique rug or an intricate tapestry instead; these are not only visually appealing but add a textural element to your space. Have lots of trinkets and collectibles to display? Mount some attractive wall shelves and arrange them as you see fit. If you don’t want to poke holes through your drywall, try putting up some wallpaper or wall decals, which provide plenty of pizzazz on their own.Browse our wall decor section to find products you’ll love.

Nothing livens up a room like a colorful or meaningful  poster. Though these large works of art may bring to mind days of yore when our teenage bedrooms were plastered with teenybopper and TV show memorabilia, posters have grown up with us. Not to worry; you can still find fun and youthful vintage and movie posters, but canvas prints can have a more adult tone, too. More

Abstract
The objective of this project was to develop value-added disposal/reuse alternatives for corn masa processing residues (i.e., waste, or byproduct, slurries). To accomplish this, the project was divided into four distinct phases. The first phase entailed identification and quantification of relevant physical and nutritional properties of typical corn masa processing residues. As a result, these byproducts appear suitable for use as livestock feed additives, or components thereof. These byproducts are very high in moisture content, but dried, they are high in fiber, and would probably be best suited for ruminant diets. Additionally, when dried, these products have a substantial calcium content, so there may exist potential for use as a calcium source for livestock rations. The second phase encompassed blending and extruding corn masa processing byproducts with soybean meal on a laboratory-scale, and investigating the effects of blend ratio, extrusion temperature, and extruder screw speed on extrusion processing variables and final extrudate product physical and nutritional characteristics. The third phase entailed blending and extruding corn masa processing byproducts with soybean meal on a pilot-scale, and investigating the effects of blend ratio, extrusion temperature, and extruder screw speed on extrusion processing variables and final extrudate product physical and nutritional characteristics. Extrusion processing during these stages produced extrudates with nutritional properties similar to the raw ingredient blends, excellent durability, and little product expansion. The final phase of the project encompassed development of a computer model to assess the economics of various disposal and recycling alternatives for corn masa processing byproducts. It was determined that, under the current economic climate, direct shipping of the raw byproduct slurry is the most economical disposal option for masa processing residues.

														After my conversation with Kurt Streams last week 08-28-2006, Low and behold, a refund check arrived 10-05-2006 via USPS, not express mail as requested, but still arrived none the less. I'm off to Bank of America to cash it directly since the refund account is with them.

Quantity:









Commercial beer brewing in Seattle can be traced back to 1864, when in the small, unincorporated town of under 1,000 people the first brewery opened and began manufacturing porter and cream ales. Over the next 50 years, innovation and entrepreneurship would take Seattle brewed beer to extraordinary heights. By the eve of Prohibition, powered by its popular Rainier Beer, the Seattle Brewing and Malting Company was the largest industrial institution in the state of Washington and the sixth-largest brewery in the world. Prohibition would wipe out the industry in 1916, but by 1933, new faces such as Emil Sick would emerge and bring Seattle back to the forefront of the brewing world. Images of America: Brewing in Seattle is the first book completely dedicated to the rich history of beer in Seattle and showcases just about every single brewery of this great city, from the mid-1800s to the recent craft-brewery boom. It offers a rare glimpse of photographs, advertisements, and comments from some of the innovators who helped shape Seattle into the beer lovers paradise it is today. —AMAZON
