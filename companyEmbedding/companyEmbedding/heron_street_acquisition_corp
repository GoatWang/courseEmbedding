Heron Therapeutics Announces Second Quarter 2015 Financial Results And Recent Corporate Progress






Business Wire




Aug 7, 2015 8:00 AM EDT













 


















































  Results of Operations   As of June 30, 2015, Heron had approximately $171.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $72.7 million as of December 31, 2014. The net increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the June 2015 public offering noted above, partially offset by net cash used in operating activities.  Heron's net cash used for operating activities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 was $15.8 million and $35.5 million, respectively, compared to net cash used for operating activities of $12.5 million and $28.2 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2014. Based on current operating plans and projections, Heron believes that its current cash and working capital are sufficient to fund operations through 2016.  Heron's net loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 was $23.1 million and $43.7 million, or $0.74 per share and $1.45 per share, respectively, compared to a net loss of $19.0 million and $36.5 million, or $0.78 per share and $1.52 per share, respectively, for the same periods in 2014.  The increases in net cash used for operating activities and net loss in 2015 as compared to 2014 were primarily due to clinical and manufacturing costs related to our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies for HTX-011, as well as costs associated with the development of HTX-019.  About Heron Therapeutics, Inc.  Heron Therapeutics, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on improving the lives of patients by developing best-in-class medicines that address major unmet medical needs. Heron is developing novel, patient-focused solutions that apply its innovative science and technologies to already-approved pharmacological agents. Heron's goal is to build on therapeutics with well-known pharmacology by improving their tolerability and efficacy as well as broadening their potential field of use. Heron is currently developing four pharmaceutical products for patients suffering from cancer or pain. SUSTOL Â® (granisetron) Injection, extended release, is being developed for the prevention of both acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). CINV is one of the most debilitating side effects of chemotherapy and is a leading cause of premature discontinuation of cancer treatment. Heron recently reported positive, top-line results from its Phase 3 MAGIC study and resubmitted its New Drug Application (NDA) for SUSTOL to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2015. HTX-019, also being developed for the prevention of CINV, has the potential to become the first polysorbate 80-free, intravenous formulation of aprepitant, a neurokinin-1 (NK 1) receptor antagonist. Heron intends to file an NDA for HTX-019 using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in the second half of 2016. HTX-011, Heron's long-acting formulation of the local anesthetic bupivacaine in a fixed-dose combination with the anti-inflammatory meloxicam, is currently being evaluated in two Phase 2 clinical trials for the prevention of post-operative pain. Heron expects to report results from both of these trials in the second half of 2015. HTX-003, a long-acting formulation of buprenorphine, is being developed for the management of chronic pain and opioid addiction. All of Heron's product candidates utilize Heron's innovative science and technology platforms, including its proprietary Biochronomer Â® drug delivery technology, which can deliver therapeutic levels of a wide range of otherwise short-acting pharmacological agents over a period of days to weeks with a single injection.  For more information, visit www.herontx.com.  Forward Looking Statements  This news release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Heron cautions readers that forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those associated with: the acceptance of the Company's resubmission of its New Drug Application (NDA) for SUSTOL, whether the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the SUSTOL NDA as submitted or supports as broad of a labeled indication for SUSTOL as requested, the progress in the research and development of HTX-019, HTX-011, HTX-003 and our other programs, including the timing of preclinical, clinical, and manufacturing activities, safety and efficacy results from our studies that may not justify the pursuit of further development of our product candidates, the launch and acceptance of SUSTOL and new products generally, our ability to raise additional capital to fund future initiatives, if necessary, or to pursue additional business opportunities, strategic business alliances we may pursue or the potential acquisition of products or technologies, and our ability to grow our organization to sustain the commercial launch for SUSTOL, and other risks and uncertainties identified in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

PAREXEL International Announces Acquisition of HERON Group LTD, a Leading Commercialization Consultancy
Boston, MA, April 30, 2013 â PAREXEL International Corporation (Nasdaq: PRXL), a global clinical research organization, announced that today the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of the HERON Group LTD (âHERONâ), a life sciences consultancy which provides evidence-based commercialization services to support biopharmaceutical companies throughout the lifecycle of their products.Â  HERON has expertise and methodologies spanning a wide range of services, including strategic market access planning, systematic reviews, economic modeling and evaluation, pricing, reimbursement strategies, global value dossier writing, and engagement with Health Technology Assessment authorities.Â  HERON was founded in 1999 and works with more than 50 biopharmaceutical and life sciences companies globally.Â  With headquarters in Luton, United Kingdom, and additional offices in India, Sweden, and the United States, HERON employs approximately 140 individuals.Â  Prior to the sale, HERON was privately owned.Â  The purchase price was approximately $24 million (which was adjusted at closing to reflect HERONâs cash, indebtedness, and working capital balances at closing), plus the possibility of an additional $14.2 million over twenty-six months if specific financial targets for HERON are achieved.Â  The acquisition was funded through use of existing cash.Â Â 
Josef von Rickenbach, Chairman and CEO of PAREXEL stated, âGiven the highly competitive and constantly changing global healthcare landscape, demonstrating product value and cost effectiveness to public and private payers requires rigorous data analysis.Â  The acquisition of HERON further strengthens our ability to offer our clients a full spectrum of services that aid in developing products with reimbursement and market access in mind.Â  Over the past thirteen years, HERON has built one of the largest independent evidence-based consultancies, and has achieved a market leadership position. We are pleased to be able to expand the expertise of our commercialization offering and believe that HERON will help to enhance the portfolio of services that we provide through our PAREXEL Consulting and Medical Communications Services business.â
John Kerrigan, one of the founders of HERON and the new Corporate Vice President and Worldwide Head of HERON at PAREXEL stated, "HERON is excited to be joining PAREXEL to provide enhanced commercialization services. Â Combining with PAREXEL will provide us the ability to introduce HERON services earlier in the product development process, and to leverage PAREXELâs broad global presence.Â  As the healthcare environment evolves, we look forward to continued innovation in the use of evidence to support commercial decisions."

      Liz Heron, 



       a veteran journalist and social media editor, has joined the Huffington Post as its new executive editor. Ms. Heron spent the past 18 months at 





            Facebook

        FB 1.18%


       as the companyâs head of news partnerships. Prior to that role, she logged stints at both The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times in prominent social media positions. At the Huffington Post, Ms. Heron will effectively serve as editor-in-chief Arianna Huffingtonâs second-in-command. Her responsibilities will include oversight of both editorial strategy and audience development. Ms. Huffington said sheâs been searching for an executive editor for several months, and started talking to Ms. Heron roughly two months ago.

The plan is to have Ms. Heron and Ms. Huffington jointly steer the Huffington Post further toward embracing the âdistributed contentâ philosophy being evangelized by the likes of BuzzFeedâthat is, the strategy of publishing unique content on social media platforms. They still plan to maintain the Huffington Postâs distinctive brand and core audience, Ms. Huffington said. âWeâve been expediting this transition to distributed content,â said Ms. Huffington. âAnd weâre a huge destination site still...with a very identified brand.â Just prior to Ms. Heronâs arrival at Facebook, the company had launched Facebook Paper, a standalone news reading application that never really took off. But since then, Facebookâs importance to the digital publishing businessâand its power to spread contentâhas only grown.  During Ms. Heronâs tenure the company introduced Facebook Instant Articles, which lets media companies publish content directly to Facebook usersâ feeds. Ms. Huffington said Ms. Heronâs experience working on that product provided her insight into Web publishing business models that will be crucial in her new role. âSheâs been a driver of this transformation that is happening at all media companies,â Ms. Huffington said.
