The nForce2 chipset was released by Nvidia in July 2002 as a refresh to the original nForce product offering. The nForce2 chipset was a platform for motherboards supporting AMD's Socket A CPUs along with DDR SDRAM. There were variations of the chipset including one with and one without an integrated GeForce4 MX graphics processor (IGP).

The nForce2 features two different southbridges, the MCP and the MCP-T. The two differ only in audio and Ethernet integration. The latter is equipped with two 100 Mbit Ethernet NICs (nV and 3Com 3C905) and the impressive NVAPU (SoundStorm) with hardware accelerated 3D audio and real-time 5.1-channel Dolby Digital encoding whereas the first features one 100 Mbit NIC and an AC'97 audio controller. For audio, both MCP units were connected to an external codec chip, such as a Realtek ALC650. With the MCP, this codec provided all software-driven audio duties, while with the MCP-T it performed the DAC duties. Unfortunately, the external codec and unavoidably noisy motherboard circuitry (EMI/RFI) were detrimental to audio quality on even the MCP-T equipped boards, and as a result the nForce audio solutions were never of high fidelity unless the S/PDIF output (TOSLINK or coaxial) was used.
The nForce2 chipset was remarkable for its advanced memory controller. It introduced a dual-channel memory interface to the mainstream market, doubling theoretical bandwidth. This was deemed necessary for the nForce2 IGP, with its GeForce4 MX-class integrated graphics, to be performance competitive budget solution. It was also important not to divert bandwidth, by sharing memory bandwidth with the most powerful IGP produced for Socket A, from the rest of the system. The Athlon's EV6 system bus was incapable of saturating the second channel, as this bus between the CPU and the north bridge was limited to the Athlon, AthlonXP, Duron, and early Sempron design to use a single 64 bit DDR channel. As a result, the second 64bit memory channel between the north bridge and the memory was almost exclusively available for the GPU. In dual-channel configurations of the nForce2 without IGP, the Athlon XP only showed gains of 5% at most in memory bandwidth intensive applications. Comparatively, in dual-channel configurations with IGP graphics, performance was demonstrably equivalent to dedicated GeForce 2 MX cards employing 64bit DDR memory or 128bit SDR memory.
Among various fixes and refinements compared to the original nForce, nForce2 featured a fixed PCI/AGP clock, i.e. PCI and AGP frequencies will not change when changing the FSB. As a result, the nForce2 platform was known for its ease in overclocking AMD processors, and was a favorite for years with the overclocking community. It was also known that the chipset gave best performance with FSB and memory running synchronized, asynchronous operation delivered an unusual high performance loss.
Refresh[edit]
In 2003, Nvidia released a refreshed nForce2, called "nForce2 Ultra 400". The nForce2 Ultra 400 and nForce2 400 represented official support for a 200 MHz FSB and PC-3200 DDR SDRAM, whereas the older nForce2 had only supported a maximum of 166 MHz FSB. Ultra 400 offered dual-channel support, while the plain 400 was single-channel PC-3200-capable. Both performed very similarly because neither had the IGP and again Athlon XP did not benefit significantly from the added bandwidth because the Athlon XP's bus was only capable of bandwidth matching a single channel of PC-3200. The new chipset again was partnered with several different southbridges, including one with (MCP-T) and one without (MCP) SoundStorm and dual Ethernet NICs. In 2004 three new southbridges were introduced: MCP-S integrated Serial ATA, MCP-RAID had additional RAID-functions and MCP-Gb featured Gigabit Ethernet. These newer southbridges did not integrate the SoundStorm unit nor the dual-Ethernet capabilities of the MCP-T.
SoundStorm[edit]
Main article: SoundStorm
The SoundStorm audio system was one of the first consumer computer audio products to offer real time Dolby Digital 5.1 encoding. This meant that one could play games or music and output them as a 5.1 stream digitally to an external decoding speaker system. This solves a common problem with most digital sound solutions of having to hook up both digital and analog connections at the same time so you can have surround sound in both games (using the analog connections) and movies (using the digital connection). Only recently has Dolby Digital live allowed competitors such as Creative's x-fi line up to offer real time DD 5.1 encoding.
Some see the passing of SoundStorm as a classic example of the bottom dollar approach to building computers sweeping the PC industry, with component quality being gradually eroded, in favor of pricing considerations. SoundStorm was good competition for Creative Labs during its time, but did suffer from driver issues and performance problems. Many computer owners also had their own discrete audio solutions, such as the popular Creative Audigy series, the VIA Envy24, or various Turtle Beach boards, among other high end solutions offering superior analog quality. This made the NVAPU/SoundStorm a niche product in a market where keeping board costs low is essential to sales volume.
SoundStorm/NVAPU's existence was a direct result of Xbox development, with the APU being directly related to the technology used in Microsoft's console. As the technology aged and consumers and OEMs showed a lack of interest in purchasing the more expensive but higher quality chipsets, Nvidia did not see reason to justify further R&D expenditures.

Page 7




CUSIP No. M6185R101

The Ashton Shares were acquired by IGP DILP for cash pursuant to a share purchase agreement between IGP DILP and Mr. Robert B.

Item 6.
Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer





After acquiring the Purchased Shares, the Reporting Persons beneficially own approximately 24.8% of the Company’s issued and outstanding share capital.


On September 29, 2016, the Reporting Persons and the Company, signed a securities  purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3, pursuant to which the Company, subject to the contingencies discussed below, will issue and sell to IGP DILP 261,287 Ordinary Shares, representing approximately 5% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company on a fully diluted basis on the date hereof, at a price per share of $5.25, or approximately US $1.37 million in the aggregate, in a private placement (the “Investment”) in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement.


In order for IGP DILP to purchase the 261,287 Ordinary Shares from the Company pursuant to the Investment and thereby own, in the aggregate, taking into account the acquisition of the Purchased Shares, Ordinary Shares conveying in excess of 25% of the outstanding voting rights in the Company, approval of the Investment will be required from the Company’s shareholders pursuant to the requirements of the Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999 (“Israeli Companies Law”). There can be no assurance, however, that the Company’s shareholders will approve the Investment.


Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, so long as IGP DILP continues to hold a specified percentage of the Company’s issued and outstanding share capital, the Reporting Persons will be entitled to nominate (and replace or remove, if applicable) up to two (2) members of the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”), out of a total of no more than nine (9) Board members (including statutory external directors elected pursuant to the Israeli Companies Law requirements). The current Board consists of six (6) members, and a proposal to increase their number to nine (9) will be brought before the Company’s general shareholders meeting for approval as described below.  If the proposal to increase the number of Board members to nine is not approved by the shareholders of the Company, the Company will secure for the Reporting Persons the right to appoint, remove or replace only one member of the Board and one non-voting observer.


The Reporting Persons will also be entitled to certain information rights.




In addition to the Purchase Agreement, the Company and IGP DILP will enter into a Registration Rights Agreement pursuant to which IGP DILP will be entitled to certain demand and “piggyback” registration rights for the resale of its Ordinary Shares.
 

In order to support the Company’s undertaking to provide the above-described Board nomination rights, the Company has obtained signed voting undertakings from certain existing Company shareholders holding just under 25%, in the aggregate, of the outstanding Ordinary Shares of the Company. Forms of these voting undertakings are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.4 and 99.5.  Pursuant to the voting undertakings, these shareholders have agreed to vote their Ordinary Shares in accordance with the Reporting Persons’ directions as related to those Board representation rights.

CUSIP No. M6185R101
 
Consummation of the Investment is subject to customary closing conditions, as well as the approval of the Investment and related matters by the Company’s shareholders. In order to achieve that shareholder approval, the Company will be publishing notice of, and distributing to its shareholders proxy materials with respect to the above referenced shareholder meeting, in the near future.

                    We began here...
                













Our

VISION

 
                            





                         
                    

                        To create an enhanced gifting ecosystem and provide a one-stop solution to make gifting an informed, hassle-free & delightful experience.
                    

                         
                    







Our

MISSION

 
                            





                         
                    

While the IGP team embarks on a 100 missions every day, there are 4 key elements which are central to every endeavor we take. These are:

Use technology as a key lever to drive a step change in consumer experience as well as their long term behavior in our category
Be master curators to ensure that our customers genuinely find something of value every time they visit us
Create enhanced gifting specific logistics & backend solutions to provide our customers with a ‘wow’ experience on the last (and the most crucial) mile
Be thought leaders in personalization to provide our customers with that much-needed personal touch in all the gifts they send & receive



                         
                    







Our

ETHOS

 
                            





                         
                    

Ethos, by definition, means the underlying sentiment that forms the basis of beliefs, customs & practices of a group or a society. In other words, it is the underlying principle that we apply in all our actions & decision making. Ethos is what brings coherence in our actions as a group & helps us take tough decisions with better clarity. It helps us avoid confusion. It is the yard stick that not only helps us find our way but also measure our progress.
So what is (are) our Ethos?
We took a year to think about it. Not because we are dumb, but we wanted to get our DNA right, we wanted to get our market right; we wanted to get our approach right. And finally we found salvation in 3 simple (and often much talked about) words.
Innovative
 It’s much easier said than done. Innovation doesn’t necessarily mean invention, as most of us naïve souls believe. Innovation is simply about doing things better & more efficiently. Innovation is about new simpler solutions to same old complex problems. All of us really need to be “innovative” in our approach to every problem/task that we handle every day – doesn’t matter how big or small – behind every giant leap, there are a 1000 small innovations.
Agile
We live in a really dense forest, where only the fittest & the scariest survive. Today, the only constant thing in this world is “change”. If you cannot adapt, cannot think on your feet, cannot pull out a feather from your cap, and cannot do all of this quickly enough, you will not survive. You might be a dinosaur today, but it’s the agile & clever fox, that will have the last laugh 5 million years from now.
Consumer-centric
So you are innovative, you are agile, but remember, you are not doing this for yourself; you are doing all this for our end consumer. If he/she doesn’t benefit, none of it matters! We got limited time, money, energy & ideas – so let’s put our money where the mouth is.
Innovative. Agile. Consumer-centric. – that’s our Ethos.
Everything we think, we do, we focus on, is guided by these 3 simple words. In other words, we drive innovation in everything you do; we do it quickly; and we focus on consumers.


                         
                    





Who we are
not ?





(We are not)
Wordsmiths

We dream, we discuss, we try – we don’t bullshit! We don’t throw jargons without even knowing their spellings in the first place. We are not the poster boys, we are not the next big unicorn, we are not Steve Jobs, we are not hyper-XYZ. We are just entrepreneurs who understand their consumers!



(We are not)
Dry Cleaners

We don’t dry-clean unwanted laundry. We only focus on tech products which cater to established, deep-rooted and real-world problems – and when we identify such a product, we don’t dry clean it. We rinse it, wash it, dry it, iron it, pack it up nicely and then only ship it to the consumer.



(We are not)
Gold Diggers

We strive to create Value, not Valuation – valuation will follow. We prioritize for 5 years, not for the next round of funding. Our consumers determine our products and our products determine our investors, not the other way round. We don’t treasure hunt!








                        It's really the people that make IGP the kind of company it is. We hire
                        people who are smart and determined, and we favour ability over
                        experience. Although people at IGP share common goal and visions for the
                        company, we hail from all walks of life.
                    



























the
people
we like






Game Changers
If you are not into the obvious or are overly complex and prototypical, but are dynamic, dream-doer & can think on your feet, then IGP is the place to be.




Owners
We stand for accountability, fluidity & ownership. We like people who love to own what they do.




Auto Pilots
Micro management is not our cup of tea. We like individuals who are confident, smart & self-reliant.




Time Masters
You get the freedom to set your own schedule. However, we live in perennial rush – time is always less & deliverables are always more. And we don’t compromise on quality. We like people who are masters of time management.




Hustlers
We envision, we plan, we hustle. We like people who do whatever it takes to get work done. For us, the means to an end doesn’t matter in the end – what matters is the end itself.




Trend Setters
We are a team who is always one step ahead. We like inventive, flexible, up-to- date and inquisitive individuals, who fit into the ethos of the company.










why
work
with us?






Amazing Peers
There is never a dull moment, not even when you are at your workstation! A brilliant journey with likeminded, motivated & dedicated individuals is what sets our company apart.




Fun @ work
We believe in the balance between work & fun. We work hard & party harder.




Pronto growth
The work, people & environment are going to push you to become the best version of yourself. You will face challenges, limitations & criticism but it would only make you maximize your potential.




Result oriented
IGP holds a results oriented culture & inculcates this value in each employee. We are high on diversity and employees who bring a wide mix of skills & experiences to the table are cherished.




We care
We understand the significance of proper mentorship, guidance & understanding that goes into making a professional. We provide you with learning opportunities to improve your skills & help you enhance your career.










work
ethics
@ IGP






Be your own manager
Discuss your targets, set your schedule, keep everyone in the loop, and run with it. As long as you reach the finish line ahead of everyone else in the market, we wouldn’t care how you got there. We like people who are mature, self-driven and are in it for themselves & not because others are pushing them.




Take what you will
If you are of the breed that believes in ‘More is Less’ and can do justice to it, be our guest, grab & take what you will. Like any other early stage company, we always have a lot more work & a lot less resources. We always welcome fast-trackers who can multi-task. But know your limits. We value quality over quantity.




You are the only limiting factor
We have well defined departments, well defined roles, well defined targets, BUT all communication is fluid, all information is accessible, and all management is reachable. Its only you who limits your exposure. If you ask right questions, someone somewhere will reply and you will learn something new. Do that for a couple of years & you would have learnt a whole lot more than a lot of your peers in the industry.










Key Functions
@ IGP







                         
                    



The technology team is currently driving the biggest transition in the history of IGP. At the front end, IGP has moved from a static e-commerce website to a Smart Gift Discovery Platform. While the new UI/UX seamlessly incorporates a responsive material design, the new APIs reside on a highly evolved information architecture powered by machine learning. At the backend, IGP is moving from an old school monolithic architecture to the more sophisticated & scalable service oriented architecture, allowing the team to build different products & services in languages which fit them the best. So in essence, the tech team is pushing IGP for a massive leap, where Customer will be at the center, technology will have no limitations & IGP will front-run the next paradigm shift in gifting (and possibly online buying experience in general).
The Next Big Thing:

Sophisticated chat bots for customer care
Real-time preview & edits for personalization of 3D objects (gift items)
Guided Search & NLP based bots to enhance discovery
A multi-feature gifting App incorporating evites, event calendar, video messages, co-gifting, etc













The Product Managers at IGP are the architects behind everything that requires building. From the front-end website features, to the backend analytics, to the admin panels, to the third party solutions (for vendors etc), this team builds it all. Apart from the internal stake holders & their product requirements, this team is also responsible to oversee the entire journey of the consumer on the website & beyond (post purchase). They mine tones of data, ideate on 100s of features & make a 1000 tweaks every month to continuously keep on enhancing user flow & improve overall customer experience. These guys are both the initiators & gatekeepers for what gets built by IGP.
The Next Big Thing:

Super smart & significantly enhanced administrative panels for various functions such as operations, inventory & SKU management, customer care, etc
Several first of its kind features on website, such as real-time preview of personalized products, multi-delivery checkout, Contextual add-on suggestions, customized gift boxes, personalize-all feature, VAS, etc
A multi-feature gifting App incorporating evites, event calendar, video messages, co-gifting, etc







                         
                    





                         
                    



Operations at IGP is challenging to say the least. While the world has focused on a single problem of faster domestic deliveries, IGP has to focus on a much bigger task of providing a specific date delivery & in many cases a specific time delivery across the globe … for all 90+ countries that we service. And as if this was not enough, we have all kinds of dispatch types – warehouse based, vendor based, RDC based – and all kinds of product types – fragile, perishable, regular. To top it all, the order flow surges many folds during festivals, peaking at well over 10,000 orders a day. The operations team manages all this and much more. So if you have hots for real problems on the ground, this team is your calling.
The Next Big Thing:

Regional Distribution Centers (RDCs) to provide same day delivery & VAS in major cities
International warehouses to reduce lead times in major international countries (IGP already has a warehouse in US)
Enhanced demand prediction model to optimize inventory distribution across warehouses & improve delivery quality
A real time map-based delivery tracker for the sender for last mile tracking of the delivery













IGP is a massive design house. We are after all in an aspirational category. This team works on various designs and imagery aspects which our business demands. This team manages several in-house studios to ensure that our customers get to see product images which are state-of-the-art, inspirational, informative & accurate. This team also works round the clock to create more & more personalization related design templates (40,000+), so that our customers not only get to personalize the gifts they are buying but they get to do that like a pro. In addition, this team is also responsible for every creative (3000+), every icon (500+), every interaction (300+), every button, every last visual that you see on our website. And they are killing it! 
The Next Big Thing:

A proprietary state-of-the-art design guide
A repository of internally created stylized images for making proprietary creatives
Largest collection of design templates for personalization







                         
                    





                         
                    



They say, you put your money where the mouth is. Well, this is the mouth where all the money goes. But contrary to the general opinion, marketing is not about money, it’s about ideas, growth hack, analytics, communication & consistency. This team is responsible for all digital marketing, all media channels, BTL activities, content, brand messaging, customer communication, strategic tie-ups and PR. In terms of numbers, this team manages rankings of over 25,000 keywords, efficacy of over 500 campaigns, brand messaging & marketing communication on over 20 channels, and several large & exclusive strategic tie-ups.
The Next Big Thing:

Emerge as the exclusive gifting partner for most corporates & retailers
Personalized communication with our customers & creation of their social graphs
Build awareness around gifting & become a trend setter in our segment













All that we do, we do for our customers. And customer service acts as the acid test of our efforts. At the end of the day, it is this team which is the face of the company. It is this team with socializes with our customers, hand holds them through their buying journey on IGP and helps them with any issues they may face. This team not only handles customer grievances, but also proactively reminds our loyal customers across the globe of upcoming occasions, changing gifting trends & our new services & products.
The Next Big Thing:

Become everyone’s personal gifting advisor through enhanced CRM & customer intelligence
Create a zero tolerance buying experience
Emerge as a gifting concierge for repeat customers

Siegfried Sassoon is a significant and famous war poet from the Great War. War poet was a description he did not particularly like.
As an officer in World War I, he was wounded and lauded twice with medals for bravery. His poetry—at times violent, always truthful—used forceful, realistic verse to express his conviction of the stupid brutality and waste of war.
We have produced Siegfried's poems here in ePub3 fixed layout and reflowable formats to give everyone on any device the opportunity to read this amazing poetry. It is also available in PDF formats from the blog post here.

Famous Paintings (Fixed Layout)





Focus: Sophisticated ePub3 Fixed Layout navigation and content interaction. Optimized for 16:9/16:10 aspect ratio monitors.
Famous paintings is a small (but beautiful) demonstration fixed layout book. It's purpose is to demonstrate how ePub3 fixed layout image-centric books can be designed to deliver new content engagement experiences. It uses fixed layout to break paper metaphors with digital content reading.
It will work on all ePub3 readers but because it uses asymmetrical page layout and spine linear properties will not display as intended on reading systems with a partial or inflexible implementation of the fixed layout specification.

Don Quijote (Reflowable)





A Spanish novel by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra. It follows the adventures of Alonso Quijano, a hidalgo who reads so many chivalric novels that he decides to set out to revive chivalry, under the name Don Quixote. He recruits a simple farmer, Sancho Panza, as his squire, who often employs a unique, earthly wit in dealing with Don Quixote's rhetorical orations on antiquated knighthood.
Don Quixote is met by the world as it is, initiating such themes as intertextuality, realism, metatheatre, and literary representation.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
