Post-Operative Pain Market Overview
Based upon statistics from the National Center for Health Statistics, it is estimated that there are over 100 million surgeries performed in the United States each year. Of these surgeries, we believe at least 50 million procedures, as referenced by the National Center for Health Statistics require post-operative pain medication. While opioids are generally considered the most effective treatment for post-operative pain, they raise serious concerns due to addiction, illicit use, respiratory depression and other side effects, including constipation, nausea, vomiting and intolerance. Due to their addictive potential, opioids are regulated as controlled substances and are listed on Schedule II and III by the DEA. As a result of these side effects, pain sufferers or their treating physicians, tend to limit their use of opioids, resulting in as many as 40% of post-operative patients reporting inadequate pain relief. This reduces the quality of life for individuals and creates an economic burden estimated to be at least $560 to $635 billion a year in medical costs and lost productivity.
According to a January 2016 article in the New England Journal of Medicine, overdose deaths from prescription painkillers (defined to mean opioid or narcotic pain relievers) has increased significantly over the past 14 years. It notes the following trends:

Prescription painkiller overdoses killed 18,893 people in the United States in 2014;
In 2014, about 10.3 million Americans (age 12 or older) reported nonmedical use of prescription painkillers in the past year; and
Emergency department visits involved with misusing or abusing prescription opioid painkillers increased 153% between 2004 and 2011.

We believe that injectable Meloxicam offers an attractive alternative for pain relief without the risks associated with opioids. Accordingly, we believe that physicians and third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, are highly interested in new non-opioid pain therapies that provide effective pain relief without the adverse issues associated with opioids.

Recro Pharma Acquires Novel Neuromuscular Blocking Agents


 Download as PDF

July 05, 2017

Transaction strengthens Recro’s portfolio of acute care pain products.
MALVERN, PA, July [5] 2017 – Recro Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq:REPH), a revenue generating specialty pharmaceutical company focused on therapeutics for hospital and other acute care settings, today announced the acquisition of exclusive global rights to two novel neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBs) and a proprietary chemical reversal agent from Cornell University. The assets include one novel intermediate-acting neuromuscular blocking agent that has completed Phase I trials, one short-acting neuromuscular blocking agent, as well as a rapid-acting reversal agent proprietary to these compounds. The novel neuromuscular blocking agents acquired through this agreement permit a very rapid induction of neuromuscular blockade at the onset of use and the novel reversal agent will provide for more rapid reversal of the neuromuscular blockade. These novel agents may meaningfully reduce the patient’s post-procedure time in the operating room or post-acute care unit and could provide valuable cost savings to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers.
“We look forward to working with Recro Pharma Inc. to commercialize a series of proprietary neuromuscular blocking agents that may benefit  patients and the medical community,” said Dr. Brian Kelly, the Director of Cornell’s Center for Technology Licensing at Cornell University.
“This transaction strengthens our portfolio with the addition of several novel compounds, which have the potential to be significant contributors within the surgical anesthesia space and complement our existing pipeline of hospital/acute care pain products,” said Gerri Henwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Recro Pharma. “As we continue to advance our lead pipeline candidate, IV meloxicam, for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, toward an NDA filing in early third quarter of 2017, we see value in building our in-hospital product portfolio and believe that we can leverage our expertise in the field to efficiently develop these differentiated agents. The  development effort for these agents was anticipated in our planned pipeline spend through 2018.”
Under the terms of the agreement, Recro Pharma will pay Cornell a six figure initial up-front fee. Cornell is entitled to receive additional milestone payments in the millions per each acquired candidate upon the achievement of certain US and EU regulatory approval and commercial milestones, as well as additional net sales milestone payments and royalties, in each case, related to the acquired agents.
About Recro Pharma, Inc.
Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company’s Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company’s lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor.  IV meloxicam has successfully completed four Phase II clinical trials in the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain and two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, as well as a large double blind Phase III safety trial and other safety studies.  As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company’s CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

					Full Description



Recro Pharma, Inc., incorporated on November 15, 2007, is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in developing products for hospitals and ambulatory care settings that is developing non-opioid products for treatment of serious acute pain. The Company's lead product candidate is an injectable form of meloxicam. The Company's product candidates for pain indications include injectable meloxicam, a product candidate in development for the treatment of acute post-operative pain; Dex-IN, a product candidate under development for the treatment of post-operative pain; Dex-SL, a product candidate for the treatment of chronic pain, and Fadolmidine (Fado), a product candidate used by injection into the spine for pain associated with surgery or certain types of chronic pain and which the Company pursues as a topical product for local application to treat serious pain associated with nerve damage to local tissues (neuropathies), especially of the lower extremities, which can occur in diabetic patients. The Company's manufacturing and development capabilities include formulation through process development, scale-up and full-scale commercial manufacturing and specialized capabilities for the development and manufacturing of controlled substances.MeloxicamThe Company's Meloxicam is a long-acting, preferential COX-2 inhibitor that possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities, which are believed to be related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) and subsequent reduction in prostaglandin biosynthesis. Meloxicam has been marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as an oral agent, Mobic. Mobic tablets and suspension are indicated for the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and the relief of the signs and symptoms of pauciarticular or polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in patients over two years. Meloxicam has a slow onset of action orally. The oral form has a prolonged absorption time, with the time of maximum observed plasma concentration, or tmax, being approximately 5-6 hours following oral administration, which is consistent with its poor aqueous solubility. Its injectable form of the drug, which utilizes NanoCrystal technology, provides a faster onset of action of meloxicam, thus providing a rapid and sustained treatment of acute pain via the Intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) administration routes. Meloxicam has completed multiple Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of moderate to severe pain.DexmedetomidineThe Company's Dex is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that has demonstrated sedative, analgesic and anxiolytic properties. The Dex effect on alpha-2 sub receptors differs from clonodine, resulting in lower propensity to lower blood pressure. In its clinical trials completed to-date, the Company has observed some hypotensive activity on hypotension. Dex has demonstrated a safe intravenous use in acute and surgical settings, utilizing its sedative properties. The Company has formulated Dex at a lower dose (perhaps as low as 1/10th for its intranasal product) than the recommended IV dosage levels. The Company's Dex has completed Phase II trials.FadolmidineThe Company's second compound under development, Fado, also belongs to the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist receptor class. Fado is similar to Dex and different from clonidine in that it is a full agonist of all subtypes of alpha-2 adrenoreceptor. Fado does not cross the blood brain barrier and this accounts for the targeting of Fado use for either IT administration for pain or anesthesia, or potentially for topical use to treat pain associated with regional nerve pain from underlying nerve damage, also called neuropathies. Various preclinical models of pain have been employed and have demonstrated Fado's potential as an analgesic, including its potential for use in neuropathies and post-operative pain. The safety and efficacy of Fado had been assessed in one Phase I study and in one Phase II study.The Company competes with Johnson & Johnson, Purdue Pharma, L.P., Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Mallinckrodt plc, Depomed, Inc., Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Catalent, Inc., Patheon Holdings Cooperatief U.A., Adare Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Mayne Pharma Group Limited.

Recro Pharma, Inc. Key Developments

Recro Pharma, Inc. Enters into a Master Manufacturing Services Agreement with Patheon UK Limited
Jul 20 17
On July 14, 2017, Recro Pharma, Inc. entered into a Master Manufacturing Services Agreement (the Master Agreement) and a related Product Agreement (the Product Agreement, and together with the Master Agreement, the Agreements) with Patheon UK Limited (Patheon), each effective as of July 14, 2017. The Master Agreement governs the general terms under which Patheon, or one of its affiliates, will provide manufacturing services to the Company for the drug products specified by the Company from time to time. The Product Agreement relates specifically to manufacturing services for injectable meloxicam. Under the terms of the Product Agreement, Recro will supply bulk injectable meloxicam formulation to Patheon for sterile fill-finish at Patheon's Monza, Italy manufacturing site. The Company has agreed to purchase from Patheon a certain percentage of its annual requirements in a specified territory of any drug manufactured under the Master Agreement, however the Company is not required to purchase any minimum quantities of injectable meloxicam or any other drug product under the Agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreements, the Company has granted to Patheon a non-exclusive license to its intellectual property solely for the purpose of enabling Patheon to perform the manufacturing services under the Agreements. The Agreements expire on December 31, 2020 and will automatically renew thereafter for successive two-year periods unless terminated by either party upon prior written notice. The Company may terminate each Agreement upon prior notice if (i) a governmental authority prevents the Company from importing, exporting, purchasing or selling the underlying product, (ii) the underlying product is discontinued in the market or (iii) Patheon fails to timely deliver batches of the underlying product (injectable meloxicam in the case of the Product Agreement). Patheon may terminate the Master Agreement or the Product Agreement if the Company assigns any rights thereunder to a Patheon competitor or to a non-credit worthy substitute. Either party may also terminate each Agreement for material, uncured breaches or in the event of the other party's bankruptcy.

MALVERN, Pa., July  21, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Recro Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq:REPH), a revenue generating specialty pharmaceutical company focused on therapeutics for hospital and other acute care settings, today announced the expansion of its team through the appointment of four new employees in the areas of finance, regulatory affairs and acute care marketing.
These four hires are part of Recro Pharma’s preparation for the upcoming filing of a New Drug Application (NDA) and supply chain team for intravenous (IV) meloxicam 30mg for the treatment of acute postoperative pain. Inducement Equity Award In connection with the hiring of these personnel, the Compensation Committee of Recro Pharma’s Board of Directors approved inducement stock option grants to purchase an aggregate of 47,500 shares of Recro Pharma’s common stock and inducement restricted stock units covering 6,000 shares of Recro Pharma’s common stock. The equity awards were granted pursuant to the NASDAQ inducement grant exception as a component of each individual’s employment compensation and were granted as an inducement material to his or her acceptance of employment with Recro Pharma in accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). Option awards were granted on July 10 and 19, 2017. Each of those awards will have an exercise price equal to the closing price of Recro Pharma's common stock on the respective grant date. The options have a ten year term and vest in equal monthly installments over four years. Restricted stock units were granted on July 10 and 19, 2017. The restricted stock units vest annually over four years. The equity awards are subject to each individual’s continued service with Recro Pharma through the applicable vesting dates. About Recro Pharma, Inc. Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company’s Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company’s lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor.  IV meloxicam has successfully completed four Phase II clinical trials in the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain and two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, as well as a large double blind Phase III safety trial and other safety studies.  As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company’s CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements reflect Recro's expectations about its future performance and opportunities that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. When used herein, the words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "upcoming," "plan," "target", "intend" and "expect" and similar expressions, as they relate to Recro or its management, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward looking statements are based on information available to Recro as of the date of this press release and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause Recro’s performance to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. Recro assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause Recro’s actual performance to materially differ from those expressed in the forward-looking statements set forth in this press release include, without limitation: results and timing of the clinical trials of injectable meloxicam, the preparation and filing of other portions of the drug application, including CMC, the ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of injectable meloxicam and, and the labeling under any such approval, regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries; the Company’s ability to achieve its financial goals, including financial guidance; the Company’s ability to raise future financing for continued development and the payment of milestones; the Company’s ability to pay its debt; customer product performance and ordering patterns, the performance of third-party suppliers and manufacturers; the Company’s ability to obtain, maintain and successfully enforce adequate patent and other intellectual property protection; and the successful commercialization of injectable meloxicam. In addition, the forward looking statements in this press release should be considered together with the risks and uncertainties that may affect Recro’s business and future results included in Recro’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov. Recro assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements. CONTACT:

 Recro Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:REPH) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive AgreementItem 1.01
Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement 
On July14, 2017, Recro Pharma, Inc., through its subsidiary Recro Ireland Limited (collectively, the “Company”) entered into a Master Manufacturing Services Agreement (the “Master Agreement”) and a related Product Agreement (the “Product Agreement,” and together with the Master Agreement, the “Agreements”) with Patheon UK Limited (“Patheon”), each effective as of July14, 2017. The Master Agreement governs the general terms under which Patheon, or one of its affiliates, will provide manufacturing services to the Company for the drug products specified by the Company from time to time. The Product Agreement relates specifically to manufacturing services for injectable meloxicam. 
Under the terms of the Product Agreement, Recro will supply bulk injectable meloxicam formulation to Patheon for sterile fill-finish at Patheon’s Monza, Italy manufacturing site. The Company has agreed to purchase from Patheon a certain percentage of its annual requirements in a specified territory of any drug manufactured under the Master Agreement, however the Company is not required to purchase any minimum quantities of injectable meloxicam or any other drug product under the Agreements. to the terms of the Agreements, the Company has granted to Patheon a non-exclusive license to its intellectual property solely for the purpose of enabling Patheon to perform the manufacturing services under the Agreements. 
The Agreements expire on December31, 2020 and will automatically renew thereafter for successive two-year periods unless terminated by either party upon prior written notice. The Company may terminate each Agreement upon prior notice if (i)a governmental authority prevents the Company from importing, exporting, purchasing or selling the underlying product, (ii)the underlying product is discontinued in the market or (iii)Patheon fails to timely deliver batches of the underlying product (injectable meloxicam in the case of the Product Agreement). Patheon may terminate the Master Agreement or the Product Agreement if the Company assigns any rights thereunder to a Patheon competitor or to a non-credit worthy substitute. Either party may also terminate each Agreement for material, uncured breaches or in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy. 
The Agreements contain customary representations, warranties, mutual indemnities, limitations of liability and confidentiality provisions. 
The foregoing description of the Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Agreements, copies of which the Company intends to file as exhibits to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September30, 2017. 
 About Recro Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:REPH) Recro Pharma, Inc. is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in developing products for hospitals and ambulatory care settings that is developing non-opioid products for treatment of serious acute pain. The Company’s lead product candidate is an injectable form of meloxicam.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Recro Pharma Acquires Novel Neuromuscular Blocking Agents
Transaction strengthens Recro’s portfolio of acute care pain products.



















July 05, 2017 08:00 ET

 | Source: Recro Pharma, Inc.






MALVERN, Pa., July  05, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Recro Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq:REPH), a revenue generating specialty pharmaceutical company focused on therapeutics for hospital and other acute care settings, today announced the acquisition of exclusive global rights to two novel neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBs) and a proprietary chemical reversal agent from Cornell University. The assets include one novel intermediate-acting neuromuscular blocking agent that has completed Phase I trials, one short-acting neuromuscular blocking agent, as well as a rapid-acting reversal agent proprietary to these compounds. The novel neuromuscular blocking agents acquired through this agreement permit a very rapid induction of neuromuscular blockade at the onset of use and the novel reversal agent will provide for more rapid reversal of the neuromuscular blockade. These novel agents may meaningfully reduce the patient’s post-procedure time in the operating room or post-acute care unit and could provide valuable cost savings to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers. “Cornell University is pleased to have licensed a series of proprietary neuromuscular blocking drugs to Recro Pharma Inc. and we look forward to working with them to commercialize this much needed technology for the benefit of patients and the medical community,” said Dr. Brian Kelly, the Director of Cornell’s Center for Technology Licensing at Cornell University. “This transaction strengthens our portfolio with the addition of several novel compounds, which have the potential to be significant contributors within the surgical anesthesia space and complement our existing pipeline of hospital/acute care pain products,” said Gerri Henwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Recro Pharma. “As we continue to advance our lead pipeline candidate, IV meloxicam, for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, toward an NDA filing in early third quarter of 2017, we see value in building our in-hospital product portfolio and believe that we can leverage our expertise in the field to efficiently develop these differentiated agents. The development effort for these agents was anticipated in our planned pipeline spend through 2018.” Under the terms of the agreement, Recro Pharma will pay Cornell a six figure initial up-front fee. Cornell is entitled to receive additional milestone payments in the millions per each acquired candidate upon the achievement of certain US and EU regulatory approval and commercial milestones, as well as additional net sales milestone payments and royalties, in each case, related to the acquired agents. About Recro Pharma, Inc. Recro is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located at the Company’s Gainesville facility. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company’s lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor.  IV meloxicam has successfully completed four Phase II clinical trials in the management of moderate to severe post-operative pain and two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials in patients following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries, as well as a large double blind Phase III safety trial and other safety studies.  As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company’s CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.

Company Overview


Recro Pharma (NASDAQ: REPH) is a revenue generating specialty pharmaceutical company developing multiple non-opioid therapeutics for the treatment of acute post operative pain. Recro Pharma is currently developing IV/IM Meloxicam, a proprietary, Phase III-ready, rapid-onset, long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor, and Dex-IN, a proprietary intranasal formulation of dexmedetomidine in Phase II, both for the treatment of acute post operative pain. As Recro Pharma's product candidates are not in the opioid class of drugs, the Company believes its candidates would avoid many of the side effects associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, such as addiction, constipation and respiratory distress while maintaining analgesic effect.
Recro Pharma owns and operates an 97,000 square foot, DEA-licensed facility that manufactures five commercial products that are commercialized by partners and receives royalties associated with the sales of these products.
