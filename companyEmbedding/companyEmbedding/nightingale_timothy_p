Description

    

For use in the Office Applications course or for individuals who would like to master Microsoft Excel 2013

Make Microsoft Office, Your Office

The Your Office series teaches readers the way Microsoft Office works in the real world, not just in a classroom.

With Your Office, readers will learn to use Office to make decisions and solve problems in a business context. Your Office bridges the gap between skill and application, and empowers students to master Office 2013 as a tool to solve problems and make decisions.

    Modular Structure Promotes Concept Retention: Provides a strong foundation for readers to practice in each workshop and then synthesize the objectives covered over two workshops—effectively challenging students to really retain what they learned as opposed to learning, and then forgetting soon after.
    Case Progression Promotes Concept Mastery: Readers progress from learning the skills in each Office Application to using the applications as tools to make business decisions.
    Realistic Series Scenario Provides Business Context: Readers gain a solid understanding of how an organization works as they see how individuals in all facets of a business interact with tools like Microsoft Office and use information to make decisions.
    Engaging Features Help Students Make Microsoft Office Their Own: Videos, Visual Summaries, and Real-World Advice boxes are among the features that help readers master Office to make decisions and solve problems in a business contex

DetailsSynopsisYour Officeis ideal for introductory computer courses on Microsoft Office 2010 or courses in computer concepts with a lab component for Microsoft Office 2010 applications. Your Officeis the Office Applications textbook written for instructors who want more than a âskill & drillâ book that enables students to learn discreet tasks but fails to illustrate the big picture of how these skills work together. Your Officebridges the gap between skill and application, and empowers students to master Office 2010 as a tool to solve problems and make decisions. The casesprogress students from learning the skills in each Office Application to using the applications as tools to make business decisions. The unique modular structureprovides a strong foundation for students through practice in each workshop and then synthesizes the objectives covered over two workshops, challenging students to really retain what they learned as opposed to learning and then forgetting soon after. The series scenariointroduces a large global business (the resort and spa) made up of smaller businesses (golf pro shop, spa, restaurants, event planning, etc) featured in the cases that run throughout all four applications. This approach gives students a solid understanding of how an organization works by exposing them to how individuals in all facets of a business interact with tools like Microsoft Office and use information to make decisions.DetailsSeries:Your OfficeSizeLength:10.9 inHeight:0.4 inWidth:8.5 inWeight:45 oz
