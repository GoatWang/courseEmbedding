NEW YORK, September 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --
Q BioMed Inc (OTC: QBIO), a biotechnology acceleration and development company, President and CEO, Mr. Denis Corin was interviewed on The Wall St Analyzer.
In the interview Mr. Corin discusses Q BioMed, its vision and the recent news announcing the letter of Intent to in-license and ultimately acquire the assets of Mannin Research Inc.
The initial target of the Mannin technology platform is a therapeutic eye drop for the treatment of Glaucoma. There have been no new-class drugs developed for Glaucoma for 20 years, since Pfizer introduced Xalatan (latanaprost). The multi-billion dollar Glaucoma market is underserviced and the 60 million people suffering from the disease is expected to grow to 80 million by 2020 (W.H.O 2010). There is no cure for Glaucoma and new therapeutics are highly sought after. Current therapies and surgical procedures are not optimally effective, are painful and not well tolerated by patients. The Mannin platform is both unique and first-in-class and we are the only drug company targeting this mechanism of action.
Please listen to the interview by following this link to The Wall St. Analyzer http://wallstreetanalyzer.com/q-biomed-otcqbio-ceo-denis-corin/ or visit our website http://www.qbiomed.com

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
