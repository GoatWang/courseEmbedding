 Career History



General Counsel, Senior Vice President & Secretary

                                    2008 - Current                


Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.


                  Momenta is a leader in the analysis, characterization, and design of complex pharmaceutical products. Our scientific foundation is a set of tools and methods that enable one to develop a deep understanding of the links between a compound’s chemical structure, its manufacturing process and its biological function. These innovative tools enable us to develop complex generics and follow-on biologics as well as facilitate the discovery of novel drugs. We believe that by applying our innovative technology to our discovery and development programs, we have the potential to create a robust pipeline of innovative generic and novel drugs.

 

Our success is a result of our committed and talented people. We attract scientists exceptionally skilled in integrating information from diverse technical disciplines and task them with challenging characterization, process, and biology problems. Using this approach, we have designed tools and methods to understand the structure (characterization of chemical components), structure-process (design and control of manufacturing process) and structure-activity (relationships between structure and biological and clinical activity) of complex mixture drugs. From this knowledge comes a diversified product development pipeline consisting of both generic and novel complex mixture drugs designed to address a variety of medical needs.

 

In July 2010, Momenta announced the FDA approval of our first drug, enoxaparin sodium injection developed in collaboration with Sandoz. Enoxaparin is a more affordable, generic version of Lovenox® (enoxaparin sodium injection), which is indicated for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Enoxaparin sodium injection is a heparin-based complex mixture drug that was developed using our innovative scientific approach. Following this initial success, we are applying a similar approach to developing a generic version of Copaxone® (glatiramer acetate), a complex mixture of polypeptides indicated for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. We are also adding follow-on biologics, which are highly similar and potentially interchangeable biologics, to our development pipeline. And finally, with the knowledge acquired from our complex generic and follow-on biologics business, we are our using our tools and technology to design and improve the structures of proteins and heparin-derived products to create novel drugs
