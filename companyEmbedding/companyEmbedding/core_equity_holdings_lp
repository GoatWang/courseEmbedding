        Performance data quoted represent past performance and are no guarantee of future

        Current performance information to the most recent month-end is available on the
        Parnassus website (www.parnassus.com). Investment return and principal value will
        fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less
        than their original principal cost.

        Before investing, an investor should carefully consider the investment objectives,
        risks, charges and expenses of a fund and should carefully read the prospectus or summary prospectus, which contains this and other information and can be found in our Forms and Documents
        section. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s
        shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original principal cost,

RISKS TO CONSIDER

Market Risk: The market values of the portfolio’s holdings rise and fall from day to day, so investments may lose value.
Non-diversification Risk: The Fund is a “non-diversified” investment company, which means that the Fund may invest a larger portion of its assets in fewer companies than a diversified investment company. This increases the risks of investing in the Fund since the performance of each stock has a greater impact on the Fund’s performance. To the extent that the Fund invests a relatively high percentage of its assets in securities of a limited number of companies, the Fund may also be more susceptible than a diversified investment company to any single economic, political or regulatory occurrence.
Emerging Market Risk: Investments in emerging market countries may have more risk because the markets are less developed and less liquid as well as being subject to increased economic, political, regulatory or other uncertainties.
Foreign (Non-US) Risk: Non-US securities may be more volatile because of political, regulatory, market and economic uncertainties associated with such securities. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect the value of the investment or reduce returns. These risks are magnified in emerging or developing markets.
Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund/Portfolio carefully before investing. For copies of our prospectus or summary prospectus, which contain this and other information, click here or contact your AB representative. Please read the prospectus and/or summary prospectus carefully before investing.

Data quoted is past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Risk Factors: Because the Portfolio is generally invested in a small number of stocks, the performance of any one security held by the Portfolio will have a greater impact than if the Portfolio were invested in a larger number of securities. Although larger companies tend to be less volatile than companies with smaller market capitalizations, returns on investments in securities of large capitalization companies could trail the returns on investments in securities of smaller companies. The IVY VARIABLE INSURANCE PORTFOLIOSSM, are only available as investment options in variable life insurance policies and variable annuity contracts issued by participating insurance companies. They are not offered or made available directly to the general public.
Index Description: S&P 500 - An unmanaged index of common stocks. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Annuities are long-term financial products designed for retirement purposes. Annuity and life insurance guarantees are based on the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. The guarantees have no bearing on the performance of a variable investment option. Variable investment options are subject to market risk, including loss of principal. There are charges and expenses associated with annuities and variable life insurance products, including mortality and expense risk charges, management fees, administrative fees, expenses for optional riders and deferred sales charges for early withdrawals. Withdrawals before age 59 1/2 may be subject to a 10% IRS tax penalty and surrender charges may apply. 
Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through April 30, 2018, Ivy Investment Management Company (IICO), the Portfolio's investment manager, Ivy Distributors, Inc. (IDI), the Portfolio's distributor, and/or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Portfolio's transfer agent, have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees, 12b-1 fees and/or shareholder servicing fees to cap the total annual ordinary portfolio operating expenses (which would exclude interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, acquired fund fees and expenses and extraordinary expenses, if any) for Class II shares at 0.95%. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated without the consent of the Board of Trustees.
Original shares of the Portfolio were renamed Class II shares on April 28, 2017.
Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.
Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.
Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 
12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. 
MPT Statistics: Alpha is a measure of a portfolio’s actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the portfolio’s return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a portfolio’s fluctuations are attributable to movements in the portfolio’s benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a portfolio’s returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a portfolio’s risk-adjusted performance.
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.

overview/highlights.xsloverview/strategy.xsl      Fund Strategy              The Fund seeks long-term capital growth by investing primarily in U.S. large-cap equity securities and diversifying across a broad range of market sectors. It employs a valuation conscious approach, one that focuses on the quality and price of individual securities, while following a research-based investment strategy to select stocks with above average growth potential.Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss.  overview/mngmt.xsl      Portfolio Management     Craig Sterling, Portfolio Manager         Mr. Sterling, a Senior Vice President and Head of Equity Research, U.S., joined Amundi Pioneer in 2015 and has been an investment professional since 1991.       John Peckham, Portfolio Manager         Mr. Peckham, a senior vice president, joined Amundi Pioneer in 2002 and has been an investment professional since that time.            Portfolio Management Perspective              "We use a quality and valuation-conscious approach to select the fund's investments based upon all of the buy-rated recommendations of Amundi Pioneer's industry and sector research analysts.  These "best ideas" from across the team sell at reasonable prices or substantial discounts to their underlying values.  A security will be included in the portfolio if it provides a favorable risk/reward outcome relative to the benchmark index based on the research analyst's fundamental research and valuation."        overview/footnotes.xsl      A WORD ABOUT RISK              Investing in foreign and/or emerging market securities involves risks relating to interest rates, currency exchange rates, economic, and political conditions. At times, the Fund's investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are interrelated or have common risks, making it more susceptible to any economic, political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting those industries and sectors.         overview/bankbox.xslNot FDIC insuredMay lose valueNo bank guarantee						Before investing, consider the product's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.

Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of the historic volatility of a portfolio.                  Sharpe Ratio - a measure of excess return per unit of risk, as defined by standard deviation.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.  The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All results are historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.         Performance results reflect any applicable expense waivers in effect during the periods shown. Without such waivers, fund performance would be lower. Waivers may not be in effect for all funds. Certain fee waivers are contractual through a specified period.

Class C Return if Redeemed: The performance of Class C shares does not reflect the 1% front-end sales charge in effect prior to February 1, 2004. If you paid a 1% sales charge, your returns would be lower than shown above. Class C Shares held for less than one year are subject to a 1% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).                  Performance for periods prior to inception of Class A shares on 6/7/13 reflects performance of Class A shares of Pioneer Research Fund (the "predecessor fund"). The performance does not reflect differences in expenses, including the applicable 12b-1 fees. If performance reflected the difference in expenses, the performance for Class A shares of the Fund would be different.Performance for periods prior to inception of Class C shares on 6/7/13 reflects performance of Class C shares of Pioneer Research Fund (the "predecessor fund"). The performance does not reflect differences in expenses, including the applicable 12b-1 fees. If performance reflected the difference in expenses, the performance for Class C shares of the Fund would be different.Performance prior to inception of Class Y shares on 6/7/13 reflects the performance of Class Y of Pioneer Research Fund (the “predecessor fund”). Performance prior to Class Y shares of the predecessor fund on 8/11/04 reflects the NAV performance of Class A shares of the predecessor fund; this performance does not reflect differences in expenses, including the 12b-1 fees applicable to Class A shares. Since fees for Class A are generally higher than those of Class Y, the performance shown for the Class Y shares prior to inception would have been higher. Class Y shares are not subject to sales charges and are available for limited groups of investors, including institutional investors.                  NAV results represent the percent change in net asset value per share. Returns would have been lower had sales charges been reflected.

        Parnassus Core Equity Fund

        Investor Shares






                Objective:

                Capital appreciation and current income.

                Strategy

                The Parnassus Core Equity Fund invests with low turnover and high conviction in approximately 40 holdings. The Fund focuses on identifying companies with:                
            

Wide moats or strong competitive advantages that protect market share and profitability

                    Relevancy over the long term, which provides a compounding growth component
                

                    Quality management teams that will act in the best interest of shareholders
                

                    Favorable three-year investment horizon
                


                The Fund strives to outperform the S&P 500 index on a risk-adjusted basis with a high active share. The Fund attempts to shield investors from losses during bear markets, while offering significant upside participation during bull markets.
            

                Risks

                The Fund’s share price may change daily based on the value of its security holdings.
                Stock markets can be volatile, and stock values fluctuate in response to the asset
                levels of individual companies and in response to general U.S. and international
                market and economic conditions. In addition to large-cap companies, the Fund may
                invest in small- and/or mid-cap companies, which can be more volatile than large-cap
                firms. Security holdings in the fund can vary significantly from broad market indexes.

Avg. Weighted Mkt. Cap ($Bin)
                            The average capitalization of all stocks in the portfolio, weighted by each holding's
                            size in the portfolio. Capitalization, or market value of an entire company, is
                            calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the price per share.

P/E Ratio
                            A ratio of a stock's current price to its per-share earnings over the past 12 months
                            (or "trailing" 12 months). This gives us an idea of how "expensive" a stock may
                            be. For a fund, the price/earnings ratio is the weighted average P/E ratio of the
                            stocks it holds.

                            market. A beta over 1 suggests that the share price will typically be more volatile
                            than the market, and conversely, a beta below 1 indicates that the share price will
                            typically be less volatile than the market.

       The Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index (also known as "the S&P 500 Index") is a widely recognized index of common stock prices. An individual cannot invest directly in an index. An index reflects no deductions for fees, expenses or taxes, but mutual fund returns do. 
    

        The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds,
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with
at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population
for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for
variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and
rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5%
receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The
Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures
associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year
rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total
returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns.
While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent
three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Parnassus Core
Equity Fund was rated against the following numbers of Large Blend Funds over the following time periods: 1,223
funds in the last three years, 1,080 funds in the last five years, and 802 funds in the last ten years. Past performance
is no guarantee of future results. Morningstar Rating is for the Investor class only; other classes may have different
performance characteristics.

Parnassus Core Equity Fund

        Institutional Shares






                Objective:

                Capital appreciation and current income.

                Strategy

                The Parnassus Core Equity Fund invests with low turnover and high conviction in approximately 40 holdings. The Fund focuses on identifying companies with:                
            

Wide moats or strong competitive advantages that protect market share and profitability
Relevancy over the long term, which provides a compounding growth component
                
Quality management teams that will act in the best interest of shareholders
                
Favorable three-year investment horizon
                


                The Fund strives to outperform the S&P 500 index on a risk-adjusted basis with a high active share. The Fund attempts to shield investors from losses during bear markets, while offering significant upside participation during bull markets.
            

                Risks

                The Fund’s share price may change daily based on the value of its security holdings.
                Stock markets can be volatile, and stock values fluctuate in response to the asset
                levels of individual companies and in response to general U.S. and international
                market and economic conditions. In addition to large-cap companies, the Fund may
                invest in small- and/or mid-cap companies, which can be more volatile than large-cap
                firms. Security holdings in the fund can vary significantly from broad market indexes.

Avg. Weighted Mkt. Cap ($Bin)
                            The average capitalization of all stocks in the portfolio, weighted by each holding's
                            size in the portfolio. Capitalization, or market value of an entire company, is
                            calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the price per share.

P/E Ratio
                            A ratio of a stock's current price to its per-share earnings over the past 12 months
                            (or "trailing" 12 months). This gives us an idea of how "expensive" a stock may
                            be. For a fund, the price/earnings ratio is the weighted average P/E ratio of the
                            stocks it holds.

                            specific security, rather than the overall market. A large alpha indicates that
                            the stock or mutual fund has performed better than would be predicted, given its

                            as a whole. A beta of 1 means that the share price moves exactly inline with the
                            market. A beta over 1 suggests that the share price will typically be more volatile
                            than the market, and conversely, a beta below 1 indicates that the share price will
                            typically be less volatile than the market.

* Expenses based on total net assets, net of reimbursement.

        Shares.
    

        The Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index (also known as "the S&P 500 Index") is a widely recognized index of common stock prices. An individual cannot invest directly in an index. An index reflects no deductions for fees, expenses or taxes, but mutual fund returns do. 
    

        The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds,
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with
at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population
for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for
variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and
rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5%
receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The
Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures
associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year
rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total
returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns.
While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent
three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Parnassus Core
Equity Fund was rated against the following numbers of Large Blend Funds over the following time periods: 1,223
funds in the last three years, 1,080 funds in the last five years, and 802 funds in the last ten years. Past performance
is no guarantee of future results. Morningstar Rating is for the Institutional class only; other classes may have
different performance characteristics.

        risks, charges and expenses of a fund and should carefully read the prospectus or summary prospectus, which contains this and other information and can be found in our Forms and Documents
        section. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s
        shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original principal cost,
        and you could lose money.

Morningstar ratings are based on risk adjusted performance.
		







Important Performance Information





Performance results reflect any applicable expense subsidies and waivers in effect during the periods shown. Without such subsidies and waivers the fund's performance results would be less favorable. All results are historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
		





Included in all fund classes' total returns for the month of May 31, 2017 are proceeds received from a non-recurring litigation settlement against Household International Inc. Had these proceeds not been included, all total returns within calendar year 2017 would have been lower by 0.72%. 
		





Sales Charges
		





Class A shares ("A") results include the maximum sales charge.
		





Important Risk Considerations




The fund may not achieve its objective and/or you could lose money on your investment in the fund.
		





Stock markets and investments in individual stocks  are volatile and can decline significantly in response to issuer, market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions.
		





Please see the prospectus for further information on these and other risk considerations.

Morningstar Disclosure



The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
		



Morningstar rankings may vary among share classes and are based on historical total returns, which are not indicative of future results.




Class A share star ratings do not include any front-end sales load and are intended for those investors who have access to such purchase terms (e.g., plan participants of a defined contribution plan.) Therefore, Morningstar strongly encourages investors to contact their investment professional to determine whether they are eligible to purchase the A share without paying the front load.

1 The chart shows the growth in value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment since inception, 08/31/1992, and does not reflect the deduction of taxes a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.

        Performance data quoted represent past performance and are no guarantee of future
        returns. All performance assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. The
        investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an
        investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original
        cost.

        The Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index (also known as "the S&P
        500 Index") is a widely recognized index of common stock prices. An individual cannot
        invest directly in an index. An index reflects no deductions for fees, expenses
        or taxes, but mutual fund returns do.

        Common stock prices fluctuate based on changes to a companys financial condition
        and on overall market and economic conditions.

        In addition to large-cap companies, the Fund may invest in small- and/or mid-cap
        companies, which can be particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions and
        have fewer financial resources or the well-established businesses of large-cap companies.
        Relative to stocks of large-cap companies, the stocks of small- and mid-cap companies
        are often thinly traded, and purchases and sales may result in higher transaction
        costs. Also, small-cap companies tend to perform poorly during times of economic
        stress. Investment return and principal will fluctuate, so that an investors shares,
        when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original principal cost.

        Prior to March 31, 1998, the Parnassus Core Equity Fund was a balanced fund.
    

        Returns shown for the Fund do not reflect the declaration of taxes a shareholder
        would pay on the fund distributions or redemption of fund shares.

Important information regarding U.S. Equities (including Tax-Managed U.S. Equity Funds)


Important information regarding asset classes






Fund  objectives, risks, charges and expenses should be carefully considered  before investing. A summary prospectus, if available, or a prospectus containing this and other important  information can be obtained by calling 800-787-7354 or by visiting the prospectus and reports page to download one. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Please remember that all investments carry some level of risk, including the potential loss of principal invested. They do not typically grow at an even rate of return and may experience negative growth. As with any type of portfolio structuring, attempting to reduce risk and increase return could, at certain times, unintentionally reduce returns.
Diversification and multi-asset solutions do not assure a profit and do not protect against loss in declining markets.

Four in a row! For the fourth consecutive year, the Ivy International Core Equity Fund, Class Y, has won a Lipper Fund Award. The Fund was recognized for strong risk-adjusted performance relative to its peers over the 10-year period ended Nov. 30, 2016, after receiving the same 10-year recognition from Lipper for its 2015, 2014 and 2013 performance.

The Lipper Fund Awards honor individual funds that have delivered stronger and more consistent risk-adjusted performance than their peers over a given measurement period. Lipper’s proprietary mutual fund rating methodology is used to determine the winners. To be considered for a fund award in the U.S., funds must have at least 36 months of performance history and must be classified in a peer group with at least 10 distinct portfolios. The fund with the highest Lipper Leader rating for Consistent Return value in each eligible classification determines the classification winner over three, five or 10 years. Other share classes may have different performance and expense characteristics. For a detailed explanation of the process, please review the Lipper Fund Awards methodology document (U.S.) here.

These and other risks are more fully described in the fund's prospectus. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all broker/ dealers.Index Description: MSCI EAFE is an unmanaged index comprised of securities that represent the securities markets in Europe, Australasia and the Far East. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.The MSCI information may only be used for your internal use, may not be reproduced or repurposed in any form and may not be used as a basis for or a component of any financial instruments or products or indices.

Without limiting any of the foregoing, in no event shall any MSCI Party have any liability for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, punitive, consequential (including, without limitation, lost profits) or any other damages. (www.msci.com) Source: MSCI.Performance results for some funds may include the effect of expense reduction arrangements. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results would have been lower.Class T shares were launched on July 5, 2017.Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through July 31, 2018, Ivy Investment Management Company (IICO), the Fund's investment manager, Ivy Distributors, Inc. (IDI), the Fund's distributor, and/or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Fund's transfer agent, have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees, 12b-1 fees and/or shareholder servicing fees to cap the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses (which would exclude interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, acquired fund fees and expenses and extraordinary expenses, if any) as follows: Class E shares at 1.28%. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated without the consent of the Board of Trustees (Board). Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through July 31, 2018, IDI and/or WISC have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient 12b-1 and/or shareholder servicing fees to ensure that the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses of the Class Y shares do not exceed the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses of the Class A shares, as calculated at the end of each month. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated without the consent of the Board.Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. Alpha, Beta, R-Squared, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio and Capture Ratio are 5 year statistics. Alpha is a measure of a fund's actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a fund's fluctuations were attributable to movements in the fund's benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a fund's returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance. Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.

Fund Summary


Building a well-rounded portfolio

Strategy
 Stock selection stems from uncovering multi-year earnings catalysts that appear underappreciated by the market in companies believed to have strong or strengthening 
competitive advantages. Fund focuses on both company-specific and thematic earnings catalysts.
 
Process
A concentrated portfolio of domestic companies that generally invests across the 
valuation and large- to mid-cap spectrum opportunistically. The goal is a portfolio of companies 
expected to produce long-term earnings power above expectations.

Experienced management
Each portfolio manager has more than 15 years of industry experience. Both managers began their careers as research analysts covering a wide range of industries from technology 
and transportation to aerospace/defense and retail/apparel. 
 


Fund explores both company-specific and theme investing

        Risk Factors: The value of the Fund’s shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. Because the Fund is generally invested in a small number of stocks, the performance of any one security held by the Fund will have a greater impact than if the Fund were invested in a larger number of securities. Although larger companies tend to be less volatile than companies with smaller market capitalizations, returns on investments in securities of large capitalization companies could trail the returns on investments in securities of smaller companies. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund’s prospectus. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all broker/dealers.Index Description: S&P 500 - An unmanaged index of common stocks. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.Performance results for some funds may include the effect of expense reduction arrangements. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results would have been lower.Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through April 30, 2018, Ivy Investment Management Company (IICO), the Portfolio’s investment manager, Ivy Distributors, Inc. (IDI), the Portfolio’s distributor, and/or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Portfolio’s transfer agent, have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees, 12b-1 fees and/or shareholder servicing fees to cap the total annual ordinary portfolio operating expenses (which would exclude interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, acquired fund fees and expenses and extraordinary expenses, if any) for Class II shares at 0.95%. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated without the consent of the Board of Trustees.Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. Alpha, Beta, R-Squared, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio and Capture Ratio are 5 year statistics. Alpha is a measure of a fund's actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a fund's fluctuations were attributable to movements in the fund's benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a fund's returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance. Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.
