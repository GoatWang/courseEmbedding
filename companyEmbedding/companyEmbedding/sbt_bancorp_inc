Liquidity Ratios





Current Ratio




 


            Current Ratio measures the ability to meet short term obligations. Generally accepted standard is 2 (current assets should be 2 times or 200% of current liabilities).
        




Quick Ratio




 


            Measures immediate liquidity or the cash available to cover immediate liabilities. A safe margin would be at least 1 (100%).
        




Financial Leverage




 


            Defined as total assets divided by total shareholders' equity. The higher the ratio, the more debt a company uses in its capital structure.
        




Profitability Ratios






ROA




 


            Return on Assets (ROA) measures the income (profit) that is generated by the use of the assets of the business.
        




ROE




 


            Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of profitability that calculates how many dollars of profit a company generates with each dollar of shareholders equity.
            ROE is sometimes called "return on net worth."
        




ROIC




 


            The Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) measure gives a sense of how well a company is using its money to generate returns. Some investors use this figure as a final evaluation to determine whether or not to invest in a company.

SBT Bancorp, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results






July 27, 2017 06:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SIMSBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SBT Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”), (OTCQX: SBTB), holding company for 
      The Simsbury Bank & Trust Company, Inc. (the “Bank”), today announced 
      net income of $568 thousand or $0.42 basic and $0.42 diluted earnings 
      per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to a net income 
      of $251 thousand or $0.19 basic and $0.19 diluted earnings per share for 
      the prior year’s second quarter.
    


      Net interest and dividend income increased $325 thousand or 9.8% as 
      compared to the prior year’s second quarter primarily due to growth in 
      the Bank’s commercial portfolio. Noninterest income increased $67 
      thousand due principally to an increase in mortgage banking activities 
      income of $39 thousand. Noninterest expenses for the three months ended 
      June 30, 2017 were $3.6 million, equivalent to the prior year period.
    

      “We are very pleased to report improved earnings for the second quarter 
      of 2017 resulting principally from commercial loan growth and strong 
      expense management,” said Simsbury Bank President & CEO Martin J. Geitz. 
      “Our net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased over 126% 
      ($317 thousand) compared to the prior year period ended June 30, 2016. 
      Most of our balance sheet growth came from a 22.7% increase in 
      commercial loans since the end of the prior year second quarter as our 
      focus on serving the needs of privately owned and family owned 
      businesses continues to gain momentum.”

        Net income increased $317 thousand or 126.3%.
      

        Total revenue, consisting of net interest and dividend income plus

        Provision for loan losses totaled $85 thousand, a decrease of $85 
        thousand compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The allowance 
        for loan losses at June 30, 2017 was 0.96% of total gross loans.
      

        Net loans grew $39.4 million or 10.7%.
      

        Commercial loan balances increased $34.8 million or 22.7% to $188.3 
        million compared to June 30, 2016.
      

        Total deposits increased $40.4 million or 10.7% to $418 million, 
        driven by increases in demand deposits of $4.6 million, savings and 
        NOW deposits of $30.5 million, and time deposits of $5.3 million.
      


      The Company’s allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2017 was 0.96% of 
      total gross loans. The Company had non-accrual loans totaling $3.3 
      million or 0.81% of total loans on June 30, 2017, compared to 
      non-accrual loans totaling $3.7 million or 1.0% of total loans a year 
      ago. Total non-accrual and delinquent loans on June 30, 2017 was 0.91% 
      of loans outstanding compared to 1.67% on June 30, 2016.
    

      Total deposits on June 30, 2017 were $418 million, an increase of $40.4 
      million or 10.7% over a year ago. At quarter end, 32% of total deposits 
      were in non-interest bearing demand accounts, 52% were in low-cost 
      savings, money market and NOW accounts and 16% were in time deposits.
    

      For the quarter ended June 30, 2017, total net revenues, consisting of 
      net interest and dividend income plus noninterest income, were $4.4 
      million compared to $4.0 million for the same period in 2016, an 
      increase of $392 thousand or 9.8% above the prior year’s second quarter. 
      Net interest and dividend income increased $325 thousand or 9.8%, 
      primarily driven by a $509 thousand, or 15%, increase in interest and 
      fees on loans. The increase was partially offset by decreased interest 
      income on securities of $40 thousand. Noninterest income increased by 
      $67 thousand or 9.5%, primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking 
      activities of $39 thousand and an increase in other service charges and 
      fees of $24 thousand.
    

      For the year-to-date ended June 30, 2017, total net revenues, consisting 
      of net interest and dividend income plus noninterest income, were $8.6 
      million compared to $7.7 million for the same period in 2016, an 
      increase of $936 thousand or 12.2% above the prior year-to-date period. 
      Net interest and dividend income increased $693 thousand or 10.7%, 
      primarily driven by a $1.1 million, or 17%, increase in interest and 
      fees on loans. The increase was partially offset by decreased interest 
      income on securities of $91 thousand and increased interest expenses of 
      $329 thousand. Noninterest income increased by $243 thousand or 20.9%, 
      primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking activities of $287 
      thousand, offset by a decrease in gain on sale of available-for-sale 
      securities, net of writedowns, of $72 thousand.
    

      The Company’s year-to-date 2017 taxable-equivalent net interest margin 
      (taxable-equivalent net interest and dividend income divided by average 
      earning assets) was 3.03% compared to 3.03% for the comparable 2016 
      period. The Company’s yield on earning assets increased 10 basis points 
      to 3.45% and the cost of funds increased 14 basis points to 0.59%, 
      primarily driven by the subordinated debt interest and increased FHLB 
      borrowings interest.
    

      Total noninterest expense for the second quarter 2017 was $3.6 million, 
      equivalent to the second quarter of 2016. Total noninterest expense for 
      the year-to-date ended June 30, 2017 was $6.9 million, equivalent to the 
      comparable 2016 year-to-date period.
