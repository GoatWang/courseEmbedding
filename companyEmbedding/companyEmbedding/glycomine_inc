SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Glycomine, Inc. a biotechnology company developing a new generation of replacement therapies for rare diseases, today announced that it has raised $12 million in a Series A financing led by Sanderling Ventures and supported by Chiesi Ventures as well as existing high net worth individuals and patients. Glycomine will use the proceeds from this financing to complete IND enabling pre-clinical studies and initiate clinical studies of its substrate replacement therapy in patients with Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type Ia (CDG-Ia), and to accelerate discovery efforts towards an enzyme replacement therapy for N-glycanase deficiency (Ngly1).








"Glycomine's approach to a new generation of replacement therapies focuses on intracellular delivery and targeting of treatments to clinically relevant organs," said Agnes Rafalko, PhD, Glycomine's Chief Executive Officer. "We are very grateful for the funding and support we have received from our investors, patients' families, and doctors as we embark on the development of the first-ever replacement therapy for CDG-Ia." The therapy has the potential to significantly improve both patients' quality of life and lifespan. "CDG-Ia is a debilitating disorder with no treatment and Glycomine's approach to therapy is our only hope for these patients," said Prof. Jaak Jaeken of University of Leuven, Belgium, the mastermind behind the discovery of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation.
Replacement therapies continue to play an important role in orphan diseases. "One of the advantages of substrate or enzyme replacement therapies is having the ability to adjust the therapeutic dose according to patients needs and disease severity," said Gregory Enns, MD, of Stanford Medicine who is also a member of the company's Clinical Advisory Board.
"Glycomine's approach reminds me of the emergence of therapies for lysosomal storage disorders," said Christopher Starr, PhD, Glycomine's Executive Chairman and previously co-founder and C-level executive of BioMarin and Raptor. "Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) was the first of its class to be successfully treated with enzyme replacement therapy and led the way to BioMarin's pipeline growth in other MPS and lysosomal storage disorders. CDG-Ia is one of the first out of more than 100 unaddressed disorders of glycosylation to be potentially treated with a substrate replacement therapy."
In conjunction with Glycomine's Series A financing, the company announced that Peter McWilliams, PhD, MBA, Managing Director at Sanderling Ventures and Giacomo Chiesi, MBA, Managing Partner at Chiesi Ventures joined the company's Board of Directors. "Sanderling is delighted to invest is such a deeply passionate, experienced, and highly talented management team," said Peter McWilliams. "Together with the expertise of Chiesi Ventures we aim at accelerating the development of long-awaited and truly important therapies for patients in immense need."
About Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type Ia
Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type Ia (CDG-Ia) is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of an enzyme called phosphomannomutase 2 (encoded by the gene PMM2). As a result, the body fails to produce glycoproteins, which are proteins decorated with carbohydrates often referred to as sugar trees. CDG-Ia affects many systems of the body including the nervous system. Approximately 20% of children with the disease die within the first few years of life, often due to infection, liver problems, or heart disease. Others with CDG-Ia may live into adulthood and most are wheelchair bound throughout their life, unable to speak and live independently. There is no cure or therapeutic option for >1000 children diagnosed with the disorder. For more information about the disease and patient network, please visit CDG Community Alliance and Resource Exchange at www.cdgcare.com.
About Glycomine, Inc.
Glycomine is developing orphan drugs for serious rare monogenic disorders of metabolism and protein misfolding for which no other therapeutic options exist. The company's approach is to combine replacement therapies – substrates, enzymes, or proteins – with intracellular delivery vehicles consisting of bio-nanomaterials or ligands that target the molecules to the cell interior of clinically relevant organs. The company is based in San Francisco, California. For more information, please visit us at www.glycomine.com.

Primary Outcome Measures:
      
collect clinical and biological information in patients with CDG-PMM2 [ Time Frame: up to 3 years ]











 Estimated  Enrollment:
48


  Anticipated  Study Start Date:
September 2017


  Estimated  Study Completion Date:
December 2020


  Estimated  Primary Completion Date:
September 2020 (Final data collection date for primary outcome measure)




Detailed Description:
Subjects enrolled in this natural history study will be thoroughly examined for signs and symptoms of PMM2-CDG. Medical history, physical examination, laboratory testing and imaging studies will be performed during a single consultation. Follow-up will occur every 6 months at a minimum, depending on the standard of care at the investigator's institution as well as the clinical status of the individual patient. All medical procedures are routine. No new therapy is offered as part of this study, and no change in the patients' routine therapy is dictated by this protocol. No randomization will be performed.
Since no new therapy is offered as part of this study and no change in the patients' routine therapy is dictated by this protocol, only Serious Adverse Events potentially related to a procedure specifically requested (if any) by this natural history study will need to be reported to the Sponsor. However, all non-serious adverse events will be recorded in the natural history (observational) study CRF database, in order to be considered as a reference for the planned clinical trial to occur later on under a separate protocol.

Glycomine


























Developing replacement 
therapies for rare genetic disorders
Menu







Mission
1

1



There are approximately 7,000 rare disorders worldwide. Each day more are being discovered. 95% of rare diseases have not one single FDA approved treatment. Glycomine develops therapeutics for diseases which have no treatment options.
We focus on genetic disorders of protein and lipid glycosylation, which often cause severe debilitation in patients. There are 100 known glycosylation disorders. Glycomine is currently addressing 2 disorders of glycosylation: CDG-Ia and Ngly1 deficiency.
Glycomine’s therapeutic approach is to combine replacement therapies – substrates, enzymes, or proteins – with intracellular delivery vehicles consisting of bio-nanomaterials or ligands that target the molecules to the cell interior of clinically relevant organs.
Our CDG-Ia program is currently in early pre-clinical development. We are at the early stages of research for Ngly1 deficiency.

We are a team of scientists whose mission is to develop treatment options for patients and families that have no therapeutic alternatives. We are experts in covering many aspects of orphan drug research and development.

A congenital disorder of glycosylation is one of several rare inborn errors of metabolism in which glycosylation (sugar coating) of a variety of tissue proteins and/or lipids is deficient or defective. Congenital disorders of glycosylation are sometimes known as CDG syndromes. They often cause serious, sometimes fatal, malfunction of several different organ systems in affected infants.








Congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ia



CDG-Ia is a genetic metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of cytosolic enzyme phosphomannomutase 2 (encoded by the gene PMM2), which is required for the conversion of mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1- phosphate required for the synthesis of GDP-mannose, the donor of mannose to a growing lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) precursor. As a result, the incorporation of mannose into LLO is reduced, and glycoproteins lacking complete N-linked glycans are synthesized.
The body’s failure to produce complete N-linked glycans causes highly variable clinical manifestations that may include feeding problems, vomiting, and diarrhea with failure to thrive in infants, and severe encephalopathy with axial hypotonia, abnormal eye movement, marked psychomotor retardation, peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar hypoplasia, stroke-like episodes, and retinitis pigmentosa in late infancy, childhood or adulthood. The severe cellular and organ dysfunction of CDG-Ia typically leads to death in early childhood.


There are currently no FDA approved treatments specific to CDG-Ia for more than 1000 patients worldwide. Supportive care is aimed at treating symptoms and sequelae. 
Glycomine is working on the development of mannose-1-phosphate replacement therapy intended to bypass the genetic block in the mannose-1- phosphate pathway and provide continuous exposure over long periods of time. It is expected that such treatment will supply mannose-1-phosphate into affected cells, which will incorporate it into N-glycans of glycoproteins and potentially restore fundamental bodily functions and improve quality of life for both patients and their families.







Ngly1 deficiency



Ngly1 is a genetic disorder of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway caused by a deficiency of a cytosolic enzyme N-glycanase 1 (encoded by the gene Ngly1), which is required for cleaving N-linked glycans from misfolded glycoproteins prior to degradation. Lacking N-glycanase leaves the body with an impaired capacity to degrade misfolded glycoproteins, which accumulate in the cells of patients.
Ngly1-deficient patients have a striking clinical triad consisting of abnormal tear production, choreoathetosis, liver disease, global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, hypotonia, EEG abnormalities with or without overt seizures, brain imaging abnormalities, peripheral neuropathy, and constipation.
To date, 30 patients were diagnosed with Ngly1 deficiency. Efforts are ongoing to identify many more who may have been misdiagnosed with diseases of similar physical characteristics. 


There are currently no FDA approved treatments specific to Ngly1 deficiency. Supportive care is aimed at treating symptoms and sequelae. 
Together with the Grace Wilsey Foundation, Glycomine is working on the development of recombinant human Ngly1 enzyme replacement therapy intended to replace the deficient enzyme to restore the process of misfolded glycoprotein degradation.
