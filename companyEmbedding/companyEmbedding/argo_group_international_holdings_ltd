Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd., incorporated on June 1, 1999, is an underwriter of specialty insurance and reinsurance products in the property and casualty market. The Company operates through four segments: Excess and Surplus Lines, Commercial Specialty, International Specialty and Syndicate 1200. Excess and Surplus Lines segment carriers focus on risks that the standard (admitted) market is unwilling or unable to underwrite. Commercial Specialty segment provides property, casualty and surety coverages designed to meet the insurance needs of businesses within certain markets. Its International Specialty segment underwrites insurance and reinsurance risks. The Syndicate 1200 segment underwrites around the world property, specialty and non-United States liability insurance.Excess and Surplus LinesThe Excess and Surplus Lines segment consists of operating platforms, which include Colony Specialty.

History[edit]
Origin[edit]
Argonaut Insurance was founded in California in 1948 as the Argonaut Insurance Exchange. It focused on underwriting workers compensation for the California construction industry.[5] It was acquired in 1969 by Teledyne Technologies,[6] then expanded into additional product lines and acquired Great Central Insurance.[7]
1986-2000[edit]
In September 1986 Teledyne Technologies formed and then spun off Argonaut Group, with Argonaut Insurance and Great Central Insurance parts of the new company.[8] It focused on underwriting large-account workers compensation policies.[9]
2000-Present[edit]
In January 2000 Mark E. Watson III, a board member since 1999, became President and CEO.[10] The company moved its corporate office to San Antonio, Texas, in 2001.
The firm acquired Front Royal, Inc.[11] (along with its subsidiaries Colony and Rockwood), an insurance holding company headquartered in Morrisville, N.C. for $165 million in cash.[12] The acquisition added products and underwriting capabilities in areas complementary to Argonaut’s previous products.[13] Then they entered the public entity market by founding Trident Insurance.[14][15] In 2002, they acquired Fulcrum,[16] an excess and surplus lines underwriter[17] from Scor.[18] In 2003 they acquired Grocers from Royal & Sun Alliance USA,[19] expanding their Great Central platform. In 2005 they acquired the renewal rights to business formerly written by Interstate Insurance Group, subsidiaries of Fireman’s Fund.[20] In May 2005 they created Argonaut Specialty to underwrite accounts larger than what Colony traditionally wrote. In 2007 they merged with Bermuda-based PXRE, entering the reinsurance market.[21]
The new company renamed as Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd., and moved its public company home office to Bermuda.[22]
In 2008, Trident Insurance Services acquired Massamont Insurance Agency, which specialized in insurance programs for public entities,[23] expanding Argo's public entity footprint into New England with offices in Greenfield and Boston, Mass. In April 2008, Argonaut Group re-branded as Argo Group. U.S. operations were packaged as Argo Group US. Peleus Re was renamed Argo Re. In Europe, it became known as Argo Solutions. In May, Argo Group acquired Heritage and its Lloyd’s syndicate for $272 million[24] in order to create a broader underwriting platform, with increased market presence as well as an extended geographic capability and distribution network.[25]

History[edit]
Origin[edit]
Argonaut Insurance was founded in California in 1948 as the Argonaut Insurance Exchange. It focused on underwriting workers compensation for the California construction industry.[5] It was acquired in 1969 by Teledyne Technologies,[6] then expanded into additional product lines and acquired Great Central Insurance.[7]
1986-2000[edit]
In September 1986 Teledyne Technologies formed and then spun off Argonaut Group, with Argonaut Insurance and Great Central Insurance parts of the new company.[8] It focused on underwriting large-account workers compensation policies.[9]
2000-Present[edit]
In January 2000 Mark E. Watson III, a board member since 1999, became President and CEO.[10] The company moved its corporate office to San Antonio, Texas, in 2001.
The firm acquired Front Royal, Inc.[11] (along with its subsidiaries Colony and Rockwood), an insurance holding company headquartered in Morrisville, N.C. for $165 million in cash.[12] The acquisition added products and underwriting capabilities in areas complementary to Argonaut’s previous products.[13] Then they entered the public entity market by founding Trident Insurance.[14][15] In 2002, they acquired Fulcrum,[16] an excess and surplus lines underwriter[17] from Scor.[18] In 2003 they acquired Grocers from Royal & Sun Alliance USA,[19] expanding their Great Central platform. In 2005 they acquired the renewal rights to business formerly written by Interstate Insurance Group, subsidiaries of Fireman’s Fund.[20] In May 2005 they created Argonaut Specialty to underwrite accounts larger than what Colony traditionally wrote. In 2007 they merged with Bermuda-based PXRE, entering the reinsurance market.[21]
The new company renamed as Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd., and moved its public company home office to Bermuda.[22]
In 2008, Trident Insurance Services acquired Massamont Insurance Agency, which specialized in insurance programs for public entities,[23] expanding Argo's public entity footprint into New England with offices in Greenfield and Boston, Mass. In April 2008, Argonaut Group re-branded as Argo Group. U.S. operations were packaged as Argo Group US. Peleus Re was renamed Argo Re. In Europe, it became known as Argo Solutions. In May, Argo Group acquired Heritage and its Lloyd’s syndicate for $272 million[24] in order to create a broader underwriting platform, with increased market presence as well as an extended geographic capability and distribution network.[25]
In September 2008 they acquired Insight Insurance, a specialist in professional liability insurance for accounting professionals, architects, engineers and insurance agents.[26] In October they established Argo Pro, a consolidation of their professional liability operations.[27]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

History[edit]
Origin[edit]
Argonaut Insurance was founded in California in 1948 as the Argonaut Insurance Exchange. It focused on underwriting workers compensation for the California construction industry.[5] It was acquired in 1969 by Teledyne Technologies,[6] then expanded into additional product lines and acquired Great Central Insurance.[7]
1986-2000[edit]
In September 1986 Teledyne Technologies formed and then spun off Argonaut Group, with Argonaut Insurance and Great Central Insurance parts of the new company.[8] It focused on underwriting large-account workers compensation policies.[9]
2000-Present[edit]
In January 2000 Mark E. Watson III, a board member since 1999, became President and CEO.[10] The company moved its corporate office to San Antonio, Texas, in 2001.
The firm acquired Front Royal, Inc.[11] (along with its subsidiaries Colony and Rockwood), an insurance holding company headquartered in Morrisville, N.C. for $165 million in cash.[12] The acquisition added products and underwriting capabilities in areas complementary to Argonaut’s previous products.[13] Then they entered the public entity market by founding Trident Insurance.[14][15] In 2002, they acquired Fulcrum,[16] an excess and surplus lines underwriter[17] from Scor.[18] In 2003 they acquired Grocers from Royal & Sun Alliance USA,[19] expanding their Great Central platform. In 2005 they acquired the renewal rights to business formerly written by Interstate Insurance Group, subsidiaries of Fireman’s Fund.[20] In May 2005 they created Argonaut Specialty to underwrite accounts larger than what Colony traditionally wrote. In 2007 they merged with Bermuda-based PXRE, entering the reinsurance market.[21]
The new company renamed as Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd., and moved its public company home office to Bermuda.[22]
In 2008, Trident Insurance Services acquired Massamont Insurance Agency, which specialized in insurance programs for public entities,[23] expanding Argo's public entity footprint into New England with offices in Greenfield and Boston, Mass. In April 2008, Argonaut Group re-branded as Argo Group. U.S. operations were packaged as Argo Group US. Peleus Re was renamed Argo Re. In Europe, it became known as Argo Solutions. In May, Argo Group acquired Heritage and its Lloyd’s syndicate for $272 million[24] in order to create a broader underwriting platform, with increased market presence as well as an extended geographic capability and distribution network.[25]
In September 2008 they acquired Insight Insurance, a specialist in professional liability insurance for accounting professionals, architects, engineers and insurance agents.[26] In October they established Argo Pro, a consolidation of their professional liability operations.[27]
Business[edit]
Argo Group provides primary and excess insurance, reinsurance, and tailored risk products for the managing general agency market.[28] It has four business segments: Excess and Surplus Lines, Commercial Specialty, International Specialty and Syndicate 1200.[29]

In 2005 they acquired the renewal rights to business formerly written by Interstate Insurance Group, subsidiaries of Fireman’s Fund.[20] In May 2005 they created Argonaut Specialty to underwrite accounts larger than what Colony traditionally wrote. In 2007 they merged with Bermuda-based PXRE, entering the reinsurance market.[21]
The new company renamed as Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd., and moved its public company home office to Bermuda.[22]
In 2008, Trident Insurance Services acquired Massamont Insurance Agency, which specialized in insurance programs for public entities,[23] expanding Argo's public entity footprint into New England with offices in Greenfield and Boston, Mass. In April 2008, Argonaut Group re-branded as Argo Group. U.S. operations were packaged as Argo Group US. Peleus Re was renamed Argo Re. In Europe, it became known as Argo Solutions. In May, Argo Group acquired Heritage and its Lloyd’s syndicate for $272 million[24] in order to create a broader underwriting platform, with increased market presence as well as an extended geographic capability and distribution network.[25]
In September 2008 they acquired Insight Insurance, a specialist in professional liability insurance for accounting professionals, architects, engineers and insurance agents.[26] In October they established Argo Pro, a consolidation of their professional liability operations.[27]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
