The Glacier Peak Advantage:

Glacier Peak's competitive edge is deep rooted in our people, patience and structure. Our goal is to deliver superior risk-adjusted investment returns to our partners. We utilize a thoughtful opportunistic value approach in publicly traded equities, an approach that has driven our performance since our initial fund launched in 1991. Having a singular investment philosophy allows our team to work collaboratively to identify core investments that we feel are opportunistically mispriced. We are not trying to be “all things to all people”. We understand that our investment approach is unique to the marketplace, but our partners trust that our focus and commitment will always be on doing our best to protect partner capital from permanent loss while providing steady long term compounding returns. 









John Rudolf
President/ Senior Portfolio Manager

	John C. Rudolf is Founder, President, and Senior Portfolio Manager for Glacier Peak Capital. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Notre Dame in 1970 and attended the Columbia University Graduate School under the Herbert Lehman Doctoral Fellowship.	John began his investment career in New York City in 1974, joining Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. in 1975. He founded Summit Capital Partners, a value-oriented private investment fund, in 1984 while at Oppenheimer. In 1988, he moved to Seattle as partner in charge of Oppenheimer’s Pacific Northwest operations. John founded Summit Capital in 1996, an independent registered investment advisory firm managing individual accounts and several private investment funds. In 2012, he sold his majority interest in Summit Capital and founded Glacier Peak Capital to focus his investing efforts on the Glacier Peak U.S. Value Fund and Glacier Peak Global Value Fund, which originally began as Summit Capital Partners in 1984. He is currently a board member of Detrex Corporation, a publicly traded company based in Detroit, and was the inaugural Presidential Fellow of Chapman University in Orange, California.	Assorted community activities over his career have included: Chair of the Building Committee for New York’s Pelham Art Center; board member and co-chair of the Million Dollar Roundtable of the United Way of King County; board member and chair of the University of Notre Dame Art Museum; trustee of the Pacific Northwest Ballet; chairman of the College Baseball Classic Foundation; board member of Andean Health and Development; advisor to the Investment Management Program at the University of Notre Dame Business School; advisory member of the Institute For Prostate Cancer Research [a consortium of the University of Washington Medical School and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]; a member of Seattle's "Monday Club"; and a board advisor to The Vital Ground Foundation. John has been a lifelong athlete and youth sports coach, active in cycling, tennis, skiing, running, triathlons, hiking, and mountain climbing- reaching the summit of many of the great mountains of the Pacific Northwest and 7 of the 8 highest mountains on the world’s continents, coming up short in 2010 at 24,000 feet on Mount Everest.  	    










James Rudolf
Chief Operating Officer/ Partner

	James oversees all business operations for Glacier Peak and provides equity research, trading and portfolio analysis for both investment strategies.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
