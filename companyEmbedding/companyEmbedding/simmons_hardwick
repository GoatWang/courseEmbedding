Two Pals, Giddy Ambition and a Big Crash at Prudential

			By Landon Thomas Jr. • 12/04/00 12:00am































Wick Simmons, the former chief executive of Prudential Securities, would have been proud. The grand ballroom at the Plaza Hotel was chock-full of money managers nibbling away at their plates of filet mignon, their attention focused on Prudential Securities star strategist Ralph Acampora, who was delivering the keynote address.
The date was Nov. 1, a mere three weeks after Mr. Simmons had, without warning, announced his retirement. He was gone, and his plan to spin off Prudential Securities from its parent company, Prudential Insurance, was apparently gone with him.
But Mr. Simmons’ vision for a free-standing securities firm-perhaps in partnership with Lehman Brothers-was almost tangible in that Plaza ballroom. It was the last day of a two-day high-tech conference run by the firm’s newly formed technology division, the Prudential Volpe Technology Group. And in a starring role was Mr. Simmons’ protégé, Mr. Acampora.


As Mr. Simmons, 60, had made Mr. Acampora, Mr. Acampora, 59, had helped to make Prudential Securities. His bold call in 1995 that the Dow would hit 7,000 brought Mr. Acampora a large dose of Wall Street fame, burnishing as well the high hopes Mr. Simmons had for his firm.
And now there Mr. Acampora was, doing his schtick, plugging along in his mentor’s image, pushing his new book and an idea that Mr. Simmons had loved. Part Henny Youngman-“Hello. Is anyone out there? What am I looking at, an oil painting?” he cracks when one of his many jokes falls a little flat-and part a sophisticated reading of the market’s tea leaves, Mr. Acampora was there to boost confidence. The message? The tech boom and the peace dividend were just now kicking in; stocks will be going higher.
This was it. The very pith of Mr. Simmons’ vision.


But no Mr. Simmons.
Mr. Simmons, finally, had run out of luck. No one on the Street was all that surprised when Arthur Ryan, chief executive officer of the parent Prudential Insurance company, accepted Mr. Simmons’ resignation on Oct. 6. Did Mr. Simmons really think that tiny little Pru could make a run at the big boys by riding the Ralph Acampora boomlet and snapping up the odd West Coast tech boutique? No way.
As far as Mr. Ryan saw it, Prudential Securities was all about retail distribution for its insurance products. Case closed. And with Prudential Insurance’s giant I.P.O. in the offing, there could be little patience for the grand banking ambitions of Hardwick Simmons.


Mr. Simmons is now retired and could not be reached for comment. But allow him a little credit for giving it the old college try. For the genial Boston Brahmin-he is eighth-generation Harvard on the Simmons side, while on his mother’s side, the Stone family is about as old-line as Boston families get-his 32-year run on Wall Street had been a blessed one.
It goes something like this: He started out at the semi-white-shoe outfit Hayden Stone & Co. (founded by his great-grandfather in 1892) in late 1967 and subsequently moved on to Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt in 1970 when the family firm imploded and was bought out. There he hitched his star to Sandy Weill, and by the mid-1980’s he found himself at Shearson-following its merger with Cogan Berlind-running the retail brokerage unit.
In the late 1980’s, Shearson Lehman Brothers grew too big, too fast-a strategy supported by Mr. Simmons-and had to be bailed out by parent American Express. (Shearson Lehman Brothers has since broken up into various entities.) Reading the handwriting on the wall, Mr. Simmons resigned. He landed lightly on his feet, though, this time as chief executive of Prudential Securities in 1991.
Finally, it seemed, Mr. Simmons was ready to step out on his own, free from the shadows of great granddad Hayden Stone and Sandy Weill. Prudential was no picnic, though, when Mr. Simmons took over. There followed a litany of public relations disasters, and between 1994 and 1996 Prudential was forced to pay out a sum close to $2 billion in legal fees and settlements for disputed partnership claims. Not surprisingly, the firm’s competitive position on Wall Street eroded. Through it all, Mr. Simmons sailed placidly along and, in the late 1990’s, began to push for the separation of Prudential Securities from its corporate parent, Prudential Insurance.
Quite simply, Mr. Simmons felt Prudential Securities was ready for prime time. It was time for Prudential to move into the bulge bracket-to go head-to-head with the likes of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He had his 6,500-strong retail sales force. And, as it turned out, he had Mr. Acampora.
Mr. Acampora is a rough-hewn man with a broad, friendly face who lacks the pretensions and gloss of many Wall Street talking heads. His suits are off the rack and his ties tend to have pictures of buildings on them. A product of the South Bronx (his father was a truck driver), he is an Iona College graduate who spent two years in the seminary studying for the priesthood before giving in to the stock-market bug. He started at the bottom in the early 1960’s, studying technical analysis for a number of now-defunct brokerage houses.
And then came “the call.” In June 1995, Mr. Acampora-at the time the firm’s technical strategist and largely an unknown name on the Street-stepped forward, with the Dow then around 4,500, and penned a now-famous research report forecasting a 7,000 level for the Dow by 1998.
 “I lost a lot of sleep over that,” Mr. Acampora remembered, sitting in his office surrounded by the blink and bleep of screens and monitors. “I was getting a lot of criticism, too. ‘What are you smoking?’ people were asking. You have to remember that Wall Street was convinced at the time that we were headed into a bear market.”
When the Dow burst through 7,000 in February 1997, Mr. Acampora was suddenly famous. Knowing it had a hot commodity on its hands, the firm started flogging him. “The 7,000 call was just the beginning,” says Rich Franchella, national sales manager for Prudential. “Ralph became a media hero, and we knew we had something. So our marketing department said, ‘Let’s put Ralph out there in a more public way. Let’s put him front and center for our clients.'”
Indeed, Mr. Acampora became ubiquitous: a regular on CNBC and Louis Rukeyser’s Wall Street Week . Mr. Simmons was beside himself. “Ralph, that was the best call I’ve ever heard,” he said to Mr. Acampora. He also wanted to know, “What can I do for you?”
“I was in Detroit at the time,” recalled Mr. Acampora. “Wick said, ‘I’d like to get you a gift. Anything.’ So, jokingly, I said: ‘How about a red 1962 Corvette?'” A month later there it was, wrapped up in a bow and parked outside the Prudential offices in 1997. “Dow 7000” read the license plate. Mr. Acampora later changed the plate to “Dow 10000,” and now it reads “Dow 22000”-his latest forecast for the index.
So Mr. Acampora became a star, and business on the retail side boomed. And what a thrill it was. “CNBC was all over me,” Mr. Acampora enthused. “They had already made Abby Cohen the Queen of Wall Street. Now I was going to be the king.”
Recently, he wrote a book: The Fourth Mega-Market, Now Through 2011: How Three Earlier Bull Markets Explain the Present and Predict the Future . Mr. Simmons had pushed him to write it; the firm was aggressively marketing it nationwide, sending the indefatigable Mr. Acampora out on multi-city tours. Clients loved him. The sales force loved him. Mr. Simmons loved him.
And of course, Prudential benefited. Up until 1996, the Pru name was suggestive of nothing more than lawsuits and fraud cases. But would Mr. Acampora’s leap from the other side of the tracks be enough to solidify Mr. Simmons’ long-standing ambition to run a truly big-league investment house worthy of the Stone name?
Mr. Simmons knew he needed to provide a competitive institutional service to institutional clients. In that vein, he branched out globally, opening an office in Shanghai, and became acquisitive by buying a niche investment bank specializing in health care in June 1999.
Last December, Mr. Simmons paid $150 million to buy Volpe, Brown, Whelan & Co., a second-tier boutique investment bank in San Francisco, to sate his institutional clients’ ravenous demand for cutting-edge tech coverage. It was a rich price, and there had been a raft of high-level defections from Volpe since the deal’s close, but a rump remained and Prudential Volpe Technology Group was born. It was Mr. Simmons’ boldest step to persuade his bosses at Prudential Insurance that the securities arm could go it alone.
And an even bolder plan was apparently in the works. Market scuttlebutt has it that Mr. Simmons had been in talks with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. about a possible merger earlier this year. But the corporate parent was not ready to sell (especially with Mr. Acampora’s star so brightly ascendant) in advance of its long awaited I.P.O. The insurance company saw its securities arm as a prime outlet for all its many products; why give it up now?
“Prudential Insurance was never going to fund Hardwick Simmons’ dream of creating a mini–Morgan Stanley,” said an analyst who preferred to remain on background (Prudential’s I.P.O., expected a year from now, will be a very large one, so analysts are loath to take their views public these days).
So once again, Mr. Simmons has fallen on his sword. And since his resignation, his successor, John Strangfeld, has started undoing much of his predecessor’s work. In late October, 425 jobs were eliminated when the company’s institutional bond department was shuttered, with more pruning expected in the coming weeks. The goal is to focus the business entirely on the retail end.
So good-bye, overpriced i-bankers and hello, Ralph. What does Mr. Acampora think?
“Look, it’s a business,” he says. “Wick wanted to make Prudential competitive. The other guy [Prudential Insurance chief executive Ryan] said no. Am I upset? No. Do I still admire him? Yes. I have the highest regard for Wick. He took a firm that was in bad shape and made it respectable. In the end, he gave us enough rope to either climb up to the sky or hang ourselves.”

Saatva's Special Edition Foundation

Like those found in most of today's premium interactive mattress sets, the Saatva mattress uses a rigid solid support foundation that utilizes a solid deck support with a wood slat construction for maximum mattress and body support. Additionally, they contain our eco-friendly foams and are covered in organic cotton.
Our foundations are available in two thickness options  a standard 8.75" foundation and a 4.75" low profile foundation. Both are available in twin, full, queen, king and California king sizes. There is absolutely no difference in the feel between the low profile 4.75" and the standard 8.75".


All king and Cal king size foundations come split for delivery purposes, as they do not bend. The split foundation will fit into any entrance way or doorway. Twin, full and queen all come standard in one piece.
Please note, we do have a split queen foundation available for an additional $35.00. This should be ordered if you feel a standard queen one piece foundation won't fit into your entrance way or doorway. That option is not available in full or twin.





Frame

The bed frame fits all sizes of bedding. The center rail has 3 heavy duty legs for maximum center support from head to toe.

The Saatva advantage explained.
See how we became the best-reviewed mattresscompany on the Web.



OUR ADVANTAGE
OUR COMPANY
OUR HISTORY
GIVING

Unlike retail store brands, Saatva offers ultra-premium luxury at an affordable price.
Here’s how we do it:



1. Make a better product
2. Offer a better price


The mattress industry is notoriously confusing. Newly developed technologies are slow to reach retail outlets, and premium products are either unavailable or prohibitively expensive. But with Saatva, you get cutting edge sleep technology and ultra-premium quality in materials and construction.
Saatva brings its luxurious mattresses to you for much less than the price of comparable beds found in stores. As an online-only retailer, we eliminate the costs and waste associated with the traditional mattress market, including rent, commissions, inventory inefficiency, and utilities.


Price comparison with retail brands:

Saatva saves you over $1,000

We cut no corners.
We've combined the top 5 features of luxury innerspring mattresses into one beautifully crafted mattress.

Featuring Luxury Firm
Rated the #1 comfort choice in the ultra-premium mattress classification.













PLUSH SOFT

For sleepers who prefer to feel their mattress hug them in a supportive embrace the Plush Soft comfort level is your choice. We layer individually wrapped coils with softer and conforming foams to create a mattress that hugs to your body while you sleep. Our core is just the right firmness to ensure you don’t sink in too much but will conform to your unique body.


Choose Plush Soft:

If you prefer to sleep on your side and sometimes your back
If you like to feel enveloped in your bed and linens
Have trouble with your arms falling asleep before you do
If you prefer a soft mattress

CHOOSE PLUSH SOFT



LUXURY FIRM
OUR FLAGSHIP LEVEL

The standard comfort level used in the finest hotels in the world, where their goal is to ensure every guest gets a great night sleep. "Luxury Firm" offers the perfect balance of "cushion firm and contouring support". This assures proper spinal alignment with our premium foam cushion layers for the most comfortable sleep experience. Whether you sleep on your side, back or stomach, you will be very happy with this comfort level. It is a true medium firm. A perfect balance of comfort with support. The "Luxury Firm", is rated the "#1 comfort choice" in the ultra premium mattress classification.


Choose Luxury Firm:

If you prefer to sleep on your side, back or stomach.
It’s the perfect mattress for couples with different sleep needs.
If you are looking for the Goldilocks bed. Not too firm. Not too soft.
If you switch sleeping positions often in the night.
If you are looking for the luxury hotel experience at home. 

CHOOSE LUXURY FIRM



FIRM

For sleepers who prefer their mattress firm but not hard the Firm comfort level is your choice. We layer individually wrapped coils with firmer foams than our Luxury Firm to create a mattress that floats your body on the mattress as you sleep. When you lie down you will feel an initial plushness quickly followed by the firm support you desire. Our core is just the right firmness balance to ensure you don’t sink into the mattress or feel like you are sleeping on a board.  


Choose Firm:

If you prefer to sleep on your back or stomach
Prefer a mattress that you float on top of instead of sink into
If your  health professional recommends a firm mattress
If you prefer a firmer mattress

CHOOSE FIRM

Transforming the 5 minute mattress test drive into a private 120 day in home experience.




It is our daily mantra to eliminate the traditional friction that is so common between vendors and consumers by offering extreme courtesy coupled with clear and transparent policies...label us truly "consumer centric". We offer the friendliest 120 day home trial in the business: if you're not happy, you have the option to return our bed and only be responsible for the original delivery charge. No penalty fees, no pickup fees. Simply a refund. Additionally, in the rare instance that you may have ordered incorrectly for your needs be it size or comfort, we are glad to honor an exchange within the 120 day home trial for only the cost of delivery as a courtesy to you. 

   Enjoy peace of mind with our 15 year warranty



 Best Reviewed Mattress
We've won BBB's award for excellence in website marketing messages

We guarantee that your mattress is crafted fresh, to our strict specifications. All mattresses are thoroughly inspected before being sent out for delivery to your home.






      We're confident your expectations will be exceeded from the day of delivery and beyond as our product continues to perform for you. By educating our customers on the features and benefits of our ultra premium bed with 'objective measures of comparison', we have had great success without ever having to use high pressure or confusing tactics. This approach results in a minuscule amount of returns. 
   


     We offer the friendliest 120 day home trial in the luxury mattress market. If you find that our bed is not right for you, it can be returned for a full and prompt refund of the purchase price, less the original delivery fee. No penalty fees, pick-up fees or restocking fees (we NEVER re-stock a mattress). In offering this friendly policy, we do ask that you double-check your measurements before you buy to confirm that the mattress and foundation heights you've chosen fit your needs.
   



     Keep in mind, for over 30 years people have been buying mattresses through infomercials and/or by phone. Today the Internet makes this process so much easier and more informative with websites such as Saatva's. You can simply make a decision at your own pace with absolutely no pressure from a salesperson, no insult by the falseness of a phony sale, and no gimmicks that are historically found in retail mattress stores.
   


At Saatva, we are serious about quality and maintaining our pristine reputation. If our mattress or any aspect of Saatva disappoints you, please click or call us immediately for the remedy. We constantly monitor all comments on our site and on the Internet.  Please know we are vigilant with action on addressing any blatant or perceived misstatements about Saatva.  Let's be friendly and just click or call for happiness!

About Beautyrest
Beautyrest
Beautyrest is the flagship sub-brand that made Simmons what it is today. Beautyrest is so popular, in fact, that it has evolved to have sub-brands of its own. Beautyrest Black, Beautyrest Platinum, and Beautyrest Silver represent the leading models from Simmons Bedding Company today.
Simmons Beautyrest strikes an excellent balance of quality and value, making it one of the most popular and successful mattress brands in the world. With a range of price points from under $500 to over $5,000, every size from Twin to Queen to California King, and every Comfort Scale rating from 1 to 10, you can rest assured there is a Simmons Beautyrest mattress perfect for you!
Beautyrest Black
Beautyrest Black is the top-of-the-line series from Simmons. These high-end mattresses feature the best comfort materials and luxury features that Simmons has to offer. If you want to make an investment in luxury sleep, Beautyrest Black is a great option.
Beautyrest Black mattresses feature SurfaceCoolPlus Fiber quilts to help regulate temperature and keep you comfortably cool. Next, strategic layers of AirCool Gel Memory Foam, BlackIce Memory Foam, Comfort Response Latex, Dynamic Response Memory Foam, Micro Diamond Memory Foam, and/or GelTouch Foam are used to provide optimal comfort, support, and temperature control for ideal sleep. BlackIce Memory Foam and Micro Diamond Memory Foam include actual diamond particles within the memory foam as a hyperconducting enhancement to absorb body heat and disperse it across the entire mattress surface. This eliminates pockets of trapped body heat for cooler, more comfortable sleep. Lastly, Veriform Advanced Pocketed Coils form the support base of the mattress, utilizing triple wire braided coils to provide durable, precise support while significantly limiting the transfer of motion. If you're ready for the best sleep of your life, Beautyrest Black is the solution.

Beautyrest Platinum
Beautyrest Platinum exists at the crossroads of affordability and high-end quality for those who desire Beautyrest Black luxury, but don't have the budget for it. Beautyrest Platinum models feature some, but not all, of the comfort materials you'll find in Beautyrest Black, and use a more cost-effective support system. By leaving out some of the more lavish features, Beautyrest Platinum achieves a good balance of value and luxury.

Beautyrest Silver
Beautyrest Silver mattresses are an excellent option for discerning customers who want a great value on a quality mattress. These mattresses are surprisingly affordable, and backed by the quality you would expect from Simmons Beautyrest. Beautyrest Silver replaces the Beautyrest Recharge series, but maintains the technology and features that made it so popular, in addition to some new ones. Beautyrest Silver boasts a dependable support system, advanced comfort foams, and contains actual silver to help wick away moisture, conduct and disperse body heat, and repel microorganisms.

Beautyrest Silver Hybrid
Simmons Beautyrest Silver Hybrid models boast the same technology as Beautyrest Silver, but with a hybrid design. Beautyrest Silver Hybrid mattresses combine 1,000 Density Beautyrest Pocketed Coil systems with advanced memory foam layers to achieve cool, comfortable, and supportive sleep.

Affordable Quality and Comfort
Simmons Beautysleep mattresses represent some of the greatest values in the industry because they often contain the same materials found in mattresses sold at much higher price points. Select BeautySleep models provide sturdy support through an individually pocketed coil system made from high carbon steel. This coil system contours to the curves of the body exceptionally well, and it also helps individuals maintain proper spinal alignment while they sleep. Some BeautySleep models include premium comfort materials like Gel Touch, which features a unique combination of memory foam and gel to enhance overall support and alleviate pressure points that can lead to tossing and turning. Gel is one of the most durable materials used in mattresses today, and it can substantially extend the comfort life of a mattress. This means that a BeautySleep mattress with Gel Touch will retain its showroom level of comfort for a longer period of time than a comparable model not containing gel.
An Exceptional Value
Simmons ensures that sleepers enjoy uniform comfort and support by surrounding each BeautySleep mattress with a three inch foam encasement. The foam encasement ensures that each sleeper will feel comfortable and supported whether he or she sleeps in the middle or on the edge of the mattress. BeautySleep mattresses are a great choice for budget minded individuals looking for the best value in a quality mattress. Whether you prefer a stiff and rigid sleep experience, or you're more comfortable sinking into a plush or pillow top, there's a BeautySleep mattress that can give you night after night of deep, restful sleep. Shop today, and find the right BeautySleep mattress for you!

Mattress Support
  Simmons' Beautyrest Recharge Hybrid line was conceived by considering not only how people sleep, but how they spend their waking hours. The result is a concept that delivers the best of both worlds. Using high-quality memory foam comfort layers on top of an individually pocketed coil system, these mattresses offer exceptional body contouring with solid underlying support. They are available in a range of comforts, from very firm to very soft, with mid-range models that make the perfect compromise.
Simmons Beautyrest Recharge Hybrid
  A good question to ask when mattress shopping nowadays is "What is the mattress made of?" Instead of mattresses just being made of a spring support system with some soft stuff on top, modern mattresses have a wide variety of materials and construction options that make them unique. A common question for these mattresses is "Does Simmons Beautyrest have cooling gel?" The answer to this depends, as each of the Beautyrest Recharge Hybrid models contains different materials in different arrangements. While all of the models use some kind of foam in the comfort layers, different gel memory foams, AirCool memory foams, and BeautyCloud memory foams can result in different levels of cooling effectiveness and softness.
Simmons Beautyrest Recharge Hybrid Comfort and Support
  It is important to know the difference between comfort and support when buying a mattress, as your comfort preferences may differ from someone else's despite the mattress providing good support to the both of you. Comfort is the more subjective preference of soft vs. firm, while support is more about the quality of the mattress and how well it reinforces your back and body. The Simmons Beautyrest Recharge Hybrid collection has something for everyone, and delivers the comfort you want with the support you need to wake up each and every morning feeling refreshed and recharged. Check out our selection of Beautyrest Recharge Hybrid mattresses at the best prices available anywhere, online or in-store!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
