The Business PlanThe business plan involves increasing the net operating income by 46% over a five-year period. The four main drivers to increase the net operating income are:

Normalize Rents –The current owners are operating with significant disparity between rents of like-units across the property and Western Wealth Capital intends to reduce that disparity using our proven lease management approach. This action alone has the potential to bring a further $176,000 in rental income which corresponds to over $2,900,000 in increased value to the property based on a 6% cap rate.
Gold Star Interior Upgrade Value-add Opportunity -Western Wealth Capital plans to complete interior upgrades to 126 of the 162 units over two years, enabling a projected $100 per month per unit increase in rental income.
Washer & Dryer Value-Add Opportunity – Western Wealth Capital plans to install washers and dryers in all of the 148 units, enabling an increase of $50 per unit per month of rental income. This will also allow the on-site laundry facility to be repurposed into a fitness center, further increasing the property’s desirability.
Interior Upgrade Value-Add Opportunity –Western Wealth Capital plans to install washers and dryers in all of the 164 units, enabling an increase of $50 per unit per month of rental income. This will also allow the on-site laundry facility to be repurposed into an updated fi tness centre and offi ce, further increasing the property’s desirability.
Bring rents to market average – Rents are forecast to be increased on average 4% each year.

Location







The property is situated in the heart of Tempe, Arizona just southeast of Phoenix. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a large property – 5.95 acres of land — in this thriving market, offering incredible future redevelopment potential. Tempe is a supply-constrained market with very limited available sites. New multifamily product in the area is achieving record sale prices ($300k+ per door). By comparison, Western Wealth Capital has secured the opportunity to acquire Amber Gardens at $103,659 per door.
The address at West 1st St and South Roosevelt St is just ½ mile west of the Arizona State University which houses over 80,000 students and is one of the largest universities in the US. The university is also the largest employer in the area with over 8,700 faculty and staff. The immediate neighborhood provides a convenient base for university students and young families.
Tempe prides itself on creating the “live-work-play” experience by attracting top Fortune 500 companies, building beautiful residential communities and maintaining outdoor parks and venues.
The immediate area boasts 300,000 jobs and that figure is expected to grow significantly over the next few years. Several notable large employers have recently relocated to Tempe including State Farm Insurance, which will bring 8,000 new jobs to the area by 2018. There are 111 major employers (each with greater than 600 employees) located within 10 miles of Amber Gardens, providing over 155,000 jobs alone and the city is home to more than 100 office complexes and developments.















Tempe is served by three school districts for K-12 students. The districts are known for nationally recognized technology enriched curriculum, excellent learning facilities and locations, amazing character education activities, strong summer learning options and an award-winning before- and after-school program. This is an attractive feature for young families in the Greater Phoenix Area.
The property is within walking distance of the historic Mill Avenue District with its vibrant dining scene, nightlife and unique shops. There are many nearby grocery store options including the Rollins Family Market which is within walking distance of the property and Walmart which is 2 miles away just south of the ASU campus.
Nearby parks include Tempe Beach Park one block north of the property and nearby Jaycee Park which is 0.4 miles south of the property.
Tempe is surrounded by fi ve freeways and hosts 9 light rail station stops including one two blocks from Amber Gardens. It is a 10-minute drive from Sky Harbor International Airport which sees 100,000 passengers daily and employs 31,000 people.

Supplemental FinancingOur unique refinancing option allows us to refi nance every 12 months if we can increase the net operating income. Traditionally, refinancing includes brokerage & legal fees similar to the costs of acquiring a new property. We have negotiated this refi nance option with the lender at a negligible cost compared to a traditional loan. A reappraisal that results in an increased property value will allow the limited partnership to increase the loan and distribute the net loan proceeds to the limited partners.

Any possible distributions made by THE PARTNERSHIP will be in the following order:

The Limited Partners will be paid back their initial investment first.
Limited Partners will then be paid 65% of the profit, if any.
The General Partner will then receive 35% of the profit, if any.

Assumptions
Material factors or assumptions that were applied in drawing a conclusion or making an estimate set out in the forward-looking statements include that: building upgrade plans and related expenses will proceed as anticipated; the Partnership will remain in good standing with respect to its obligations any senior lenders; the general economy is stable local real estate conditions are stable; interest rates are relatively stable; equity and debt markets continue to provide access to capital; that the Partnership’s expenses will not be materially greater than anticipated. These factors and assumptions should be considered carefully by readers. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements or the assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based on. Investors are further cautioned that the foregoing list of factors and assumptions is not exhaustive.
In addition, information regarding targeted returns is based on the following principles and assumptions: the Partnership will maintain a consistent level of cash flow and indebtedness and will not materially incur additional indebtedness, other than with respect to ordinary operating costs or as disclosed herein; the consumer price index, property taxes, operating expense growth, and market rent growth will be as anticipated; existing tenants will fulfill their current contractual lease obligations and remain in occupancy and pay rent for the term of their leases; upon expiry of their leases, the number of retained tenants will meet historical retention experience; and the Partnership will maintain cash reserves as anticipated.
Other assumptions used by Western Wealth Capital Management LTD to model the costs and create the worksheets laid out in this document.

Bring loss to lease levels from 6% in year one to 3% per year after 12 months of ownership
Bring rents to market levels in year one then in increase by 3.5% in year two and then 4% per year after 24 months of ownership.
Occupancy remains at an average of 96% per year.
Sales commissions at time of sale are $200,000.
Asset value at time of sale is calculated using a 6% CAP rate.

Risk Factors
Investment in the Partnership involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for sophisticated investors and requires the financial ability and willingness to accept the high risks and lack of liquidity inherent in an investment in the Partnership. No assurance, representation or warranty can be given that the Partnership’s investment objectives will be achieved or that investors will receive a return of their capital.
An investment in Units is subject to risk. Standard risks applicable to investments of this nature include:

No market for Units – There is currently no resale market for these Units and it is not guaranteed that any market will develop. The Units are not transferable without the approval of General Partner and in compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations.
Vacancy Rates – The apartment building business relies on a steady supply of good quality tenants. A shortage of quality tenants due to an economic down turn or job losses in a given market place could result in higher than expected vacancy and lower than expected revenue.
No guaranteed return – The projected returns described in this Investment Summary are not guaranteed. An investment in Units is not suitable for investors who cannot afford to assume significant risks in connection with their investments.
Tax matters – Investors should consult their own tax advisors for advice with respect to the tax consequences of an investment in the Units based on their particular circumstances.
The limited partnership intends to acquire units in an Arizona Limited Liability Partnership (the “LLP”). The Arizona Limited Liability Partnership will own all of the issued units of an Arizona Limited Liability Limited Partnership, which will be the owner of the property. The limited partnership will own units in the LLP along with the Equity Investor.
In the event of a refi nance of the property, the Equity Investor and the limited partnership will be entitled to participate in the net proceeds of the refi nance on a pari passu basis. Investors should note that pursuant to the terms of the LLP partnership agreement, in the event of a sale of the property the Equity Investor will receive a return of all of its equity invested in the LLP prior to the limited partnership of any of the limited partnership’s equity invested in the LLP. For more information, investors are advised to contact the principals of the limited partnership and to review all of the various agreements governing the relationships described herein.
