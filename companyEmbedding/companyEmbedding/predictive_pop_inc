Predictive Biotech, Inc. Completes Development Of Allograft Stem Cell Liquid Suspension Product

  2















Company Introduces Its Latest Innovation In Regenerative Treatment Solutions 
Salt Lake City, UT — (May 16, 2016) – Predictive Technology Group, Inc. (OTC PINK: PRED), announces that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Predictive Biotech, Inc. has finalized the development process of a new allograft stem cell product derived from umbilical cord blood (UCB).
The use of UCB stem cells has gained popularity in medical science owing to their ability to transform into any type of human cells. UCB refers to the blood and tissue that remains in the attached umbilical cord and placenta after childbirth. UCB derived stem cells are considered unique in their applicability in treating many different diseases and disorders including fusion, wound healing, pain management, genetic and hematopoietic disorders.
Eric Olson, President and CEO of Predictive Biotech, Inc., said, “We are very excited to announce that we have completed the development of our latest biologic product. The ‘CoreCell’ liquid suspension product which is rich in proteins and cells is a strong addition to our current regenerative product portfolio.”
Mr. Olson continues, “The new ‘CoreCell’ product added to our allograft portfolio brings together a full selection of regenerative solutions in three core products, UBC, amniotic liquid suspension products, and amniotic membrane. This group of allograft products gives our clinicians the flexibility to choose the optimum solution depending on the patient indication and personal preference.
Predictive Biotech is currently negotiating with several large orthobiologic distributors to launch the product domestically and internationally. The Company is also considering private label opportunities and plans to eventually distribute the product through its own direct sales organization.

(PRED), through its wholly owned subsidiaries, revolutionizes the treatment of severe and debilitating diseases through the commercialization of novel therapeutics leveraged by proprietary gene-based companion diagnostics. The Company develops and acquires proprietary technologies that open windows into the origin of human illness and the role that genes and their related proteins play in diseases’ onsets and progressions. PRED’s subsidiaries use gene-based information as cornerstones in the development of new diagnostics that assess a person’s risk of illness and therapeutic products designed to prevent and treat diseases effectively, www.predictivetechnologygroup.com and www.predrx.com.

INTRODUCTION

Milk is a favoured medium for the growth of many microorganisms that cause spoilage. However, widespreadadoption of refrigerated storage of bulk raw milk and its subsequent delivery to the processing plants in cold chain has largelyeliminated spoilage of milk due to undesirable organisms. This handling system of raw milk has resulted in the emergence of psychrotropic group of organisms that can multiply rapidly at or below 7



C irrespective of their optimum growth temperature.The psychrotropic spore formers remain in heat processed cold stored milk and otherdairy foods. These psychrotropic sporeformers are the reasons for spoilage of milk and milk products. The presence of these organisms in milk and milk productsindicate not only unsanitary conditions but also the poor keeping quality of the products. Presence and multiplication of psychrotropic spore formers in milk is not only of concern as a public health hazard due to production of toxin by certainstrains but also a cause of economic losses through spoilage.The number of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria present in food has both health and financial implications and is of concern to everybody from food producers and processors to retailers and consumers. Traditional methods for enumeratingbacteria are not instantaneous and hence information only on the number of organisms that were present at the sampling timecan be gained. It is often desirable to know the current bacterial population or the number that will be present in the future if aproduct is subjected to particular treatments. Information oninitial levels of contamination combined with knowledge on howbacterial number change allows present and future levels to be predicted.Food microbiology has adopted modern methods and novel concepts with some reluctance. Many foodmicrobiologists follow the “old fashioned” approach of enumerating microbes at different stages of food storage, identifyingthe major fractions of the microflora by their phenotypic characters, and gradually building up an understanding of the shelf-life and safety of foods.However it is slow and expensive, and has not led to a cumulative, structured database of informationthat can be interrogated quickly. Study of the effects on microbial growth of single controlling factors such as temperature, pHor water activity, resulted in acceptance that particular microbes of concern would not grow below certain temperatures, orbelow a certain pH value or water activity. Some scientists recognized that other factors were important e.g. the compositionof the atmosphere above the food, preservatives, food structure, but the experiments needed to cover the effects of all thosefactors appeared enormous and beyond the scope of individual food microbiologists. Not until the problem was viewed fromanother perspective was progress made.All foods contain water, have a pH value and a temperature of storage. If the growthresponse determined by those “controlling factors” could be measured, then modeled, the result would indicate how muchgrowth could be attributed to those three factors.If the differences between the calculated and observed responses weresignificant, other factors would have to be taken into account.Predictive microbiology is a description of the microbial response to a particular environmental condition, usingmodelsas a basis on which predictions are made. The models use experimental data, and equations (known as algorithms), toproduce a prediction. A prediction should be used as a guide to the response of an organisms to a particular set of conditions.Predictivemicrobiology is used to assess the risks of food processing, distribution, storage and food handling; and toimplement control measures in order to protect the microbiological quality of foods, important for both food safety andproduct quality.

SOME EXAMPLES OF THE USE OF PREDICTIVE MICROBIOLOGY:-



Evaluating the safety and stability of new formulations and identifying one that gives the desired shelf-life.



Identifying potentially dangerous formulations.

Predicting the time taken by yeast to spoil a fruit juice.

Identify which microorganisms are likely to be the limiting factors with regard to food safety and spoilage.Predictive microbiology is based on the hypothesis that growth is an intrinsic characteristic of the organism and willoccur reproducibly inthe same environment. Thus by measuring growth once it is possible to tell how a future population willdevelop under the same conditions. In its simplest form, these types of predictions can be made from graphs showing thenumber of bacteria measured in samples taken during growth against time. The points on the growth curve will show a trendallowing the population at any time to be estimated by interpolation. The trend can also be described mathematically by agrowth function.Its earliest appearance isprobably Esty and Meyer (1922), who described the thermal death of 

Clostridium botulinum

type. A spores by a log-linear model, which is still used to estimate the necessary heat processing of low-acid canned foods.This model simply says that, at a given temperature, the relative (or specific) death rate of the bacteria is constant with time.In other words, the percentage of the cell population inactivated in a unit time is constant.A step forward was taken by Scott (1936), who investigated how the specific death rate depended on the availablewater, quantified today by the so-called water activity, a dimensionless number between 0 (dry) and 1 (wet). He subsequentlystudied the effect of the temperature on the specific microbial death rate.It is generally agreed that the most important environmental factor determining growth is the temperature, followedby the pH and water activity; followed by preservatives, antimicrobials and the composition of the atmosphere. However,while the temperature is controllable during the storage of the food, the other environmental conditions are not. Furthermore,they can be changed by the growing bacteria, and they can affect each other (interactions). This increased the need fordynamic models, when the constant environment would just be a special case (zero-variation) of the general scenario, whenthe environment can change with time. Another aim was to use more mechanistic models, i.e. to describe the mechanismbehind the observed process by models based on laws of fundamental sciences; as opposed to the empirical models drivenprimarily by data-fitting.McMeekin et al. (1993) defined it as a quantitative science that enables users to evaluate objectively the effect of processing, distribution and storage operations onthe microbiological safety and quality of foods. Later, the same authorsused the expression “Quantitaive Microbial Ecology of Food”, which is a somewhat more generic description. The most recent book on the field (McKellar and Xu, 2003) puts more emphasison the need to describe the microbial response to the foodenvironments by mathematical models.Baranyi and Roberts published three papers (1993, 1994 and 1995) that gave a good mathematical basis formechanistic modeling of the lag phase. That theory was recently validated experimentally by Elfwing et al. (2004) using a flowchamber and an automated image analyzer to enable observation of divisions of thousands of single cells, and to derivestatistical distributions of them. By the 190s, the square-root(secondary) model of Ratkowsky (1983) had become the most popular to describe the effect of temperature on the specific growth rate. Just 20 years ago very few food microbiologistsbelieved that models of microbial growth and death would never be sufficiently reliable to be used in the food industry, or byfood regulators. From the early empirical models, a new generation of modeling approaches, together with internationalcollaboration, has opened the door to the possibility of predicting growth and deathproperties for the key microorganisms infood.
