About Keith Mestrich, President & CEO, Amalgamated Bank
	Keith Mestrich is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Amalgamated Bank. The bank, a uniquely progressive institution headquartered in New York City with 14 branches in the metropolitan area, has $4 billion in commercial assets and operates a Trust and Investment Management business with over $40 billion of assets under management. Amalgamated Bank also maintains offices in Washington, DC and Los Angeles, and has a national customer base.

	Keith brings with him 25 years of experience working with the bank's core constituencies in the labor movement, non-profit advocacy groups, progressive philanthropy, and political organizations. Keith joined Amalgamated in June of 2012 and directed the bank's Washington Region where he coordinated the bank's operations.

	In describing what makes the Amalgamated Bank such a special place, Keith explains:


		We have a unique heritage. We were founded by a union of immigrants nearly a century ago and began as the bank for working people. We proudly enabled everyone to participate fully in our financial system and work towards achieving the American Dream. We pioneered free savings accounts, checking accounts, unsecured credit and second chance bank accounts for those people who had credit problems in the past.

		 

		We have a unique mission and vision. Our mission is to be the progressive bank for the progressive community. We want to create a financial institution specifically designed for organizations, companies and people who share a progressive vision of wanting to make an impact and a difference on society. Our customer base – which includes the Democratic Party, leading campaign committees, thousands of labor unions, non-profits and foundations – are active, involved and committed to making our communities stronger, smarter, fairer, cleaner and safer. We are a bank that understands their needs, offers expert advice and guidance and ultimately, provides the financial solutions necessary to reaching their goals. By funding and investing in them, we help our customers reimagine, rebuild and reform society.

		 

		We have a unique culture. We’re as progressive-minded as our customers. We were the first bank to raise our wage to $15 an hour for all employees. When customers open accounts or use their debit cards, we contribute money to progressive organizations. We help fund affordable housing. We have advocated for paid sick leave, and fair wages. We volunteer and get involved in our community.

		 

		There are 5,000 banks in America, all with similar products and services. But we believe that we are the only one that truly understands, enables and celebrates the progressive community.


	Prior to joining Amalgamated Bank, Keith served as the Chief Financial Officer and Deputy Chief of Staff for the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). In his capacity at SEIU, Keith also served as a trustee on three separate Taft-Hartley funds and on the Investment Committee for the SEIU Master Trust.

	Keith is a 25-year veteran of the labor movement, beginning his career as a researcher at the AFL-CIO where he gained experience assisting unions on hundreds of organizing, bargaining and political campaigns. In 2002, Keith went to work for UNITE, the bank's majority shareholder, where he served in various capacities including Director of Corporate Affairs, President of one of the union's locals and Executive Assistant to the International President. Following the formation of Worker's United, Keith was named the new union's first Chief of Staff.

	Keith is a Fellow of the inaugural class of the Finance Leaders Fellowship Program and a member of the Aspen Global Leadership Network. He currently serves on the Board of Directors of The Roosevelt Institute, Democracy Alliance, Progressive Congress, Sidney Hillman Foundation, Capital and Main, The Workers Lab, Working America Education Fund, The Public Utility Law Project, Hot Bread Kitchen and the Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition. He serves on the Advisory Boards of Girls Who Invest and The Patriotic Millionaires, is a Trustee on the Consolidated Retirement Fund, and was recently named one of Washington Life Magazine’s “Power 100” top influencers.

	Keith received a degree in Political Science and Public Policy from Kalamazoo College where he graduated magna cum laude and was inducted as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He lives in Washington, DC with his wife and family.

Testimonials:
Keith H. and his associates were so helpful throughout this whole process. We are first time home buyers and we are so thankful for him taking the time to explain every step in detail and ensure we were comfortable with the process. He absolutely went above and beyond in his role. 
-Katharine Murphy 
 "Everyone was super attentive, responsive and answered all questions I had. The finance and house purchase could not have gone any smoother and that was a big credit to the team at Leader Bank."
-Erik Harris
 
"Keith and Leader Bank did a fantastic job and made the mortgage and lending process a breeze!  We were working on a tight timeline and financing through the VA, but Keith and his team made sure we hit all our deadlines and had our loan ready in time for closing without any hiccups or surprises.  In addition to getting us a great rate, Keith and Kerry were approachable and responsive when we had questions, and their personal touch made it feel like our mortgage was as important to them as it was to us.  Thanks again for all your help, and for such a wonderful homebuying experience!"
-Timothy McGuiness
 
"I have been in the real estate business for awhile now and have worked with a lot of different mortgage people. Keith by far has been incredibly responsive and on top of his game. Buyers that have done business with him have nothing but praise for a job well done."
- Marie Zorn
 
"Aside from being extremely personable, Keith went above and beyond (including contacting me over a holiday weekend) during my experience... I spoke with Keith nearly every day for a month, and his professional demeanor never changed - he was always prompt, knowledgeable, and very reliable. I trusted Keith throughout the mortgage process, and he over-delivered 10-fold on my initial expectations. I'd recommend Keith (and his support team) many times over."
- Alex Mathews
 
"Keith is FANTASTIC. I cannot say enough about him. He is fast, responsive, and knows the market. He timed our rates exactly, and he gave us the smoothest transaction I've ever had with a real estate purchase. Plus, I just trust him. You will go back to Keith again and again, because when you've found the best person for you, there's no reason to look anywhere else."
- Katherine Huang
 
"I had the pleasure of working with Keith on a real estate transaction. He was detailed, precise, and his follow-up was impeccable. I would recommend Keith to anyone who is truly looking to work with a professional in the mortgage lending industry."
- JoAnn Drabble
 
"What can I say about Keith Hapenney and Kerry McCarthy? They were truly remarkable throughout this entire process. This is an email I sent to them after we closed: "Hi Guys, Katie, Violet, Lincoln, and I wanted to say thank you very much for all your help, knowledge, and hand-holding throughout this very long (sometimes very difficult!) home buying process. Leader Bank came highly recommended to us and we now know why. You've helped make another dream come true and we look forward to continue working with y'all. (<= getting that North Carolina lingo down) Have a great weekend and thanks again for everything."
- The Connors Family
 
"I worked with Keith Hapenney. We were in touch last year and met at his office. At that time he told me that I wouldn't be eligible to apply for a mortgage until February. No games, no stringing me along, no false promises and most importantly no BS! February 2016 came along and I called him back and we got started right away. No repeated requests for the same info over and over because someone "lost" my paperwork, something that can and does happen frequently with other lenders. He helped me pick a lawyer, Patrick Devine, who also was very good. The Gill Devine law offices were responsive to my questions and timely with answers. The whole experience was positive, everyone was supportive and understood when I said I was excited and nervous at the same time. This condo is a dream come true for me, and I am grateful and thankful for being referred to Keith and his team."   - Janice Cohen
 
"Keith was awesome! I really appreciate how patient he was in explaining the process each step of the way, often more than once. As a result, my husband and I were able to close on our first house feeling confident. Thank you!
- Katelyn Boles
 
"The team was very helpful and took the time to answer all of my questions. They worked with me to make it work for our specific situation and were always friendly and informative."   - Kristin Krukenberg
 
"Keith provided an itemized sheet early in the process that let me know approximate closing costs. This level of transparency was very helpful and encouraging."
-Benjamin Hoerner 
"Keith Hapenney and his associates were excellent in every way. They gave me every detail of paperwork I needed to submit; any questions I had were answered promptly and clearly; and they kept me informed of where I was in the mortgage process. Keith was recommended by my daughter and I will definitely recommend him to my friends if the need arises."

Amalgamated Bank names Keith Mestrich PresidentLargest Union-Owned Bank Chooses Progressive Leader to Support GrowthNEW YORK, April 25, 2014 – Amalgamated Bank is pleased to announce that Keith Mestrich has been named its President to further its mission of providing affordable and accessible banking for all. Mestrich, who most recently served as the bank’s Chief of Staff, worked in the labor and progressive movements for more than two decades prior to joining Amalgamated Bank. Gabriel Caprio will continue as interim CEO.
“Keith is ideally suited to lead the bank,” said Noel Beasley, Chairman of Amalgamated Bank and President of Workers United. “His unique combination of progressive leadership, financial and operational acumen and passion for great service will help us solidify our reputation as the preeminent financial institution for working families, progressive organizations and businesses and labor.”
“I am humbled to have the opportunity to help lead a bank with such amazing clients and such a proud history,” Mestrich said. “I look forward to ensuring that Amalgamated Bank will build on the foundation it has created over nearly a century—one of high-quality, affordable and accessible banking. I will also work to make Amalgamated Bank even stronger in areas that already set us apart, like our customer-friendly experience and commitment to making banking opportunities available for all.”
Before joining Amalgamated Bank in 2012 as head of its Washington, D.C., operations, Mestrich spent 25 years in the labor movement with Workers United, SEIU and the AFL-CIO. Keith is a board member for the D.C. Employment Justice Center and the National Consumers League. He has been active for a many years in Democratic Party politics.

The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America founded the bank in 1923 so that working people would have a place to bank at a time when other banks were not interested in them. Today, Amalgamated continues to advance the rights of workers through shareholder activism, products and services designed to protect workers and advocacy efforts, like supporting the successful campaign for paid sick days in Washington, D.C.
About Amalgamated Bank Established in 1923 by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, Amalgamated Bank continues the progressive traditions of its founders as the largest majority union-owned bank in the United States. The Bank’s corporate divisions include Retail and Small Business Banking, Investment Management, Commercial Banking, and Commercial Real Estate Finance. Amalgamated has 24 retail branches including 20 in New York City as well as branches in: Las Vegas, Nevada; Lyndhurst, New Jersey; Pasadena, California, and Washington, D.C.






I am humbled to have the opportunity to help lead a bank with such amazing clients and such a proud history.Keith Mestrich, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff
