What sort of products can I find keratin in and why is it used?



So now you know what keratin is, you probably want to know where you can find it and what it can do for your hair, right?



The good news is Keratin is found in a range of hair shampoos, conditioners, treatments for damaged and colored hair; but you’ll have to do some careful ‘label checking’ next time you’re shopping.
The purest type of keratin is the one we discussed in the last blog post – grown right  in the country of the Lord of the Rings’ ‘Middle Earth’ – yep little old New Zealand from their most common woolly mammals – sheep!
So wherever you shop, whether in the supermarket, drug store or at the hairdresser – what you want to look for is products that contain (the purest stuff) Replicine Functional Keratin technology.  This sometimes appears on the label as Keratin or oxidized keratin. 

Some products sound like they contain Keratin (they use keratin in their product name to falsely mislead you, the consumer) but they don’t actually list keratin in their ingredients, or may only have hydrolyzed keratin, which is so far from being real keratin that it doesn’t do much.
So why is it used? And what are the benefits?
Replicine Functional Keratin technology contains a purified form of keratin intermediate filament protein manufactured purely, as mentioned before, from New Zealand sheep wool. The intermediate filament protein is the protein that gives natural hair fibers their strength.
This protein is really clever in how it works:

It coats the outside of the hair shaft in a shield which protects from nasty pollutants.
It penetrates the hair fibers and starts working to heal hair from the inside out.

The combined action makes it so effective – it’s basically a liquid form of hair!
As well as healing your hair from the inside out, it takes on the damage itself so your hair doesn’t! How cool is that?!
The nasty environmental pollutants that damage hair include cigarette smoke, UV radiation, and sulfur dioxide gas (from car and truck exhaust fumes).

It’s especially important to use Replicine Functional Keratin technology after chemically straightening hair, because the straightening agent formaldehyde destroys the hair structure in the straightening process and the keratin is what ‘heals’ it again.
In the next blog post we’ll discuss exactly how to decipher that scientific jargon on the back of your hair care products…so stay tuned!

It would be nice to get an answer to your question.  I am asking the same thing but all I seem to get is an explanation on how it works and what to look for in the ingredients.  I looked at all the shampoes and conditioners in 2 stores, not one of them had Replicine Functional Keratin in it.  
I can find it on-line for 100 + That is ridicules.

I cannot verify what kind of Keratin is in this product until I go there and read the ingredients.  Hope it is the real thing and not Hydrolized Keratin because it is useless.

When you look at the ingredients list of this product you see Keratin, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Oxidized Keratin. The Keratin and Oxidized Keratin components are the right forms of keratin providing good performance.

Unfortunately Replicine Functional Keratin is not yet available in South Africa. Kerastase products do not contain any keratin of any type. The name often makes people think that it should contain keratin, but unfortunately that is not the case.

I live in North America. I was super excited about the new Suave keratin infusion smoothing shampoo and conditioner, but after reading that article on real and “fake” keratin I found out the suave thing uses Hydrolized Keratin! It got really good reviews but I don’t know if it will be as good as real keratin. Is there any cheap local-ish shampoo and conditioner with real keratin?

Awapuhi wild ginger, from Paul Mitchell, contains keratin and oxidized keratin, these are real keratins that provide great performance and is available widely in North America. Also look out for treatment products with Replicine Functional Keratin, this is the latest and most concentrated form of the real keratin technology ever produced.

That’s a bit of an open ended question…there is a great deal that could be said on keratins, products that contain keratins and what they can do for you! Perhaps it would be helpful to talk a bit about the functionality of the different keratin ingredients that are available out there?
“Hydrolyzed Keratin” is from a process where a keratin source is treated with a chemical such as caustic, which breaks up the keratin into small water soluble components known as peptides. These will contain a few – usually less than 10- amino acids linked together. Amino acids are the basic building blocks of all proteins and there are 20 that are most common. The peptides are small so able to transfer easily across the skin and get into the crevices in your hair. They will also draw water into your skin with them so acting as a “humectants”. But, because of the process by which they have been extracted from the Keratin source, they will form only weak attachments with the proteins in hair and have lost much of their original functionality.
In contrast Replicine™ Functional Keratin® is produced by patented processes that retains the functionality of the keratins. Replicine™ contains three broad groups of Keratins which are listed in the ingredients as: Keratin, Hydrolyzed Keratin and Oxidized Keratin, or as subsets of these three groups. The” Keratin” has been extracted from New Zealand sheep wool by a gentle process that retains the full length of the proteins and their functionality.  These large proteins, also known as Intermediate Filament proteins, have fascinating properties and are able to form films and realign with each other back into the helical forms that are present in keratin structures. They are great for providing a protective layer to hair and skin. And because the functionality of the cysteine amino acids has been retained in the keratins they are able re-crosslink with your hair to form durable bonds that can help with small cracks and tears in the shaft and in the protective cuticle layer of your hair.
 Like  “Hydrolyzed Keratin”  extracted via other processes the Hydrolyzed Keratin that is the second group in Replicine™  Functional Keratin®, is small and able to penetrate into your skin and the hair shaft drawing in moisture along with it. However in contrast to conventional Hydrolyzed Keratin Replicine™ Hydrolyzed Keratins still retains the functionality of the cysteine amino acids and so are able to crosslink with the keratin of your hair.
The Oxidized Keratin within Replicine™ has been shown through science research, to have some amazing properties. This ingredient is used in wound healing products as it accelerates the rate of healing through increasing activity of keratinocytes in the wound. It has also been shown to promote the production of collagens 4 and 7, which are situated in the skin at the dermal-epidermal junction. This helps to repair and strengthen the junction, and incidentally reversing the development of wrinkles which begin at this point through the aging loss of collagen 4 and 7. Oxidised Keratin has retained the amino acid sequence of the original keratin source and is able align with the proteins in hair forming what are known as ”hydrogen bonds” and “salt bridges” to help repair to give hair back its strength and shine. 
Collectively, these keratin types within  Replicine™ Functional Keratin® promote the production of glutathione within the skin, which is the cells own master antioxidant which helps counteract the impacts of environmental stress and aging.
That’s a fairly whirlwind description of the different types of keratins and their activity in skin and in hair, as discovered through the recent research undertaken with Replicine. If you have any more questions please come back to us!

Care of the hair and care of the scalp skin may appear separate, but are actually intertwined because hair grows from beneath the skin. The living parts of hair (hair follicle, hair root, root sheath, and sebaceous gland) are beneath the skin, while the actual hair shaft which emerges (the cuticle which covers the cortex and medulla) has no living processes. Damage or changes made to the visible hair shaft cannot be repaired by a biological process, though much can be done to manage hair and ensure that the cuticle remains intact..’

You are quite right that damages to the hair shaft cannot be repaired by a biological process. However it is possible to “glue” small splits in the shaft and cuticle with an appropriate material. Replicine™ Functional Keratin® has been extracted from clean New Zealand sheep wool and is the same as the keratins in your hair. Unlike other extraction processes the Replicine™ process is able to extract the long proteins intact, retaining the amino acid sequences, while also maintaining the crosslinking functionality of the cysteine that holds the proteins together in your hair naturally. These properties allow the Replicine™ proteins to align with the proteins in your hair and form durable bridges across spaces where the hair shaft has begun to come apart. The Replicine™ Functional Keratin® will also coat the hair shaft crosslinking with the cuticle of your hair to provide a smooth and glossy protective layer; helping to add body and shine to your hair. But unlike silicones these proteins are chemically identical to your hair so do not interfere with the transfer of dyes or conditioning agents.

Hi Tolu,

BHAVE sell a range of Keratin based treatments- including a smoothing treatment which is very gentle. They are selling into South Africa and may have plans for the rest of the continent. You could ask them on their facebook or salon selector page. Please see the links below :

Hi Arianna,
I haven’t heard of a leave-in with Keratin that would make your hair less curly. I have wavy hair myself and I use a Keratin based leave-in to keep it wavy. You might want to check that the product you are using isn’t a smoothing product as that will have other chemicals in it that will reduce your curls.

Hi Basha,
I received your Keratin Blog Question.
Yes you can use a keratin conditioner every single day.   Using a daily conditioner adds a layer of protection that guards against harsh products or heating tools.  Some shampoos contain strong detergents that can strip hair of moisture.  Use shampoos and conditioners that are free of sulfates, parabens, and sodium.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

The Rogaine® Brand's Minoxidil Difference




" I too was a doubter for years but I am now a lifetime user of this product!"






Do something about thinning hair 
At the first signs of thinning hair, use ROGAINE® brand, the #1 dermatologist-recommended brand for hair regrowth. No other topical hair loss treatment has been proven to grow thicker, fuller hair faster than ROGAINE® brand—and satisfaction is guaranteed.








What makes ROGAINE® brand different?
Unlike thickening shampoos which temporarily coat the hair, ROGAINE® products penetrate the scalp so that new, fuller and thicker hair can be grown.
Start getting results







Discover the game-changing ingredients of ROGAINE® Foam




Minoxidil works to boost hair follicle activity and hair protein production
While minoxidil works to boost hair follicle activity and hair protein production for long-lasting hair density when used daily, ROGAINE® Foam’s patented formulation with Tricho-Prime™ Technology starts to work on contact to create the optimal hair growth environment, with:






Botanical extracts and emollient help maintain a healthy conditioned scalp



Alphahydroxy acid (AHA) promotes natural skin exfoliation to help keep follicles open






What is minoxidil?
In the 1980s, scientists discovered that minoxidil, being studied for other indications, actually showed signs of regrowing hair. They then applied this discovery to produce ROGAINE®, the first topical minoxidil brand FDA-approved to regrow hair.
In ROGAINE® Brand products, minoxidil delivers results by reactivating your hair's natural growth cycle by reinvigorating hair follicles that are shrunken due to hereditary hair loss.
Today, the ROGAINE® Brand is the #1 dermatologist-recommended brand for hair regrowth.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
