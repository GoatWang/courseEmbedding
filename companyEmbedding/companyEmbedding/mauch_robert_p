AmerisourceBergen's Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
      Statements


      Certain of the statements contained in this presentation are
      "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the
      Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
      1934. Words such as "expect," "likely," "outlook," "forecast," "would,"
      "could," "should," "can," "will," "project," "intend," "plan,"
      "continue," "sustain," "synergy," "on track," "believe," "seek,"
      "estimate," "anticipate," "may," "possible," "assume," variations of
      such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such
      forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's
      current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change in
      circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of future performance
      and are based on assumptions that could prove incorrect or could cause
      actual results to vary materially from those indicated. Among the
      factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
      projected, anticipated, or implied are the following: changes in
      pharmaceutical market growth rates; price inflation in branded and
      generic pharmaceuticals and price deflation in generics; declining
      economic conditions, increased costs of maintaining, or reductions in
      AmerisourceBergen's ability to maintain, adequate liquidity and
      financing sources, and interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate
      fluctuations; the disruption of AmerisourceBergen's cash flow and
      ability to return value to its stockholders in accordance with its past
      practices, disruption of or changes in vendor, payer and customer
      relationships and terms, and the reduction of AmerisourceBergen's
      operational, strategic or financial flexibility; volatility and
      disruption of the capital and credit markets; economic, business,
      competitive and/or regulatory developments in countries where
      AmerisourceBergen does business and/or operates outside of the United
      States; supplier bankruptcies, insolvencies or other credit failures;
      customer bankruptcies, insolvencies or other credit failures; the loss
      of one or more key customer or supplier relationships resulting in
      changes to the customer or supplier mix; the retention of key customer
      or supplier relationships under less favorable economics or the adverse
      resolution of any contract or other dispute with customers or suppliers;
      risks associated with the strategic, long-term relationship between
      Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (including its subsidiaries Walgreen Co.
      and Alliance Boots GmbH) and AmerisourceBergen, including the occurrence
      of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the
      termination, cross-termination or modification of any of the transaction
      documents among the parties (including, among others, the distribution
      agreement or the generics agreement), an impact on AmerisourceBergen's
      earnings per share resulting from the issuance of the warrants to
      subsidiaries of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., an inability to realize
      anticipated benefits (including benefits resulting from participation in
      the Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH joint venture),
      AmerisourceBergen's inability to implement its hedging strategy to
      mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the issuance of its common
      stock under its special share repurchase program due to its financial
      performance, the current and future share price of its common stock, its
      expected cash flows, competing priorities for capital, and overall
      market conditions; increasing governmental regulations regarding the
      pharmaceutical supply channel; federal and state government enforcement
      initiatives to detect and prevent suspicious orders of controlled
      substances and the diversion of controlled substances, federal and state
      prosecution of alleged violations of related laws and regulations, and
      any related litigation, including shareholder derivative lawsuits or
      other disputes relating to our distribution of controlled substances;
      changes in federal and state legislation or regulatory action affecting
      pharmaceutical product pricing or reimbursement policies, including
      under Medicaid and Medicare, and the effect of such changes on
      AmerisourceBergen's customers; frequent changes to laws and regulations
      in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse and the increased scrutiny of
      the federal government related thereto; qui tam litigation for alleged
      violations of fraud and abuse laws and regulations and/or any other laws
      and regulations governing the marketing, sale, purchase and/or
      dispensing of pharmaceutical products or services and any related
      litigation, including shareholder derivative lawsuits; the acquisition
      of businesses that do not perform as AmerisourceBergen expects or that
      are difficult for it to integrate or control or AmerisourceBergen's
      inability to successfully complete any other transaction that it may
      wish to pursue from time to time; risks associated with
      AmerisourceBergen’s proposed acquisition of MWI, including uncertainties
      as to the timing of the tender offer and the subsequent merger, the
      possibility that various conditions to the consummation of the tender
      offer or the merger may not be satisfied or waived, the effects of
      disruption from the transactions on the respective businesses of
      AmerisourceBergen and MWI and the fact that the announcement or pendency
      of the transactions may make it more difficult to establish or maintain
      relationships with employees, suppliers and other business partners;
      risks associated with international business operations, including
      non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, anti-bribery
      laws and economic sanctions and import laws and regulations; risks
      generally associated with the sophisticated information systems on which
      AmerisourceBergen relies, including significant breakdown or
      interruption of such systems; risks generally associated with data
      privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data;
      changes in tax laws or legislative initiatives that could adversely
      affect AmerisourceBergen's tax positions and/or AmerisourceBergen's tax
      liabilities or adverse resolution of challenges to AmerisourceBergen's
      tax positions; natural disasters or other unexpected events that affect
      AmerisourceBergen's operations; and other economic, business,
      competitive, legal, tax, regulatory and/or operational factors affecting
      AmerisourceBergen's business generally. Certain additional factors that
      management believes could cause actual outcomes and results to differ
      materially from those described in forward-looking statements are set
      forth (i) in Item 1A (Risk Factors) and Item 1 (Business) in the
      Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September
      30, 2014 and elsewhere in that report and (ii) in other reports.

MAUCH, Robert P. Sr. 67, formerly of Staten Island, NY passed away Dec. 29, 2009. Bob, also known as "Papa Bob" and "Doo Wop Bob" was an amazing family and business man. He is truly one of a kind and heaven has now been blessed with a very special angel. Bob moved to Clearwater in 1973. He was a pharmacist who touched many lives through his pharmaceutical knowledge, generosity and humor. Shortly after arriving in Florida he opened an independent pharmacy, Medicine Chest Pharmacy, in Dunedin. He soon began to provide pharmacy services to nursing homes in addition to the community. Bob pioneered long-term care pharmacy. Mauch Care became the largest long-term care pharmacy provider in the state of Florida in the mid 1980s with multiple locations. In his memory, the Robert P. Mauch Sr. Memorial scholarship program at Mercer University will be established to assist aspiring pharmacists. Bob will be remembered as a kind, generous and fun man. He loved music, cooking/grilling, boating, family, business and helping others. He was always the life of any party. Bob is survived by his loving family including his lifelong love Jacqueline Mauch; son Robert P. Mauch Jr. and his wife Susan; daughter Kristine Flemister and her husband Matthew; grand-children Ashley and Adam Mauch; Monica and Caroline Flemister; as well as his father Robert Joseph Mauch of Shrewsbury, NJ; brothers, Richard Mauch of Ocala and Thomas Mauch of Hazlet, NJ; sisters, Judith Bowles of Asbury, NJ and Katherine DeVita of Monroe, CT and many nieces and nephews. Friends and family are invited to celebrate his extraordinary life Jan. 8th from 6-8pm at Sylvan Abbey Funeral Home.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Walgreens deal offers no lasting relief to Rite Aid
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    10:49 AM ET 06/30/2017
                                                


A slimmed-down Rite Aid Corp (RAD) could lose much of its bargaining heft with insurers and makers of branded drugs at a time when it is trying to turn around its flagging pharmacy business, analysts said. Rite Aid (RAD) said on Thursday it would sell nearly half its U.S. stores to larger rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA) after the drugstore operators agreed to scrap a whole-sale merger.

















                                                    Why did these generic drugs' prices jump as much as 85%?
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    8:28 AM ET 06/29/2017
                                                


Drug manufacturers and pharmaceutical middlemen tend to point fingers at each other. On June 13, as members of a Senate health panel gathered to discuss the rising cost of prescription drugs, the prices of 14 common medications were increased by some 20% to 85%. The affected drugs would appear to be unlikely candidates for price hikes.
