Providing Objective Analysis &amp Market Commentary







Our Perspective




Q2 2017 Market CommentarySummer has arrived, and the overall economic outlook for 2017 is positive. Global expansion is gaining momentum as the US, developed and many emerging economies are seeing steady, modest growth. The Dow has continued to push higher into new territory and volatility has remained low. The administration’s ambitious agenda of deregulation, tax reform and fiscal spending has all but stalled as the legislative battles surrounding healthcare and the steady stream of scandals and negative press threaten to push most agenda items into next year. The primary risk facing the markets are geo-political in nature, with North Korea being the main concern.

Q1 2017 Market CommentaryThe New Year is off to a good start as the overall economic outlook for 2017 is positive. An ambitious agenda of deregulation, tax reform and fiscal spending from the new administration combined with strengthening fundamentals has pushed the post-election market rally into record- setting territory. The Dow passed 20,000 for the first time in January, and volatility has been muted for now. Global expansion is gaining momentum as the US, developed and many emerging economies are likely to see steady, modest growth. Most of the risks facing the markets are geo- political this year, as legislative battles in Congress, Trump’s unpredictability, pivotal elections in the UK and Eurozone, and the fast pace of unfolding world events such as in Syria and North Korea will drive headlines.
Read More


Q4 2016 Market Commentary2016 certainly was the year for interesting times. Beginning with the worst January performance since records have been kept, the markets rebounded through the spring. Summer brought more drama and market volatility to global markets as the surprise outcome of the Brexit vote sent markets tumbling. A week later, markets had recovered, and the Dow resumed its push into record high territory. Not to be outdone, fall saw the most contentious and vitriolic election season in memory, culminating in the unexpected win of Donald Trump. The upset victory triggered a market rally in anticipation of a pro-business friendly policy agenda from the new administration, with the Dow closing the year out within striking distance of 20,000.
Read More


Q2 2016 Market CommentarySummer brought more drama and market volatility to global markets during the second quarter of 2016, as the surprising outcome of the Brexit vote sent markets tumbling. The Dow dropped 611 points the day following the vote, and Britain saw its largest one-day drop in the British pound to lows not seen in over three decades. By the quarter’s end a week later, markets had recovered, and the Dow has resumed its push into record high territory. As of this writing, the Dow has just hit six consecutive all-time highs.
Read More


Q1 2016 Market CommentaryDrama and market volatility reached new extremes during the first quarter of 2016, as the first ten days of January proved to be the worst ever on record for the Dow, dating back to 1897. The panicked sell-off was driven by a steep drop in oil prices and plummeting stock prices in China, rather than any change in fundamentals at home. This was then followed by a 5-week, 13% rebound, during which the markets erased January’s losses and pushed into positive territory. Fears linger over China’s slowing economy and global uncertainty in general, but the US economy showed its resiliency in weathering the storm.
Read More


Q4 2015 Market Commentary2015 has proven to be a lackluster year when it comes to annual returns, but the volatility was anything but boring. Much of that volatility was fed by news overseas, as China’s growth rate continued to slow due to a rebalancing of its economy, driving global demand lower, and Bejing’s decision to devalue their currency. However, fundamentals at home have steadily strengthened throughout the year, and while it was a very modest return at 1.38%, the S&P 500 Index finished the year in positive territory for the 7th year in a row.
Read More


Q3 2015 Market CommentaryBe careful what you wish for. After a flat and unremarkable second quarter, U. S. markets saw a great deal of volatility, dropping 11% over the course of seven days in August, giving us our first market correction in over 3 1⁄2 years. This volatility was largely due to short-term, emotional reactions to news abroad - headlines have been dominated by China’s economic slowdown - however, there was nothing on the home front to justify the pullback. The U.S. economy continues to show signs of strong growth, and the markets have already bounced back, reclaiming nearly 10% of the 11% drop in stock prices from August. As of this writing, the S&P 500 Index is only off 1.25% from where it began the year.
Read More


Q2 2015 Market CommentaryOverall, the second quarter proved unremarkable for U. S. markets. Domestically, fundamentals remain strong; both the Dow and Standard & Poor’s 500 indexes set new highs again, only to finish the quarter near where they started. This was largely due to short-term, emotional reactions to news abroad - headlines have been dominated by Greece, China and Puerto Rico’s financial turmoil and difficulties, and the volatility those headlines generated.
Read More


Q1 2015 Market CommentaryAfter losing ground in January, the major indices had a strong February. March saw early losses, then solid gains, with the Dow industrials, S&P 500, and Russell 2000 all hitting closing highs, and the Nasdaq closing above 5000 for the first time in 15 years, just shy of its all-time high.
Read More


Q4 2014 Market CommentaryU. S. markets continued their climb in the third quarter of 2014, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 again setting new records. Concerns over geopolitical instability, slowing global growth and a likely Fed rate increase in 2015 will drive market volatility, as investors nervous of the new highs react to headlines. However, a global recession remains unlikely, and we expect the steady, modest growth we have seen in the economy this year to continue through the fourth quarter of 2014.
Read More


Q3 2014 Market CommentaryMarkets continued to climb in the second quarter of 2014, with the Dow Jones Industrial and S&P 500 setting new records, spurred on by increased manufacturing after the slowdown at the beginning of the year due to an abnormally harsh winter. We expect to see steady, modest growth in the economy through the second half of 2014, as inflation and interest rates remain low. Going forward, the main concern for volatility in the markets is geopolitical instability.
Read More


Q2 2014 Market CommentaryAfter much of the US suffered through a particularly harsh winter, spring has arrived, bringing with it much milder temperatures.  In the first quarter of 2014, domestic markets seemed to mirror the weather.  Following a volatile January, the markets settled down into a rather calm first quarter, with the S&P 500 hovering around 1%.  In the last five years, negative headlines and volatile markets have become so commonplace, that a benign quarter is a nice change of pace as we put the Great Recession in the rear-view mirror and the U.S. economy returns to a more normal business cycle.
Read More


Q1 2014 Market CommentaryAnother new year is upon us, and 2013 turned out to be a stellar year for stocks. With the financial crisis now firmly in the rear-view mirror, and the US economy heading into what is shaping up to be a normalizing expansion cycle, will 2014 be as spectacular? Well, yes and no.
Read More


Q4 2013 Market CommentaryThe fall season is off to a tumultuous beginning, starting with the government shutdown, the renewed fight over raising the debt ceiling, and a woefully rocky roll-out of the enrollment website for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Hundreds of thousands of Federal workers were furloughed, national parks and monuments shuttered, and many public services were frozen, with no productive resolution to the gridlock in an extremely polarized and unpopular Congress.
Read More


Q3 2013 Market CommentaryThe dog days of summer are here, but where are the down days? It would seem that the perennial pessimistic financial journalism that we all are bombarded with continues to fly in the face of reality. While the gloom-and-doom, world-is-coming-to-an-end stories and headlines sold a lot of papers and magazines during the dark days of the financial crisis, that tag line has gotten pretty stale. So here is a reality check.
Read More


Q2 2013 Market CommentarySpring has arrived, and already first quarter 2013 is in the books. The Dow and the S&P 500 continue to break records, surpassing their October 2007 peaks, and finished the quarter up 8.7% and 7.3%, respectively. While the bull market began 4 years ago this month, psychologically, “getting back to where we started” has renewed investor optimism in the markets.
Read More


Q1 2013 Market CommentaryDespite the election, the “fiscal cliff”, the debt, the deficit, the Fed and the deteriorating Eurozone, stocks had a great year in 2012 and continued to rise strongly through January. The S&P 500 index of large U.S. stocks added a monthly gain of 5.1% on top of a 16% gain in 2012. It was the largest January gain since 1997. S&P 500 gains of over five percent in January have happened only twelve other times since 1950, and the market finished the year positive all twelve times, with an average additional gain of 15% over the remaining eleven months.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

 One Man's 9-Minute Secret to Retiring Rich  by Investing Daily Staff - May 1, 2017     Years ago Jim Fink knew he’d need to make a change if he was ever going to retire.
It's a similar problem a lot of Americans are dealing with as they approach retirement.
He had a good job, was squirreling away money in his IRA, and investing in stocks—but wasn’t really getting anywhere.
The piddly returns he was making that way seemed like a waste of time. He needed something better.
Luckily Jim worked at an office building in Chicago, close to the financial district.
One day he ran into a "trader" who shared an approach that would go on to change Jim's life forever.
So Jim started experimenting with the approach he learned...
Before long he was generating extra monthly income like $1,200, $1,800, and $2,100... and all in a matter of weeks!
His nest egg began to grow exponentially, and before long he had turned a mere $50,000 into a massive $5.3 million.
Now, years later, Jim trades full-time—and lets independent-minded investors follow the exact approach he's now perfected.
It’s an easy, step-by-step process that takes just 9 minutes to per week.
Best of all, unlike many risky approaches to making money, there's a built-in safety net unique to his strategy that can make it safer than traditional investing.
In fact, safety-loving Warren Buffett pulled in $4.7 billion following this exact approach not too long ago.
The full story behind how Jim makes his trades is right here.
