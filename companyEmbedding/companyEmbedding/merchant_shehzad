MILPITAS, Calif., April 1, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Gigamon®, a leader in traffic visibility solutions with the innovative Visibility Fabric™ architecture, announced today that enterprise networking veteran Shehzad Merchant has joined the company as Chief Strategy Officer. Merchant will be focused on developing a strategic path for the continued evolution of the company's Visibility Fabric architecture in this exciting and fast-paced market. Merchant joins Gigamon from Extreme Networks.
"Shehzad will play a critical role in driving and evangelizing the strategic vision of our innovative Visibility Fabric architecture. As the world of networking continues to evolve through the increasing adoption of next generation technologies, including virtualization, cloud computing and emerging SDN technology, operators and owners of infrastructure will need increasing visibility and control of the traffic crossing their networks," said Paul Hooper, CEO of Gigamon. "Shehzad's knowledge and experience will allow Gigamon to continue to provide increasing value to our existing and future customers through determined and purposeful thought leadership."
Merchant brings more than 20 years of experience in the networking industry. Prior to joining Gigamon, Merchant served as the CTO at Extreme Networks and prior to that as the co-founder and VP of Products at Polytime Systems. Merchant has also held various senior architectural and research roles at Allied Telesyn, Nevis Networks and SRI. He is the author of several networking and communications patents and is a frequent speaker at industry events, including Interop and Open Networking Summit. He also works closely with many standards groups and organizations, including the IEEE, IETF and ONF. Merchant holds a Masters Degree in Computer Engineering from USC and an Electronic Engineering degree from the University of Mumbai.
"As the need for application performance and security management increases, the monitoring fabric will continue to play an increasingly critical role in bringing visibility to the application flows," said Merchant. "Gigamon is a leader in building traffic visibility systems. The versatility of Gigamon's platforms, its compelling vision and its strong team set it apart as an innovative leader in this space. I am excited to be part of the Gigamon team."
About the Visibility Fabric architecture At Gigamon we realized that delivering the visibility essential to manage, analyze and secure the complex system that is the IT infrastructure requires a new approach. With millions of traffic flows across thousands of endpoints, visibility needs to be pervasive, intelligent and dynamic. Using our patented, unique technology, we created an innovative new approach for delivering this visibility called the Visibility Fabric architecture. This new approach is intelligent and versatile in its ability to enable visibility into the network. For more information visit http://www.gigamon.com/traffic-visibility-fabric. 
About GigamonGigamon provides an intelligent Visibility Fabric™ architecture for enterprises, data centers and service providers around the globe. Our technology empowers infrastructure architects, managers and operators with pervasive and dynamic intelligent visibility of traffic across both physical and virtual environments without affecting the performance or stability of the production network. Through patented technologies and centralized management, the Gigamon GigaVUE portfolio of high availability and high density products intelligently delivers the appropriate network traffic to management, analysis, compliance and security tools. With over eight years' experience designing and building traffic visibility products in the US, Gigamon solutions are deployed globally across vertical markets including over half of the Fortune 100 and many government and federal agencies. www.gigamon.com

A Dialogue With Shehzad Merchant, Gigamon's Chief Technology Officer — ITSPmagazine | Cybersecurity & Infosec News | At the Intersection of IT Security & Society™

A Dialogue With Shehzad Merchant, Gigamon's Chief Technology Officer



Editor


June  2, 2017



Shehzad Merchant, InfoSec Life, Home Infosec Life F












ITSPmagazine connects with Shehzad Merchant, Gigamon's Chief Technology Officer about his role as CTO for Gigamon, the value of culture in building out a cybersecurity program, and the importance he and his company place on collaboration and innovation beyond traditional R&D roles.ITSPmagazine: Can you please tell us a little bit about yourself?Merchant: I serve as the Chief Technology Officer at Gigamon and have over 20 years of experience in the high-tech industry. Prior to joining Gigamon, I served as the CTO at Extreme Networks and authored several networking and communications patents. I speak at various industry events including Interop and Open Networking Summit, and have been engaged with many standards bodies including the IEEE, IETF and ONF. Before Extreme Networks I was the co-founder and VP of Products at Polytime Systems, following on from various senior architectural and research roles at Allied Telesyn, Nevis Networks and SRI. I have a Masters Degree in Computer Engineering from USC and an Electronic Engineering degree from University of Mumbai.ITSPmagazine: What's a recent accomplishment you'd like to share with our readers?Merchant: Our biggest recent team accomplishment has been building our security operation center (SOC) at the Gigamon offices. Operationalizing the SOC and putting our own infrastructure in place has been a huge success for our technology development team. It has not only given us the ability to mirror our customers’ toughest cybersecurity network visibility problems, but also find solutions and test them out before bringing a finished product to market. Through that we now have the ability to service out different threats and more quickly innovate for our customers.From a more personal perspective, culture is something that can never change unless it is embraced from the top. It must be reflected by all the members of the executive team, and for Gigamon, our goal is to have a culture that enables collaboration and innovation. We strive for this kind of environment across the entire company so that every person in the office can jump in and solve challenging issues without concern about being tied to different teams or projects. It fosters a very positive work environment. An example of this is our infosec and IT teams. Traditionally these two groups are at odds and always pushing against each other because their priorities are different. At Gigamon, we have tried to bridge that gap through our own practices, creating a model where IT and Infosec teams work in a frictionless manner by providing them with the tools they need to accomplish their goals.ITSPmagazine: What inspires and motivates you to do what you do?Merchant: Inspiration really comes from deep inside; it’s sewn into your DNA. I’ve found that I’ve continued to be inspired by people who think outside the box and have a different perspective on how to solve problems. They are the people that don’t say “solve this problem by doing x, y, z.” They are the people that say “why is there a problem?” Thinking this way creates an environment to work hard, have integrity, and be creative, which is where my biggest source of inspiration comes from.I am continuously motivated knowing that I have the ability to make a difference at Gigamon but also across the broader industry. Right now the cybersecurity industry is facing numerous challenges, but along with those challenges are opportunities to actually make things better and help enterprise and public sectors keep their infrastructure safer and secure. Cyber attackers currently have the upper hand, but I think we are at a point where we can leverage technology to shift that advantage back to the defender. In 20, 30, or 40 years from now, the security industry can look back and say “this was a time when cybersecurity shifted.” It is really motivating to me to think Gigamon is a part of such a significant change.ITSPmagazine: How would you describe your impact on society?Merchant: At Gigamon we continuously try to find ways to reach out to our community and drive support in the cybersecurity industry. We recently partnered with UC Irvine as part of their cybersecurity initiative. It is a group that is utilizing the most cutting-edge technologies for research in cybersecurity and Gigamon is sponsoring that initiative. Our company really believes that there is a lot of interesting work being done at universities and that partnering with schools and giving them a place to showcase talented students will ultimately benefit the industry. Gigamon also runs a very effective internship program where we bring in students from all over the country and give them an opportunity to work in a fast-paced, exciting environment while also giving them the freedom to think independently.Gigamon also runs an internal annual global innovation fair. This fair is not just open to R&D and technology employees, it is open to anybody at the company to bring ideas that can be implemented into our products. Through this, we are hoping to encourage innovation and thought leadership all levels across the organization. You never know who may have the next big idea that could change the game for our customers.ITSPmagazine: What's one final thing about the work you've done that you'd like your colleagues, peers, friends and family to know?Merchant: Something that changed my perspective on security was when my son was in 6th grade and he would hack into and jam our home network. While he was doing it to get my attention when I was working at home, it was definitely an eye-opener. He could hack into the network so easily by downloading some readily-available software. Seeing the democratization of malware in my own home was very shocking and just proved how easily available this software is that even a 6th grader could do it. That happened about two years ago and had an impact on the genesis of our whole security delivery platform. It shifted my perspective on who we address and how we view security challenges.About Shehzad MerchantShehzad Merchant serves as Chief Technology Officer of Gigamon bringing over 20 years of experience in the high-tech industry. Prior to joining Gigamon, Shehzad served as the CTO at Extreme Networks, and is the author of several networking and communications patents.More About Shehzad

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.

RDC eBookFive Ways RDC Can Help Boost Your Business














Boost Accounts Receivable Operations with Remote Deposit Capture
Mobile payments have rippled through the industry, creating new payment types and channels, but checks are still king, representing more than half of all B2B remittances in 2013, according to the 2013 AFP Electronic Payments Survey.
Check technology is advancing with technologies like Remote Deposit Capture (RDC) and mobile RDC (mRDC).  Enhanced RDC solutions let you take advantage of workflow automation to reduce the cost of manual data entry, using the technology to develop a solid check-processing foundation. What’s more, advanced RDC solutions can also act as a springboard to integrated receivables solutions that can ultimately handle all payment types and channels from a single platform.

Streamlining Accounts Receivable Processes to Save Time and Money

Many point to RDC as the best kind of innovation: one that sets you up for success down the road, rather than breeding complications that only grow. Companies are wise to identify the value in moving to a single platform that can accommodate all their payments needs, both now and in the future.
But processing is only half of the equation when discussing ‘straight through processing.’ Consolidated settlement, posting, and reconciliation all have to be addressed to create a holistic integrated receivables solution.
Technology and Automation are Powerful Tools
Today's advanced check processing solutions account not only for the front end tasks of capturing check images via RDC and electronically sending them to the bank for deposit, but completely automating the back end processes of seamlessly posting remittance information into your back office AR accounting system(s) upon transmission to your banking institution(s).

Additionally, by joining the pieces of capturing, submitting and posting check-based remittances from a single platform, you gain access to consolidated reporting and reconciliation within that same system. You benefit from greater oversight of your receivables operations and greater clarity into the business decisions that get made as a result. 
By moving to a single, cloud-based, integrated receivables processing platform, you can address your current needs while also building the foundation for the strategic consolidation of your legacy systems and processes. You can develop new business process as the need for them grows, mapping them to the next stage of development as you—and your customers—are ready.

Who Should Get This eBook?
In this free eBook, learn five ways to boost your business with RDC and mRDC, including the key elements to look for in an RDC solution and the pitfalls that can lie ahead.
This eBook is designed for businesses of any size that want to save time and money by streamlining accounts receivable processes, eliminating wasted manual effort, mitigating risks with checks and, best of all, decreasing the time it takes to get your money into the bank.

Mobile Payments eBookPreparing Your Business for Mobile Payments














Five Tips for Successfully Adding Mobile Remittance to your Receivables Mix

Let’s face it, the traditional processes surrounding the processing and management of business-to-business accounts receivable are slow, inefficient and expensive. But both times and technology are changing, giving businesses an opportunity to revamp their processes to be more effective and efficient than ever before.
With consumer reliance on mobile technology growing by the day, combined with increased mobile adoption by businesses, mobile is the next great wave of payment technology for traditional receivables processes. In fact, acoording to a recent Forbes study, 51% of B2B executives say mobile will be their primary business platform within three years.


Impact of Mobile Payment Adoption on Your Business
While mobile payments seem to be a never-ending ‘hot topic,’ with many industry experts talking as if it’s an approaching tidal wave, the reality is that the payment ecosystem is complex – both from a cultural and a technology perspective. That means mobile payments are going to be an incremental revolution, not a sudden, Twitter-style tsunami of adoption that many seem to be anticipating.
What many companies may not realize, is that leveraging mobile payments within existing receivables processes is not only possible, it’s easier than you think – and provides measurable business benefits.
Download this eBook to learn how mobile payments can help your business:

Leverage mobile remote deposit capture (mRDC) to accelerate check remittances
Make the move to mobile invoice presentment
Accept multiple payment methods to meet customer expectations
Improve transaction security
Optimize the integration and consolidation of legacy payment systems to pave your way to success



Who Should Get This eBook?
In this free eBook, learn 5 essential tips to help prepare your business for adopting mobile payments within existing receivables processes, including key criteria essential to the strategic planning and decision-making process for benefiting from mobile payments.
This eBook is designed for any business of any size that is evaluating the adoption of mobile payments from payment-enabled devices.

                                One of Cayan’s strengths is the back-office structure. I’m able to stay focused on selling and know
                              that once I hand it off to the Cayan team, it’s in safe hands – that’s phenomenal. I couldn’t do what
                              I do without that team.

4 steps to succeed in merchant services sales

4 Steps To Succeed in Merchant Services Sales
Every day we speak to potential agents who ask us how they can be successful when selling credit card processing.  There are a lot of factors but we have laid out the top 5 for you below.  Follow these and you will be on your way to a six figure income in the merchant services sales field!
1.  Join the right ISO
This is the single most important factor.  You need to work with a company that will not only support you but will also deliver on their promises to you and your clients.  Look the company up on the BBB, rip off report, www.topcreditcardprocessorrating.com, and www.cardpaymentoptions.com.  If they have bad ratings it is for a reason.  They either do not deliver on their promises to the client, the merchant account sales agent, or both.  We have one of the top rated ISO Agent programs in the country - but shop around - see whats out there - then come back and contact us to learn more about what makes us different! 
2.  Learn your product
Working as a merchant services sales agent is VERY competitive.  You need to make sure that you have as much knowledge as possible when you hit the field.  You can learn most of what you need to know through your ISO Agent program training portal or from your manager at your ISO.  If you ask your manager a question and they don't know the answer then that is a red flag that you are not working for the right company.  Learn as much as you can and NEVER stop learning.  The credit card processing is changing rapidly and you need to keep up to date in order to compete.
3.  Set a schedule for yourself
One of the more difficult parts of working as an independent sales agent in the merchant account field is taking responsibility for your daily actions.  You are your own boss and your success is 100% dictated by your schedule.  Write it up daily and STICK TO IT.  For example:  From 8-10am cold call over the phone, from 10am to 2pm cold call in the field, have an appointment set for 230 every day, then finish your day following up with old clients.  This works for most people - but you really need to work the schedule that best fits your needs.  If you do not plan your day you may get caught up in one activity and your entire day can go to waste.  Plan ahead for success!  Sample Schedule that we suggest you use. 
4.  Referrals Referrals Referrals
This is the single most important way you can grow your business.  Cold calling sucks.  Period.  There is no way around it.  You have to do it in the beginning of your career - but you won't have to do it forever. You need to set a pattern for how you interact and follow up with clients in order to get the most referrals you can from every one.  First:  when you are signing up a new client - set the expectation that you will be coming back in for referrals after you prove your self to them  Second:  After your client has been with you for a full month complete reverse cost comparison to show them the savings you generated.  Finally:  Bring hte cost comparison in to them and ask them for SPECIFIC referrals.  Who is their doctor, veterinarian, mechanic, etc.  DO NOT ask who they know.  Ask them specific questions to get specific answers. 
These 4 steps won't guarantee your success in the merchant services field - but-  they will absolutely help you take the right steps to success.  If you would like to learn more about a career with beacon payments click the link:  Beacon Payments Careers

Stop Cold Calling and start making more sales!



            Stop Cold Calling and start making more sales!
Published 01/18/2017
The majority of the sales people at our company work outside in door to door sales.  This is hands down one of the hardest ways you can build a book of business in any industry.  It is time consuming, exhausting, and the negativity that comes with being told "no" many times daily can lead a person to look for a new career.  BUT  - there is a better way to sell.
If you are a rookie in sales I'm going to give you some bad news right now - you WILL need to start off with a lot cold calling in order to build up a pipeline - but you won't have to forever. So - what is the magic plan to grow your business and sell more deals than anyone else in your company.  Its all about scheduling.
Traditionally sales people have been taught that they need to leave their office and go grind.  Spend 8 hours walking door to door.  Hit every door and every floor.  Talk to everyone.  This is not the answer though - working hard is not always enough to make someone successful  - you need to work smart as well.
You need to set up your day so part of it is spent cold calling (This part will get smaller and smaller as you grow your database of potential clients), part of it is spent at appointments, and part of it is spent on referrals.  This is what a typical day should look like for any outside sales person.
1.  8AM - 10AM Spend the morning reaching out to potential customers that you have not had a chance to sit down with yet via the phone.  You have spent time collecting their information  - most likely cold calling and pulling their business card or just their name and when the best time is to contact them.  Now you are going to reach out to them to try to set up an appointment to sit down with them.  A typical script would be: " I was in the other day to speak to you about X.  I helped some of your neighbors with X and I would like to come in and speak with you for 5 minutes on Tuesday at 3pm."  Then handle any rejections or rebuttals that come your way.  Always offer them a time when you are going to be near them - NEVER ask them what time is good.  They will always say they have no time.  You are going to suggest either 11 am or 3pm.  Hit those calls for 2 hours and start setting as many appointments as you can.
2.  11AM  You are going to have your first of 2 daily appointments at this time.  Hit the area before and after in any spare time you have to do some cold calling/collecting of information so you can reach out to people the next day during you phone session.
3.  1PM.  The middle of the day - lunch - a great time to sit down with an existing client and ask for referrals. Bring them something to eat  - and most importantly - ask for referrals!  The most important part of your day will be getting those referrals and then calling them to set up a meeting.  Nothing is more powerful than calling someone up and saying that their friend told you to call.  People will give you their attention twice as often on a referral than they will on a cold call.  Once you have enough clients you should be constantly going to these lunch meetings and working on referrals.  Just to be clear - his does not mean asking who they know - ask for a very specific type of person or business that you are trying to work with. For example: "I am looking to work with people in the medical field, who is your doctor or dentist, and can I reach out to them"
4.  3PM  This will be your second appointment of the day.  Spend time cold calling around this appointment and information gathering.
5.  5PM.  Get out of the field.  Go home and wrap up your day and start organizing and preparing for the next day.  In sales your day does not truly end at 5pm.   You should spend time after the "work" day getting ready for the next day.  This is what makes the difference between someone earning $80,000 a year and someone earning $500,000 a year.
If you follow this simple plan you will effectively cut your time cold calling down from 8 hours a day to maybe 2-3 hours max. There will be days where you wont even be doing any.  You will eventually hit a point where almost all of your business will be coming from appointments and referrals.  Stick to this schedule and keep track of your daily activity and sales will be much less stressful, you will be happier, and you will make a ton more money.
 If you are looking to start a lucrative career and earn a six figure income please let us know!

Retiree Increases Income by Selling Merchant Services



            Retiree Increases Income by Selling Merchant Services
Published 11/04/2011
Recently we have seen an influx of retired salespeople contacting us looking to re-enter the workforce.  We are more than happy to speak to them as their years of experience can translate well into being a successful outside sales person.  Selling merchant card services is a sales job that does not require experience - but if someone comes to us with a lot of it we are not going to give them a chance to succeed.
A year ago we hired a gentleman in the midwest who had retired 10 years ago and was living on social security.  His checks were just enough to pay his bills - but he wanted something more.  After almost a year of searching for a sales job he had no luck.  He contacted us knowing that while we could not guarantee him a salary - we could give him an opportunity to increase his income substantially on his own timeframe.
After explaining that selling merchant services is one of the last ways to build a residual income in this country he decided to give us a shot.  His first month selling was tough.  it had been a while since he had done any outside sales and he had to re-aquaint himself with dealing with rejection.  He kept at it though, knowing that every no was one step closer to a yes and he was just spending his days filling up his pipeline.
six months later he had brought on over 75 clients and was earning a monthly residual of over $2,000.  While it doesn't sound like much he was almost doubling his social security payment and if he decided he did not want to go out and sell any more he would continue to earn this residual as long as his clients continue to process credit cards with us!
Fortunately he was not happy with only $2,000 a month in residual income.  He kept at it and a year later he has brought in over 175 clients!  His residual is now over $5000 a month!  If he decides to lay back and take a few months off he will continue to earn $60,000 a year!
Like i said - selling merchant card services is one of the last ways to earn a great residual income!  If you would like to learn more please click here or give us a call!
