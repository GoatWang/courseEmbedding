in the Lending Program as a lender (�Lender�) enters into a securities lending authorization agreement (�Lending
Agreement�) with U.S. Bank. Under the Lending Agreement, U.S. Bank is permitted to delegate administration of the Lending
Program to affiliates including USBAM, thereby empowering USBAM with the duties described in the Lending Agreement, specifically
the authority to invest the cash collateral securing loans of securities of each Lender. The Mount Vernon Securities Lending Trust
(the �Trust�) has been established for the investment of cash collateral on behalf of Lenders participating in the Lending
Program.
�
The Trust
offers two series of shares of beneficial interest representing interests in two separate portfolios: Mount Vernon Securities
Lending Prime Portfolio (�Prime Portfolio�) and Mount Vernon Government Portfolio (�Government Portfolio�)
(each a �Portfolio� and collectively the �Portfolios�). USBAM serves as the investment advisor
for each of the Trust�s Portfolios.
�
The investment
objectives, principal investment strategies and principal risks of each Portfolio are described below. See the Statement of Additional
Information for a description of each Portfolio�s investment restrictions.
�
Investment Objectives
�
The Portfolios
seek to:
�

�maximize
current income to the extent consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity; and

�

�maintain
a stable $1.00 per share net asset value (�NAV�) by investing in dollar-denominated securities with remaining
maturities of 397 calendar days or less.

�
The investment
objective of a Portfolio may be changed at any time by the Board of Trustees of the Trust (each a �Trustee� and collectively
the �Board�) upon at least 30 days prior written notice to shareholders of that Portfolio.
�

�
�
Principal Investment Strategies
�
The Portfolios�
principal investment strategies are discussed below. These are the strategies that the Portfolios� investment advisor believes
are most likely to be important in trying to achieve the Portfolios� objectives. You should be aware that each Portfolio may also
use strategies and invest in securities that are not described in this prospectus, but that are described in the Statement of
Additional Information (�SAI�).
�
Principal Investment Strategies
Applicable to Each Portfolio
�
Each Portfolio
complies with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (�SEC�) regulations that apply to money market funds. These
regulations require that each Portfolio�s investments mature within 397 days from the date of purchase and that each fund
maintain a weighted average maturity of 60 days or less and a weighted average life of 120 days or less. The Portfolios may invest
in securities with variable or floating interest rates and securities with demand features. The maturities of these securities
are determined according to regulations which allow the Portfolios to consider some of these securities as having maturities shorter
than their stated maturity dates. All of the Portfolios� investments must be in U.S. dollar-denominated high quality securities
which have been determined by the Portfolios� investment advisor to present minimal credit risk and are rated in one of
the two highest rating categories by one or more nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs) or are deemed
by the investment advisor to be of comparable quality to securities having such ratings. In addition, no more than 3% of each
Portfolio�s total assets may be invested in securities rated in the second highest rating category by an NRSRO or deemed
to be of comparable quality by the Portfolio�s investment advisor at the time of purchase (�second-tier securities�).
With limited exceptions, a Portfolio may not invest more than 5% of its total assets in securities issued by the same issuer.
Each Portfolio is further limited to investing no more than � of 1% in second-tier securities of any issuer. Each Portfolio
must comply with weekly liquidity standards that require a Portfolio to hold at least 30% of its total assets in cash, direct
obligations of the U.S. Government, agency discount notes with remaining maturities of 60 days or less, or securities convertible
into cash within five business days. Each Portfolio must also comply with daily liquidity standards that require a Portfolio to
hold at least 10% of its total assets in cash, direct obligations of the U.S. Government, or securities convertible into cash
within one business day. Each Portfolio is limited to investing no more than 5% of its total assets in illiquid securities.
�
When selecting
securities for each Portfolio, the portfolio managers first consider general economic factors, market conditions, and the short-term
interest rate environment in determining what types of short-term instruments to purchase. The portfolio managers then select
the specific instruments to be purchased. Generally, the portfolio managers buy and hold securities until their maturities. However,
the portfolio managers may sell securities for a variety of reasons, such as to adjust the portfolio�s average maturity,
credit, liquidity or yield metrics.
�
For liquidity
and to respond to unusual market conditions, the Portfolios may hold all or a significant portion of their total assets in cash
for temporary defensive purposes. This may result in a lower yield and prevent the Portfolios from meeting their investment objectives.
�
Prime Portfolio
�
The Portfolio
principally invests in the following high-quality U.S. dollar-denominated instruments, which are further described in the SAI:
�


4
�

�

�securities
  issued or backed by the U.S. Government or its agencies or instrumentalities (�U.S.
  Government Securities�);

�

�instruments
of U.S. and foreign banks, including certificates of deposit, bankers� acceptances and time deposits (including Eurodollar certificates
of deposit (�ECDs�), Eurodollar time deposits (�ETDs�) and Yankee certificates of deposit (�YCDs�));

�

�corporate
debt obligations, including commercial paper of U.S. and foreign companies;

�

�money
market funds;

�

�municipal
securities, including variable rate demand notes, commercial paper, and municipal notes and other short-term municipal obligations;

�

�debt
obligations of foreign governments and foreign government subdivisions and their agencies and instrumentalities and supranational
organizations;

�

�repurchase
agreements;

�

�loan
participation interests;

�

�funding
agreements;

�

�asset-backed
securities; and

�

�floating
and variable rate securities, including variable amount master demand notes.

�
The Portfolio may
invest more than 25% of its assets in obligations of U.S. banks.
�
Government Portfolio
�
The Portfolio
operates as a �government money market fund� within the meaning of Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act (�Rule 2a-7�).
As a government money market fund, the portfolio invests exclusively in cash, government securities, and/or repurchase agreements
that are collateralized fully.
�
As required
by Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act, under normal market conditions, the Portfolio invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus any
borrowings for investment purposes) in short term U.S. government securities, including repurchase agreements secured by U.S.
government securities. U.S. government securities are bonds or other debt obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and
interest by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities. U.S. Treasury securities and some obligations of
U.S. government agencies and instrumentalities are supported by the �full faith and credit� of the U.S. government.
Other U.S. government securities are backed by the right of the issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury. Still others are supported
only by the credit of the issuer or instrumentality.
�


5
�

�
Risk Factors
�
You could
lose money by investing in the Portfolios. Although the Portfolios seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per
share, they cannot guarantee they will do so. An investment in the Portfolios is not a deposit of U.S. Bank and is not insured
or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Portfolios� sponsor has no
legal obligation to provide financial support to the Portfolios, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial
support to the Portfolios at any time. The principal risks of investing in each Portfolio are described below.
�
Prime Portfolio
�
Prime Portfolio
is subject to the following principal risks:
�

�The
value of your investment might decline if the issuer of an obligation held by the Portfolio defaults on the obligation or has
its credit rating downgraded.

�

�Foreign
securities in which the Portfolio invests, even when U.S. dollar denominated and publicly traded in the United States, may involve
risks not associated with the securities of domestic issuers. Political or social instability or diplomatic developments could
adversely affect the securities. There is also the risk of possible withholding taxes, seizure of foreign deposits, currency controls,
interest limitations, or other governmental restrictions that might affect the payment of principal or interest on securities
owned by the Portfolio. In addition, there may be less public information available about foreign corporations and foreign banks
and their branches.

�

�The
level of income you receive from the Portfolio will be affected by movements in short-term interest rates.

�

�The
value of your investment might decline because of a sharp rise in interest rates that causes the value of the Portfolio�s
holdings to fall. This risk is usually greater for longer-term fixed-income securities. Conversely, when interest rates fall,
the value of variable and floating rate securities may appreciate less than comparable fixed-income securities. Effective maturity
and effective duration are measures of the Portfolio�s interest rate risk.

�

�The
Portfolio may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner or at a desired price, or may be unable to sell the security at
all, because of a lack of demand in the market for the security, or a liquidity provider defaults on its obligation to purchase
the security when properly tendered by the Portfolio.

�

�The
value of municipal securities owned by the Portfolio may be adversely affected by future changes in federal income tax laws, including
rate reductions or the imposition of a flat tax, and adverse changes in the financial conditions of municipal securities issuers.

�

�If
there are unexpectedly high redemptions of Portfolio shares, the Portfolio might have to sell portfolio securities prior to their
maturity, possibly at a loss.

�


6
�

�

�If
the seller of a repurchase agreement defaults on its obligation to repurchase securities from the Portfolio, the Portfolio may
incur costs in disposing of the securities purchased and may experience losses if the proceeds from the sale of the securities
are less than the full repurchase price. Securities purchased by the Portfolio under a repurchase agreement may include securities
that the Portfolio is not otherwise permitted to purchase directly, such as long-term government bonds, investment and non-investment
grade corporate bonds, asset- and mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, agency real estate mortgage
investment conduits, and equity securities. The value of these securities may be more volatile or less liquid than the securities
the Portfolio is permitted to purchase directly, which increases the risk that the Portfolio will be unable to recover fully in
the event of the seller�s default.

�

�Investments
in variable rate demand notes involve credit risk with respect to the issuer or financial institution providing the Portfolio
with the credit and liquidity support for the unconditional put option. While the Portfolio invests only in variable rate demand
notes of high quality issuers, or which are supported by high quality financial institutions, it is still possible that an issuer
or financial institution could default on its obligations.

�

�An
adverse development in the banking industry (domestic or foreign) may affect the value of the Portfolio�s investments more
than if the Portfolio was not invested to such a degree in the banking industry. Banks may be particularly susceptible to certain
economic factors such as interest rate changes, adverse developments in the real estate market, fiscal and monetary policy and
general economic cycles. For example, deteriorating economic and business conditions can disproportionately impact companies in
the banking industry due to increased defaults on payments by borrowers. Moreover, political and regulatory changes can affect
the operations and financial results of companies in the banking industry, potentially imposing additional costs and expenses
or restricting the types of business activities of these companies.

�

�To
the extent the Portfolio invests in money market funds advised by another investment advisor, you will bear both a proportionate
share of the expense in the Portfolio and, indirectly, the expenses of such other money market fund.

�

�In
July 2014, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the �SEC�) adopted reforms to money market fund regulation.
The compliance periods for these reforms range between July 2015 and October 2016. When the reforms are implemented, they could
affect the Portfolio�s operations and return potential. In addition, changes to monetary policy by the Federal Reserve or
other regulatory actions could expose fixed income and related markets to heightened volatility, interest rate sensitivity and
reduced liquidity, which may impact the Portfolio�s operations, universe of potential investment options, and return potential.

�

�With
the increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions,
the Portfolio may be subject to operational and informational security risks resulting from breaches in cyber security (�cyberattacks�).
Cyber-attacks include, but are not limited to, infection by computer viruses or other malicious software code, gaining unauthorized
access to systems, networks, or devices that are used to service the Portfolio�s operations through �hacking�
or other means for the purpose of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption.
Cyber security failures or breaches by the Portfolio�s affiliates or service providers, may cause disruptions and impact
the business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to both the Portfolio and its shareholders, the inability of
shareholders to transact business, inability to calculate the Portfolio�s NAV, impediments to trading, violations of applicable
privacy and other laws (including the release of private shareholder information), regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage,
reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs. In addition, substantial costs may be incurred
in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future. While the advisor has risk management systems designed to prevent or reduce
the impact of such cyber-attacks, there are inherent limitations in such controls, systems and protocols, including the possibility
that certain risks have not been identified, as well as the rapid development of new threats. These cybersecurity risks are also
present for issuers of securities in which the Portfolio invests, which could result in material adverse consequences for such
issuers, and may cause the Portfolio�s investment in such securities to lose value and may result in financial loss for
Portfolio shareholders.

�


7
�

�
The Portfolio
is actively managed and its performance therefore will reflect in part USBAM�s ability to make investment decisions that
are suited to achieving the Portfolio�s investment objectives. Due to its active management, the Portfolio could underperform
other mutual funds with similar investment objectives.
�
Government Portfolio
�

Government
  Portfolio is subject to the following principal risks:
�

�The
value of your investment might decline if the issuer of an obligation held by the Portfolio defaults on the obligation or has
its credit rating downgraded.

�

�The
level of income you receive from the Portfolio will be affected by movements in short-term interest rates. Because the Portfolio
invests solely in U.S. government securities and repurchase agreements secured by those securities, the Portfolio may offer less
income than money market funds investing in other high-quality money market securities.

�

�The
value of your investment might decline because of a sharp rise in interest rates that causes the value of the Portfolio�s
holdings to fall.

�

�The
Portfolio may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner or at a desired price, or may be unable to sell the security at
all, because of a lack of demand in the market for the security.

�

�If
there are unexpectedly high redemptions of Portfolio shares, the Portfolio might have to sell portfolio securities prior to their
maturity, possibly at a loss.

�

�If
the seller of a repurchase agreement defaults on its obligation to repurchase securities from the Portfolio, the Portfolio may
incur costs in disposing of the collateral and may experience losses if there is any delay in its ability to do so.

�

�In
July 2014, the SEC adopted reforms to money market fund regulation. The compliance periods for these reforms range between July
2015 and October 2016. When the amendments are implemented, they could affect the Portfolio�s operations and return potential.
In addition, changes to monetary policy by the Federal Reserve or other regulatory actions could expose fixed income and related
markets to heightened volatility, interest rate sensitivity and reduced liquidity, which may impact the Portfolio�s operations,
universe of potential investment options, and return potential.

�


8
�

�
The Portfolio currently
has no intention to rely on the ability to impose redemption gates and liquidity fees, which beginning October 14, 2016 will be
elective provisions for government money market funds under the SEC�s money market fund reforms.
�

�With
the increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions,
the Portfolio may be subject to operational and informational security risks resulting from breaches in cyber security (�cyberattacks�).
Cyber-attacks include, but are not limited to, infection by computer viruses or other malicious software code, gaining unauthorized
access to systems, networks, or devices that are used to service the Portfolio�s operations through �hacking�
or other means for the purpose of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption.
Cyber security failures or breaches by the Portfolio�s affiliates or service providers, may cause disruptions and impact
the business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to both the Portfolio and its shareholders, the inability of
shareholders to transact business, inability to calculate the Portfolio�s NAV, impediments to trading, violations of applicable
privacy and other laws (including the release of private shareholder information), regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage,
reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs. In addition, substantial costs may be incurred
in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future. While the advisor has risk management systems designed to prevent or reduce
the impact of such cyber-attacks, there are inherent limitations in such controls, systems and protocols, including the possibility
that certain risks have not been identified, as well as the rapid development of new threats.

�
The Portfolio
is actively managed and its performance therefore will reflect in part USBAM�s ability to make investment decisions that
are suited to achieving the Portfolio�s investment objectives. Due to its active management, the Portfolio could underperform
other mutual funds with similar investment objectives.

Disclosure of Portfolio
Holdings
�
A
description of each Portfolio�s policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of its portfolio securities is
available in the SAI.
�
ITEM 10. MANAGEMENT, ORGANIZATION,
AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE
�
Investment Advisor
�
USBAM is
each Portfolio�s investment advisor. USBAM provides investment management services to institutional clients such as funds,
corporations, public entities, foundations, endowments and other institutions (and occasionally individuals). As of December 31,
2015, USBAM had approximately $56.6 billion in assets under management, including registered investment company assets of $44.2
billion. As investment advisor, USBAM manages the Portfolios� business and investment activities, subject to the authority
of the Board.
�


9
�

�
USBAM does
not charge an investment advisory fee for its investment advisory services to the Trust�s Portfolios. A discussion regarding
the basis for the Board�s approval of the Portfolios� investment advisory agreements will be available in the Portfolios�
annual report to shareholders for the period ending December 31, 2016.
�
USBAM is
located at 800 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402.
�
Administrator
�
USBAM provides
administrative services to the Portfolios. These services include general administrative, accounting and transfer agent services
and certain other services. The Administrator is entitled to receive total fees, on an annual basis, equal to 0.02% of the aggregate
average daily net assets of Prime Portfolio and equal to 0.04% of the aggregate average daily net assets of Government Portfolio
and bears all of the Portfolios� other expenses, except for brokerage commissions and other expenditures in connection with
the purchase and sale of portfolio securities, interest expense and, subject to the specific approval of a majority of the Trustees
who are not interested persons of the Trust, taxes and extraordinary expenses.
�
Custodian
�
U.S. Bank
provides custody services to the Trust.
�
Portfolio Management 
�
The Portfolios
are managed by a team of persons who are employed by USBAM.
�
Shares of the Trust
�
Shares
of the Trust are not registered under the 1933 Act or the securities law of any state and are sold in reliance upon an exemption
from registration. Shares may not be transferred or resold without registration under the 1933 Act, except pursuant to an exemption
from registration.
��
ITEM 11. SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
�
Pricing, Purchase and Redemption
of Portfolio Shares
�
Shares
of each Portfolio are only offered to, and held by, Lenders in the Lending Program.
�
Shares
of Prime Portfolio and Government Portfolio are available for purchase or redemption each day on which the Federal Reserve Bank
is open for business, except for Good Friday (�Business Day�). All shares of the Portfolios are purchased and redeemed
at the NAV per share of the Portfolio next calculated after the purchase or redemption request is communicated to the Trust�s
transfer agent and determined to be in good order. USBAM, in administering U.S. Bank�s securities lending agent duties for
a Lender, will effect all purchases and redemptions on behalf of a Lender.
�


10
�

�
The NAV
of the Portfolios will generally be calculated at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time on each Business Day.
�
A Portfolio�s
NAV is equal to the market value of its investments and other assets, less any liabilities, divided by the number of Portfolio
shares. The securities held by the Portfolios are valued on the basis of amortized cost. This involves valuing an instrument at
its cost and thereafter assuming a constant amortization of any discount or premium until the instrument�s maturity, rather
than looking at actual changes in the market value of the instrument. Each Portfolio�s NAV is normally expected to be $1
per share.
�
Redemptions
will be paid in cash unless the Board determines that conditions exist that make payment wholly in cash unwise or undesirable.
If such a determination is made by the Board, the Trust may, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act, pay redemptions entirely
or partially in securities.
�
Each Portfolio
reserves the right to suspend the right of shareholder redemption, or postpone the date of payment:
�

�if
emergency conditions exist, as specified in the 1940 Act, or as determined by the SEC, as a result of which disposal of portfolio
securities or determination of the NAV of the Portfolio is not reasonably practicable;

�

�for
any period during which trading on the New York Stock Exchange (�NYSE�) is restricted as determined by the SEC, or
the NYSE is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings);

�

�for
any period during which the SEC has, by rule or regulation, deemed that (1) trading shall be restricted or (2) an emergency exists;
or

�

�for
such other periods as the SEC may by order permit for the protection of shareholders of the Portfolio.

�
In addition,
in the unlikely event that the Board were to determine pursuant to Rule 2a-7 that the extent of the deviation between a Portfolio�s
amortized cost per share and its market-based NAV per share may result in material dilution or other unfair results to shareholders,
the Board will cause the Portfolio to take such action as it deems appropriate to eliminate or reduce to the extent practicable
such dilution or unfair results, including, but not limited to, suspending redemption of shares and liquidating the Portfolio
under Rule 22e-3 of the 1940 Act.
�
In accordance
with certain federal regulations, the Trust is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each entity that
applies to open an account. For this reason, when an account is opened (or ownership is changed), the Trust will request certain
information, including name, address and taxpayer identification number which will be used to verify identity. If sufficient information
is not available to verify identity, the Trust will not open an account. As required by law, the Trust may employ various procedures,
such as comparing information to fraud databases or requesting additional information and documentation, to ensure that the information
supplied is correct. The Trust reserves the right to reject any purchase for any reason, including failure to provide the Trust
with information necessary to confirm identity as required by law. The Board has appointed an Anti-Money Laundering officer, who
is re-elected by the Board annually.
�


11
�

�
Dividends and Distributions
�
Dividends
on shares of each Portfolio will be declared daily and paid monthly from net investment income. The Portfolios may take into account
capital gains and losses (other than net long-term capital gains) in their daily dividend declarations. Dividends will be processed
pursuant to the Lending Agreements between each Lender and U.S. Bank. Distributions from net short- and long-term capital gains,
if any, will be made at least annually. Generally, distributions will be declared and paid in December, if required for a Portfolio
to avoid imposition of a federal excise tax on undistributed income and capital gains. The Portfolios do not expect to realize
any material long-term capital gains or losses.
�
A shareholder�s
right to receive dividends and distributions with respect to shares purchased commences on the effective date of the purchase
of such shares and continues through the day immediately preceding the effective date of redemption of such shares.
�
Excessive Trading of Portfolio
Shares
�
The Board
has not adopted market timing policies and procedures applicable to the Portfolios. The Board has evaluated the risks of market
timing activities by the Portfolios� shareholders and has determined that due to the (i) Portfolios� attempt to maintain
a stable NAV, (ii) nature of the Portfolios� portfolio holdings, (iii) nature of the Portfolios� shareholders, (iv)
inability of the Portfolios� shareholders to exchange into other mutual funds, and (v) inability of the Portfolios�
shareholders to direct transactions because purchases and redemptions are made as securities are lent and returned, it is unlikely
that (a) market timing would be attempted by the Portfolios� shareholders or (b) any attempts to market time the Portfolios
by shareholders would result in a negative impact to the Portfolios or their shareholders.
�
Tax Consequences
�
Dividends
from net investment income and distributions of net short-term capital gains are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income under
federal income tax laws and are not expected to be eligible for the long-term capital gain tax rate applicable to certain qualified
dividend income. Distributions from net long-term capital gains are taxable as long-term capital gains regardless of the length
of time a shareholder has held its shares. Dividends and distributions are taxable whether they are paid in cash or in additional
shares.
�
Under federal
law, the income derived from U.S. Government Securities is exempt from state income taxes, and a shareholder may be eligible for
this exemption with respect to distributions from the Portfolios attributable to income that is so exempt. Income from repurchase
agreements in which the underlying securities are U.S. Government Securities does not receive this exempt treatment.
�


12
�

�
Shareholders
will be notified after the end of each calendar year of the amount of income dividends and net capital gains distributed and the
percentage of a Portfolio�s income attributable to U.S. Government Securities. Each Portfolio is required to withhold 28% of reportable
payments (including dividends, capital gain distributions, if any, and redemptions) paid to certain shareholders who have not
certified that the social security number or taxpayer identification number supplied by them is correct and that they are not
subject to backup withholding because of previous underreporting to the IRS. These backup withholding requirements generally do
not apply to shareholders that are corporations or governmental units or certain tax exempt organizations.
�
The foregoing
discussion is only a summary of certain federal income tax issues generally affecting each Portfolio and its shareholders. Circumstances
among investors may vary and each investor should discuss the tax consequences of an investment in a Portfolio with a tax advisor.
��
ITEM 12. DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS
�
Shares
of the Portfolios are being offered to Lenders in connection with the Lending Program. Shares of each Portfolio are sold on a
private placement basis in accordance with Regulation D under the 1933 Act. Shares of the Trust are sold directly by the Trust
without a distributor and are not subject to a sales load or redemption fee. Assets of the Portfolios are not subject to Rule
12b-1 fees.

ITEM 15. TRUST HISTORY
�
The Trust
was organized in the State of Delaware on August 18, 2005. The Trust is organized as a series fund and currently issues its shares
in two series. Each series of shares represents a separate investment portfolio with its own investment objectives and policies.
The series to which this SAI relates are named are on the cover.
��
ITEM 16. DESCRIPTION OF
THE TRUST AND ITS INVESTMENTS AND RISKS
�
Each Portfolio
of the Trust is an open-end management investment company. Each Portfolio is diversified as defined in the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the �1940 Act�).
�
Investment Policies
�
The investment
policies described below (i) reflect the investment practices of the Portfolios, (ii) are not fundamental, and (iii) may be changed
by the Board of Trustees of the Trust (each a �Trustee� and collectively the �Board�) without shareholder
approval. To the extent consistent with each Portfolio�s investment objective and other stated policies and restrictions, and
unless otherwise indicated, each Portfolio may invest in the following instruments and may use the following investment techniques:
�
Asset-Backed
Securities. Prime Portfolio may invest in asset-backed securities, including asset-backed commercial paper, as a principal
investment strategy. Asset-backed securities generally constitute interests in, or obligations secured by, a pool of receivables
other than mortgage loans, such as automobile loans and leases, credit card receivables, home equity loans and trade receivables.
Asset-backed securities generally are issued by a private special-purpose entity. Their ratings and creditworthiness typically
depend on the legal insulation of the issuer and transaction from the consequences of a sponsoring entity�s bankruptcy,
as well as on the credit quality of the underlying receivables and the amount and credit quality of any third-party credit enhancement
supporting the underlying receivables or the asset-backed securities. Asset-backed securities and their underlying receivables
generally are not issued or guaranteed by any governmental entity.
�
Commercial
Paper and Rule 144A Securities. The securities in which Prime Portfolio may invest may include
commercial paper issued in reliance on the exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933
(the �1933 Act�) and corporate obligations qualifying for resale to certain �qualified institutional buyers�
pursuant to Rule 144A under the 1933 Act. Commercial paper refers to short-term, unsecured promissory notes issued by corporations
to finance short-term credit needs. Commercial paper is usually sold on a discount basis and typically has a maturity at the time
of issuance not exceeding nine months. Prime Portfolio may also purchase asset-backed commercial paper (�ABCP�), which
is a form of commercial paper that is backed by assets such as real estate, trade receivables, credit card loans, auto loans and
other commercial assets. ABCP is typically sponsored by a commercial bank or other financial institution. Such securities, if
they meet the criteria for liquidity established by the Board, will be considered liquid. Consequently, Prime Portfolio does not
intend to subject such securities to the 5% limitation applicable to investments in illiquid securities. Because the secondary
market for Rule 144A securities is generally limited to certain qualified institutional buyers, there may be times when the trading
market for a particular Rule 144A security held by Prime Portfolio may be limited and will be considered illiquid. In such an
event, U.S. Bancorp Asset Management, Inc. (�USBAM�) will consider appropriate remedies to minimize the effect on
Prime Portfolio�s liquidity. 
�


16
�
�
Credit
Enhancement Agreements. As a non-principal investment strategy, Prime Portfolio may separately
arrange for guarantees, letters of credit, or other forms of credit enhancement agreements (collectively, �Guarantees�)
for the purpose of further securing the payment of principal and/or interest on Prime Portfolio�s investment securities.
Although each investment security, at the time it is purchased, must meet Prime Portfolio�s creditworthiness criteria, Guarantees
sometimes are purchased from banks and other institutions (collectively, �Guarantors�) when USBAM, Prime Portfolio�s
investment advisor, through yield and credit analysis, deems that credit enhancement of certain securities is advisable. 
�
Foreign
Securities. Prime Portfolio may invest as a principal investment strategy in dollar-denominated
obligations of U.S. branches of foreign banks, foreign branches of domestic banks, foreign banks, and foreign corporations. Investment
in foreign securities is subject to special investment risks that differ in some respects from those related to investments in
securities of U.S. domestic issuers. These risks include political, social or economic instability in the country of the issuer,
the difficulty of predicting international trade patterns, the possibility of the imposition of exchange controls, expropriation,
limits on removal of currency or other assets, nationalization of assets, foreign withholding and other taxation, and foreign
trading practices (including higher trading commissions, custodial charges and delayed settlements). Foreign securities also may
be subject to greater fluctuations in price than securities issued by U.S. corporations. The principal markets on which these
securities trade may have less volume and liquidity, and may be more volatile, than securities markets in the United States.
�
In addition,
there may be less publicly available information about a foreign bank or company than about a U.S. domiciled bank or company.
Foreign banks and companies generally are not subject to uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards comparable
to those applicable to U.S. domestic banks and companies. There is also generally less government regulation of securities exchanges,
brokers and listed companies abroad than in the United States. Confiscatory taxation or diplomatic developments could also affect
investment in those countries. Various provisions of federal law governing the establishment and operation of domestic branches
of foreign banks do not apply to foreign branches of domestic banks. Obligations of U.S. branches of foreign banks may be general
obligations of the parent bank in addition to the issuing branch, or may be limited by the terms of a specific obligation and
by federal and state regulation as well as by governmental action in the country in which the foreign bank has its head office.
�
Funding
Agreements. Prime Portfolio may invest in funding agreements as a principal investment strategy. Funding agreements are contracts
issued by insurance companies that guarantee a return of principal, plus some amount of interest. Funding agreements purchased
by Prime Portfolio will typically be short-term and provide an adjustable rate of interest. Funding agreements may or may not
allow Prime Portfolio to demand repayment of principal after an agreed upon waiting period or upon certain other conditions. The
insurance company may also have a corresponding right to prepay the principal with accrued interest upon a specified number of
days� notice to Prime Portfolio. The maturity date of some funding agreements may be extended upon the mutual agreement
and consent of the insurance company and Prime Portfolio. Generally, there is no active secondary market in short-term funding
agreements. Consequently, short-term funding agreements may be considered by Prime Portfolio to be illiquid investments and therefore
subject to the Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act (�Rule 2a-7�) limitations on investing in illiquid securities.
�


17
�
�
Illiquid
Securities. Neither Portfolio will invest more than 5% of its net assets in illiquid securities or securities that are not
readily marketable, including repurchase agreements and time deposits of more than seven days� duration. The absence of a regular
trading market for securities imposes additional risks on investments in these securities. Illiquid securities may be difficult
to value and may often be disposed of only after considerable expense and delay.
�
Letters
of Credit. Certain of the debt obligations (including certificates of participation, variable rate demand notes, commercial
paper and other short-term obligations) which Prime Portfolio may purchase may be backed by an unconditional and irrevocable letter
of credit, or other form of credit or liquidity support, of a bank, savings and loan association or insurance company which assumes
the obligation for payment and interest in the event of default by the issuer. Only banks, savings and loan associations, and
insurance companies which, in the opinion of USBAM, are of comparable quality to issuers of other permitted investments of Prime
Portfolio, may be used for letter of credit-backed investments.
�
Loan
Participation Interests. Prime Portfolio may invest in loan participation interests as a principal investment strategy. A
loan participation interest represents a pro rata undivided interest in an underlying bank loan. Participation interests, like
the underlying loans, may have fixed, floating, or variable rates of interest. The bank selling a participation interest generally
acts as a mere conduit between its borrower and the purchasers of interests in the loan. The purchaser of an interest (for example,
Prime Portfolio) generally does not have recourse against the bank in the event of a default on the underlying loan. Therefore,
the credit risk associated with such instruments is governed by the creditworthiness of the underlying borrowers and not by the
banks selling the interests. If Prime Portfolio invests in loan participation interests that can be sold within a seven-day period,
the interests are deemed by USBAM to be liquid investments. If Prime Portfolio invests in loan participation interests that are
restricted from being sold within a seven-day period, the interests are deemed by USBAM to be illiquid investments and are therefore
subject to the Rule 2a-7 limitations on investing in illiquid securities.
�
Money
Market Funds. Each of the Portfolios may invest, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, in securities issued by other money
market funds, provided that the permitted investments of such other money market funds constitute permitted investments of the
investing Portfolio. As a shareholder of another investment company, a Portfolio would bear, along with other shareholders, its
pro rata portion of that company�s expenses, including advisory fees. These expenses would be in addition to the expenses
that the Portfolio bears directly in connection with its own operations. Investment companies in which the Portfolios may invest
may also impose a sales or distribution charge in connection with the purchase or redemption of their shares and other types of
commissions or charges. Such charges will be payable by the Portfolios and, therefore, will be borne indirectly by its shareholders.
�


18
�

�
Municipal
Securities. Prime Portfolio may invest in municipal securities as a principal investment
strategy. Municipal securities include municipal bonds and other debt securities issued by the states and by their local and special-purpose
political subdivisions. The term �municipal bond� as used in this section includes short-term municipal notes and
other commercial paper issued by the states and their political subdivisions. Two general classifications of municipal bonds are
�general obligation� bonds and �revenue� bonds. General obligation bonds are secured by the governmental
issuer�s pledge of its faith, credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest upon a default by the issuer
of its principal and interest payment obligation. They are usually paid from general revenues of the issuing governmental entity.
Revenue bonds, on the other hand, are usually payable only out of a specific revenue source rather than from general revenues.
Revenue bonds ordinarily are not backed by the faith, credit or general taxing power of the issuing governmental entity. The principal
and interest on revenue bonds for private facilities are typically paid solely out of rents or other specified payments made to
the issuing governmental entity by a private company which uses or operates the facilities. Examples of these types of obligations
are industrial revenue bonds and pollution control revenue bonds. Industrial revenue bonds are issued by governmental entities
to provide financing aid to community facilities such as hospitals, hotels, business or residential complexes, convention halls
and sport complexes. Pollution control revenue bonds are issued to finance air, water and solids pollution control systems for
privately operated industrial or commercial facilities. Revenue bonds which are not backed by the credit of the issuing governmental
entity frequently provide a higher rate of return than other municipal obligations, but they entail greater risk than obligations
which are guaranteed by a governmental unit with taxing power. Federal income tax laws place substantial limitations on industrial
revenue bonds, and particularly certain specified private activity bonds issued after August 7, 1986. In the future, legislation
could be introduced in Congress which could further restrict or eliminate the income tax exemption for interest on debt obligations
in which Prime Portfolio may invest.
�
Prime Portfolio�s
investments in municipal bonds and other debt obligations that are purchased from financial institutions such as commercial and
investment banks, savings associations and insurance companies may take the form of participations, beneficial interests in a
trust, partnership interests or any other form of indirect ownership that allows Prime Portfolio to treat the income from the
investment as exempt from federal income tax.
�
In addition,
Prime Portfolio may invest in other federal income tax-free securities such as (i) tax anticipation notes (�TANs�)
and revenue anticipation notes (�RANs�) issued to finance working capital needs in anticipation of receiving taxes
or other revenues, (ii) bond anticipation notes (�BANs�) that are intended to be refinanced through a later issuance
of longer-term bonds, (iii) variable and floating rate obligations including variable rate demand notes, described below under
��Variable and Floating Rate Instruments,� (iv) tender option bonds, and (v) participation, trust and partnership
interests in any of the foregoing obligations. The obligations of TANs, RANs, and BANs are generally secured by the anticipated
revenues from taxes, grants or bond financing. An investment in such instruments, however, presents a risk that the anticipated
revenues will not be received or that such revenues will be insufficient to satisfy the issuer�s payment obligations under
the notes or that refinancing will be otherwise unavailable. Tender option bonds are created when municipal instruments are transferred
to a special purpose trust which issues two classes of certificates. The first class, commonly called floating rate certificates,
pays an interest rate that is typically reset weekly based on a specified index. The second class, commonly called inverse floaters,
pays an interest rate based on the difference between the interest rate earned on the underlying municipal instruments and the
interest rate paid on the floating rate certificates, after expenses. In selecting tender option bonds, USBAM may consider the
creditworthiness of the issuer of the underlying bond deposited in the trust, the experience of the custodian, and the quality
of the sponsor providing the tender option, among other factors. In certain instances, the tender option may be terminated.
�


19
�

�
Obligations
of Banks and Other Financial Services Companies. Prime Portfolio invests as a principal investment strategy in U.S. dollar-denominated
obligations of domestic and foreign banks, including fixed and variable rate certificates of deposit, time deposits, bankers�
acceptances, and other short-term obligations. Certificates of deposit are negotiable certificates evidencing the obligation of
a bank to repay funds deposited with it for a specified period of time. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained in
a banking institution for a specified period of time at a stated interest rate. Time deposits that may be held by Prime Portfolio
will not benefit from insurance from the Deposit Insurance Fund administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Bankers�
acceptances are credit instruments evidencing the obligation of a bank to pay a draft drawn on it by a customer. These instruments
reflect the obligation both of the bank and of the drawer to pay the face amount of the instrument upon maturity. Bank obligations
in which Prime Portfolio invests may include uninsured, direct obligations, bearing fixed, floating or variable interest rates.
Prime Portfolio may also invest in securities issued by other financial services companies in various industries as a principal
investment strategy. To the extent Prime Portfolio invests in securities issued by domestic and foreign banks and other financial
services companies, Prime Portfolio�s performance will be susceptible to the risks associated with the banking and financial
services sectors. These sectors are highly dependent on the supply of short-term financing. The value of securities of issuers
in the banking and financial services sectors can be sensitive to changes in government regulation and interest rates and to economic
downturns in the United States and abroad.
�
Put
Options. Prime Portfolio may, as a non-principal investment strategy, purchase securities that provide for the right to resell
them to the issuer, a bank or a broker-dealer at a specified price within a specified period of time prior to the maturity date
of such obligations. Such a right to resell, which is commonly known as a �put,� may be sold, transferred or assigned
only with the underlying security or securities. Prime Portfolio may pay a higher price for a security with a put than would be
paid for the same security without a put. The primary purpose of purchasing such securities with puts is to permit Prime Portfolio
to be as fully invested as practicable in securities while at the same time providing Prime Portfolio with appropriate liquidity.
�
Repurchase
Agreements. Each Portfolio may engage in repurchase agreements as a principal investment strategy. A repurchase agreement
involves the purchase by the Portfolio of securities with the agreement that, after a stated period of time, the original seller
(the �counterparty�) will buy back the same securities (�collateral�) at a predetermined price or yield.
Repurchase agreements permit a Portfolio to maintain liquidity and earn income over periods of time as short as overnight. A Portfolio
may engage in repurchase agreements with any member bank of the Federal Reserve System or dealer in U.S. Government securities.
A Portfolio may enter into repurchase agreement transactions that are collateralized fully as defined in Rule 5b-3(c)(1) of the
1940 Act, which has the effect of enabling the Portfolio to look to the collateral, rather than the counterparty, for determining
whether its assets are �diversified� for 1940 Act purposes. In addition, collateral may include securities that the
Portfolio is not otherwise permitted to purchase directly, such as long-term government bonds, and for Prime Portfolio, investment
grade corporate bonds and equity securities. Irrespective of the type of collateral underlying a repurchase agreement, the Portfolio
must determine that a repurchase obligation with a particular counterparty involves minimal credit risk to the Portfolio and otherwise
satisfies the credit quality standards applicable to the acquisition of an instrument issued by such counterparty in compliance
with Rule 2a-7.
�
Securities
pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements are held by the custodian bank until the respective agreements mature. The Portfolios
may also invest in tri-party repurchase agreements. Securities held as collateral for tri-party repurchase agreements are maintained
in a segregated account by an unaffiliated third-party custodian bank until the maturity of the repurchase agreement. The market
value of the collateral underlying the repurchase agreement will be determined on each business day. If at any time the market
value of the collateral falls below the repurchase price under the repurchase agreement (including any accrued interest), the
appropriate Portfolio will promptly receive additional collateral (so the total collateral is an amount at least equal to the
repurchase price plus accrued interest).
�


20
�

�
Repurchase
agreements involve certain risks not associated with direct investments in securities. If the counterparty defaults on its obligation
to repurchase as a result of its bankruptcy or otherwise, the Portfolio will seek to sell the collateral, which could involve
costs or delays. Although collateral will at all times be maintained in an amount at least equal to the repurchase price under
the agreement (including accrued interest), the Portfolio would suffer a loss if the proceeds from the sale of the collateral
were less than the agreed-upon repurchase price. As noted above, the Portfolios may engage in repurchase agreement transactions
that are collateralized by securities that the Portfolios are not otherwise directly permitted to purchase, such as long-term
government bonds, and for Prime Portfolio, investment grade corporate bonds and equity securities. These collateral securities
may be less liquid or more volatile than others or less liquid and more volatile than the securities that the Portfolio is permitted
to purchase directly, thereby increasing the risk that the Portfolio will be unable to recover fully in the event of a counterparty�s
default and potentially resulting in the Portfolio owning securities that it is not otherwise permitted to purchase. USBAM will
monitor the creditworthiness of the firms with which the Portfolio enters into repurchase agreements.
�
U.S.
Government Securities. The Portfolios may invest in securities issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S.
Government, or agencies or instrumentalities of the U.S. Government. Making such investments is a principal investment strategy
for the Portfolios. These investments include direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury such as U.S. Treasury bonds, notes, and
bills. These Treasury securities are essentially the same except for differences in interest rates, maturities, and dates of issuance.
In addition to Treasury securities, the Portfolios may invest in securities, such as notes, bonds, and discount notes which are
issued or guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. Government and various instrumentalities which have been established or sponsored
by the U.S. Government. Except for U.S. Treasury securities, these U.S. Government obligations, even those which are guaranteed
by federal agencies or instrumentalities, may or may not be backed by the �full faith and credit� of the United States.
In the case of securities not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, the investor must look principally to
the agency issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate repayment and may not be able to assert a claim against the United
States itself in the event the agency or instrumentality does not meet its commitment. USBAM considers securities guaranteed by
an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a government agency to be guaranteed by that agency.
�
U.S. Treasury
obligations include bills, notes and bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury and separately traded interest and principal component
parts of such obligations that are transferable through the Federal book-entry system, which are known as Separately Traded Registered
Interest and Principal Securities (�STRIPS�). STRIPS are sold as zero coupon securities, which means that they are
sold at a substantial discount and redeemed at face value at their maturity date without interim cash payments of interest or
principal. This discount is accreted over the life of the security, and such accretion will constitute the income earned on the
security for both accounting and tax purposes. Because of these features, such securities may be subject to greater interest rate
volatility than interest paying U.S. Treasury obligations. The Portfolios� investments in STRIPS will be limited to components
with maturities less than or equal to 397 days and the Portfolios will not actively trade such components.
�


21
�
��
Variable
and Floating Rate Instruments. A floating rate security provides for the automatic adjustment of its interest rate whenever
a specified interest rate changes. A variable rate security provides for the automatic establishment of a new interest rate on
set dates. Interest rates on these securities are ordinarily tied to, and represent a percentage of, a widely recognized interest
rate, such as the yield on 90-day U.S. Treasury bills or the prime rate of a specified bank. These rates may change as often as
twice daily. Generally, changes in interest rates will have a smaller effect on the market value of variable and floating rate
securities than on the market value of comparable fixed-income obligations. Thus, investing in variable and floating rate securities
generally affords less opportunity for capital appreciation and depreciation than investing in comparable fixed-income securities.
The Portfolios may purchase variable and floating rate non-U.S. Government securities that have a stated maturity in excess of
397 calendar days only if the Portfolios have a right to demand payment of the principal of the instrument at least once every
397 calendar days upon not more than 30 days� notice.
�
Variable
and floating rate instruments may include variable amount master demand notes that permit the indebtedness thereunder to vary
in addition to providing for periodic adjustments in the interest rate. There may be no active secondary market with respect to
a particular variable or floating rate instrument. Nevertheless, the periodic readjustments of their interest rates tend to assure
that their value to a Portfolio will approximate their par value. Illiquid variable and floating rate instruments (instruments
that are not payable upon seven days� notice and do not have an active trading market) that are acquired by a Portfolio
are subject to a Portfolio�s percentage limitations regarding securities that are illiquid or not readily marketable. USBAM will
continuously monitor the creditworthiness of issuers of variable and floating rate instruments in which the Trust invests and
the ability of issuers to repay principal and interest.
�
When-Issued
Transactions. The Portfolios may purchase securities on a when-issued basis, although they do not do so as a principal investment
strategy. New issues of securities are often offered on a when-issued basis. This means that delivery and payment for the securities
normally will take place several days after the date the buyer commits to purchase them. The payment obligation and the interest
rate that will be received on securities purchased on a when-issued basis are each fixed at the time the buyer enters into the
commitment.
�
Each Portfolio
will make commitments to purchase when-issued securities only with the intention of actually acquiring the securities, but a Portfolio
may sell these securities or dispose of the commitment before the settlement date if it is deemed advisable as a matter of investment
strategy. Cash or marketable high-quality debt securities equal to the amount of the above commitments will be segregated on each
Portfolio�s records. For the purpose of determining the adequacy of these securities, the segregated securities will be valued
at market value. If the market value of such securities declines, additional cash or securities will be segregated on a Portfolio�s
records on a daily basis so that the market value of the account will equal the amount of such commitments by that Portfolio.
No Portfolio will invest more than 25% of its net assets in when-issued securities.
�
Securities
purchased on a when-issued basis and the securities held by each Portfolio are subject to changes in market value based upon the
public�s perception of changes in the level of interest rates. Generally, the value of such securities will fluctuate inversely
to changes in interest rates (i.e., they will appreciate in value when interest rates decline and decrease in value when interest
rates rise). Therefore, if in order to achieve higher interest income a Portfolio remains substantially fully invested at the
same time that it has purchased securities on a �when-issued� basis, there will be a greater possibility of fluctuation
in the Portfolio�s net asset value (�NAV�).
�


22
�

�
When payment
for when-issued securities is due, each Portfolio will meet its obligations from then-available cash flow, the sale of segregated
securities, the sale of other securities or, and although it would not normally be expected to do so, from the sale of the when-issued
securities themselves (which may have a market value greater or less than the Portfolio�s payment obligation). The sale
of securities to meet such obligations carries with it a greater potential for the realization of capital gains, which are subject
to federal income taxes.
�
Zero-Coupon
and Step-Up Coupon Securities. The Portfolios may invest in zero-coupon securities and Prime Portfolio may invest in step-up
coupon securities as non-principal investment strategies. These securities are debt securities that do not make regular cash interest
payments. Zero-coupon securities are securities that make no periodic interest payments, but are instead sold at discounts from
face value. Step-up coupon bonds are debt securities that may not pay interest for a specified period of time and then, after
the initial period, may pay interest at a series of different rates. If these securities do not pay current cash income, the market
prices of these securities would generally be more volatile and likely to respond to a greater degree to changes in interest rates
than the market prices of securities having similar maturities and credit qualities that pay cash interest periodically.

Money Market Fund Material
Events
�
On January
22, 2016, U.S. Bancorp made a capital contribution to Prime Portfolio in the amount of $4.6 million. The contribution was made
by U.S. Bancorp in order to offset Prime Portfolio�s historical capital losses. U.S. Bancorp is the indirect parent of USBAM.
�
Prime
Portfolio was required to disclose additional information about this event on Form N-CR and to file this form with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the �SEC�). Any Form N-CR filing submitted by Prime Portfolio is available on the EDGAR Database
on the SEC�s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov.

Investment Restrictions
�
Fundamental Investment Restrictions
�
Each Portfolio
is classified under the 1940 Act as a diversified series of an open-end management investment company. This classification cannot
be changed with respect to a Portfolio without approval by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Portfolio
as defined in the 1940 Act, i.e., by the lesser of the vote of (a)�67% of the shares of the Portfolio present at a meeting
where more than 50% of the outstanding shares are present in person or by proxy, or (b)�more than 50% of the outstanding
shares of the Portfolio. The 1940 Act currently restricts a Portfolio, with respect to 75% of its total assets, from purchasing
securities of an issuer (other than (i) securities issued by other investment companies, (ii) securities issued by the U.S. Government,
its agencies, instrumentalities or authorities, or (iii) repurchase agreements fully collateralized by U.S. Government securities)
if (a) such purchase would, at the time, cause more than 5% of the Portfolio�s total assets taken at market value to be
invested in the securities of such issuer; or (b) such purchase would, at the time, result in more than 10% of the outstanding
voting securities of such issuer being held by the Portfolio.
�


23
�

�
In addition
to the investment objective and strategies and risk factors set forth in Part A, Prime Portfolio and Government Portfolio are
subject to the investment restrictions set forth below. The investment restrictions set forth in paragraphs�1 through 6 below
are fundamental and cannot be changed with respect to a Portfolio without approval by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of the Portfolio as defined in the 1940 Act.
�
Neither
Portfolio will:
�

1.Concentrate
  its investments in a particular industry, except that there shall be no limitation on
  the purchase of obligations of domestic commercial banks, excluding for this purpose,
  foreign branches of domestic commercial banks. For purposes of this limitation, the U.S.
  Government and state or municipal governments and their political subdivisions, are not
  considered members of any industry. Whether a Portfolio is concentrating in an industry
  shall be determined in accordance with the 1940 Act, as interpreted or modified from
  time to time by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction.
�

2.Borrow
  money or issue senior securities, except as permitted under the 1940 Act, as interpreted
  or modified from time to time by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction.
�

3.Purchase
  physical commodities or contracts relating to physical commodities.
�

4.Purchase
  or sell real estate unless as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments,
  but this shall not prevent the Portfolios from investing in securities or other instruments
  backed by real estate or interests therein or in securities of companies that deal in
  real estate or mortgages.
�

5.Act
  as an underwriter of securities of other issuers, except to the extent that, in connection
  with the disposition of portfolio securities, it may be deemed an underwriter under applicable
  laws.
�

6.Make
  loans except as permitted under the 1940 Act, as interpreted or modified from time to
  time by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction.
�
For purposes
of applying the limitation set forth in number 1 above, according to the current interpretation by the SEC, a Portfolio would
be concentrated in an industry if 25% or more of its total assets, based on current market value at the time of purchase, were
invested in that industry.
�
For purposes
of applying the limitation set forth in number 2 above, under the 1940 Act as currently in effect, a Portfolio is not permitted
to issue senior securities, except that the Portfolio may borrow from any bank if immediately after such borrowing the value of
such Portfolio�s total assets is at least 300% of the principal amount of all of the Portfolio�s borrowings (i.e.,
the principal amount of the borrowings may not exceed 33 1/3% of the Portfolio�s total assets). In the event that such asset
coverage shall at any time fall below 300% the Portfolio shall, within three days thereafter (not including Sundays and holidays)
reduce the amount of its borrowings to an extent that the asset coverage of such borrowings shall be at least 300%.
�


24
�

�
For purposes
of applying the limitation set forth in number 6 above, there are no limitations with respect to unsecured loans made by the Portfolio
to an unaffiliated party. However, if the Portfolio loans its portfolio securities, the obligation on the part of the Portfolio
to return collateral upon termination of the loan could be deemed to involve the issuance of a senior security within the meaning
of Section 18(f) of the 1940 Act. In order to avoid violation of Section 18(f), the Portfolio may not make a loan of portfolio
securities if, as a result, more than one-third of its total asset value (at market value computed at the time of making a loan)
would be on loan. The Portfolio currently does not intend to make loans, unsecured or otherwise, except to the extent that investments
in debt securities in accordance with Rule 2a-7 (as discussed below under �Additional Restrictions�) would be deemed
to be loans.
�
Non-Fundamental Investment
Restrictions
�
The following
restrictions are non-fundamental and may be changed by the Board without a shareholder vote.
�

1.The
Portfolios will not sell securities short.

�

2.The
  Portfolios will not borrow money in an amount exceeding 10% of a Portfolio�s total
  assets. The Portfolio will not borrow money for leverage purposes. For the purpose of
  this investment restriction, the purchase of securities on a when-issued or delayed delivery
  basis shall not be deemed the borrowing of money. The Portfolio will not make additional
  investments while its borrowings exceed 5% of total assets.
�
Additional Restrictions
�
The Portfolios
may not invest in obligations of any affiliate of U.S. Bancorp, including U.S. Bank National Association (�U.S. Bank�).
�
The Trust
may rely on a previously received exemptive order (Investment Company Act Release No. 22589 dated March 28, 1997) from the SEC
under which short-term investments and repurchase agreements may be entered into on a joint basis by the Portfolios and other
funds advised by USBAM.
�
The
Trust may rely on a previously received exemptive order (Investment Company Act Release No. 25526 dated April 15, 2002) from the
SEC which permits the Portfolios to participate in an interfund lending program pursuant to which the Portfolios and other mutual
funds advised by USBAM may lend money directly to each other for emergency or temporary purposes. The program is subject to a
number of conditions designed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all participating mutual funds, including the following:
(1) no mutual fund may borrow money through the program unless it receives a more favorable interest rate than a rate approximating
the lowest interest rate at which bank loans would be available to any of the participating mutual funds under a loan agreement;
and (2) no mutual fund may lend money through the program unless it receives a more favorable return than that available from
an investment in repurchase agreements and, to the extent applicable, money market cash sweep arrangements. In addition, a mutual
fund may participate in the program only if and to the extent that such participation is consistent with the fund�s investment
objectives and policies (for instance, money market funds would normally participate only as lenders because they rarely need
to borrow cash to meet redemptions). The duration of any loans made under the interfund lending program will be limited to the
time required to receive payment for the securities sold, but in no event more than seven days. All loans will be callable by
the lending fund on one business day�s notice. A mutual fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if
an interfund loan is called or not renewed. Any delay in repayment to a lending fund could result in a lost investment opportunity
or additional costs. The program is subject to the oversight and periodic review of the board of trustees of the participating
mutual funds, or the equivalent. 
�


25
�

�
The Portfolios
are subject to the investment restrictions of Rule 2a-7 in addition to other policies and restrictions discussed herein. A description
of the ratings categories used to determine whether a security is an �Eligible Security,� as that term is defined
in Rule 2a-7, is included in Appendix A.
�
The concentration
policy of Prime Portfolio permits investment, without limit, in bankers� acceptances, certificates of deposit and similar instruments
issued by (i) U.S. banks and (ii) U.S. branches of foreign banks (in circumstances in which the U.S. branches of foreign banks
are subject to the same regulation as U.S. banks). Prime Portfolio may concentrate in such instruments when, in the opinion of
USBAM, the yield, marketability and availability of investments meeting Prime Portfolio�s quality standards in the banking industry
justify any additional risks associated with the concentration of Prime Portfolio�s assets in such industry.
�
Portfolio Turnover
�
Each Portfolio
generally intends to hold its portfolio securities to maturity. In certain instances, however, a Portfolio may dispose of its
portfolio securities prior to maturity when it appears such action will be in the best interest of the Portfolio because of changing
money market conditions, redemption requests, or otherwise. Each Portfolio may attempt to maximize the total return on its portfolio
by trading to take advantage of changing money market conditions and trends or to take advantage of what are believed to be disparities
in yield relationships between different money market instruments. Because each Portfolio invests in short-term securities and
manages its portfolio, as described above in �Description of the Trust and its Investments and Risks � Investment
Policies� and in Part A to the Trust�s registration statement, the portfolio will turn over several times a year.
Because brokerage commissions as such are not usually paid in connection with the purchase or sale of the securities in which
the Portfolio invests and because the transactional costs are small, the high turnover is not expected to materially affect NAVs
or yields. Securities with maturities of less than one year are excluded from required portfolio turnover rate calculations, and,
therefore, the Portfolios� turnover rate for reporting purposes will be zero.
�
Disclosure of Portfolio
Holdings
�
The Portfolios
are not subject to the policies and procedures adopted by the Board which prohibit the release of information concerning portfolio
holdings (�Disclosure Policies�) because the Portfolios� shares are not available to the general public (i.e.,
shares are only offered in connection with the investment of collateral received in connection with securities lending) and the
Portfolios hold only short-term securities that generally do not vary significantly in value over short periods of time. Because
of the types of securities held by the Portfolios, such portfolio holdings information would not be subject to the types of misuses
that the Disclosure Policies are designed to prevent.
�


26
�

�
Information
concerning the Portfolios� securities holdings, as well as their weighted average maturity and weighted average life, will
be posted on the U.S. Bank Institutional Trust and Custody website five business days after the end of the month and will remain
posted on the website for at least six months thereafter. In addition, the Portfolios file more detailed holdings information
with the SEC on Form N-MFP no later than five business days after the end of the month, which becomes publicly available on the
SEC�s website 60 days after the end of the month to which the information pertains. A Portfolio may publish complete holdings
information more frequently if it has a legitimate business purpose for doing so.

1Messrs.
  Thole, Palmer, Smith, Ertel and Cloutier and Mses. Stevenson, Mayr and Kasmani are each
  officers and/or employees of U.S. Bancorp Asset Management, Inc., which serves as investment
  advisor, transfer agent and administrator for the Trust.

Board Leadership Structure
�
The Board
is responsible for overseeing generally the operation of the Portfolios. The Board has approved two investment advisory agreements
with USBAM, as well as other contracts with USBAM, its affiliates, and other service providers. Annually, the Board evaluates
the services received from the Trust�s principal service providers.
�
As noted
above, the Board consists entirely of Independent Trustees. The Trustees also serve as trustees (or �directors�) of
First American Funds, Inc. (collectively with the Trust, the �Fund Complex�). Taking into account the number and complexity
of the funds overseen by the Trustees and the aggregate amount of assets under management in the Fund Complex, the Board has determined
that the efficient conduct of its affairs makes it desirable to delegate responsibility for certain matters to committees of the
Board. These committees, which are described in more detail below, review and evaluate matters specified in their charters and
make recommendations to the Board as they deem appropriate. Each committee may use the resources of the Trust�s counsel
and auditors, counsel to the Independent Trustees, if any, as well as other experts. The committees meet as often as necessary,
either in conjunction with regular meetings of the Board or otherwise.
�
The Portfolios
are subject to a number of risks, including, among others, investment, compliance, operational, and valuation risks. The Board�s
role in risk oversight of the Portfolios reflects its responsibility to oversee generally, rather than to manage, the operations
of the Portfolios. The actual day-to-day risk management with respect to the Portfolios or the Trust resides with USBAM and the
other service providers to the Portfolios or the Trust. In line with the Board�s oversight responsibility, the Board receives
reports and makes inquiries at its regular meetings or otherwise regarding various risks. However, the Board relies upon the Trust�s
Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Board, and USBAM (including its Senior Business Unit Risk Manager and other
members of its management team) to assist the Board in identifying and understanding the nature and extent of such risks and determining
whether, and to what extent, such risks may be eliminated or mitigated. Although the risk management policies of USBAM and the
other service providers are designed to be effective, those policies and their implementation vary among service providers and
over time, and there is no guarantee that they will be effective. Not all risks that may affect the Portfolios or the Trust can
be identified or processes and controls developed to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects, and some risks are simply
beyond any control of the Portfolios, the Trust, or USBAM, its affiliates or other service providers.
�
Standing
Committees of the Board
�
There are
currently two standing committees of the Board: Audit Committee and Governance Committee. References to the �Portfolios�
in the committee descriptions below are to each of the Portfolios of the Trust and other funds in the Fund Complex. All committee
members are Independent Trustees.

  to oversee the Portfolios� accounting and financial reporting policies and practices, their internal controls and, as
  appropriate, the internal controls of certain service providers; (2) to oversee the quality of the Portfolios� financial
  statements and the independent audit thereof; (3) to assist Board oversight of the Portfolios� compliance with legal
  and regulatory requirements; and (4) to act as a liaison between the Portfolios� independent auditors and the full Board.
  The Audit Committee, together with the Board, has the ultimate authority and responsibility to select, evaluate and, where
  appropriate, replace the outside auditor (or to nominate the outside auditor to be proposed for shareholder approval in any
  proxy statement).

  education program in a cost-effective manner); and (4) governance practices (including reviewing and making recommendations
  regarding Trustee compensation and Trustee expenses; monitoring Trustee investments in the Portfolios; monitoring compliance

�
The
Governance Committee will consider shareholder recommendations for Trustee nominees in the event there is a vacancy on the Board
or in connection with any special shareholder meeting which is called for the purpose of electing Trustees. The Trust does not
hold regularly scheduled annual shareholder meetings. There are no differences in the manner in which the Governance Committee
evaluates nominees for Trustee based on whether the nominee is recommended by a shareholder.
�


33
�
�
A
shareholder who wishes to recommend a Trustee nominee should submit his or her recommendation in writing to the Chair of the Board
(Mr. Kedrowski) or the Chair of the Governance Committee (Mr. Riederer), in either case at Mount Vernon Securities Lending Trust,
P.O. Box 1329, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55440-1329. At a minimum, the recommendation should include:
�

�the
  name, address, and business, educational, and/or other pertinent background of the person
  being recommended;

�

�a
  statement concerning whether the person is �independent� within the meaning
  of New York Stock Exchange and NYSE MKT listing standards and is not an �interested
  person� as defined in the 1940 Act;

�

�any
  other information that the Portfolios would be required to include in a proxy statement
  concerning the person if he or she was nominated; and

�

�the
  name and address of the person submitting the recommendation, together with the number
  of Portfolio shares held by such person and the period for which the shares have been
  held.

�
The
recommendation also can include any additional information that the person submitting it believes would assist the Governance
Committee in evaluating the recommendation. Shareholder recommendations for nominations to the Board will be accepted on an ongoing
basis and will be kept on file for consideration when there is a vacancy on the Board or prior to a shareholder meeting called
for the purpose of electing Trustees.

Baumgardner and Gaumond were appointed to the Board effective January 1, 2016.
�


34
�
�
As
of December 31, 2015, none of the Independent Trustees or their immediate family members owned, beneficially, or of record, any
securities in (i) an investment advisor of the Trust or (ii) a person (other than a registered investment company) directly or
indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with an investment advisor of the Trust.
�
None of
the Trustees meet the eligibility requirements to purchase shares of the Portfolios.

�
Trustee Qualifications
�
The Board
has determined that each Trustee should serve or continue to serve as such based on several factors (none of which alone is decisive).
All Trustees have served in such role since the Trust�s inception in 2005 with the exception of Messrs. Baumgardner and
Gaumond who were appointed effective January 1, 2016. The Board determined that, each Trustee is knowledgeable or will become
knowledgeable regarding the Trust�s business and service provider arrangements. In addition, each Trustee other than Messrs.
Baumgardner and Gaumond has served for a number of years as a director of other funds in the Fund Complex, as indicated in the
�Independent Trustees� table above. Among the factors the Board considered when concluding that an individual should
serve on the Board were the following: (i) the individual�s business and professional experience and accomplishments; (ii)
the individual�s ability to work effectively with other members of the Board; (iii) the individual�s prior experience,
if any, serving on the boards of public companies and other complex enterprises and organizations; and (iv) how the individual�s
skills, experiences and attributes would contribute to an appropriate mix of relevant skills, diversity and experience on the
Board. The Board believes that, collectively, the Trustees have balanced and diverse qualifications, skills, experiences, and
attributes, which allow the Board to operate effectively in governing the Trust and protecting the interests of shareholders.
Information about the specific qualifications, skills, experiences, and attributes of each Trustee, which in each case contributed
to the Board�s conclusion that the Trustee should serve (or continue to serve) as trustee of the Trust, is provided in the
�Independent Trustees� table above.
�
Trustee Compensation
�
Effective
January 1, 2016, the Fund Complex pays Trustees who are not paid employees or affiliates of the funds in the Fund Complex (each
a �Fund� and collectively the �Funds�) an annual retainer of $165,000 ($250,000 in the case of the Chair).
The Audit Committee Chair receives an additional annual retainer of $15,000 and the Governance Committee Chair receives an additional
annual retainer of $12,000. Prior to January 1, 2016, Trustees were paid an annual retainer of $145,000 ($217,500 in the case
of the Chair). The Audit Committee Chair and Governance Committee Chair each received an additional annual retainer of $11,250.
Prior to January 1, 2015, Trustees were paid an annual retainer of $120,000 ($198,750 in the case of the Chair). The Audit Committee
Chair and Governance Committee Chair each received an additional annual retainer of $11,250. Prior to October 6, 2014 (the date
when their service as directors of the First American closed-end funds ended), Trustees were paid an annual retainer of $160,000
($265,000 in the case of the Chair). The Audit Committee Chair and Governance Committee Chair each received an additional annual
retainer of $15,000.
�
Trustees
also receive $3,500 per day when traveling, on behalf of a Fund, out of town on Fund business which does not involve a Board or
Committee meeting. In addition, Trustees are reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses in traveling from their primary or secondary
residence to Board and Committee meetings, on Fund business and to attend mutual fund industry conferences or seminars. The amounts
specified in this paragraph are allocated evenly among the funds in the Fund Complex.
�


35
�

�
Prior
to January 1, 2011, the Trustees could elect to defer payment of up to 100% of the fees they received in accordance with a Deferred
Compensation Plan (the �Plan�). Under the Plan, a Trustee could elect to have his or her deferred fees treated as
if they had been invested in shares of one or more funds and the amount paid to the Trustee under the Plan would be determined
based on the performance of such investments. Effective January 1, 2011, the Trustees may no longer defer payments under the Plan.
The prior deferral of Trustee fees in accordance with the Plan will have a negligible impact on Fund assets and liabilities and
will not obligate the Funds to retain any Trustee or pay any particular level of compensation. The Funds do not provide any other
pension or retirement benefits to Trustees.
�
The following
table sets forth information concerning aggregate compensation paid to each Trustee of the Trust by (i) the Trust (column 2),
and (ii) the Trust and First American Funds, Inc. collectively (column 5) during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. No executive
officer or affiliated person of the Trust received any compensation from the Trust in excess of $60,000 during such fiscal year
or fiscal period.

�
�
Codes of Ethics
�
The
Trust and USBAM have each adopted a Code of Ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 of the 1940 Act. Each of these Codes of Ethics permits
personnel to invest in securities for their own accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by the Trust. These
Codes of Ethics are on public file with, and are available from, the SEC.
�
Proxy Voting Procedures
�
Because
the Portfolios invest primarily in short-term debt obligations, the probability of the Portfolios or USBAM receiving a proxy request
on behalf of the Portfolios is remote. Nonetheless, the Trust has adopted Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures that delegate the
responsibility of voting proxies to USBAM. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of the Trust are attached as Appendix B.
�
Information
regarding how Prime Portfolio voted proxies relating to portfolio securities during the most recent 12 month period ended June
30, 2015 is available, without charge and upon request, by calling 1-800-677-3863 and on the SEC�s website at www.sec.gov.
Government Portfolio commenced operations on March 4, 2016. Information regarding how Government Portfolio voted proxies relating
to portfolio securities from the time of commencement to June 30, 2016, and every 12 month period thereafter, will be available,
without charge and upon request by calling 1-800-677-3863 and at the SEC�s website at www.sec.gov.

ITEM 18. CONTROL PERSONS
AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF SECURITIES
�
Controlling Shareholders
�
In connection
with U.S. Bank�s securities lending program, USBAM holds certain collateral on behalf of its securities lending clients
to secure the return of loaned securities. At the direction of the securities lending clients, such collateral may be invested
in Trust shares from time to time. USBAM, however, will pass through voting rights to its securities lending clients that have
a beneficial interest in the Portfolios. Consequently, USBAM will not be a controlling person of the Trust for purposes of the
1940 Act.
�
Principal Shareholders
�
As of December
31, 2015, Government Portfolio had no shareholders of record in the Portfolio as the Portfolio was not yet in operation. As of
December 31, 2015, there were 4,215,600,049.83 shares outstanding for Prime Portfolio. The following shareholders of record owned

Investment Advisor
�
USBAM,
800 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402, serves as the investment advisor and manager for each of the Portfolios pursuant
to an investment advisory agreement dated September 21, 2005 for Prime Portfolio and an investment advisory agreement dated February
29, 2016 for Government Portfolio. USBAM is a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. Bank, 800 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, Minnesota
55402, the nation�s fifth-largest commercial bank. U.S. Bank is, in turn, a wholly-owned subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp, 800
Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402, which is a diversified financial services holding company headquartered in Minneapolis,
Minnesota. U.S. Bancorp provides a wide range of financial services for consumers, businesses, government entities and other financial
institutions. At December 31, 2015, U.S. Bancorp and its consolidated subsidiaries had consolidated assets of approximately $421.8
billion, consolidated deposits of more than $300.4 billion and shareholders� equity of more than $46.1 billion.
�
Each
Advisory Agreement requires USBAM to arrange, if requested by the Trust, for officers or employees of USBAM to serve without compensation
from the Portfolios as Trustees, officers, or employees of the Trust if duly elected to such positions by the shareholders or
Trustees of the Trust. USBAM has the authority and responsibility to make and execute investment decisions for the Portfolios
within the framework of the Portfolios� investment policies, subject to review by the Board. USBAM is also responsible for
monitoring the performance of the various organizations providing services to the Portfolios, including the Portfolios�
custodian and accounting agent, and for periodically reporting to the Board on the performance of such organizations. USBAM will,
at its own expense, furnish the Portfolios with the necessary personnel, office facilities, and equipment to service the Portfolios�
investments and to discharge its duties as investment advisor of the Portfolios.
�


38
�

�
The
Trust may have an obligation to indemnify its Trustees and officers with respect to litigation. USBAM will be liable to the Portfolios
under each of the Advisory Agreements for any negligence or willful misconduct by USBAM other than liability for investments made
by USBAM in accordance with the explicit direction of the Board or the investment objectives and policies of the Portfolios. USBAM
has agreed to indemnify the Portfolios with respect to any loss, liability, judgment, cost or penalty that a Portfolio may suffer
due to a breach of either of the Advisory Agreements by USBAM.
�
Both Advisory
Agreements were approved initially for a two-year term by the Trustees, and will continue in effect from year to year unless terminated
in writing by either USBAM or the Trust at the end of such period or thereafter on 60 days� prior written notice given by
either party to the other party.
�
Administrator
�
USBAM serves
as the administrator of Prime Portfolio pursuant to an Administration Agreement dated as of September 21, 2005 by and between
USBAM and the Trust (the �Prime Portfolio Administration Agreement�) and of Government Portfolio pursuant to an Administration
Agreement dated effective as of April 29, 2016 (the �Government Portfolio Administration Agreement�, collectively the
�Administration Agreements�). U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, (�USBFS�), 615 East Michigan Street, Milwaukee,
Wisconsin 53202, serves as sub-administrator pursuant to a Sub-Administration Agreement between USBAM and USBFS dated June 1,
2007 for Prime Portfolio and a Sub-Administration Agreement between USBAM and USBFS dated effective as of April 29, 2016 for Government
Portfolio. USBFS is a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp. Under the Administration Agreements, USBAM provides, or compensates others to
provide, services to the Portfolios. These services include various administrative and accounting services. For these services,
the Trust pays USBAM total fees, on an annual basis, equal to 0.02% of the aggregate average daily net assets of Prime Portfolio
and equal to 0.04% of the aggregate average daily assets of Government Portfolio, and bears all of the Portfolios� other
expenses, except for brokerage commissions and other expenditures in connection with the purchase and sale of portfolio securities,
interest expense and, subject to the specific approval of a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust,
taxes and extraordinary expenses. All fees paid to USBFS, as sub-administrator, are paid from the administration fee.
�
From
January 31, 2013 through May 31, 2015, USBAM voluntarily waived one half of the administration fee it received from the
Prime Portfolio under the administration agreement between USBAM and the Trust. The Prime Portfolio used the amounts waived
by USBAM to offset the effect of accumulated net realized losses. As a result, the amounts waived were not included in income
distributed to shareholders and were therefore reflected in the financial statements as an accumulation of undistributed net
income, which was subject to applicable federal and state income tax. USBAM discontinued this voluntarily waiver effective
June 1, 2015.
�
The following table sets forth
total administration fees (including fees for transfer agent and dividend disbursing agent services provided by USBAM, as described
below) paid to USBAM by Prime Portfolio during its three most recent fiscal years ended December 31. Government Portfolio did
not have administration fees as of December 31, 2015 as it was not yet in operation.

ITEM 20. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS
�
The Portfolios
are managed by a team of persons who are employed by USBAM.
�


40
�

�
ITEM 21. BROKERAGE ALLOCATION
AND OTHER PRACTICES
�
The Trust�s
Portfolios are almost exclusively composed of fixed income securities and most of the Portfolios� portfolio transactions
are made directly with the issuer of the securities or with broker-dealers acting for their own account or as agents. The Portfolios
do not usually pay brokerage commissions on purchases and sales of fixed income securities, although the price of the securities
generally includes compensation, in the form of a spread or mark-up or mark-down, which is not disclosed separately.
�
USBAM determines
the broker-dealers with or through which the Portfolios� securities transactions are executed. The primary consideration
in placing a portfolio transaction with a particular broker-dealer is efficiency in executing orders and obtaining the most favorable
net prices for the Portfolios under the circumstances of each particular transaction. More specifically, the Portfolios consider
the full range and quality of the services offered by a broker-dealer. The determination may include the competitiveness of price;
access to desirable securities; willingness and ability to execute difficult or large transactions; value, nature, and quality
of any brokerage and research products and services provided; financial responsibility (including willingness to commit capital)
of the broker-dealer; ability to minimize market impact; maintenance of the confidentiality of orders; responsiveness of the broker-dealer
to USBAM; and ability to settle trades. For transactions where competitiveness of price is the determining factor, all other factors
being equal, USBAM will seek to obtain more than one offer or bid on purchases and sales of securities to the extent they are
available. USBAM may, however, select a dealer to effect a particular transaction without communicating with all dealers who might
be able to effect such transaction because of the volatility of the market and USBAM�s desire to accept a particular price
for a security because the price offered by the dealer meets USBAM�s guidelines for profit, yield, or both. While it is
USBAM�s policy to seek the most advantageous price on each transaction, there is no assurance it will be successful in doing
so on every transaction.
�
When consistent
with the best execution objectives described above, business may be placed with broker-dealers who furnish brokerage and research
products and services to USBAM. Such brokerage and research products and services would include advice, both directly and in writing,
as to the value of securities, the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities, and the availability of securities
or purchasers or sellers of securities, as well as analyses and reports concerning issues, industries, securities, economic factors
and trends and portfolio strategy. The research products and services may allow USBAM to supplement its own investment research
activities and enable it to obtain the views and information of individuals and research staffs of many different securities firms
prior to making investment decisions for the Portfolios. To the extent portfolio transactions are effected with broker-dealers
who furnish research services, USBAM would receive a benefit, which is not capable of evaluation in dollar amounts, without providing
any direct monetary benefit to the Portfolios from these transactions. As a general matter, the brokerage and research products
and services that USBAM receives from broker-dealers are used to service all of USBAM�s accounts. However, any particular
brokerage and research product or service may not be used to service each and every account, and may not benefit the particular
accounts that generated the transactions that may have resulted in the receipt of the product or service.
�


41
�
�
USBAM has
not entered into any formal or informal agreements with any broker-dealers, and does not maintain any �formula� that
must be followed in connection with the placement of the Portfolios� portfolio transactions in exchange for brokerage and
research products and services provided to USBAM. USBAM may, from time to time, maintain an informal list of broker-dealers that
will be used as a general guide in the placement of Portfolio business in order to encourage certain broker-dealers to provide
USBAM with brokerage and research products and services, which USBAM anticipates will be useful to it. Any list, if maintained,
would be merely a general guide, which would be used only after the primary criteria for the selection of broker-dealers (discussed
above) has been met, and, accordingly, substantial deviations from the list could occur. While it is not expected that the Portfolios
will pay brokerage commissions, if they do, USBAM would authorize the Portfolios to pay an amount of commission for effecting
a securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker-dealer would have charged only if USBAM determined
in good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided
by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or USBAM�s overall responsibilities with respect
to the Portfolio.
�
Generally,
USBAM does not aggregate or �bunch� fixed income securities orders. USBAM may, however, bunch orders in the same fixed
income securities for all accounts, provided that no account is favored over any other participating account, in an effort to
obtain best execution at the best price available. Any subsequent order for the same security is treated as a separate order,
which may be aggregated with remaining unfilled orders for the same security. In some cases, this system could have a detrimental
effect on the price or volume of the security as far as each account is concerned. In other cases, however, the ability of the
accounts to participate in volume transactions will produce better executions for each account. It is USBAM�s policy to
allocate investment opportunities among all accounts in a fair and equitable manner that does not systematically favor one account
over any other, by providing buy and sell opportunities to all accounts. Orders for fixed income securities will be allocated
across participating accounts using one of three approved allocation methods: pro rata allocation, pro rata excluding accounts
for which transaction and processing costs would exceed the expected benefit of the trade, and the good faith judgment method.
Selection of the allocation method will consider one or more of the following factors:
�

�Nature
of the security to be allocated;


�Current
holdings in the issuer;


�Size
of the available position;


�Current
duration;


�Current
credit score (short-term fixed income portfolios only);


�Minimizing
operational and trading risk;


�Account
investment policies, restrictions and constraints;


�Account
liquidity needs;


�Availability
of cash; and


�Any
other information USBAM considers relevant.

�
Neither
Portfolio effects brokerage transactions in its portfolio securities with any broker-dealer affiliated directly or indirectly
with USBAM unless such transactions, including the frequency thereof, the receipt of commissions payable in connection therewith,
and the selection of the affiliated broker-dealer effecting such transactions, are not unfair or unreasonable to the shareholders
of the Portfolio, as determined by the Board. Any transactions with an affiliated broker-dealer must be on terms that are both
at least as favorable to the Portfolio as such Portfolio can obtain elsewhere and at least as favorable as such affiliated broker-dealer
normally gives to others.
�


42
�

�
Government
Portfolio paid no brokerage fees as of December 31, 2015 as it was not in yet in operation. During its three most recent fiscal
years ended December 31, Prime Portfolio paid no brokerage commissions to affiliated brokers. At December 31, 2015, Prime Portfolio
held securities of broker-dealers which are deemed to be �regular brokers or dealers� of Prime Portfolio under the
1940 Act (or of such broker-dealers� parent companies) in the following amounts:

ITEM 22. CAPITAL STOCK AND
OTHER SECURITIES
�
Under its
Declaration of Trust, the Trust is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest with a par value of
$0.01 per share, which may be divided into one or more series and class, each of which evidences pro rata ownership interest in
a different investment portfolio. The Trustees may create additional portfolio series at any time without shareholder approval.
Subject to compliance with the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Trustees have the power to determine the designations, preferences,
privileges, limitations and rights, including dividend rights, of each portfolio series.
�
As of the
date of this SAI, the Trust is comprised of the following portfolio series, which commenced operations on the date set forth opposite
the Portfolio�s name:
�


Commencement
  
of Operations
�
Portfolio Name

04/01/2006
Mount Vernon Securities Lending Prime
  Portfolio

03/04/2016
Mount Vernon Government Portfolio

�
The Trust
is authorized, without shareholder approval, to divide shares of any series into two or more classes of shares, each class having
such different dividend, liquidation and other rights as the Trustees may determine without shareholder approval.
�
Any amendment
to the Declaration of Trust that would materially and adversely affect shareholders of the Trust as a whole, or shareholders of
a particular portfolio series, must be approved by the holders of a majority of the shares of the Trust or the portfolio series,
respectively. All other amendments may be effected by the Board.
�
The Declaration
of Trust provides that shareholders shall not be subject to any personal liability for the acts or obligations of a portfolio
series. If any present or past shareholder of any portfolio series of the Trust is charged or held personally liable for any obligation
or liability of the Trust solely by reason of being or having been a shareholder and not because of such shareholder�s acts or
omissions or for some other reason, the portfolio series, upon request, shall assume the defense against such charge and satisfy
any judgment thereon, and the shareholder or former shareholder shall be entitled out of the assets of such portfolio series to
be held harmless from and indemnified against all loss and expense arising from such liability. Thus, the risk to shareholders
of incurring financial loss beyond their investments is limited to circumstances in which the portfolio series itself would be
unable to meet its obligations.
�


43
�

�
The Trust
will not have an Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Annual and special meetings of Shareholders may be held on such date and at such
time as shall be set or provided by the Board.
�
ITEM 23. PURCHASE, REDEMPTION
AND PRICING OF SHARES
�
Manner in Which Shares are
Offered
�
Shares
of each Portfolio may only be offered to, and be held by, participants in U.S. Bank�s securities lending program. Shares
are sold on a private placement basis in accordance with Regulation D under the 1933 Act. Because shares are sold directly by
the Trust without a distributor, they are not subject to a sales load or redemption fee, and assets of the Trust are not subject
to a Rule 12b-1 fee.
�
Valuation of Portfolio Shares
�
The NAV
per share for the shares of the Portfolios are calculated as of 4:30 p.m. Eastern time on each day on which the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York (�Federal Reserve�) is open for business, except as noted below. In addition to weekends, the Federal
Reserve is closed on the following holidays: New Year�s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, President�s Day, Memorial
Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Portfolios may close when
the Federal Reserve is open and the New York Stock Exchange is closed, such as Good Friday. The NAV may be calculated early on
any business day when the bond markets close early (typically on the business day preceding a Federal holiday). On December 31,
2015, the NAV per share for Prime Portfolio was calculated as set forth below. Government Portfolio did not have a NAV per share
on December 31, 2015 as it had not yet commenced operations.

�
4,215,600,049.83
�
$1.00

�
The Portfolios
will use their best efforts to maintain a constant price per share of $1.00, although there can be no assurance that the $1.00
NAV per share will be maintained. In accordance with this effort and pursuant to Rule 2a-7, the Portfolios use the amortized cost
valuation method to value its portfolio instruments. This method involves valuing an instrument at its cost and thereafter assuming
a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or premium even though the portfolio security may increase or decrease in
market value generally in response to changes in interest rates. While this method provides certainty in valuation, it may result
in periods during which value, as determined by amortized cost, is higher or lower than the price the Portfolios would receive
if they sold the instrument.
�
The Trustees
have established procedures reasonably designed to stabilize the Portfolio�s price per share at $1.00. These procedures
include (i) the determination of the deviation from $1.00, if any, of the Portfolio�s NAV using market values, (ii) periodic
review by the Trustees of the amount of and the methods used to calculate the deviation, and (iii) maintenance of records of such
determination. The Trustees will promptly consider what action, if any, should be taken if such deviation exceeds � of
one percent.
�


44
�

�
When market
quotations are not readily available for an investment, or if USBAM believes they are unreliable, fair value prices may be determined
in good faith using procedures approved by the Board. Valuing securities at fair value involves greater reliance on judgment than
valuing securities that have readily available market quotations. There can be no assurance that the Portfolio could obtain the
fair value assigned to a security if they were to sell the security at approximately the time at which the Portfolio determines
its NAV per share.
�
ITEM 24. TAXATION
�
Federal Taxes
�
Each
Portfolio intends to elect and to qualify to be treated each year as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the �Code�). If so qualified, each Portfolio will not be liable for federal
income taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income and gains to its shareholders. In order to so qualify, the Portfolios
must, among other things, satisfy each year a diversification requirement, 90% gross income requirement and a requirement that
each Portfolio distribute, in a manner qualifying for the dividends paid deduction, at least 90% of its income and net short-term
capital gains. If the Portfolios were to fail to so qualify and were unable or ineligible to cure such failure, the Portfolios
would be subject to corporate level taxation, and consequently, there would be a reduction in income available for distribution
to shareholders. 
�
If
either Portfolio were to fail to distribute in a calendar year at least an amount equal, in general, to the sum of 98% of its
ordinary income for such year and 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 of such year
(or a later date if the Portfolio is eligible to elect and so elects), plus any such amounts retained from the prior year, that
Portfolio would be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on the undistributed amounts.
�
The
Portfolios expect to distribute net realized short-term capital gains (if any) once each year, although it may distribute them
more frequently, if necessary in order to maintain the Portfolio�s NAV at $1.00 per share. Distributions of net investment
income and net short-term capital gains are taxable to investors as ordinary income. Under certain circumstances, a redemption
from a Portfolio potentially will not be treated as a sale or exchange, but rather as a distribution from the Portfolio.
�
Under
the Code, each Portfolio is required to withhold 28% of reportable payments (including dividends, capital gain distributions,
if any, and redemptions) paid to certain shareholders who have not certified that (i) the social security number or taxpayer identification
number supplied by them is correct and (ii) they are not subject to backup withholding because of previous under reporting to
the IRS. These backup withholding requirements generally do not apply to shareholders that are corporations or governmental units
or certain tax-exempt organizations.
�
Dividends
paid by a Portfolio to foreign shareholders that the Portfolio properly reports as capital gain dividends, short-term capital
gain dividends, or interest-related dividends, each as further defined in the SAI, are not subject to withholding of U.S. federal
income tax, provided that certain other requirements are met. A Portfolio is permitted, but is not required, to report any part
of its dividends as are eligible for such treatment. A Portfolio�s dividends other than those the Portfolio so reports as
capital gain dividends, short-term capital gain dividends, or interest-related dividends paid to foreign shareholders generally
will be subject to a U.S. withholding tax at the 30% rate (or lower applicable treaty rate).
�


45
�

�
Sections
1471-1474 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury and IRS guidance issued thereunder (collectively, �FATCA�) generally require
the Portfolios to obtain information sufficient to identify the status of each of its shareholders under FATCA or under an applicable
intergovernmental agreement (an �IGA�). If a shareholder fails to provide this information or otherwise fails to comply
with FATCA or an IGA, the Portfolio may be required to withhold under FATCA at a rate of 30% with respect to that shareholder
on ordinary dividends it pays after June 30, 2014 (or, in certain cases, after later dates), and 30% of the gross proceeds of
share redemptions or exchanges and certain capital gain dividends it pays on or after January 1, 2017 (which date, under recent
Treasury guidance, is expected to be delayed until on or after January 1, 2019). If a payment by a Portfolio is subject to FATCA
withholding, the Portfolio is required to withhold even if such payment would otherwise be exempt from withholding under the rules
applicable to foreign shareholders described above (e.g., capital gain dividends, short-term capital gain dividends, and interest-related
dividends).

APPENDIX A 
�
SHORT-TERM
RATINGS
�
The Portfolios�
investments are limited to securities that, at the time of acquisition, are �Eligible Securities.� Eligible Securities
include, among others, securities that are rated by two Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations in one of the two
highest categories for short-term debt obligations, such as A-1 or A-2 by Standard & Poor�s Rating Services, a division
of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., or Prime-1 or Prime-2 by Moody�s Investors Service, Inc.
�
Standard
& Poor�s
�
A-1.
A short-term obligation rated �A-1� is rated in the highest category by Standard & Poor�s. The obligor�s
capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is strong. Within this category, certain obligations are designated
with a plus sign (+). This indicates that the obligor�s capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is
extremely strong.
�
A-2.
A short-term obligation rated �A-2� is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances
and economic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories. However, the obligor�s capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is satisfactory.
�
Moody�s
�
Prime-1.
Issuers rated Prime-1 (or supporting institutions) have a superior ability for repayment of senior short-term debt obligations.
Prime-1 repayment ability will often be evidenced by many of the following characteristics:
�

�Leading
market positions in well-established industries.

�

�High
rates of return on funds employed.

�

�Conservative
capitalization structure with moderate reliance on debt and ample asset protection.

�

�Broad
margins in earnings coverage of fixed financial charges and high internal cash generation.

�

�Well-established
access to a range of financial markets and assured sources of alternate liquidity.

�
Prime-2.
Issuers rated Prime-2 (or supporting institutions) have a strong ability for repayment of senior short-term debt obligations.
This will normally be evidenced by many of the characteristics cited above but to a lesser degree. Earnings trends and coverage
ratios, while sound, may be more subject to variation. Capitalization characteristics, while still appropriate, may be more affected
by external conditions. Ample alternate liquidity is maintained.

�
Conflicts of Interest
�
As an affiliate of U.S. Bancorp,
a large multi-service financial institution, USBAM recognizes that there are circumstances wherein it may have a perceived or
real conflict of interest in voting the proxies of issuers or proxy proponents (e.g., a special interest group) who are clients
or potential clients of some part of the U.S. Bancorp enterprise. Directors and officers of such companies may have personal or
familial relationships with the U.S.Bancorp enterprise and/or its employees that could give rise to potential conflicts of interest.
�


48
�

�

A.Proxy
Voting

�

�When
a Fund proxy is received, it will be voted by the Chief Investment Officer.

�

B.Control
Procedures

�
Preventative Control Procedures
�

�USBAM
will vote proxies in the best interest of the Funds regardless of real or perceived conflicts of interest. To minimize this risk,
the IPC will discuss conflict avoidance at least annually to ensure that appropriate parties understand the actual and perceived
conflicts of interest proxy voting may face.

�

�If
any member of the IPC becomes aware of a material conflict for USBAM, they will bring the matter to the General Counsel to convene
a meeting of the IPC which will determine a course of action designed to address the conflict. Such actions could include, but
are not limited to:

�

1.Abstaining
from voting; or

�

2.Voting
in proportion to the other shareholders to the extent this can be determined.

�

3.Recusing
an IPC member from all discussion or consideration of the matter, if the material conflict is due to such person�s actual
or potential conflict of interest.

�
Detective Control Procedures
�

�In
addition to all of the above, employees of USBAM must notify USBAM�s Chief Compliance Officer of any direct, indirect or
perceived improper influence exerted by any employee, officer or director within the U.S. Bancorp enterprise or First American
Fund complex with regard to how USBAM should vote proxies.

�

�The
Chief Compliance Officer, or their designee, will investigate the allegations and will report the findings to USBAM�s Chief
Executive Officer and the General Counsel.

�

�To
ensure USBAM has met its fiduciary duty to the Funds, the Chief Investment Officer will certify quarterly that:

�

1.There
were no proxies received for the Funds during the quarter; or,

�

2.If
proxies were voted, that either no material conflict(s) of interest existed in connection with a proxy voted for any security
held in the Funds, or if a material conflict of interest occurred in connection with a proxy voted for a security held in the
Funds, the certification will require a description of the material conflict of interest, and a statement that any advice received
regarding a proxy was not unduly influenced by an individual or group that may have an economic interest in the outcome of the
proxy vote; and,

�

3.If
proxies were received and voted against Management recommendation, then the certification will require documentation of the reasons
for voting against Management recommendation.

�

�Compliance
reviews the Quarterly Proxy Voting Certification for material conflicts and undue influence.

�
Corrective Control Procedures
�

�If
it is determined that improper influence was attempted, appropriate action shall be taken. Such appropriate action may include
disciplinary action, notification of the appropriate senior managers within the U.S. Bancorp enterprise, or notification of the
appropriate regulatory authorities. In all cases, the IPC shall not consider any improper influence in determining how to vote
proxies.

�


49
�
�

C.Securities
Lending Control Procedures

�
Certain Funds participate in
U.S. Bank�s securities lending program. If a portfolio security is on loan as of the shareholder meeting record date, then
the Funds will not have the right to vote the proxies.
�
Preventative Control Procedures
�

�Portfolio
Managers and/or Analysts, who become aware of upcoming proxy issues relating to any securities in portfolios they manage, or issuers
they follow, will consider the desirability of recalling the affected securities that are on loan or restricting lending of the
affected securities prior to the record date for the matter.

�

�If
the proxy issue is determined to be material, and the determination is made prior to the shareholder meeting record date the Portfolio
Manager(s) will contact the Securities Lending Department to recall securities on loan or restrict the loaning of any security
held in any portfolio they manage, if they determine that it is in the best interest of shareholders to do so.

�

D.Review
and Reports

�
Detective Control Procedures
�

�The
General Counsel will review votes cast on behalf of portfolio securities held by the Funds, such review will also be reported
to the Board of Directors of the Funds at each of their regularly scheduled meetings.

�

E.Disclosure
to Shareholders

�
Preventative Control Procedures
�

�USBAM�s
Legal Department will cause Form N-PX to be filed with the SEC, and ensure that any other proxy voting-related filings as required
by regulation or contract are timely made.

�

�USBAM
shall make available the proxy voting record of the Funds to shareholders upon request. Additionally, shareholders can receive,
on request, the voting records for the Funds by calling a toll free number (1-800-677-3863).

�

�The
Funds� proxy voting policy and procedures will also be made available to the public in the Funds registration which is available
to the public on the SEC website. Additionally, shareholders can receive, on request, the proxy voting policies for the Funds
by calling a toll free number (1-800-677-3863).

�
Failure
to Comply
�
USBAM strives to operate ethically
and lawfully and requires all employees to conduct their activities in accordance with USBAM policies and applicable rules and
regulations. USBAM encourages and expects all employees to report any potential or suspected activities that may be considered
fraudulent or illegal in nature, or could potentially damage the reputation of the USBAM and/or the Funds. Employees should report
such activities to one of the individuals listed below.
�
Employee�s immediate
supervisor or other Advisor senior manager
USBAM Chief Executive Officer
USBAM Legal Counsel
USBAM/Fund Chief Compliance
Officer
�
USBAM does not tolerate any
retaliatory action against any individual for good-faith reporting of ethics violations, illegal conduct, suspicious activity
or other serious issues. Allegations of retaliation will be appropriately investigated and, if substantiated, appropriate disciplinary
action will be taken, up to and including termination. Diligent enforcement of non-retaliation measures is vital to the success
of the reporting process because employees must feel they can report problems without fear of reprisals. Employees may report
suspected retaliation to USBAM/Fund Chief Compliance Officer; USBAM Chief Executive Officer; employee�s immediate supervisor
or other senior manager, or to the USBAM Human Resource Contact.
�


50
�

�
Failure of an employee
to comply with all policies, rules and regulations may lead to disciplinary action. Such actions may include: documenting the
incident of non-compliance in the employee�s personnel file, a fine, suspension of trading privileges and termination of
employment. Serious violations may result in monetary fines, censure, suspension or result in other sanctions including the loss
of certain licenses.

ITEM 30. INDEMNIFICATION

�
Except
as set forth in Section 5.2 of the Declaration of Trust, the Trust shall indemnify any person described in Section 5.2 of the
Certificate of Trust (�indemnitee�), for covered expenses (expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by an indemnitee in connection with a covered proceeding) in any covered proceeding (any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to which an indemnitee
is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party), whether or not there is an adjudication of liability as to such indemnitee,
if a determination has been made that the indemnitee was not liable by reason of disabling conduct, as described in Section 5.2
of the Certificate of Trust, by (i) a final decision of the court or other body before which the covered proceeding was brought;
or (ii) in the absence of such decision, a reasonable determination, based on a review of the facts, by either (a) the vote of
a majority of a quorum of Trustees who are neither �interested persons�, as defined in the 1940 Act nor parties to the
covered proceeding or (b) an independent legal counsel in a written opinion; provided that such Trustees or counsel, in reaching
such determination, may need not presume the absence of disabling conduct on the part of the indemnitee by reason of the manner
in which the covered proceeding was terminated.
�
Covered
expenses incurred by an indemnitee in connection with a covered proceeding shall be advanced by the Trust to an indemnitee prior
to the final disposition of a covered proceeding upon the request of the indemnitee for such advance and the undertaking by or
on behalf of the indemnitee to repay the advance unless it is ultimately determined that the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification
thereunder but only if one or more of the following is the case: (i) the indemnitee shall provide a security for such undertaking;
(ii) the Trust shall be insured against losses arising out of any lawful advances; or (iii) there shall have been a determination,
based on a review of the readily available facts (as opposed to a fully trial-type inquiry) that there is a reason to believe
that the indemnitee ultimately will be found entitled to indemnification by either independent legal counsel in a written opinion
or by the vote of a majority of a quorum of trustee who are neither �interested persons� as defined in the 1940 Act
nor parties to the covered proceeding.
�
Nothing
contained in the Declaration of Trust shall be deemed to affect the right of the Trust and/or any indemnitee to acquire and pay
for any insurance covering any or all indemnitees to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act or to affect any other indemnification
rights to which any indemnitee may be entitled to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.
