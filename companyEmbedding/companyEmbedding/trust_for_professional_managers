Table of Contents
The Metamorphosis  � We use this particular title in reference to the great changes that have characterized the past year and to the classic exposition of ancient
mythology attributed to Ovid. Kafka�s similarly named work might provide a reasonably apt metaphor, but we will leave this to the reader�s imagination. The mythological reference seemed appropriate, as bear markets have a tendency to
reveal the fanciful nature of widely accepted beliefs that underpinned the preceding bull market. This most recent sequence is no exception.  � The circumstances leading to the events of 2008 are, by now, quite familiar to most investors. The Federal Reserve Board began the sequence with overly tight monetary conditions
just at the time that the technology and growth stock mania of the late 20th century was exhausting itself. The subsequent downturn surprised policy makers, who responded with a 180 degree shift in policy to a point of extreme and inappropriate
ease.  � Short term interest rates of around 1% underpinned an extraordinarily steep yield
curve, allowing leveraged speculation to emerge as the new national pastime. The objects of that leverage were many and far flung, with the main ones being real estate and genetically altered securities of all sorts. These asset categories lent
themselves to the easiest, quickest and most extensive application of leverage. After about three years of hypertrophic demand, supply responses across nearly every asset type, from luxury hotels and golf communities to modern art and credit
derivatives were sufficient to slow and then reverse prices. Thus began the journey down asset deflation lane, now entering year three.  � The sheer intensity of turbulence in the capital markets and parts of the real economy makes it difficult to keep events within any sort of stable perspective. Without that
ability, it is nearly impossible to avoid responding to every new data surprise and market shock. These short term responses are a recipe for disastrous investment results.  � If we step back from the immediate news flow, it is possible to characterize the events of the past few years in a more general and less volatile
context. In many ways, the disturbances in the global economy over the past five years are similar in form to what occurred in the early to mid 1970s. At that time the economy (particularly in the U.S.) operated under the implicit assumption that
cheap, abundant oil was a permanent input feature. The first oil shock in 1973 undermined every enterprise that had been built around the cheap oil hypothesis and set off a long period of substandard global growth. It might be argued that the
secular decline of U.S. manufacturing, especially the automobile industry, was set in motion after one of their core strategic assumptions (perpetually cheap energy) was proven wrong. Thirty five years later, they continue to drag an outdated
business model right to the verge of bankruptcy court.  � The core input assumption that
has been undermined in this cycle is not unlimited access to inexpensive energy, but abundant and under priced credit. The plethora of liquid savings (particularly in Asia) combined with the Fed�s extreme suppression of short term interest
rates in the early years of this decade created compelling incentives to structure business models that would take advantage of access to leverage on extraordinarily favorable terms. The entire financial infrastructure that is now unraveling had, at
the core of its assumptions, an implicit dependence in unlimited access to cheap credit. The level of belief became so outrageous as to provoke seeming serious public discussions about a leveraged buyout of General Electric. This would have involved
hundreds of billions of borrowed dollars concentrated in one deal. And yet few commentators were willing to dismiss the ideal out of hand. The old saying that there is not a bell that rings at market tops is true. There is not a bell, there are
hundreds.  �

Table of Contents
We are in the process of passing from an environment of bargain priced credit to one in which lenders are going to be adequately
compensated for the apparent risks that they are willing to assume. The fact that few are currently willing to assume any risk is another aspect of the story. Returns that have been produced at the expense of overly credulous and under compensated
lenders will no longer be available. Wall Street will undergo changes more dramatic than those that occurred after fixed commissions were abolished. Credit dependency has become a structural weakness that will hinder the results of many large
financial institutions for years to come.  � The Mythology  � Every great excess has been built around a mythological core that seems to justify extraordinary
valuations and behaviors. A good deal of it originates and is propagated within academic circles, where a veneer of intellectual respectability is applied. This past cycle has been no different.  � Chief among the deceptions was the designation of statistical variability of returns as an adequate
measure of investment risk. We and others have written for years about the inherent flaws of this approach, which fails to take into account the unique circumstances attending every new cycle of excess. Histories of price fluctuations, credit
performance and market correlations provide insight into the past, but are of little use in understanding the present, and even less so as concerns the future.  �
Complex statistical analysis has arisen as a popular tool as a consequence of the widespread availability of computing power and ever more detailed records of market minutia.
None of what passes for risk management now would have been possible in the days of paper tickers or blackboard quotations, and yet good investors were perfectly capable of limiting their exposures to potentially disastrous outcomes even in those
primitive days.  � The confusion of volatility with risk of loss gave rise to an extensive
array of new marketing and investment approaches that have characterized this cycle and its demise. Managers found that by presenting the illusion of higher returns without higher risk, they were able to attract untold sums in short order. The
return sans risk illusion was accomplished in one basic fashion. In essence, it involved the creation of an insurance- like return stream, where small flows of premium were constantly received, against the small probability of an insurable event
(the financial equivalent of a hurricane or earthquake) that would warrant the payout of a large part of the accumulated premiums. Real insurance companies do this all the time as a legitimate and important business. The problems with the modern
investment version were twofold. The practitioners never suggested the possibility of the unusual but highly expensive event of loss, nor did they reserve against it. All of the premiums they received were booked as profit.  � Most �stable return� or �low volatility� investment strategies while not explicitly
run on the insurance company model, shared the same essential risk and return characteristics. The most straightforward comparison exists with option writing strategies, which involve the receipt of premium against the chance of an unusual market
displacement that would require a large payout on the part of the option writer. The key to the marketing appeal of such strategies lies in the fact that if the insurable event is rare enough (a hundred year flood) it will appear to uninformed
investors that the strategy offers nothing but steady, excess return. Because all propositions that promise to pay against the occurrence of an unusual event are, by definition, usually receiving a stream of premium payment, it is very easy to show
large interval of time, often many years, during which a pure statistical analysis based on historical data will show no risk of loss. This, in essence was the marketing mechanism behind a great proportion of the strategies that rose to prominence
during the first two thirds of this decade. 2008 was the insurable event that was never supposed to occur. In fact, the financial markets� volatility during October was, according to statistical analyses of historical precedent, so improbable
that the known

universe has not been in existence long enough for there to be a meaningful chance of occurrence. So much for modern risk management.  � The direct sale of option premium is the simplest investment analog to the payoff structure of an
insurance business, but there are many other important strategies that share similar return and risk characteristics. The general principal behind each of these is the acceptance of a steady, incremental return premium against the presumably small
chance of some disruptive event. Over the past several years, much of the incremental growth of the hedge fund business was based on the illusion of excess return without additional risk that can be created by these types of strategies. 
� Insurance like structures with the potential to create nearly unlimited loss in the event of unusual
market displacements were spread around the globe like a mutant influenza virus. Structured products with these characteristics were sold as currency hedges to foreign corporations, interest rate hedges to municipalities, fixed income and equity
substitutes to clients of private banks and commodity hedges to producers, consumers and speculators. In each case, history provided a comforting picture of stability and normalcy.  � The financial market effects were equally illusory. The widespread sales of credit insurance (CDS) and other insurance like products drove down
premiums across all markets. Currency, interest rate, credit and equity volatility reached historic lows during 2007. The compression of spreads and volatility was taken as a sign that risks across all financial markets were actually diminishing as
risk management techniques became ever more sophisticated. The Fed joined the intellectual bandwagon with carefully telegraphed, perfectly regular policy moves, in the mistaken belief that markets would become more predictable if monetary policy
appeared to be.  � The entire enterprise ignored the primary rule of risk management i.e.,
the more people engaged in an investment activity, the more likely that a small disturbance in results will be amplified by a coordinated rush for the exits. In other words, popularity is the precursor of calamity.  � Another broad array of myths arose around the principle of diversification. This valuable portfolio
concept became confused with and eventually defined by various measures of statistical correlation. This simply proved to be another of the fallacies underlying modern, quantitative financial techniques, where series of numbers are manipulated
toward conclusions without a basic understanding of the processes that have generated them. Finance is not physics. Assets and strategies that were assumed to be unrelated because they had been in past cycles now proved highly correlated as a result
of common ownership, financing sources or inclusion in broad indices or widely held portfolio structures. These new sources of correlation did not generally exist in prior cycles and hence the statistical evidence of history pointed toward none of
the recent dangers. The efficient frontier proved to be a long, deep precipice.  � Underlying the entire investment Pantheon was an enormous, global financing mechanism that presumed normalcy across all asset categories at all times. Almost no margin for error was allowed. The combination of widespread portfolio
structures that were meant to take advantage of low volatility and normal relationships within and across all markets combined with the widespread use of leverage rates well in excess of 90% provided a perfect mix for the transmission of acute
distress across the entire landscape of global finance. In essence, the fourth quarter of 2008 provided a textbook example of an old fashioned panic and crash. The unique aspect of this one was the speed of propagation across nearly every asset
class and every corner of the global financial system.  � The scope of the dislocations
unfolding in the past year is such that it almost demands some broad, abstract characterization in order to begin any analysis or possible response. This is what seemed most lacking in governmental efforts to cushion the effects. Initial responses
were episodic and without

any thematic cohesion or understanding of the fundamental, as opposed to local, causes. This lack of broad perspective also accounts for the dismal investment
performance of many renowned value managers. Because their skills generally consisted in a thorough understanding of the values inherent in the assets and operations of individual companies, the abrupt change in macroeconomic conditions, which
altered the metrics of all security valuations, was overlooked or dismissed. Because most value approaches assume a gradual reversion to normalcy, dramatic shifts in the nature of normalcy have the ability to invalidate historic standards of value.
Bottom up expertise is fine unless the top down forces are overwhelming.  � In the
aftermath of Lehman�s failure, world markets underwent a colossal, synchronous margin call. A good amount of the call was unmet by additional provision of capital, and so there were widespread sell-outs into markets that had ceased to function
with any semblance of normal liquidity. The price declines were breathtaking. There was little performance differentiation among large cap equities, corporate bonds, commodities, emerging market securities, credit default swaps or other
over-the-counter (OTC) derivative markets. Where markets completely froze, the rush for liquidity simply intensified in those that were still functioning.  � At the heart of the issue was the matter of funding. Financial assets that were carried on credit were forced onto markets when the funding was withdrawn. This created a spiral of
lower valuations, diminished bank capital and further contraction of credit. In some ways, this was a financial analogue to the inventory cycles that shaped the economy in the past. In those cases, producers would accumulate large stocks of raw
materials or intermediate goods when it appeared that good times would go on forever. The Federal Reserve would tighten credit and most of the funding for inventories, which were largely carried with short term bank loans, would evaporate. Companies
would be forced to liquidate into the void of a credit starved marketplace. Prices would collapse and real commercial distress would ensue.  � In the current cycle, inventory excesses and inflation were generally concentrated in financial assets and property. Banks balance sheets exploded with excessive securities�
financing rather than commercial and industrial lending. The Fed�s own balance sheet, which represents the primary source of funding for the financial system, failed to keep pace. Market participants were forced to rely on private, short term
financing for a record stock of exotic, illiquid and recently conceived securities. As the adjacent chart shows, the Fed�s provision of liquidity through its balance sheet activities showed no meaningful expansion until crisis had reached full
force. Even after the Bear Stearns failure, the expansion of Fed lending in response to that crisis was rapidly allowed to dissipate, leading to the re-emergence of the same acute funding issues in the weeks before the Lehman debacle.  �

 The right side scale on the bottom chart represents the ratio of the Federal Reserve Bank balance sheet to Commercial Bank Assets (x1000). For example, a reading of 100 means
that the FRB balance sheet is 10% of the size of the Commercial Banking Sector�s Balance Sheet.  � Following the October crash, the Fed threw caution to the wind as far as its own balance sheet was concerned. The historic expansion of their funding activities is well documented,
and from our perspective, crucial in setting the stage for more normal markets.  � Both the
Fed and the U.S. Treasury were slow to recognize the essential nature of this particular crisis. In fact, the latter may still be at a loss if their continuing erratic and piecemeal approaches are any indication. The practical failure of the first
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) initiative could have been avoided if emphasis was placed on stopping the spiral of forced liquidation rather than removing certain �bad� assets from the banking system. Simply by funding those assets
within the institutions where they resided would have preempted any need to continue selling into non-existent markets. By providing term funding within any institution that requested it, the entire issue of valuation and moral hazard could have
been avoided. The troubled institutions would not have been rid of their mistakes, but would have had the leeway to hold them apart for some number of years and absorb the losses in an orderly fashion. This would have prevented the wholesale dumping
of good assets and the consequent impairment of institutions that had not been playing in traffic. The collapse in high grade corporate bond prices (since reversed) that briefly threatened the solvency of the entire insurance industry might have
been avoided.  � The ongoing conceptual failures at Treasury have not extended to the
Federal Reserve. Their willingness to provide funding support across a wide expanse of capital markets has reversed many of the pressures in the more fundamental elements of credit. Recall that it has been less than three months since a wholesale
run on money market funds seemed to be unfolding, with the attendant failure of the commercial paper market. Since the Fed began its funding efforts in earnest, high grade commercial paper (CP) (which they have purchased directly) has fallen to
historic low yields, while

second tier paper, which continued under pressure throughout 2008, has lately seen yields cut nearly in half.  � Other signs of restoration within the credit and money markets abound. Libor (London InterBank Offered
Rate) and swap spreads have retreated to near normal levels. Nominal short term rates of all sorts are at or near historic lows. High grade corporate bonds have rallied strongly, and issuance among investment grade companies is beginning to run at a
record pace. Credit, while being rationed by a crippled banking system, is available through the capital markets for high quality borrowers. Borrowing for speculative investment activities, including Leveraged Buy Outs (LBOs), activist hedge fund
forays and credit dependent relative value or arbitrage strategies is nearly impossible. Similar distinctions exist in mortgage markets.  � Large, high valuation commercial projects cannot be financed or refinanced under acceptable terms. The equity value in most large commercial property ventures that have financing
based upon either a rise in rental rates or an appreciation of the property has probably vanished. Jumbo mortgages are difficult to obtain for all but the most creditworthy, and even they are paying well above conforming levels. The direct support
of the conforming mortgage markets by the Fed is bringing nominal rates down to levels where large increases in refinancing activity have begun. Rates are now at levels where we expect to see a significant pick up in housing activity within the
conforming price limits at or near current price levels. Prices and activity at the luxury end have much farther to fall.  � 2009  � The turmoil in capital markets that characterized 2008 is rapidly emerging in the global economy. There, the economic mythology that suggested the invulnerability of developing market economies to financial and asset price disruptions in
the U.S., Europe and Japan has suffered the intrusion of reality. Global demand, trade and investment have collapsed. Commodity prices have followed, thus undermining the main economic drivers of emerging market economies. Adding fuel to the fire is
a gradual realization that many of the speculative underpinnings of credit mania in developed world financial and property markets were transmitted and perfectly replicated in developing markets. A good deal of their apparent prosperity seems to
have derived from hedge funds, proprietary trading, currency speculation and luxury property development. Some of these activities were legitimate adjunct to local development, but many are turning out to be no more than secondary extensions of the
excesses in the developed nations. They have proven about as uncorrelated as Nasdaq and NYSE stocks.  � The founts of speculative wealth that shaped the last cycle and much of contemporary culture have run dry. All followed the general form of utilizing unlimited, cheap credit to create and amplify investment returns. The
business models behind the large, integrated investment and commercial banks have failed. Like the railroads of the late 19th century or the automobile manufacturers that proliferated during the 1920s, most of these institutions will cease to exist
in anything near their present forms, and will spend years in the repair shed. The same fate awaits much of the �alternative� investment universe, where thousands of private management firms will disappear.  � In the wake of these changes at the core of our financial system, there will be a long period in which
the relative fortunes of various business and professional sectors will realign. The oft heard complaint about �income inequality� will gradually lose its rhetorical cache, as it becomes clear in hindsight that the late lamented inflation
of capital assets was the primary driver of the disparities. Owners of capital assets and those who move them around and finance their movement naturally benefit disproportionately during a cycle in which real prices of those assets are dramatically
inflated. Now that that cycle has ended and reversed, its negative effects will fall more heavily on owners of capital assets, also known as rich people. The wealth envy that has driven a good deal of harmful political and legislative initiative
should begin to lose some potency. At least one can hope.  �

We have witnessed a deflationary cataclysm within the global balance sheet. Because all of our economic measurement systems
concentrate on analysis of national income statements (GDP-Gross Domestic Product), changes in the valuation of existing wealth are largely overlooked. This has confounded policy makers, who do not seem to have a page in their operations manual that
deals with generalized price changes across the balance sheet that are not clearly manifest in Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports. The oft heard protests of central bankers, that they are not in business to address what they term �asset
bubbles�, seems a basic evasion of their role in regulating the extent of credit expansions regardless of the consequences of those expansions. Credit excess drives all generalized price expansions, whether the object of the excess is consumer
goods or capital assets. If a central bank is unwilling to address a situation where credit grows at a far greater rate than the expansion of real output, it hardly has any excuse to exist.  � With the collapse of asset prices across a wide section of the economy, we have gone from a funding
crisis to one that involves longer term financing and solvency. The Fed�s actions to expand their balance sheet and provide funding support for a large segment of the money and credit markets has reduced the threat of another acute phase of
forced liquidation. The tension in the system is no longer concentrated in the interplay between security owners and their margin clerks, but between commercial debtors and creditors. We have entered the workout phase of a gigantic Chapter 11
filing, during which those who owe and those who are owed will have to sit down and work out some settlement that takes into account the new, lower levels of value that have arisen in a world where financing can no longer assume asset appreciation.
In some instances, e.g. the automobile industry, the process will be public, political and highly complex. In others, it will be as simple as a commercial mortgage holder taking possession of a property and accepting the operating cash flows in lieu
of the previous owner�s mortgage payments. In almost every instance, there will be some loss of nominal value for all parties concerned.  � It is in this process that adherence to free market principles by the incoming administration will be crucial. The genius of free markets lies in their freedom to adjust to change
in a way that continually clears the slate of harmful rigidities. When demand for a good or service diminishes, the price will fall until demand is restored. Markets that are burdened with oversupply will fall to a clearing level, at which the
excess is taken up and normal production can resume. When businesses become less profitable, compensation of employees with those businesses must fall to levels that allow the restoration of profitability. Absent that, the businesses will fail. All
aspects of a free market system must be sufficiently elastic so that the inevitable fluctuations can be smoothly adjusted to. The ability of prices to adjust easily is the central requisite for a properly functioning market economy. The difficult
fact for many people with a more interventionist bent to accept is that there is no such thing as a �proper� price level that can be divined by some group of assiduous politicians or their well credentialed retainers. The markets let you
know when a price has reached a level at which some restorative or restrictive response is forthcoming. Prices can only be characterized by the human responses that they provoke. Two dollars per gallon was always believed to be a high price for
gasoline, but in the recent cycle it didn�t seem to stop people from purchasing gigantic, powerful vehicles or driving them as far as always. Four dollars proved the real breaking point, but that was only apparent after the market took prices
there.  � With the perilous state of finance and global confidence, any policies that
inhibit the process of adjustment within capital markets and the real economy will be detrimental to prospects for recovery. To the extent that these policies tend toward those espoused by the left wing of the Democratic Party, there is the
potential for a longer, more serious period of depressed activity. We would be particularly alarmed by any moves to raise taxes, limit or alter the terms of international trade or compel unionization among more private sector workers.  �

To the extent that markets are allowed to adjust to the new environment, recovery in the U.S. housing sector should begin during
the next two quarters, as both prices and mortgage rates reach levels that provoke more normal demand and construction. Stabilization in housing activity (not a resumption of price appreciation) will be a precursor of a more general restoration of
demand and should provide some valuation metrics and liquidity within mortgage derivative markets. As with other areas of the economy, it is important that government allows house values to find levels at which there is a natural demand. Efforts to
artificially maintain previously inflated prices will only postpone real recovery.  � Any
stabilization and recovery in the real economy depends upon the restoration of normalcy in credit and money markets. The long term impairment of the banking system precludes a major role for bank lending as a counterweight to the economic malaise.
Capital markets will be called upon as a primary source of financing. In this context, the restorative trends underway within these markets are heartening. It was not long ago that the morning financial news was headed by the latest Libor fix. At
this writing three month dollar Libor has fallen from its October high of 4.80% to an historic low of 1.08%. Similar declines in rates for prime and second grade commercial paper are evident. Mortgage spreads have contracted, and investment grade
bond yields are well below their average long term yields, having come down substantially since October. Issuance of investment grade debt is accelerating to record levels in the U.S. and Europe.  � Three years ago we explained our concerns about property and mortgage markets by noting that in a
heavily indebted economy, seemingly benign changes in interest rates will have disproportionately severe effects on overall activity. At the time, people argued that interest rates, despite having risen substantially from their 2003 lows, were still
well within normal ranges. The idea that a 5% federal funds rate could precipitate a secular collapse of residential real estate was regarded as absurd. We are currently holding out a similar but functionally obverse proposition, namely, that the
very degree of indebtedness within our economy makes it extremely responsive to the palliative effects of lower interest rates. As credit markets continue to heal, the benefits of lower rates will be transmitted through an expanding section of
borrowers. Already, the automatic resets of corporate loans in relation to Libor is reducing rates for a large number of borrowers, as is the boom in mortgage refinancing with 30 year rates below 5%. As the effects of the Fed�s actions continue
to expand from their initial orbit, increasing rewards for some greater degree of risk assumption should be at hand.  � Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.  � Must be preceded or accompanied by a prospectus.  � Opinions expressed are those of Marketfield Asset Management and are subject to changes are not guaranteed and should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell a security.
 � Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Fund invests in
smaller companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting
methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment by the Fund in
lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities involve additional risks such as credit risk, prepayment risk,
possible illiquidity and default, and increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments. The Fund regularly makes short sales of securities, which involves the risk that losses may exceed the original amount invested, however a mutual fund
investor�s risk is limited to the amount invested in a fund. The

MARKETFIELD FUND  Expense Example  (Unaudited)  � As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1)�transaction costs, including redemption fees, and (2)�ongoing costs, including advisory
fees and other fund expenses. This Example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund, and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds. The Example is based on an
investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period (6/1/08 � 11/30/08).  �


Actual
�
Expenses  � The first line of the following table provides information about actual account values and actual expenses. Although the Fund charges no sales load, you will be assessed fees for outgoing wire transfers, returned checks and
stop payment orders at prevailing rates charged by U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, the Fund�s transfer agent. If you request that a redemption be made by wire transfer, currently a $15.00 fee is charged by the Fund�s transfer agent. You
will be charged a redemption fee equal to 1.00% of the net amount of the redemption if you redeem your shares of the Fund within sixty days of purchase. IRA accounts will be charged a $15.00 annual maintenance fee. To the extent the Fund invests in
shares of exchange-traded funds or other investment companies as part of its investment strategy, you will indirectly bear your proportionate share of any fees and expenses charged by the underlying funds in which the Fund invests in addition to the
expenses of the Fund. Actual expenses of the underlying funds are expected to vary among the various underlying funds. These expenses are not included in the Example. The Example includes, but is not limited to, advisory fees, fund administration
and accounting, custody and transfer agent fees and dividends on short positions. You may use the information in this line, together with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account
value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first line under the heading entitled �Expenses Paid During Period� to estimate the expenses you paid on your
account during this period.  �


Hypothetical
�
Example for Comparison Purposes  � The second line of the table provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund�s actual expense ratio and an
assumed rate of return of 5%�per year before expenses, which is not the Fund�s actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period.
You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of other funds. Please note
that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales charges (loads), redemption fees or exchange fees. Therefore, the second line of the table is useful in
comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds. In addition, if these transactional costs were included, your costs would have been higher.  �

Table of Contents
MARKETFIELD FUND  � Notes to Financial Statements  November 30, 2008 (Unaudited)  �


(1)
�
Organization  � Trust for Professional Managers (the �Trust�) was organized as a Delaware statutory trust under a Declaration of Trust dated May�29, 2001. The Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the �1940 Act�), as an open-end management investment company. The Marketfield Fund (the �Fund�) represents a distinct series with its own investment objectives and policies within the Trust. The investment objective of
the Fund is capital appreciation and income. The Trust may issue an unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest at $0.001 par value. The assets of the Fund are segregated, and a shareholder�s interest is limited to the Fund in which
shares are held. The Fund commenced operations on July 31, 2007. Costs incurred by the Fund in connection with the organization, registration and the initial public offering of shares were paid by Marketfield Asset Management, LLC (the
�Adviser�).  �


(2)
�
Significant Accounting Policies  � The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund in the preparation of the financial statements. These policies are
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (�GAAP�).  �


�
(a)
�
Investment Valuation  � Each security owned by the Fund that is listed on a securities exchange is valued at its last sale price on that exchange on the date as of which assets are valued.
When the security is listed on more than one exchange, the Fund will use the price of the exchange that the Fund generally considers to be the principal exchange on which the security is traded. Fund securities listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market,
Inc. (�NASDAQ�) will be valued at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price (�NOCP�), which may not necessarily represent the last sale price. If there has been no sale on such exchange or on NASDAQ on such day, the security is valued at
the closing bid price on such day. When market quotations are not readily available, any security or other asset is valued at its fair value as determined in good faith in accordance with procedures adopted by the Trust�s Board of Trustees.
These fair value procedures will also be used to price a security when corporate events, events in the securities market and/or world events cause the Adviser to believe that a security�s last sale price or NOCP may not reflect its actual
market value at the time of the U.S. market close. The intended effect of using fair value pricing procedures is to ensure that the Fund is accurately priced.  �


�
(b)
�
Foreign Securities  � Investment securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar amounts at the date of valuation. Purchases
and sales of investment securities and income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar amounts on the respective dates of such transactions.  � The Fund isolates the portion of the results of operations from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from those resulting
from changes in market prices of securities held. Reported net realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of portfolio securities, sales and maturities of short-term securities, sales of foreign currencies, currency gains or losses
realized between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions, and the difference between the amounts of dividends, interest and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the Fund�s books, and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts
actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses arise from changes in the values of assets and liabilities, including investments in securities at fiscal period end, resulting from changes in the exchange rate.
 �


�
(c)
�
Short Positions  � The Fund may sell a security it does not own in anticipation of a decline in the fair value of that security. When the Fund sells a security short, it must borrow
the security sold short and deliver it to the broker-dealer 
 �
23 


Table of Contents
MARKETFIELD FUND  � Notes to Financial Statements, continued  November 30,
2008 (Unaudited)  � 
through which it made the short sale. A gain, limited to the price at which the Fund sold the security short, or a loss, unlimited in size, will be recognized upon the
termination of a short sale.  � For financial statement purposes, an amount
equal to the settlement amount is included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as an asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current value of the short positions.
Subsequent fluctuations in the market prices of securities sold, but not yet purchased, may require purchasing the securities at prices which could differ from the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The Fund is liable for
any dividends or interest payable on securities while those securities are in a short position. As collateral for its short positions, the Fund is required under the 1940 Act to maintain segregated assets consisting of cash, cash equivalents or
liquid securities. These segregated assets are valued consistent with Note 2a above. The amount of segregated assets are required to be adjusted daily to reflect changes in the market value of the securities sold short. The Fund�s receivable
for proceeds on securities sold short is with one major security dealer. The Fund does not require this broker to maintain collateral in support of the receivable for proceeds on securities sold short.  �


�
(d)
�
Options  � The Fund may purchase and write call or put options on securities and indices and enter into related closing transactions. As a holder of a call option, the Fund has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a security at
the exercise price during the exercise period. As the writer of a call option, the Fund has the obligation to sell the security at the exercise price during the exercise period. As a holder of a put option, the Fund has the right, but not the
obligation, to sell a security at the exercise price during the exercise period. As the writer of a put option, the Fund has the obligation to buy the underlying security at the exercise price during the exercise period.  � The premium that the Fund pays when purchasing a call option or receives when writing a
call option will reflect, among other things, the market price of the security, the relationship of the exercise price to the market price of the security, the relationship of the exercise price to the volatility of the security, the length of the
option period and supply and demand factors. The premium is the market value of an option at the time of the trade.  � A purchaser (holder) of a put option pays a non-refundable premium to the seller (writer) of a put option to obtain the right to sell a specified amount of a
security at a fixed price (the exercise price) during a specified period (exercise period). Conversely, the seller (writer) of a put option, upon payment by the holder of the premium, has the obligation to buy the security from the holder of the put
option at the exercise price during the exercise period.  � An option that
is written by the Fund is generally valued at the last sale price or, in the absence of the last sale price, the average of the quoted bid and asked prices. An option that is purchased by the Fund is generally valued at the last sale price or, in
the absence of the last sale price, the quoted bid price. If an options exchange closes after the time at which the Fund�s net asset value is calculated, the last sale or last bid and asked prices as of that time will be used to calculate the
net asset value.  �


�
(e)
�
Federal Income Taxes   � The Fund complies with the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code necessary to qualify as a regulated investment company and makes the requisite
distributions of income and capital gains to its shareholders sufficient to relieve it from all or substantially all federal income taxes. Therefore, no federal income tax provision has been provided.  �


�
(f)
�
Distributions to Shareholders  � The Fund will distribute any net investment income and any net realized long- or short-term capital gains at least annually. Distributions from net realized gains
for book purposes may include short-term capital gains. 
 �
24 


Table of Contents
MARKETFIELD FUND  � Notes to Financial Statements, continued  November 30,
2008 (Unaudited)  � 
All short-term capital gains are included in ordinary income for tax purposes. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The Fund may also
pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements.  �


�
(g)
�
Use of Estimates  � The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  �


�
(h)
�
Share Valuation  � The net asset value (�NAV�) per share of the Fund is calculated by dividing the sum of the value of the securities held by the Fund, plus cash or other
assets, minus all liabilities (including estimated accrued expenses) by the total number of shares outstanding for the Fund, rounded to the nearest cent. The Fund�s shares will not be priced on the days on which the New York Stock Exchange is
closed for trading. The offering and redemption price per share for the Fund is equal to the Fund�s net asset value per share. The Fund charges a 1.00% redemption fee on shares held less than sixty days. These fees are deducted from the
redemption proceeds otherwise payable to the shareholder. The Fund will retain the fee charged as an increase in paid-in capital and such fees become part of the Fund�s daily NAV calculation. During the period ended November 30, 2008 the Fund
retained $4,164 of redemption fees.  �


�
(i)
�
Expenses  � Expenses associated with a specific fund in the Trust are charged to that fund. Common expenses are allocated between the funds of the Trust based upon the ratio of the net assets of each fund to the combined net assets of the
Trust, or other equitable means.  �


�
(j)
�
Other  � Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. The Fund determines the gain or loss from investment transactions on the identified cost basis by comparing the original cost of the security lot sold with the net sale
proceeds. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date and interest income is recognized on an accrual basis.  �


�
(k)
�
New Accounting Pronouncements  � In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (�FASB�) issued Interpretation No.�48, �Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes�
(�FIN 48�). FIN 48 addresses the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and establishes for all entities, including pass-through entities, such as the Fund, a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of
positions taken in filing tax returns (including whether an entity is taxable in a particular jurisdiction). The Fund recognizes tax benefits only if it is more likely than not that a tax position (including the Fund�s assertion that its income
is exempt from tax) will be sustained upon examination. The Fund adopted FIN 48 in fiscal 2008. The Fund had no material uncertain tax positions and has not recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of May�31, 2008. Also, the Fund
had recognized no interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in fiscal 2008. At May�31, 2008, the tax year 2007 remains open to examination in the Fund�s major tax jurisdictions.  � In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (�FASB�) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (�SFAS�) No. 157, �Fair Value Measurements�. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosure about fair
value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Fund adopted FAS 157. The Fund has performed an analysis of all existing 
 �

Table of Contents
MARKETFIELD FUND  � Notes to Financial Statements, continued  November 30,

investments to determine the significance and character of all inputs to their fair value determination. Based on this assessment, the adoption of FAS 157 did not have
a material effect on the Funds� net asset values.  � FAS 157 �
Summary of Fair Value Exposure at November�30, 2008  � Various
inputs are used in determining the value of the Fund�s investments. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:  � Level 1 � Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.  Level 2 � Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)  Level 3 � Significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund�s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments.)  �
The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.  � The following is a summary of the inputs used, as of November�30, 2008, in valuing
the Fund�s investments carried at fair value:  �

Other financial instruments are derivative instruments not reflected in the Portfolio of Investments, such as futures, forwards, options, and securities held short which are valued at the
unrealized appreciation/depreciation on the instrument.  � In
March 2008, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.�161, �Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities� (�SFAS 161�) was issued and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November�15,
2008. SFAS 161 is intended to improve financial reporting for derivative instruments by requiring enhanced disclosure that enables investors to understand how and why an entity uses derivatives, how derivatives are accounted for, and how derivative
instruments affect an entity�s results of operations and financial position. Management is currently evaluating the implications of SFAS 161. The impact on the Fund�s financial statement disclosures, if any, is currently being assessed.

Investment Adviser  � The Trust has an Investment Advisory Agreement (the �Agreement�) with the Adviser to furnish investment advisory services to the Fund. Under the terms of
the Agreement, the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, compensates the Adviser for its management services at the annual rate of 1.40% of the Fund�s average daily net assets.  � The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund�s other expenses for an indefinite
period at the discretion of the Adviser and the Board of Trustees to the extent necessary to ensure that the Fund�s operating expenses do not exceed (a)�2.00% through November�6, 2008; and (b)�1.75% on and after November�7,
2008 (the �Expense Limitation Cap�) of the Fund�s average daily net assets. For the period ended November 30, 2008, expenses of $39,771 incurred by the Fund were waived or reimbursed by the Adviser. Any such waiver or reimbursement is
subject to later adjustment to allow the Adviser to recoup amounts waived or reimbursed to the extent actual fees and expenses for a fiscal period are less than the Expense Limitation Cap; provided, however, that the Adviser shall only be entitled
to recoup such amounts for a period of three years from the date such amount was waived or reimbursed.  � The following table shows the remaining waived or reimbursed expenses subject to potential recovery expiring in:  �

MARKETFIELD FUND  � Additional Information  (Unaudited)  � Indemnifications  � Under the Fund�s organizational documents, its officers and Trustees are indemnified against
certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the Fund. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other parties. The Fund�s maximum exposure
under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet occurred. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be
remote.  � Information about Trustees  � The business and affairs of the Trust are managed under the direction of the Trust�s Board of

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the Commission's Public Reference Room, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-1520 (telephone (202) 551-5850).
Applicants' Representations
1. The Trust, a Delaware statutory trust organized as a series investment company, is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company and currently offers 22 series, one of which, Ascentia Alternative Strategies Fund, is advised by the Adviser (the “Fund”).[1] 
           The Adviser, a limited liability company organized under Nevada law, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940   (“Advisers Act”), and serves as investment adviser to the Fund under an investment advisory agreement with the Trust   (“Advisory Agreement”) that has been approved by the shareholders of the Fund and the Trust's board of trustees   (“Board”), including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons,” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act, of either the Trust or the Adviser  (“Independent Trustees”).
2. Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser provides the Fund with overall management services and continuously reviews, supervises and administers the Fund's investment program, subject to the supervision of, and policies established by, the Board. For the investment management services it provides to the Fund, the Adviser receives the fee specified in the Advisory Agreement from the Fund. The Advisory Agreement also permits the Adviser, subject to the approval of the Board and Fund shareholders, to enter into investment subadvisory agreements   (“Subadvisory Agreements”) with one or more subadvisers  (“Subadvisers”). The Adviser has entered into Subadvisory Agreements with various Subadvisers to provide investment advisory services to the Fund. Each Subadviser is, and every future Subadviser will be, registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The Adviser monitors and evaluates the Subadvisers and recommends to the Board their hiring, retention or termination. Subadvisers recommended to the Board by the Adviser are selected and approved by the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees. Each Subadviser has discretionary authority to invest the assets or a portion of the assets of a particular Fund. The Adviser compensates each Subadviser out of the fees paid to the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement.
3. Applicants request an order to permit the Adviser, subject to Board approval, to enter into and materially amend Subadvisory Agreements without obtaining shareholder approval. The requested relief will not extend to any Subadviser who is an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of the Trust or of the Adviser, other than by reason of serving as a Subadviser to one or more Funds  (“Affiliated Subadviser”).
4. Applicants also request an exemption from the various disclosure provisions described below that may require the Funds to disclose fees paid by the Adviser to each Subadviser. An exemption is requested to permit the Trust to disclose for each Fund (as both a dollar amount and as a percentage of the Fund's net assets): (a) The aggregate fees paid to the Adviser and any Affiliated Subadviser; and (b) the aggregate fees paid to Subadvisers other than Affiliated Subadvisers  (“Aggregate Fee Disclosure”). Any Fund that employs an Affiliated Subadviser will provide separate disclosure of any fees paid to the Affiliated Subadviser.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 15(a) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that it is unlawful for Start Printed Page 55569any person to act as an investment adviser to a registered investment company except pursuant to a written contract that has been approved by a vote of a majority of the company's outstanding voting securities. Rule 18f-2 under the Act provides that each series or class of stock in a series investment company affected by a matter must approve that matter if the Act requires shareholder approval.
2. Form N-1A is the registration statement used by open-end investment companies. Item 14(a)(3) of Form N-1A requires disclosure of the method and amount of the investment adviser's compensation.
3. Rule 20a-1 under the Act requires proxies solicited with respect to an investment company to comply with Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  (“1934 Act”). Items 22(c)(1)(ii), 22(c)(1)(iii), 22(c)(8) and 22(c)(9) of Schedule 14A, taken together, require a proxy statement for a shareholder meeting at which the advisory contract will be voted upon to include the “rate of compensation of the investment adviser,” the “aggregate amount of the investment adviser's fees,” a description of the “terms of the contract to be acted upon,” and, if a change in the advisory fee is proposed, the existing and proposed fees and the difference between the two fees.
4. Form N-SAR is the semi-annual report filed with the Commission by registered investment companies. Item 48 of Form N-SAR requires investment companies to disclose the rate schedule for fees paid to their investment advisers, including the Subadvisers.
5. Regulation S-X sets forth the requirements for financial statements required to be included as part of investment company registration statements and shareholder reports filed with the Commission. Sections 6-07(2)(a), (b), and (c) of Regulation S-X require that investment companies include in their financial statements information about investment advisory fees.
6.  Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions from any provisions of the Act, or from any rule thereunder, if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants state that their requested relief meets this standard for the reasons discussed below.
7. Applicants assert that the shareholders rely on the Adviser's experience to select one or more Subadvisers best suited to achieve the Fund's investment objectives. Applicants assert that, from the perspective of the investor, the role of the Subadvisers is comparable to that of the individual portfolio managers employed by traditional investment company advisory firms. Applicants state that requiring shareholder approval of each Subadvisory Agreement would impose costs and unnecessary delays on the Funds, and may preclude the Adviser from acting promptly in a manner considered advisable by the Board. Applicants note that the Advisory Agreement and any Subadvisory Agreement with an Affiliated Subadviser will remain subject to section 15(a) of the Act and rule 18f-2 under the Act.
8. Applicants assert that many Subadvisers use a “posted” rate schedule to set their fees. Applicants state that while Subadvisers are willing to negotiate fees that are lower than those posted on the schedule, they are reluctant to do so where the fees are disclosed to other prospective and existing customers. Applicants submit that the requested relief will encourage potential Subadvisers to negotiate lower subadvisory fees with the Adviser.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions: 
1. Before a Fund may rely on the order requested in the application, the operation of the Fund in the manner described in the application will be approved by a majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities, as defined in the Act, or, in the case of a Fund whose public shareholders purchase shares on the basis of a prospectus containing the disclosure contemplated by condition 2 below, by the sole initial shareholder before offering the Fund's shares to the public.
2. The prospectus for each Fund will disclose the existence, substance, and effect of any order granted pursuant to the application. Each Fund will hold itself out to the public as employing the management structure described in the application. The prospectus will prominently disclose that the Adviser has ultimate responsibility (subject to oversight by the Board) to oversee the Subadvisers and recommend their hiring, termination, and replacement.
3. Within 90 days of the hiring of any new Subadviser, the affected Fund's shareholders will be furnished all information about the new Subadviser that would be included in a proxy statement, except as modified to permit Aggregate Fee Disclosure. This information will include Aggregate Fee Disclosure and any change in such disclosure caused by the addition of the new Subadviser. To meet this obligation, a Fund will provide shareholders within 90 days of the hiring of a new Subadviser with an information statement meeting the requirements of Regulation 14C, Schedule 14C, and Item 22 of Schedule 14A under the 1934 Act, except as modified by the order to permit Aggregate Fee Disclosure.
4. The Adviser will not enter into a Subadvisory Agreement with any Affiliated Subadviser without that agreement, including the compensation to be paid thereunder, being approved by the shareholders of the applicable Fund.
5. At all times, at least a majority of the Board will be Independent Trustees, and the nomination of new or additional Independent Trustees will be placed within the discretion of the then-existing Independent Trustees.
6. When a Subadviser change is proposed for a Fund with an Affiliated Subadviser, the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will make a separate finding, reflected in the applicable Board minutes, that such change is in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders and does not involve a conflict of interest from which the Adviser or the Affiliated Subadviser derives an inappropriate advantage.
7. Independent legal counsel, as defined in rule 0-1(a)(6) under the Act, will be engaged to represent the Independent Trustees. The selection of such counsel will be within the discretion of the then existing Independent Trustees.
8. The Adviser will provide the Board, no less frequently than quarterly, with information about the profitability of the Adviser on a per-Fund basis. The information will reflect the impact on profitability of the hiring or termination of any Subadviser during the applicable quarter.
9. Whenever a Subadviser is hired or terminated, the Adviser will provide the Board with information showing the expected impact on the profitability of the Adviser.
10. The Adviser will provide general management services to each Fund, including overall supervisory responsibility for the general management and investment of the Fund's assets and, subject to review and approval of the Board, will: (a) Set each Fund's overall investment strategies; (b) evaluate, select and recommend Subadvisers to manage all or part of a Start Printed Page 55570Fund's assets; (c) when appropriate, allocate and reallocate a Fund's assets among multiple Subadvisers; (d) monitor and evaluate the performance of Subadvisers; and (e) implement procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the Subadvisers comply with each Fund's investment objective, policies and restrictions.
11. No trustee or officer of the Trust, or director or officer of the Adviser, will own directly or indirectly (other than through a pooled investment vehicle that is not controlled by such person) any interest in a Subadviser, except for: (a) Ownership of interests in the Adviser or any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Adviser; or (b) ownership of less than 1% of the outstanding securities of any class of equity or debt of a publicly traded company that is either a Subadviser or an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a Subadviser.
12. Each Fund will disclose in its registration statement the Aggregate Fee Disclosure.
13. The requested order will expire on the effective date of rule 15a-5 under the Act, if adopted.

Footnotes
1.
     Applicants request relief with respect to existing and future series of the Trust and any other existing or future registered open-end management investment company or series thereof that: (a) Is advised by the Adviser or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser or its successors; (b) uses the management structure described in the application; and (c) complies with the terms and conditions of the application (collectively, the “Funds”). For purposes of the requested order, “successor” is limited to an entity or entities that result from a reorganization into another jurisdiction or a change in the type of business organization. The only existing registered open-end management investment company that currently intends to rely on the requested order is named as an applicant. If the name of any Fund contains the name of a Subadviser (as defined below), the name of the Adviser or the name of the entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser that serves as the primary adviser to the Fund will precede the name of the Subadviser.

Welcome to The Trust





 
The Employee Ownership Difference


The Management Trust is the only 100% employee-owned company in the community association
management industry. Structured as an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), we are able to offer
potential employees something they cannot get at any other firm in our industry; ownership interest in
the company. This unique offering allows us to attract and retain the top national talent in community
association management.

Our structure as an ESOP brings with it a culture of entrepreneurialism that directly benefits each of our
clients. Every employee who touches a client account has a vested interest in ensuring the job is done
correctly and the promise to our client is fulfilled. Our service-based business model thrives on referrals for
new business. New business drives the firm, which in turn has a direct impact on each employee’s individual
bottom line. Simply put, our success is tied to the success of our clients.
OK. I’M INTRIGUED.






 
The Story of Us


BILL SASSER, CEO
An interesting thing happened one day back in 2004. Marshall Fant and I, the two co-owners of Transpacific Management Service, looked at each other and said, “So, what should we do with the rest of our lives?” From that simple conversation began the greatest and most rewarding professional journey either of us had ever embarked upon. But first, a bit of backstory.
Marshall and I had been partners since 1995, and had grown Transpacific into one of the premier community management firms in Southern California. Both of us brought quite a history to our partnership. He began his community management career in 1966 with Management Service Company, and I began my own in 1986 with Transpacific Management Company. After experiencing years of solid growth together and, more specifically, both of us reaching certain milestone birthdays, it was time for that fateful conversation. We explored many options for the company, but once we learned of this thing called an
ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan), we immediately knew that was the answer. What better way to honor our employees, all of whom contributed to the success of the company, than by giving them ownership in the company? Simply put, employee ownership felt morally right.
But then, things got really interesting. It hit me that I now was responsible to all these new employee owners to grow the business and increase the value of their shares in it. One of the ways to achieve both objectives was to invite more companies to join in this new adventure of ours. So through 2005 Marshall and I shared our vision with a few trusted industry friends for a company that would be national in its scope and impact, and one that would represent- through our collective employee ownership- a paradigm shift for our industry. Because we are picky about whom we consider friends, we offered
our vision only with like-minded company owners whom we knew to have the highest integrity, and shared our philosophical approach to corporate culture, employee ownership values and the community management industry.
Just like that, a mere 18 months after forming our ESOP, The Management Trust was born. The Management Trust brought together under a single employee ownership structure some of the most well respected community management firms in the Western United States including:

CDC Management (Washington)
Northwest Community Management (Oregon)
Kocal Management Group (Northern California)
Goetz Manderley (Central California)
Monarch Management Group (California Desert)
Transpacific Management Service (Southern California)

After surviving the inevitable bumps and bruises that accompany merging six firms into one, we decided it was time to expand the family further. We added a Las Vegas, Nevada office to our roster, and invited a few more firms to join The Management Trust. More recently, we have
welcomed into The Management Trust:

Parker Finch Association Services (Arizona, Nevada, Colorado)
Cuellar Realty (Arizona)
Professional Management Associates (Colorado)
TMC Management (Nevada)

We now serve community associations through Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Arizona and Colorado. And although we’ve grown considerably over the years, we have never lost sight of real purpose, to each other or to our clients. That purpose is reflected in our mission statement:
“Inspiring each other to take ownership of our potential.” To us, that means that every relationship is important and must be nurtured to its greatest extent. After all, conducting business without building strong relationships is neither fun nor much of a recipe for success. Our attorneys tell us we’re a company, but we feel more like a collection of people who take great pride in serving other people. That sounds like a pretty good business model to me.
It has been quite a ride since The Management Trust’s beginnings in 2005; challenging, exciting, rewarding and fun! The Management Trust is a journey I am grateful to have launched and one I continue to this day with the same vigor and enthusiasm.
Thank you for visiting us.
LET’S CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION

We remain keenly aware of each of our community association’s needs, making them better places to live. Here are some frequently asked questions and answers about our services.




What types of community associations do you manage?



Our job is to manage. Seems like a simple concept, but it’s a unique one in our industry. We work with you to establish objectives, then proactively turn your vision into reality. At The Management Trust, we understand that each community has a unique personality that is the sum of the individual residents. That is why each community association we manage is handled in a unique way.
Our experience allows us the expertise to manage any type of project, and specialize in everything from Homeowner and Condo associations to Large Scale and Master Planned communities. Are you in a specified Active Adult Community, High Rise, or Mixed Use development? We have a management team that is trained and certified to remain mindful of your goals and maintain your high expectations. For communities that have Declarant involvement, The Management Trust regularly works with both boards and builders to ensure the community flourishes upon completion.
SOUNDS GOOD, BUT WHAT ABOUT MY COMMUNITY?





Do you offer services for financial management independently?



We sure do. The Management Trust’s community association financial management services are not only included as part of our full service management program, they’re also offered independently to community associations requiring only financial management. All of our financial operations are SSAE 116 compliant and are highlighted by our TrustLink proprietary software. Our financial services include:

VENDOR BILLINGS MANAGEMENT

When vendor invoices are received, they are researched by our accounts payable department to ensure that they have not previously been paid and that vendor work has been completed. Bills are coded and categorized, ensuring expenses are correctly delineated in financial statements.




BUDGET PREPARATION

The budget is prepared by our accounting department and is reviewed until we’re confident that it is accurate and comprehensive. The budget is then provided by the manager in the board package, for review and approval, well in advance of the annual deadline.




AUDIT COORDINATION

Your community association manager provides the Board with proposals from various, reputable independent audit firms. Once the Board chooses an auditor, our accounting department provides all requested documentation to ensure ease of review and reporting.




ESCROW SERVICES

Escrow demand statements and change of ownership records, among many other certifications and verifications, are produced by our in-house escrow staff on behalf of the association.


I SPEAK FINANCE, AND I WANT TO KNOW MORE.






What services do you offer to builders and developers?

The property development teams at The Management Trust possess a wealth of experience and practical involvement in the planning and management of homeowners and condominium associations. We provide our builders and developer partners with expertise and services poised to help them build strong, successful community associations.
The Management Trust knows what the departments of real estate want to see in each state we operate in. Providing it to them on the first submission saves our clients time and money. We review plans and make recommendations on common area amenities, security features and other building-related systems.
Employees at regional offices throughout The Management Trust share best practices and experience in all types of communities, from high-rise, mixed-use projects, to master planned communities, to those with environmental considerations including water quality or lake and stream issues.
Our property management development teams also provide insight on working efficiently with architecture and engineering firms to remain vigilant about common design pitfalls and oversights, as well as, produce quality results in all aspects, from initial budget preparation to transitioning the management to the
community association.
So, to recap, we help prevent unnecessary costs and delays, and equip property development partners, builders and community associations for success, by providing support at every stage of the process. Building a community is hard enough, we make setting up the HOA easy.
GIVE ME THE NITTY GRITTY










vendorsTrusted Partners Program




Trusted Partners Program
Good for the vendor and good for the community.
Our Trusted Partners program is not only a risk management and quality assurance product for our client community associations, but it is also a business development and cost savings program for our vendors. That's what we call a "win, win". The impact of this program is readily apparent to our clients and vendors
alike.
Our Trusted Partners program is much more than being ‘added to the vendor list’. The Management Trust's better vetting process only accepts vendors who deliver high quality services, in a cooperative manner, for a fair price into our program.
The benefits for the vendor are palpable in three ways. First, Trusted Partners have the greatest opportunity to bid on services and most Trusted Partners experience a much higher win rate based on this status. Second, we provide a $2,500 client satisfaction guarantee for work performed by our enrolled vendors.
And third, our full contractor liability insurance coverage is provided to you at a lower than market rate for work completed in Trust communities, helping your bottom line smile.
Bringing together great vendors with HOAs that need their services is essential in fulfilling our mission to create the best community associations in the country. If you’re a service provider looking to grow your business volume and reduce overhead, then the decision is easy. Become a Trusted Partner.
JOIN OUR TEAM. GROW YOUR BUSINESS.

Board Members: Who are these guys and what do they do?




Posted


				by				Super User



				on				
Thursday, 13 July 2017




								in blog 













 
 
When I think of a Board of Directors, the first thing that comes to mind is a dark lit room, with men in suits, sipping scotch and joking about their last golf outing. Funny thing, times have changed. If you live in a Homeowners or a Condominium Association chances are you have a Board of Directors. These volunteer homeowners are hard at work to meet association needs, address pertinent issues, and protect the interests of you, as a homeowner. But how do they get to be on the board, and what exactly do they do? 

How did they get there?  

Your Board of Directors are elected by the people of the association via a secret ballot and in accordance with local and state laws, and your community’s governing documents also known as CC&Rs and ByLaws. You may have read them when you purchased your home. 
In cases of vacant seats, Directors may be appointed directly by the Board. 



 

What exactly do they do? 

The Board may choose to contract a management company (The Management Trust, for example) to assist in developing and achieving the community’s goals in order to maintain common area and increase property value within the community. With the assistance of management: 

Board members vote on matters related to the association. This might include things like the budget or improvements, and/or repairs.
Each Board member’s vote should represent the needs and wants of all community members and they are expected to make “reasonable and unbiased decisions.”  
The Board is expected to know and understand the communities existing governing documents as well as local laws and statutes pertaining to Homeowners associations. Did you know they even existed?
Board Members work together to adopt or change rules & regulations for common areas for the community’s benefit.  





 

What can you expect from your management company?

A great customer experience, personalized to meet the needs of your community. 
A customized plan of action, to assist the Board of Directors in achieving community goals. 
The ability to provide resources, systems, tools, and training 
Access to Service Providers, Programs and dedicated professionals 
Last, but not least, a Professional & friendly partnership with your community and Board of Directors.  



 
You and your neighbors deserve to feel confident in your management. Read more on ways we can partner here.

6 Ways to Get your Home Ready for Summer




Posted


				by				Super User



				on				
Monday, 19 June 2017




								in blog 














 
 
Summer is officially here which means warmer weather, spending more time outdoors and welcoming friends and family into your home to celebrate the season. While this time of year might have you wanting to sit back and relax, there are a few things we recommend doing to get your home ready, running efficiently, and saving you a bit of money while you’re at it. Here are our 6 tips to get your home prepped for summer:
 
Let fresh air in
Trying to keep your home cool during the warmer months can often mean the windows and doors are locked tight. Don’t forget the benefit of opening up your home during the cooler times of the day though; early morning and after the sun has set. You can create a cross breeze to cool off your home before it resorts to turning the AC on. And while you do have everything closed? Consider adding a few houseplants to filter the air and brighten up your space. Snake plants, spider plants, english ivy and small-leafed rubber plants do well indoors.
 
Refrigerator Maintenance
Cleaning your fridge’s condensing coils helps keep your fridge running efficiently and saves you money. With the use you might have as guests filter through the kitchen in combination with the higher temps sneaking in everytime a member of your household grabs a drink, this could mean your appliance is working harder than it needs to.
Here’s how you can easily clean yours:


Unplug your fridge or turn off the appropriate circuit breaker


Check your owner’s manual to determine how to safely access coils


Use a vacuum cleaner with nozzle attachment to remove dirt/lint


 
Brighten up your home decor
Summer calls for light, bright and airy decor, with a few simple switches you can create that vibe in your own space. Refresh your heavy duvets with solid light colored linens, replace flannel sheets with lighter weight cotton or add a few new throw pillows indoors and outside. These quick switches will brighten up any home.
 
Prep your windows
Caulk any gaps in the framing of your windows. It’s amazing how much air can get through these tiny spaces, causing your electric bills to creep up when that AC kicks in more than it needs to!
 
Check your sprinklers for leaks
Leaks can add up fast, don’t let this costly mistake add to your bills or cause damage in your yard, especially with the extra use they receive during the warmer months. Look for any build up of water around your landscaping to identify problem areas. If you spot these, make sure to check for broken heads, cracked pipes, etc.
 
Prep your patio for summer gatherings!
As we said, you can expect to host a bit more than usual with the beautiful weather. These are a few of the items we keep on our to-do list every year:


Seal your deck to avoid any damage from harsh sun


Wash your outdoor cushions so they are ready for entertaining


Clean your grill


Give your plant beds a quick refresh with a few new potted plants and/or ground cover


 
What are your go-to tips to get your home summer ready?

How to Pick the Best Management Company for your Community




Posted


				by				Super User



				on				
Wednesday, 19 April 2017




								in blog 














 
Many think community association management companies are all alike.  And for the most part they are probably right.  This is because most firms try to shoe-horn your community into a “one-size fits all” approach, which makes it difficult to adapt to the changing needs of your community.  The good news for you is that our unique culture is not bound by our office walls.  Each of our local offices are filled with employee owners who are empowered to customize management plans to fit your needs. As we see it, you and your neighbors deserve to have a great experience every time you interact with our staff.
We could go on and on about all the special things we can do for you (and probably will), but let’s define how to know you’re getting the best experience when choosing a management company for your community.
 
The Contract 
You deserve professional management. You expect professional management.  However, the typical industry contract prevents true professional management of your community.  This is because most contracts reflect industry practices and standards that have evolved over many years.  
Essentially, those contacts place all the burdens of managing your community on the shoulders of you and your fellow directors, while absolving management of any and all responsibility, even our own actions.  Clearly that is not in the community’s best interest, does not value your precious time, and certainly does not allow us to demonstrate our professionalism and leadership abilities.
We understand that to be a professional means to take responsibility for the things we do and are responsible for.  It’s as simple as that. 
We are committed to making your time serving on the board as pleasurable and rewarding as possible.  Our new Management Service Agreement is a major step forward towards doing just that.
 
Community Managers 
Due to low barriers to entry, increased competition, little difference in the basic services offered within our industry, and
various economic factors, the community association management industry has become commoditized.  The Result? Community Managers have become reactive instead of proactive towards the needs of the community.  Unfortunately, it can happen to anyone.
How do we combat this in an industry rife with turnover?  Well it’s simple.  We Listen!  It’s one of our best services.  By listening, our Community Managers forge strong relationships with our clients and we gain great insights into the needs of the of the communities we represent.  The rest is Leadership Management.  Think of it this way, Leadership Management is a proactive, quantifiable approach to meeting the goals of the community. The bottom line is we get it done right. 
 
Risk Protection 
Do you have peace of mind knowing your community is actively reducing its exposer to risk and liability?  Do you know what your exposure to risk and liability even is?   Employing risk management best practices is something your community should take seriously, because exposure to financial risks, bodily injury and property damage claims is costly.
Our Trust Risk Assessment and Compliance Program (TRAC), Trusted Partner Program for Service Providers and in house Reserve Study programs are designed to minimize the risk inherent to special projects by creating strict standards for procedures, specifications and insurance to ensure consistent compliance by bidding vendors.  In other words, we’ve got your back.
 
Power to Influence
The Management Trust is the only 100% employee-owned company in the community association management industry. Structured as an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), we are able to offer potential employees something they cannot get at any other firm in our industry; ownership interest in the company. This unique offering allows us to attract and retain the top national talent in community association management.  The Result?  We are simply motivated to think differently, to do more and to do what is right every day.  Add to that a culture that encourages and embraces the unique talents that every employee-owner brings to the table, and you truly get our best efforts and a great customer experience.  We’re good in a different way.  Can your Community Association firm say that?
 
   
Give us a call.  We’d love to talk.  But mostly, we’d love to listen.

The Six Best-Kept Secrets for Selling Your Home




Posted


				by				Super User



				on				
Monday, 03 April 2017




								in blog 
















 

It’s no secret that every home-owner strives to sell their home in record time, at top dollar, and luck can only get you so far. With careful planning, the proper approach, and a little effort, your home will be sold in no time at a competitive price. The following are six secrets to aid in selling your home. 
 
Selling Secret #1: Make the Most of Your First Impression 
 
It’s true: curb appeal matters. The first thing potential buyers see is your home’s exterior, which provides a snapshot of what they anticipate the inside will look like. The goal is to make people feel welcome and safe as they approach their potential new home. Don’t underestimate the importance of a welcoming entryway. Immaculate landscaping, brightly colored flowers and fresh shrubs will upgrade your home’s initial impression.  Be sure to leave your outdoor lights on incase prospective buyers drive by at night.  Lastly, once inside, create a charming ambiance by displaying a vase of fresh-cut flowers or even some fresh cookies. 
 
Selling Secret #2: Clean and De-Clutter 
 
Now’s the time for the ultimate spring cleaning. Hire a professional cleaning company for a major deep clean. You’ll be moving out soon so start to pack up and donate anything you haven’t used in at least a year. Too much big furniture will make spaces seem smaller. Utilize a storage unit and remove excess furniture as a solution. This will instantly make your home appear bigger and calmer. Potential homebuyers are always seeking ample storage in a home. In order to be prepared for snooping, organize drawers and tidy up cabinets. Remove half of the stuff in your closet and strategically organize what’s left. Remove all knickknacks and take a minimalistic approach to kitchen surfaces, bathroom countertops, decorative rugs and drapery. 
 
Selling Secret #3: De-Personalize 
 
Take the home out of your house. Prospective buyers need to visualize your house becoming their home and it can be difficult for them if all your personal items are displayed. Remove items that makes your home “your” home, such as family photos, religious décor and memorabilia. Maximize the full potential of your house by staging it. Staging means arranging furniture in a way that showcases the floor plan in the best way possible while maximizing the use of space. Another staging trick is to exaggerate the light in your home. Take down drapes, open curtains/blinds/shades and replace old light bulbs. Do what you can to make every room light and bright – it will make your home more sellable. 
 
Selling Secret #4: Don’t Over-Upgrade
 
Major home makeovers aren’t always necessary since it’s unlikely that you’ll get your money back before putting your home on the market. Alternatively, make small improvements that won’t break the bank but will help you receive top dollar. Replace door knobs and cabinet handles with inexpensive new ones. Adjust closet doors that are off track and fix leaky faucets. Also, a fresh coat of paint will make a huge difference to liven your house. Cover up bright colors and accent walls with warm, natural tones such as light gray, off-white and cream. Creating a neutral color scheme will help buyers envision how they’ll decorate and add their personal touches. 
 
Selling Secret #5: Spread The Word 
 
Tell your neighbors that your home is for sale and invite them to your open house. More often than not they’re the best salespeople for your home because they can vouch to prospective buyers about how much they love the neighborhood. Share your home’s listing on social media platforms - the power of the online network is great for widening your reach. Create a video to post on social media showcasing your home and neighborhood. Make sure to include what you’ve loved about the house and your favorite nearby spots. Knowing the home was adored will help potential buyers imagine their life there and making it their own. 
 
Selling Secret #6: Advertise your HOA or COA
 
Living in a well-managed community is a huge plus for most people so highlight the perks of your neighborhood. Increased amenities, such as walking trails, sports courts, swimming pools, fitness center, or neighborhood parks are also helpful selling points. HOAs create a friendly and healthy living environment. Many communities take care of landscaping and gardening needs. Social events such as a welcoming party for new residents and block parties create community engagement.

Community Outreach: Casual for a Cause




Posted


				by				Super User



				on				
Friday, 21 October 2016




								in blog 
















During the past quarter, our Employee Owners have been busy giving back to the community with their me, resources and financially.
Our Palm Desert employees are going Casual for a Cause and will be donating the proceeds to their local YMCA. The Ronald McDonald House at Loma Linda is undergoing construction, and this has prevented them from preparing dinner. But, they do have a date scheduled for October once the construction is finished. They have also started preparing for their annual USO gala which will be held in November.
The NorCal office has also been busy supporting their community. A team of employees cleaned the beach for the Monterey Bay Aquarium in April. During the month of June, they are collecting donations for their Ronald McDonald House, and their next event will be hos ng a social event in a local nursing home.
SoCal is currently going Casual for a Cause and are supporting the Challenged Athletes Foundation. The money raised will help a team of TMT employees compete in the CAF triathlon in October. The team will swim 1 mile in the ocean, bike 44 miles and then run 10 miles, all to raise funds for athletes with disabilities.
Nevada employees collected 340 items to donate to their local food pantry, Three Squares. These items weighed a whopping 171 pounds and equates to 143 meals for those who are hur ng for money and cannot provide meals for their families. They also went Casual for a Cause in May, raising $266 for Project 999, an organization that supports injured law enforcement officers and the families of fallen law enforcement officers.
The Employee Owners in Oregon heard about Project 999 while at the last Leadership meeting, and decided their June Casual for a Cause would also benefit this amazing organizations.
While it was not a divisional effort, a number of Arizona employees also made donations to support Project 999.
The Employee Owners in the Central Coast went Casual for a Cause for Project 999 raising an impressive $1,300!! The leadership in this office was touched by the fundraising efforts of the daughter of one of the TMT employees. 15-year-old Dani Bush, whose father was a police officer and passed away from cancer in 2012, participated in a portion of the bike ride that began in Sacramento, CA and ended in Westminster, CA – a distance of over 600 miles. Dani rode portions of the route from San Luis Obispo to the finish line, logging over 100 miles in two days.

Setting the Tone through Leadership Management




Posted

Friday, 21 October 2016




								in blog 
















By: Grace Pluck, Management Practices Committee
You have to set the tone and the pace, define objectives and strategies, demonstrate through personal example what you expect from others. –Stanley C. Gault
When asked to do this article while looking through the lens of Management Practices, I thought of all the ways that we can set the tone both internally and externally, who sets it and how the tone impacts all of our success. What exactly IS the tone that we want to set? I know you've heard this before, but we truly believe Leadership Management is the key to Setting the Tone here at The Management Trust. It reflects who we are as a company both internally and externally.
Internally, we need to remember that as employee owners we are all within our company. That's right, no matter your position, you have to voice and an equal investment in achieving success for all of us. How? By striving to be a leader that inspires others to provide exceptional customer service, or who volunteers to serve on a committee. Remember, simply having a positive attitude can rub off on others to look at their job and the company in a new light. That is what Leadership Management looks like.
Externally, our clients and homeowners rely on us to provide top notch customer service. We don't just manage Homeowners Associations, we provide Leadership Management to our Boards of Directors by providing proactive, quantifiable objectives and strategies that are customized for our clients, not the cookie-cutter approach of so many of our competitors. As leaders for our Associations, we work with boards to develop strategic initiatives that will lead them towards the future. Or, it may be as simple as going the extra mile to help a homeowner who needs to get a tricky ARC request resolved quickly. Whether the issues are financial (how we will pay for new roofs), physical (the landscape is old and tired), or administrative (finding the best way to deal with a new law); we set the tone to demonstrate that we are the leaders who can bring them creative solutions based on our Professionalism, Experience and Knowledge. So, lets "Set The Tone" in a way that is memorable, positive and shows Leadership Management!
- Grace Pluck, Management Practices Committee

The Single Most Important Word




Posted


				by				Super User



				on				
Friday, 21 October 2016




								in blog 
















By Brent Kocal, Director of Sales and Marketing
The question comes up every time I'm meeting with a prospective client. What are you not accomplishing at your community that you'd hoped to? The answer is worded a little differently every tie, but the gist of it is that they blame their management company for the lack of accomplishment. When I ask what their management company is doing to block their path, they tell me that it isn't about what their management company is doing, it's about what the company is not doing. Not calling them back. Not emailing them back. Not getting bids. Not … You fill in the blank.
I'm not one to look up quotes, but there is one floating around that says 90% of success is just showing up. I get it, but I'm not sure I entirely agree with it. To me, showing up is a baseline requirement for competent human beings. A core expectation.
Allow me to take poetic license to rephrase: 90% of success is just showing up if you show up ready to hustle. Without a doubt, HUSTLE is the single most important word if success is what we're after.
Hustling takes grit. It is hard. That's why a lot of people don't do it. That's also why we can use it to set us apart from every other company in the industry if we're willing to dig in.
I've been down in the trenches and up to the 30,000 foot view of this company. There is a LOT coming at us every day, regardless of our position. That's okay with me because when a lot comes at us, it means we're important. We're relevant. Somebody needs us. Of course, there are times when it can seem overwhelming.
We've all got an individual choice to make when the work stacks up faster than we can push it out. When that happens, we've got two options:
Let it overwhelm us, which means we might not even start doing the things we know need to be done.
Dig in. Recognize our individual capacity for greatness and hustle to get as much done as we can as well as we can possibly do it.
If we chose option A, then it most likely results in a salesperson from another company sitting in front of our client listening to all of the things we're not going for them.
If we chose option B, it will result in an undeniable competitive advantage for us. We will retain more clients, win more business and grow ESOP value. No question.
Now, I need to come clean. I lied to you about not looking up quotes. The little caveat is that I don't look up the quotes themselves. I look for people who inspire me and listen to what they have to say. Nobody inspires me to hustle more than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Here's what he says:
"Wake up determined. Go to bed satisfied."
I'm determined to sleep well tonight. How about you?

A word from Bill Sasser… President & CEO of The Management Trust




Posted


				by				Super User



				on				
Friday, 21 October 2016




								in blog 
















The Ice Cream Truck Scourge: I had the honor of delivering the keynote address at our California Desert division's annual director seminar. It was a wonderful success, and the clients in attendance seemed highly engaged and appreciative of the event.
During preparations for my presentation, I was browsing through various articles in my files and came upon an email forwarded from an industry friend that she received from a homeowner. It was so humorous, yet disturbing, I kept it for posterity. The email went something like this:
"Margo, I find it totally unacceptable that every afternoon I have to listen to the ice cream truck driving around our neighborhood. I moved into a gated community to escape 'The Ice Cream Trucks of the World.' I insist that you stop them immediately."
What? Really? When did ice cream trucks become a metaphor for all things that are bad things in this world? I remember quite fondly from my youth the sound of the ice cream truck as it approached every afternoon. A world of limitless deliciousness heading straight towards me! What could be better than than?
Is this homeowner's sentiment a symptom of a larger issue? I think it is.
My keynote address spoke of community associations as ecosystems. Ecosystems' are closed systems that sustain themselves through the interdependent relationships of its members. Think of a forest or the ocean- each member contributes to the overall health of the group. Ecosystems are threatened only when external influences are introduced into it. Just ask the dinosaurs, or our climate for that matter.
Obviously, community associations can never be fully closed systems, as our homeowners introduce external influences into them every day. Those influences are the social, physical and cultural changes that our world has been experiencing for decades now. Space limitations do not allow me to explore each of those changes here, but I believe this confluence of forces has resulted in the long term decline in social capital in our communities and the world around us. One need only to listen to the tone of the current presidential campaign to see that civility has become a rare commodity these days. Social capital is characterized by trust, engagement, reciprocity and mutual respect among neighbors and in society. In the thirty years I've been in the community management industry, it seems to me that the fundamentals of what we do has not changed in all those years, yet the business is harder than ever. I suspect if you have been in this business for any period of time, you feel the same.
I share with the conference attendees the following model used by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to analyze and predict behaviors.

Called the Social-Ecological Model of Health, it explores the characteristics of the individual (age, race, education, income), relationships (peers, family, social circles), community (physical surroundings of workplace, school, neighborhoods) and society (social norms, laws, policies) to predict behavior and long term physical and mental health. Note that these are overlapping, not concentric, circles. This speaks to the fact that each of these four factors influences the others.
In my presentation, I asked the simple questions of our clients as to where they believe the community association falls among these four overlapping circles. The answer is ALL of them. The communities that we manage affect the individuals, their neighbors and peers, the physical setting in which interactions occur and creates and influences policies and social norms not just for its own sake, but the larger society as well.
If our homeowners are bringing into our communities all sorts of external influences, then we (and our clients) need to understand our role in counteracting those influences through the policies, tone, style and programs/practices of our communities. Acknowledging that everything about the community association touches every aspect of the social-ecological model necessitates a new thinking in how we mange them. If we believe that our and the association's mission is merely to enforce the CCR's, then we need to aim higher.
Our mission should be- NEEDS to be – the cultivation of social capital within our communities. In every action we take, and every policy we make, consideration needs to be given to its impact to the overall trust, engagement, reciprocity and mutual respect of/for/among our community members.
If we are successful in reestablishing such social capital in our communities, the very nature of them will change. Not only will there be a positive change to practical issues such as compliance matters, but the communities themselves will begin to enjoy a very different sort of vitality.
Let that be our mission.
-Bill Sasser, President & CEO of The Management Trust

Our Take on the California Housing Market




Posted


				by				Super User



				on				
Friday, 21 October 2016




								in blog 
















California has some of the most expensive housing in the country. In the article, Why California is so expensive: It's not just the weather, it's the regulation, the author defines the situation with a financial view. Our very own CCAM Division President, Brent Kocal, gave us his insight and take on the article: http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2016/07/07/why-california-is-so-expensive-its-not-just-the-weather-its-the-regulation
"This article demonstrates the classic macroeconomics of supply and demand.  Governmental restrictions on new development choke supply in the most desirable areas where demand is the highest.  The result is higher market value for homes in those areas.  I think a couple of things will happen as a result of increased regulation.  The first is that home builders will have to push further and further out from city centers to build single family homes in commutable cities starving for economic growth.  Those cities will likely see home building and development fees as hitting the jackpot.  The second thing that's going to happen is that more people will choose to live closer to city centers in more condensed housing units.  This will increase demand from homebuyers for homebuilders to develop significant common amenities into their city center developments.
Both of those results play well into homeowners' associations.  Cities further out will want the development cash cow to be as fat as possible and will require homebuilders to install infrastructure and parks that will require owners' association's to maintain.  Developments closer to city centers will have common building maintenance responsibilities in addition to the common amenities." – Brent Kocal, CCAM Division President

Surveys: A Guide for Community Associations




Posted


				by				Super User



				on				
Friday, 21 October 2016




								in blog 
















Boards need to be in touch with residents. They need a sense of association members’ opinions and priorities when making decisions for the entire community. Surveys are an excellent way to obtain feedback on specific subjects and sample general attitudes of community residents. Boards that seek out and seriously consider resident’s opinions will likely foster a stronger sense of community, reduce violations and resident complaints, and generally find that residents support their efforts.
 
Conducting a community survey might reveal unknown problems or negative attitudes, but boards should never be reluctant to undertake surveys for these reasons. On the contrary, boards have a responsibility to recognize and rectify problems and address the sources of negative attitudes. Of course, the opposite is also true: surveys can confirm that the board is on the right track, provide support for difficult decisions, and demonstrate a board’s due diligence and sound business judgment.
 
Boards might also be reluctant to conduct surveys because they feel that the results constitute a mandate. However, surveys are not votes! Board members should remember that the information they collect is intended to help them make decisions, set priorities, and identify issues. Boards won’t always be able to respond to every issue raised in a survey; but, they will at least be aware of it, and they can factor it into their decision making. Residents will understand the information-gathering nature of a survey if it includes a cover letter from the board explaining the surveying process and purpose.
 
Survey results are an expression of attitudes on specific subjects at one point in time. Therefore, conducting surveys should be a regular–but not excessive-activity in any association. The value of a survey’s results is related to the level and breadth of participation by residents. Conducting surveys periodically demonstrates to residents and members the value of their views and accustoms residents to sharing those views.
 
There is no perfect research design, and associations need not worry about getting it perfect. Begin modestly with simple surveys on non-critical issues until the volunteer leaders and members become more familiar with the process. Boards and managers alike will become more comfortable with the process as they get underway.

Rights & Responsibilities for Better Communities: Principles for Homeowners




Posted


				by				Super User



				on				
Friday, 21 October 2016




								in blog 
















It is with this challenge in mind that Community Associations Institute (CAI) developed Rights and Responsibilities for Better Communities. Rights and Responsibilities can serve as an important guidepost for all those involved in the community—board and committee members, community managers, homeowners and non-owner residents.
Homeowners Have the Right To:

A responsive and competent community association.
Honest, fair and respectful treatment by community leaders and managers.
Participate in governing the community association by attending meetings, serving on committees and standing for election.
Access appropriate association books and records.
Prudent expenditure of fees and other assessments.
Live in a community where the property is maintained according to established standards.
Fair treatment regarding financial and other association obligations, including the opportunity to discuss payment plans and options with the association before foreclosure is initiated.
Receive all documents that address rules and regulations governing the community association—if not prior to purchase and settlement by a real estate agent or attorney, then upon joining the community.
Appeal to appropriate community leaders those decisions affecting non-routine financial responsibilities or property rights.

Homeowners Have the Responsibility To:

Read and comply with the governing documents of the community.
Maintain their property according to established standards.
Treat association leaders honestly and with respect.
Vote in community elections and on other issues.
Pay association assessments and charges on time.
Contact association leaders or managers, if necessary, to discuss financial obligations and alternative payment arrangements.
Request reconsideration of material decisions that personally affect them.
Provide current contact information to association leaders or managers to help ensure they receive information from the community.
Ensure that those who reside on their property (e.g., tenants, relatives, friends) adhere to all rules and regulations.

So what do you think? Are there any that should be added to this list? Let us know below!
