					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.

Quirónsalud to build Spain’s first proton beam therapy center
Quirónsalud, a unit of Fresenius Helios, is investing about €40 million to build a proton beam therapy center in Madrid. Scheduled for opening in 2019, it will be the first facility of this type for treating cancer patients in Spain. Currently, every patient who can benefit from proton beam therapy must seek treatment outside the country. In proton beam therapy, the use of a high-energy beam allows tumors to be irradiated with lower total doses of radiation and reduced exposure to surrounding tissue compared with conventional radiation therapy. Quirónsalud will also modernize and expand its radiotherapy clinics in Palmaplanas (Mallorca) and Seville.
