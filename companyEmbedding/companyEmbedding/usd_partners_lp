Oil by rail: USD Partners LP sets terms for $177 million IPO

USD Partners LP, an MLP spun out of US Development Group to own
oil and gas rail terminals, announced terms for its IPO on Tuesday.
The Houston, TX-based company plans to raise $177 million by
offering 8.9 million shares at a price range of $19 to $21. At the
midpoint of the proposed range, it would command a fully diluted
market value of $427 million.



The company is owned by United States Development Group, which
counts Goldman Sachs and, as of September, Energy Capital Partners,
as primary shareholders.    



USD Partners LP is a fee-based growth-oriented MLP with an
origination crude-by-rail terminal in Hardisty, Canada (170,000
barrels per day) and two destination ethanol rail terminals in San
Antonio, Texas (20,000 bpd) and West Colton, California (13,000
bpd).



For the six months ended June 30, 2014, total revenue fell 18% to
$11 million due to a decrease in railcar leases. Adjusted EBITDA
swung negative to -$1.5 million from $1.1 in the prior six months.
Pro forma for the offering, USD Partners LP had $100 million of
debt at quarter-end.



USD Partners LP, which was founded in 2014 and booked $24 million
in sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014, plans to list on
the NYSE under the symbol USDP. Citi, Barclays, Credit Suisse and
BofA Merrill Lynch are the joint bookrunners on the deal. It is
expected to price during the week of October 6, 2014.

USD Partners LP is a fee-based, growth oriented master limited partnership formed in 2014 by US Development Group LLC to acquire, develop and operate energy-related logistics assets, including rail terminals and other high-quality and complementary midstream infrastructure. In addition, we provide our customers with railcars and fleet services related to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons and biofuels by rail. We generate substantially all of our operating cash flow from multi-year, take-or-pay contracts. Rail transportation of energy-related products provides flexible access to key demand centers on a relatively low fixed-cost basis with faster physical delivery, while preserving the specific quality of customer products over long distances.

We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $145.0 million from the sale 
of 9,120,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting 
underwriting discounts, commissions and structuring fees. We intend to use 
these proceeds, together with the proceeds from borrowings of $100.0 million 
under our new term loan facility, as follows:

. to make a cash distribution to USD Group LLC of $98.0 million and to 
  reimburse USD Group LLC for $7.5 million of fees and expenses related to 
  this offering;

. to repay $97.8 million of indebtedness under USD’s current credit facility; 
  and

. to pay $2.0 million of fees and expenses in connection with our new senior 
  secured credit agreement, which will be comprised of a revolving credit 
  facility and a term loan.

The remaining approximately $39.7 million will be retained by us for general 
partnership purposes, including potentially to fund future acquisitions from 
USD and third parties and potentially for funding future growth projects, such 
as the potential acquisition from USD Group LLC of the Hardisty Phase II and 
Phase III projects on which we have been granted rights of first offer. USD 
has not offered these assets to us, and we are under no obligation to acquire 
these assets from USD with the proceeds of this offering, or otherwise. We do 
not presently have definitive agreements with USD or any third parties with 
respect to acquisitions. The consummation and timing of any future acquisitions 
of our right of first offer assets are subject to various contingencies, 
including USD’s successful development of such projects, USD’s willingness to
offer such projects for sale and obtain any necessary consents, our ability 
to negotiate acceptable purchase agreements and commercial agreements with 
respect to such acquisitions and our ability to obtain financing on acceptable 
terms. We may also consider the acquisition of other assets from USD and third 
parties. Any such acquisitions, however, will also depend on various 
contingencies, including our ability to identify attractive acquisition 
candidates and successfully negotiate acceptable acquisition agreements and 
our ability to obtain financing.

USD’s current credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable 
premium which equates to 3.90% as of June 30, 2014. An affiliate of an 
underwriter participating in this offering is a lender under the current USD 
credit facility and will receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering 
pursuant to the repayment of borrowings thereunder. In April 2014, our Canadian 
subsidiary which owns our Hardisty rail terminal borrowed $67.8 million under 
the current credit facility to fund the repayment of $67.0 million of 
intercompany indebtedness owed to USD.

The net proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option 
to purchase additional common units (approximately $17.4 million, if exercised 
in full, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and 
structuring fees) will be used to redeem from USD Group LLC a number of common 
units equal to the number of common units issued upon such exercise of the 
option at a price per unit equal to the net proceeds per common unit in this 
offering before expenses but after deducting underwriting discounts, 
commissions and the structuring fee.


The crude oil and hydrocarbon logistics business is highly competitive. The 
ability to secure additional agreements for rail terminalling and railcar fleet 
services is primarily based on the reputation, efficiency, flexibility, 
location, market economies and reliability of the service provided and the 
pricing of services.

With respect to our Hardisty rail terminal, we believe that we will face 
competition from other logistics services providers, such as pipelines and 
other rail terminalling service providers, for barrels of crude oil in excess 
of the minimum volume commitments under our terminal services agreements with 
customers. If our customers choose to ship excess crude oil via alternative 
means, we may only receive the minimum volumes through our Hardisty rail 
terminal, which would cause a decrease in our revenues. With respect to our 
San Antonio and West Colton rail terminals, we face competition from other 
terminals and trucks that may be able to supply end-user markets with ethanol 
and other biofuels on a more competitive basis, due to terminal location, and 
price, versatility and services provided. Both facilities are served by the 
Union Pacific (UP) Railroad. In the Southern California market, we compete 
directly with Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) served ethanol facilities 
in Fontana and Carson, as well BNSF served terminals in the San Diego area. 
A combination of rail freight and trucking economics, which make up the 
largest share of the value chain, make it very difficult to compete with other 
facilities in this market on terminalling throughput fees alone. In the San 
Antonio market, we also compete with a BNSF served facility, although our UP 
served facility is closer to the San Antonio metro area allowing advantaged 
trucking rates for certain end-user customers.

With respect to the railcar fleet services we provide, we may face competition 
from other providers of railcars in excess of the railcars currently contracted
for under our master fleet services agreements. This competition may limit our 
ability to increase the number of railcars under contract, and thus, limit our 
ability to increase our revenues. Furthermore, we may face competition from 
other parties interested in procuring railcars equipped to carry crude oil. We 
believe, however, that with our strong relationships with leaders in the 
railcar supply industry such as CIT Rail, Union Tank Car Company and Trinity 
Industries, we will be able to continue to procure railcars on more 
advantageous terms, with shorter lead times than our competitors.

We believe that, generally, we are favorably positioned to compete in our 
industry due to the strategic location of our terminals, quality of service 
provided at our terminals, independent strategy, our reputation and industry 
relationships, and the quality, versatility and complementary nature of our 
services. The competitiveness of our service offerings could be significantly 
impacted by the entry of new competitors into the markets in which we operate. 
However, we believe that significant barriers to entry exist in the crude oil 
logistics business. These barriers include significant costs and execution 
risk, a lengthy permitting and development cycle, financing challenges, 
shortage of personnel with the requisite expertise, and a finite number of 
sites suitable for development.


Company Description
We are a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by US
Development Group LLC to acquire, develop and operate energy-related rail
terminals and other high-quality and complementary midstream infrastructure
assets and businesses. Our initial assets consist primarily of: (i)


 an
origination crude-by-rail terminal in Hardisty, Alberta, Canada, with capacity
to load up to two 120-railcar unit trains per day and (ii) two destination unit
train-capable ethanol rail terminals in San Antonio, Texas, and West Colton,
California, with a combined capacity of approximately 33,000 barrels per day
(bpd). Our rail terminals provide critical infrastructure allowing our customers
to transport energy-related products from multiple supply regions to multiple
demand markets. In addition, we provide railcar services through the management
of a railcar fleet consisting of 3,799 railcars, as of August 1, 2014, that are
committed to customers on a long-term basis. We generate substantially all of
our operating cash flow by charging fixed fees for handling energy-related
products and providing related services. We do not take ownership of the
underlying commodities that we handle nor do we receive any payments from our
customers based on the value of such commodities. Rail transportation of
energy-related products provides efficient and flexible access to key demand
markets on a relatively low fixed-cost basis, and as a result has become an
important part of North American midstream infrastructure.

The following table provides a summary of our initial assets:

                                                Designed                                           
                                                Capacity         Commodity         Primary          Terminal  
      Terminal Name             Location         (Bpd)            Handled         Customers           Type    
                                                                              Producers/Refiners   
 Hardisty rail terminal     Alberta, Canada      ~172,629 (1)    Crude Oil        /Marketers       Origination
San Antonio rail terminal     Texas, U.S.          20,000         Ethanol     Refiners/Blenders    Destination
West Colton rail terminal   California, U.S.       13,000         Ethanol     Refiners/Blenders    Destination
                                                                                                   
                                                  205,629                                          

(1) Based on two 120-railcar unit trains comprised of 31,800 gallon 
    (approximately 757 barrels) railcars being loaded at 95% of volumetric 
    capacity per day. Actual amount of crude oil loading capacity may vary 
    based on factors including the size of the unit trains, the size, type 
    and volumetric capacity of the railcars utilized and the type and 
    specifications of crude oil loaded, among other factors.

We generate the vast majority of our operating cash flow in connection with
providing crude oil terminalling services at our Hardisty rail terminal.
Substantially all of the capacity at our Hardisty rail terminal is contracted
under multi-year, take-or-pay terminal services agreements with seven customers.
Furthermore, approximately 83% of the contracted utilization at our Hardisty
rail terminal is with subsidiaries of five investment grade companies including
major integrated oil companies, refiners and marketers. Each of the terminal
services agreements with our Hardisty rail terminal customers has an initial
contract term of five years. The initial terms of six of these agreements
commenced between June 30, 2014 and August 1, 2014, and the initial term of the
seventh agreement will commence on October 1, 2014. Additionally, each of these
agreements is subject to inflation-based rate escalators, and all but one
agreement has automatic renewal provisions. In addition to terminalling
services, we provide customers access to railcars under fleet services
agreements which commit customers to railcars and fleet management services on a
take-or-pay basis for periods ranging from five to nine years. These agreements
are generally executed in conjunction with commitments to use our rail
terminals.

For the six months ended June 30, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2013, we
had revenues of $10.9 million and $26.3 million, respectively, and net income
(loss) of $(5.2) million and $6.4 million, respectively. These figures do not
include the results of operations from our Hardisty rail terminal, which did not
commence operations until June 30, 2014.

One of our key strengths is our relationship with our sponsor, USD. USD is an
independent, growth-oriented developer, builder, operator and manager of
energy-related infrastructure and was among the first companies to successfully
develop the hydrocarbon-by-rail concept. USD has developed, built and operated
14 unit train-capable origination and destination terminals with an aggregate
capacity of over 725,000 bpd. Ten of these terminals were subsequently divested
in multiple transactions for an aggregate purchase price of over $740 million.
From January 2006 through July 2014, USD has loaded and/or handled through its
terminal network a total of over 75 MMbbls of crude oil and over 72 MMbbls of
ethanol. Furthermore, USD has a nationally recognized safety record with no
reportable spills at any of its terminals since its inception. USD is currently
owned by Energy Capital Partners, Goldman Sachs and certain of USD’s management
team members.

On September 19, 2014, Energy Capital Partners made a significant investment in
USD, and has indicated an intention to invest over an additional $1.0 billion of
equity capital in USD, subject to market and other conditions, over five years
to support USD’s growth and expansion plans. Energy Capital Partners, which
together with its affiliates and affiliated funds, is a private equity firm with
over $13.0 billion in capital commitments that primarily invests in North
America’s energy infrastructure. Energy Capital Partners has significant energy
infrastructure, midstream, master limited partnership and financial expertise to
complement its investment in us. To date, Energy Capital Partners and its
affiliated funds have 24 investment platforms with investments in the power
generation, electric transmission, midstream and renewable sectors of the energy
industry, including Summit Midstream Partners, LP, another public master limited
partnership. Funds affiliated with Energy Capital Partners have invested a
significant amount of capital in Summit Midstream Partners, LLC, the owner of
the general partner of Summit Midstream Partners, LP in order to fund in part
Summit’s continued development and acquisition of midstream assets. At any time
following September 19, 2019, Energy Capital Partners has the right to compel
USD to effect the total sale of Energy Capital Partners’ interests in USD and to
potentially compel USD to effect a total sale of itself pursuant to an auction
process.

USD, through USD Group LLC, currently has several major growth projects 
underway, including the development of strategically located destination and 
origination rail terminals for crude oil and other energy-related products. At 
the closing of this offering, we will enter into an omnibus agreement with USD 
and USD Group LLC, pursuant to which USD Group LLC will grant us a right of 
first offer on existing expansion projects at our Hardisty rail terminal for a 
period of seven years after the closing of this offering. USD and USD Group LLC 
will also grant us a right of first offer during this seven-year period on any 
additional midstream infrastructure assets and businesses that they may develop,
construct or acquire. We cannot assure you that USD or USD Group LLC will be 
able to develop or construct, or that we will be able to acquire, any other 
midstream infrastructure project including the Hardisty Phase II or Hardisty 
Phase III projects. Among other things, the ability of USD or USD Group LLC to 
develop the Hardisty Phase II and Hardisty Phase III projects, or any other 
project, and our ability to acquire such projects, will depend upon USD’s and 
our ability to raise additional equity and debt financing. We are under no 
obligation to make any offer, and USD and USD Group LLC are under no obligation 
to accept any offer we make, with respect to any asset subject to our right of 
first offer, including the Hardisty Phase II and Hardisty Phase III projects. 
Additionally, the approval of Energy Capital Partners is required for the sale 
of any assets by USD or its subsidiaries, including us, other than sales in the 
ordinary course of business, acquisitions of securities of other entities that 
exceed specified materiality thresholds and any material unbudgeted expenditures 
or deviations from our approved budgets. Energy Capital Partners may make these 
decisions free of any duty to us and our unitholders. This approval would be 
required for the potential acquisition by us of the Hardisty Phase II and 
Hardisty Phase III projects, as well as any other projects or assets that USD 
may develop or acquire in the future or any third party acquisition we may 
intend to pursue jointly or independently from USD. Energy Capital Partners is 
under no obligation to approve any such transaction. If we are unable to 
acquire the Hardisty Phase II or Hardisty Phase III projects from USD Group LLC,
these expansions may compete directly with our Hardisty rail terminal for 
future throughput volumes, which may impact our ability to enter into new 
terminal services agreements following the termination of our existing 
agreements or the terms thereof and our ability to compete for future spot 
volumes. Furthermore, cyclical changes in the demand for crude oil and other 
liquid hydrocarbons may cause USD or us to reevaluate any future expansion 
projects, including the Hardisty Phase II and Hardisty Phase III projects.

We believe USD intends for us to be its primary growth vehicle in North America.
We intend to strategically expand our business by acquiring energy-related rail
terminals and other high-quality and complementary midstream infrastructure
assets and businesses from both USD and third parties. We also intend to grow
organically by opportunistically pursuing growth projects and enhancing the
profitability of our assets. We believe that USD’s successful project
development and operating history, safety track record and industry
relationships will allow us to execute our growth strategy.
