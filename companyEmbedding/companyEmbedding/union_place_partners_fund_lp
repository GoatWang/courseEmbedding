  NEW YORK — The founder of the New York-based hedge fund
  Platinum Partners was arrested Monday
  as prosecutors unveiled an indictment charging him and six others
  with participating in an approximately $1 billion fraud.

  Mark Nordlicht, Platinum's founding partner and
  chief investment officer, was taken into custody at his New
  Rochelle, New York, home in connection with 
  charges contained in an indictment filed in federal court in
  Brooklyn.

  Others arrested included David Levy, Platinum's
  cochief investment officer, and Uri Landesman, the former
  president of the firm's signature fund, FBI spokeswoman Adrienne
  Senatore said.
Platinum is liquidating its hedge funds, two of
  which have received bankruptcy protection.

  The indictment said that since 2012, Nordlicht, Levy, and
  Landesman schemed to defraud Platinum investors by
  overvaluing illiquid assets held by its flagship fund.





  This caused a "severe liquidity crisis" that
  Platinum at first tried to remedy through
  high-interest loans between its funds before selectively paying
  some investors ahead of others, the indictment said.

  Nordlicht, Levy, and Jeffrey Shulse, the former chief executive
  officer of Platinum's majority-owned Black Elk
  Energy Offshore Operations LLC, also defrauded the Texas energy
  company's bondholders, the indictment said.

  A Platinum spokesman declined to comment.
  Nordlicht's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for
  comment. Michael Sommer, Levy's lawyer, said he looked forward to
  clearing his client's "good name."

  Lawyers for Shulse and the other defendants could not be
  immediately identified.

  Founded in 2003, Platinum Partners
  until this year had more than $1.7 billion under management, the
  indictment said. The flagship fund reported returning profits of
  more than 8% in 2015 and 7% from January to April 2016, it said.

  But this year, a series of investigations tied to
  Platinum came to a head, leading a Cayman Islands
  court to place its two main funds into liquidation in August.

  In June, Murray Huberfeld, a Platinum associate who
  prosecutors say was a founder, was charged in Manhattan federal
  court with orchestrating a bribe to the head of the New York City
  prison guards' union, Norman Seabrook, to secure a $20 million
  investment. Both have pleaded not guilty.

  Two weeks later, the FBI raided Platinum's Manhattan
  offices in a separate fraud investigation that culminated in
  Monday's indictment.

  Others indicted include Joseph Sanfilippo, the former chief
  financial officer of flagship fund Platinum
Partners Value Arbitrage Fund LP; Joseph Mann, a
  former Platinum marketing employee; and Daniel
  Small, a Platinum managing director.

  The case is US v. Nordlicht et al, US District Court, Eastern
  District of New York, No. 16-cr-640.

					Union Place Apts. in Franklin, MA acquired for $64m
					


					Published at: 2016-12-19 15:26 | Author: CIJ USA
				


					Prospect Capital Corporation along with Jones Street Investment Partners have purchased Union Place Apartments, a multifamily property located in Franklin, Massachusetts, for $64.8 million. Built between 2005-2006 at 10 Independence Way, the 300 unit property rests on a 32 acre site. Prospect and Jones Street plan on implementing a value-added investment program that includes in-unit upgrades, with Jones Street to serve as the day-to-day property manager for Union Place.

“The Union Place acquisition continues NPRC’s strategy of selectively acquiring real estate assets in conjunction with established property managers, where the assets benefit from a highly diverse tenant base, stabilized cash flow, and discount to replacement cost in markets with limited new construction pipelines and positive demographic and economic trends,” said Ted Fowler, Managing Director of Prospect Capital Management L.P.

Investments in any VCM strategy are not subject to the protections of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Performance data represents past performance, and past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance data is subject to revision following each monthly reconciliation and annual audit. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data presented. VCM is not required by law to follow any standard methodology when calculating and representing performance data. The performance of each VCM strategy may not be directly comparable to the performance of other private or registered hedge funds, real estate private equity funds, and private equity funds. See the private offering memorandum for each VCM strategy for complete information and risk factors.The Vukota Multi-Strategy Fund, LP and separately managed accounts based on VCM’s Multi-Strategy approach use investment techniques with risks that are different from the risks ordinarily associated with equity investments. Such techniques and strategies include high portfolio turnover risks, options risks, borrowing risks, short sale risks, non-diversification risks, and foreign investment risks, which may increase volatility and may increase costs and lower performance.
