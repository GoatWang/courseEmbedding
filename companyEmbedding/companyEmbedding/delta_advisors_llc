At Delta Financial Advisors, we are wealth managers. As an investment counseling firm registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are on your side providing financial and investment advice that meets your needs. We are not brokers and receive no commissions for our services, which eliminates any bias in making recommendations. Our interests are aligned with our clients’ as our fees are based on the assets that we manage.
Good results require education, experience and judgment – we use these qualities to deliver results for our clients. If you have ever felt uneasy, hesitant or disappointed with your investments, we would like to discuss how our firm can better serve you. If you are looking for a more customized approach to your unique financial situation, please give us a call.
