MORE ON OUR INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY










Words of Wisdom
“Most of all we need intimate knowledge of the past. Not that the past has any magic about it, but because we cannot study the future, and yet need something to set against the present, to remind us that the basic assumptions have been quite different in different periods and that much which seems certain to the uneducated is merely temporary fashion. A man who has lived in many places is not likely to be deceived by the local errors of his native village. The scholar has lived in many times and is therefore in some degree immune from the cataract of nonsense that pours from the press and the microphone of his own age.”
C.S. Lewis

Meet our team




































Investment Philosophy «  SouthernSun Asset Management





































 

 

























Investment Philosophy






We painstakingly evaluate companies in three critical areas: financial flexibility, management adaptability, and niche dominance.






Financial Flexibility
SouthernSun invests in companies we believe to be financially strong and flexible. It is important to us that these companies not be reliant on capital markets to execute their business plan. We seek financial strength as evidenced by:

Internally generated discretionary cash flow
Excess working capital
Organic revenue growth







Management Adaptability
At SouthernSun, we believe there is no substitute for knowing the management of the companies in which we invest our clients’ assets. It is critical that management be experienced. We visit with management teams and evaluate their facilities on a regular basis. Were they able to maintain their focus on long-term goals while moving through current conditions? In brief, we look for management that is:

Experienced
Forward thinking
Focused on measurable goals
Execution oriented







Niche Dominance
An equally important aspect of our investment process is that the businesses in which SouthernSun invests are niche dominant. Our portfolio companies distinguish themselves by the product(s) or service(s) they offer and are at a point in their life cycle when they are not readily recognized or rewarded in the marketplace. The primary competition for these entities is often a division or subsidiary of a large public company or a private company.









Portfolio Monitoring
Once companies make it into our portfolios at SouthernSun, our analysts conduct continuous evaluations of their financials, as well as monitor the business environment in which they operate. This work is performed from SouthernSun’s headquarters as well as in the field.
We visit management and their facilities on a regular basis. We do not believe we can truly know what is happening at a company unless we maintain regular contact with them. We also take advantage of event-driven market anomalies and adjust our positions, as determined by our Investment Team.

Investment Strategies «  SouthernSun Asset Management





































 

 

























Investment Strategies






SouthernSun follows a proven investment process within its SMID Cap, Small Cap and Global Opportunities investment strategies. While these strategies differ in terms of the size of companies held in each portfolio, the investment team’s approach to implementing them is the same.






SMID Cap Strategy
Our SMID Cap Strategy generally holds between twenty (20) and thirty (30) positions at any time. The market capitalization of these domestic companies are within the range of the Russell 2500 at the time of initial purchase. No single company will generally be greater than ten percent (10%) of the portfolio value. Currently, this strategy may be accessed through three product types: separately managed account ($20 million minimum), mutual fund (AMG SouthernSun U.S. Equity Fund), and UCITS fund (SouthernSun Value Fund PLC – U.S. Value Fund).


Small Cap Strategy
Our Small Cap Strategy seeks out domestic companies with a market capitalization within the range of the Russell 2000 at the time of initial purchase. Our target number of companies to have in this discipline is twenty (20) to thirty (30) at any time. No single company will generally be greater than ten percent (10%) of the portfolio value.
The Small Cap Strategy reopened on a limited basis as of April 15, 2016. Availability of the strategy is dependent on, among other things, the method of investment (i.e. – mutual fund), investment amount, strategy capacity, and is subject to change at any time.
Currently, this strategy may be accessed through two product types: separately managed account ($20 million minimum) and mutual fund (AMG SouthernSun Small Cap Fund).







Global Opportunities Strategy
Our Global Opportunities Strategy holds between fifteen (15) and thirty (30) companies from around the globe and is not restricted by market capitalization. Currently, this strategy may be accessed through two product types: separately managed account and mutual fund (SouthernSun Global Opportunities Fund).
For additional information on our firm strategies, please contact us at clientservice@southernsunam.com or call 901.341.2700.

We believe that there is little substitute for critical reasoning, attention to detail, revealing query, hard work, and patience.
INVESTMENT STRATEGIES









People Driven Culture
Our greatest assets are our people, so we believe that excellent execution and a healthy culture are inextricably linked.
MEET OUR TEAM










Our Philosophy
We painstakingly evaluate companies in three critical areas: financial flexibility, management adaptability, and niche dominance.
MORE ON OUR INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY










Words of Wisdom
“Most of all we need intimate knowledge of the past. Not that the past has any magic about it, but because we cannot study the future, and yet need something to set against the present, to remind us that the basic assumptions have been quite different in different periods and that much which seems certain to the uneducated is merely temporary fashion. A man who has lived in many places is not likely to be deceived by the local errors of his native village. The scholar has lived in many times and is therefore in some degree immune from the cataract of nonsense that pours from the press and the microphone of his own age.”
C.S. Lewis
Learning in Wartime
Oxford University, 1939
