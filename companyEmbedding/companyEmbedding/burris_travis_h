                                    This mount is for Bushnell Elite 3200 10x scope on my flattop AR in .223.  I purchased the quick disconnect version to allow for easy switching between the scope and my EOTech.  As others have mentioned, this comes with scope rings that have the rail...

                                    The mount works, and there isn't much wrong with it.  I expected the quick detach feature to be easier to use, and I also thought it was a feature I'd maybe want to use one day.  I realized detaching the scope will never happen, and that the added we...

                                    Fit great and zero the gun in 2 shot , have not taken it off to see if it zero again but will soon. It was very easy to install just took some adjustment on the knobs to have it fit tight but I should not have to do anymore adjustments.

                                    This Burris scope mount is well worth the money. Has some weight to it and built very sturdy. I have this on my Mosin Nagant and it stands up to recoil the Nagant kicks lol. I'm thinking about getting another for my AR10 build it should do well there...

                                    Second time purchasing this product from Optics Planet because it works fantastic. Clamps scope securely, mounts and adjusts perfectly. Two AR's,two different brand scopes, just one scope mount brand.
