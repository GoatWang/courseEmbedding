The Next Generation of Cell Therapies
Conventional therapeutics rely on drug molecules to effect change in the patient by manipulating the behavior of cells within the body. At SQZ, we aim to use cells as the therapeutic. By directly engineering complex cell functions, we aspire to develop therapies that are more effective and safer than conventional approaches - potentially allowing us to tackle the most devastating diseases.

SQZ Biotechnologies Company Key Developments

SQZ Biotech Partners with Roche to Develop Cell Therapy Treatment for Cancer
Dec 15 15
SQZ Biotech has partnered with Swiss drug giant Roche to develop a cell therapy platform to enable a patient's immune cells to fight a range of cancers. Under the agreement -- valued at $500 million in upfront and milestone payments -- SQZ will provide its technology to engineer B cells as a therapeutic platform for oncology. Specifically, the technology introduces proteins into a patient's B-cells that help activate killer T-cells to attack the cancer.


SQZ Biotech Announces Partnership with Roche to Fight Cancer with Novel Cell Engineering Technology
Dec 7 15
SQZ Biotech announced a partnership with Roche to develop a cell therapy platform that would empower a patient's own immune cells to fight a broad range of cancers. The deal leverages SQZ's pioneering technology to engineer B cells as a therapeutic platform for oncology a novel approach with the potential to overcome many of the shortcomings of current cell-based therapies. The agreement provides for over $500 million in upfront and potential clinical, regulatory and sales milestone-based payments for advancement of all products across all planned indications, in addition to royalties on potential future products. The proposed therapy involves using SQZ technology to introduce proteins into a patient's B-cells which will then help activate killer T-cells to attack the cancer. The ability to engineer such a response is fundamentally dependent on effective delivery of tumor-associated proteins, or antigens, into the patient's B cells. This delivery process is uniquely enabled by SQZ's technology and harnesses the power of the patient's own immune system to fight tumors more effectively across a broad range of cancer types.
