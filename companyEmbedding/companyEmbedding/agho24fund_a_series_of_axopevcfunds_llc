German healthcare robotics company ReActive Robotics raises seven digit Series A lef by MTIP MedTech Innovation Partners
07/06/2016 · Germany · Healthcare, Technology Equipment ·  Bayern Kapital, High-Tech Gruenderfonds, MTIP MedTech Innovation Partners, TQ-Group. 

Providing the best possible rehabilitation treatment to intensive-care patients, already 24 hours after hospital admission, directly into the patient bed: ReActive Robotics aims to make intelligent robotics the standard-of care in a field that has been dominated by manual therapy. A consortium of four investors, led by MTIP MedTech Innovation Partners AG and complemented by the High-Tech Gründerfonds, Bayern Kapital and TQ-Group, provides a seven-digit series-A to enable the development and clinical validation of several prototype until 2017.
The demographic change and a continuous increase of healthcare cost require intelligent automation solutions in therapy and care of heavily affected patients”, explains Dr. Alexander Koenig, founder and CEO of ReActive Robotics. “This fresh capital enables us to develop a robotics therapy prototype and clinically validate our early- mobilization concept in the intensive care unit”.
ReActive Robotics develops adaptive and intelligent therapy robotics which automate early- mobilization in the intensive care unit. Using robotic modules that can be attached and detached on and from the patient bed, patients can be mobilized directly in their hospital bed. As compared to existing solutions, this approach supersedes the time-intensive and dangerous transfer of the patient onto a separate therapy device. The market size is estimated to exceed 2 bn. Euros. The device is scheduled to become available in Europe the beginning of 2018.
Clinical studies demonstrate that intensive care unit patients that receive early mobilization can leave the hospital on average three days earlier which can lead to large cost savings. The improved therapy results can, however, only be achieved if the patient is mobilized several times per day. Manually providing such early-mobilization is expensive, as up to three therapists and nurses are required to move the patient. In comparison, the solution developed by ReActive Robotics can be operated by one care-taker. The therapist is alleviated from the heavy manual work by the robotics device and can focus on the patient. The therapy thereby not only becomes more cost effective but also more personal. “ReActive Robotics’ innovation represents a shining example of reducing therapy costs while improving patient benefits, and delivers a valuable contribution to the future sustainability of our healthcare system”, says Dr. Christoph Kausch, CEO of lead investor MTIP with regard to the investment.

ReActive Robotics was founded in Munich, Germany, in April 2015 with the vision to enable intensive care personnel to deliver the best possible rehabilitation therapy to their patients. As part of the Business Incubation Center of the European Space Agency ESA-BIC Bavaria, the team around the founder, Dr. Alexander Koenig, could win TQ-Group, one of the leading Technology companies with broad robotics know-how, as its partner in July 2015. ReActive Robotics was supported by the UnternehmerTUM and BayStartUP and already succeeded twice in the Munich Businessplan Competition 2016.
