W. Don Cornwell

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

W. Don Cornwell is the former CEO, Chairman, and co-founder of Granite Broadcasting (1988–2009). He stepped down as CEO on August 31, 2009.
Founded in 1988 with the purchase of stations in Duluth and Peoria, Granite developed from an entrepreneurial idea into a diverse station group which operates and provides services to 23 channels in 9 markets, reaching more than six percent of U.S. television households. The Company owns or manages affiliates of NBC (4), ABC (3), CBS (3), one major market My Network TV (MNTV) affiliate and one major marketindependent station. In many markets, Granite broadcasts additional programming content including MNTV, The CW Network (CW), Spanish language programming such as TvAzteca and LATV, and 24/7 local news over the digital spectrum of its stations.
Granite grew through operating performance and the acquisition of more than 15 television stations to become, at one time, one of the 25 largest television station groups as measured by Broadcasting and Cable Magazine and the largest television broadcast company in America controlled by an African American. Black Enterprise Magazine named Granite as its Company of the Year in 1995. From 1991 through 2006, Granite was publicly owned with common stock listed on NASDAQ and several issues of debt registered with the SEC.
Granite declared bankruptcy in December 2006 in order to restructure its balance sheet and had its plan of reorganization approved by the court in June 2007.[1] Following the restructuring which included a severe period of recession beginning in 2007, Granite achieved significant reductions in station and corporate cost structure with widespread use of technology and innovative changes in business practices and business model.
He sits on the board of directors of Avon Products (since 2002),[2] Pfizer (since 1997),[3] American International Group (since 2011) and Big Brothers/Big Sisters of New York.[4]
Prior to founding Granite, Mr. Cornwell was employed by Goldman Sachs (1971 to 1988). He was formerly on the board of directors for CVS (1994–2007),[5] the National Association of Broadcasters, the Hershey Trust Company and Milton Hershey School(-2002),[6] the New York University Medical Center,[7] the Wallace Foundation[8] and chairman of Telecommunications Development Fund (1997–2006).[9] Former trustee of Occidental College, and Citizens Budget Commission (2001–2005).[10]
Cornwell received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Occidental College in 1969 and a master's degree in Business Administration from Harvard University in 1971.
Born 1948, Cushing, OK. He grew up in Tacoma, WA. He is married to Saundra Williams-Cornwell and has two children, K. Don Cornwell and Samantha Cornwell.

Awards:
1996 Occidental College, Alumnus of the Year Award
1999 Harvard Business School, Alumni Achievement Award[11]

W. Don Cornwell

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

W. Don Cornwell is the former CEO, Chairman, and co-founder of Granite Broadcasting (1988–2009). He stepped down as CEO on August 31, 2009.
Founded in 1988 with the purchase of stations in Duluth and Peoria, Granite developed from an entrepreneurial idea into a diverse station group which operates and provides services to 23 channels in 9 markets, reaching more than six percent of U.S. television households. The Company owns or manages affiliates of NBC (4), ABC (3), CBS (3), one major market My Network TV (MNTV) affiliate and one major marketindependent station. In many markets, Granite broadcasts additional programming content including MNTV, The CW Network (CW), Spanish language programming such as TvAzteca and LATV, and 24/7 local news over the digital spectrum of its stations.
Granite grew through operating performance and the acquisition of more than 15 television stations to become, at one time, one of the 25 largest television station groups as measured by Broadcasting and Cable Magazine and the largest television broadcast company in America controlled by an African American. Black Enterprise Magazine named Granite as its Company of the Year in 1995. From 1991 through 2006, Granite was publicly owned with common stock listed on NASDAQ and several issues of debt registered with the SEC.
Granite declared bankruptcy in December 2006 in order to restructure its balance sheet and had its plan of reorganization approved by the court in June 2007.[1] Following the restructuring which included a severe period of recession beginning in 2007, Granite achieved significant reductions in station and corporate cost structure with widespread use of technology and innovative changes in business practices and business model.
He sits on the board of directors of Avon Products (since 2002),[2] Pfizer (since 1997),[3] American International Group (since 2011) and Big Brothers/Big Sisters of New York.[4]
Prior to founding Granite, Mr. Cornwell was employed by Goldman Sachs (1971 to 1988). He was formerly on the board of directors for CVS (1994–2007),[5] the National Association of Broadcasters, the Hershey Trust Company and Milton Hershey School(-2002),[6] the New York University Medical Center,[7] the Wallace Foundation[8] and chairman of Telecommunications Development Fund (1997–2006).[9] Former trustee of Occidental College, and Citizens Budget Commission (2001–2005).[10]
Cornwell received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Occidental College in 1969 and a master's degree in Business Administration from Harvard University in 1971.
Born 1948, Cushing, OK. He grew up in Tacoma, WA. He is married to Saundra Williams-Cornwell and has two children, K. Don Cornwell and Samantha Cornwell.

Awards:
1996 Occidental College, Alumnus of the Year Award
1999 Harvard Business School, Alumni Achievement Award[11]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
