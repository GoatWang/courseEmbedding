Entity on the Closing Date pursuant to the Indenture and this
Indenture Supplement to be known as the “ Series 2010-4
Floating Rate Asset Backed Notes ” or the “
Series 2010-4 Notes .” The Series 2010-4 Notes shall
be issued in five Classes, the first shall be known as the “

,” the second shall be known as the “ Series 2010-4
Floating Rate Asset Backed Notes, Class B ,” the third
shall be known as the “ Series 2010-4 Floating Rate Asset
Backed Notes, Class C ,” the fourth shall be known as the
“ Series 2010-4 Floating Rate Asset Backed Notes, Class

The Series 2010-4 Notes shall be due and payable on the Series

or in an Interest Reallocation Group. Series 2010-4 shall not be
subordinated to any other Series.

(c) The
Series 2010-4 Notes are “Notes” and this Indenture
Supplement is an “Indenture Supplement” for all
purposes under the Indenture. If any provision of the Series 2010-4
Notes or this Indenture Supplement conflicts with or is
inconsistent with any provision of the Indenture, the provisions of
the Series 2010-4 Notes or this Indenture Supplement, as the case
may be, control.

(e)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, the
Series 2010-4 Notes, other than the Class E Note, shall be issued
in fully registered form in minimum amounts of $100,000 and in
integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof (except that one
Note from each such class may be issued in a different amount so
long as such amount exceeds $1,000);

provided
that the minimum amounts of the Series 2010-4 Notes, other than the
Class E Note, shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in

Balance.

SECTION 1.02
Reopening of Class or Tranche of Notes .

The
Depositor may from time to time, with notice to the Rating Agencies
but without notice to, or the consent of, the holders of a Class or
Tranche of Series 2010-4 Notes, create and issue additional Series
2010-4 Notes equal in rank to any Class or Tranche of Series 2010-4
Notes previously offered in all respects or in all respects, except
for the payment of interest accruing prior to the Issuance Date of
such additional Series 2010-4 Notes in a Class or Tranche of Series
2010-4 Notes or except for the first payment of interest following
the Issuance Date of such additional Series 2010-4 Notes in a Class
or Tranche of Series 2010-4 Notes. This is called a “
reopening .” When issued, the additional Series 2010-4
Notes of a Class or Tranche shall be equally and ratably entitled
to the benefits of the Indenture and this Indenture Supplement
applicable to those Series 2010-4 Notes with the other Outstanding
Notes of that Class or Tranche without preference, priority or
distinction. These additional Series 2010-4 Notes may be
consolidated and form a single Class or Tranche with the previously
issued Series 2010-4 Notes and shall have the same terms as to
status, redemption or otherwise as the previously issued Series

any date, 19.75%; provided , however , that if on any
Distribution Date, the Three Month Average Payment Rate is
(i) less than 25.00% but greater than or equal to 22.50%,
(ii) less than 22.50% but greater than or equal to 20.00%, or
(iii) less than 20.00%, then on the next Distribution Date,
the Subordination Factor shall be equal to (i) 21.95%,

the Subordination Factor would otherwise have been required to have
been increased rather than increasing the Subordination Factor. In
addition, the Depositor may (a) in its discretion increase the
Subordination Factor, increasing the Subordination Percentage and
thereby increasing the Class E Invested Amount and the Class E
Principal Amount by an amount equal to the product of (i) the
increase in the Subordination Percentage and (ii) the excess,
if any, of (A) the Net Invested Amount over (B) the

increase shall not cause the Required Nonoverconcentration Pool

therewith, decrease the Subordination Factor, with corresponding
decreases in the Subordination Percentage, the Class E Invested
Amount and the Class E Principal Amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Depositor shall not be permitted to increase the
Subordination Factor in its discretion without satisfaction of the
Series 2010-4 Rating Agency Condition with respect to each Class of
Series 2010-4 Notes in connection therewith if such increase would
result in the aggregate amount of all such increases together with
discretionary increases in the Class E Invested Amount and the
Reserve Fund exceeding 5.0% of the Note Principal Balance as of the
date of such increase.

Subordination
Percentage : As of
any date, an amount (expressed as a percentage) equal to

any Distribution Date, the arithmetic average of the Monthly
Payment Rate determined with respect to each of the three
