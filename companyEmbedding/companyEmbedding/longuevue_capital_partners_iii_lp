("LVC III" or the "Fund"). Building upon the track record of LVC's predecessor funds, LVC III will focus on private equity investments in lower middle market companies across a variety of industries. In launching the Fund, LongueVue Capital welcomed new institutional investors into the partnership, including The University of Texas Investment Management Company ("UTIMCO").

Historically, LVC has made successful investments in business services, transportation and logistics, healthcare, energy services, and niche manufacturing. "We are delighted to announce the closing of LVC III and are grateful for the confidence placed in us by both our returning and new limited partners," said Rick Rees, Co-founder and Managing Partner of LongueVue Capital. "We are thrilled to have UTIMCO and a number of other value-add limited partners as members of the LVC family. The lower middle market is an attractive sector for private equity investment, and we look forward to leveraging our strong track record and our value-oriented approach to identify exceptional opportunities to deploy capital." "Our complementary partnership with the U.S. Small Business Administration through the SBIC program enables LVC III to provide creative deal structures to entrepreneurs seeking growth capital," said John McNamara, Co-founder and Managing Partner of LongueVue Capital.
