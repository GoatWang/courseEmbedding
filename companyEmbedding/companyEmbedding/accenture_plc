History[edit]
Formation and early years[edit]
Accenture began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm Arthur Andersen[13] in the early 1950s when it conducted a feasibility study for General Electric to install a computer at Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky,[14] which led to GE's installation of a UNIVAC I computer and printer,[15] believed to be the first commercial use of a computer in the U.S.[16] Joseph Glickauf, an early pioneer of computer consulting, held a position as head of Arthur Andersen's administrative services division.[14]
Splitting from Arthur Andersen[edit]
In 1989, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting became separate units of Andersen Worldwide Société Coopérative (AWSC).
Throughout the 1990s, there was increasing tension between Andersen Consulting and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – pay the other the 15 percent ), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting claimed breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2 billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.[17]
Emergence of Accenture[edit]
On 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted its current name, "Accenture". The word "Accenture" is supposedly derived from "Accent on the future". The name "Accenture" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Accenture felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates.[18]




Accenture's banner hanging on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) building for its initial public offering on July 19, 2001.


On 19 July 2001, Accenture’s initial public offering (IPO) was priced at $14.50 per share, and the shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE); Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley served as its lead underwriters. Accenture stock closed the day at $15.17, with the day's high at $15.25. On the first day of the IPO, Accenture raised nearly $1.7 billion.[19]
Bermuda headquarters[edit]
In October 2002, the Congressional General Accounting Office (GAO) identified Accenture as one of four publicly traded federal contractors that were incorporated in a tax haven country.[20] The other three, unlike Accenture, were incorporated in the United States before they re-incorporated in a tax haven country, thereby lowering their US taxes. Critics, most notably former CNN journalist Lou Dobbs,[21] have reported Accenture's decision to incorporate in Bermuda as a US tax avoidance ploy, because they viewed Accenture as having been a US-based company.[22] The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a US-based company; it stated that "prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity."
Accenture engaged in a very large and ambitious IT overhaul project for the National Health Service (NHS) in 2003, making headlines when it withdrew from the contract in 2006 over disputes related to delays and cost overruns.[23] The government of the United Kingdom ultimately abandoned the project 5 years later for the same reasons.[24]
Ireland headquarters[edit]
Accenture announced on 26 May 2009 that its Board of Directors unanimously approved changing the company’s place of incorporation to Ireland from Bermuda and would become Accenture plc.[25]
Accenture was chosen to replace CGI Group as the lead contractor for HealthCare.gov in January 2014.[26] In December 2014, Accenture won a $563 million contract to provide ongoing maintenance, software development and technology support for HealthCare.gov through 2019.[27]
In July 2015 the United States Department of Defense awarded a major Electronic Health Records contract to Cerner, Leidos and Accenture. The contract valued $4.33 billion will serve 55 hospitals and 600 clinics. Accenture federal services and Leidos will play the role of configuration specialist while Cerner is the prime contractor.[28]

Marketing, branding and identity[edit]
In 2011, Accenture launched a new campaign of results-based ads featuring clients such as Marriott, Unilever and the Royal Shakespeare Company alongside its slogan “High performance. Delivered”.[35] As of 2016, Interbrand ranked Accenture No. 37 of its list of best global brands.[36] The brand consultancy noted Accenture's focus on branding and marketing of its Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations divisions.[37]
From at least 2005[38] until December 2009, Accenture used Tiger Woods as a celebrity spokesperson and advertised using the service mark "Go on, be a Tiger" and the ancillary statement "We know what it takes to be a Tiger" in association with his image. On 13 December 2009 after details of Woods' extra-marital affairs were exposed, the company terminated Woods' six-year sponsorship deal.[39]
The company uses a standardised system of branding, with extensive use of the font Graphik.[40]
From 1999, the firm's culture was parodied by the webcomic Bigtime Consulting, operated pseudonymously by its San Francisco-based employee James Sanchez.[41][42] The comic operated a store offering merchandise branded with the names 'Bigtime Consulting' and 'Indenture'. Sanchez left the company in 2000 but continued to operate the comic for some years.[43][44][45]

History[edit]
Formation and early years[edit]
Accenture began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm Arthur Andersen[13] in the early 1950s when it conducted a feasibility study for General Electric to install a computer at Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky,[14] which led to GE's installation of a UNIVAC I computer and printer,[15] believed to be the first commercial use of a computer in the U.S.[16] Joseph Glickauf, an early pioneer of computer consulting, held a position as head of Arthur Andersen's administrative services division.[14]
Splitting from Arthur Andersen[edit]
In 1989, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting became separate units of Andersen Worldwide Société Coopérative (AWSC).
Throughout the 1990s, there was increasing tension between Andersen Consulting and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – pay the other the 15 percent ), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting claimed breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2 billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.[17]
Emergence of Accenture[edit]
On 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted its current name, "Accenture". The word "Accenture" is supposedly derived from "Accent on the future". The name "Accenture" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Accenture felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates.[18]




Accenture's banner hanging on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) building for its initial public offering on July 19, 2001.


On 19 July 2001, Accenture’s initial public offering (IPO) was priced at $14.50 per share, and the shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE); Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley served as its lead underwriters. Accenture stock closed the day at $15.17, with the day's high at $15.25. On the first day of the IPO, Accenture raised nearly $1.7 billion.[19]
Bermuda headquarters[edit]
In October 2002, the Congressional General Accounting Office (GAO) identified Accenture as one of four publicly traded federal contractors that were incorporated in a tax haven country.[20] The other three, unlike Accenture, were incorporated in the United States before they re-incorporated in a tax haven country, thereby lowering their US taxes. Critics, most notably former CNN journalist Lou Dobbs,[21] have reported Accenture's decision to incorporate in Bermuda as a US tax avoidance ploy, because they viewed Accenture as having been a US-based company.[22] The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a US-based company; it stated that "prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity."
Accenture engaged in a very large and ambitious IT overhaul project for the National Health Service (NHS) in 2003, making headlines when it withdrew from the contract in 2006 over disputes related to delays and cost overruns.[23] The government of the United Kingdom ultimately abandoned the project 5 years later for the same reasons.[24]
Ireland headquarters[edit]
Accenture announced on 26 May 2009 that its Board of Directors unanimously approved changing the company’s place of incorporation to Ireland from Bermuda and would become Accenture plc.[25]
Accenture was chosen to replace CGI Group as the lead contractor for HealthCare.gov in January 2014.[26] In December 2014, Accenture won a $563 million contract to provide ongoing maintenance, software development and technology support for HealthCare.gov through 2019.[27]
In July 2015 the United States Department of Defense awarded a major Electronic Health Records contract to Cerner, Leidos and Accenture. The contract valued $4.33 billion will serve 55 hospitals and 600 clinics. Accenture federal services and Leidos will play the role of configuration specialist while Cerner is the prime contractor.[28]

The company uses a standardised system of branding, with extensive use of the font Graphik.[40]
From 1999, the firm's culture was parodied by the webcomic Bigtime Consulting, operated pseudonymously by its San Francisco-based employee James Sanchez.[41][42] The comic operated a store offering merchandise branded with the names 'Bigtime Consulting' and 'Indenture'.

History[edit]
Formation and early years[edit]
Accenture began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm Arthur Andersen[13] in the early 1950s when it conducted a feasibility study for General Electric to install a computer at Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky,[14] which led to GE's installation of a UNIVAC I computer and printer,[15] believed to be the first commercial use of a computer in the U.S.[16] Joseph Glickauf, an early pioneer of computer consulting, held a position as head of Arthur Andersen's administrative services division.[14]
Splitting from Arthur Andersen[edit]
In 1989, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting became separate units of Andersen Worldwide Société Coopérative (AWSC).
Throughout the 1990s, there was increasing tension between Andersen Consulting and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – pay the other the 15 percent ), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting claimed breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2 billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.[17]
Emergence of Accenture[edit]
On 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted its current name, "Accenture". The word "Accenture" is supposedly derived from "Accent on the future". The name "Accenture" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Accenture felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates.[18]




Accenture's banner hanging on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) building for its initial public offering on July 19, 2001.


On 19 July 2001, Accenture’s initial public offering (IPO) was priced at $14.50 per share, and the shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE); Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley served as its lead underwriters. Accenture stock closed the day at $15.17, with the day's high at $15.25. On the first day of the IPO, Accenture raised nearly $1.7 billion.[19]
Bermuda headquarters[edit]
In October 2002, the Congressional General Accounting Office (GAO) identified Accenture as one of four publicly traded federal contractors that were incorporated in a tax haven country.[20] The other three, unlike Accenture, were incorporated in the United States before they re-incorporated in a tax haven country, thereby lowering their US taxes. Critics, most notably former CNN journalist Lou Dobbs,[21] have reported Accenture's decision to incorporate in Bermuda as a US tax avoidance ploy, because they viewed Accenture as having been a US-based company.[22] The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a US-based company; it stated that "prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity."
Accenture engaged in a very large and ambitious IT overhaul project for the National Health Service (NHS) in 2003, making headlines when it withdrew from the contract in 2006 over disputes related to delays and cost overruns.[23] The government of the United Kingdom ultimately abandoned the project 5 years later for the same reasons.[24]
Ireland headquarters[edit]
Accenture announced on 26 May 2009 that its Board of Directors unanimously approved changing the company’s place of incorporation to Ireland from Bermuda and would become Accenture plc.[25]
Accenture was chosen to replace CGI Group as the lead contractor for HealthCare.gov in January 2014.[26] In December 2014, Accenture won a $563 million contract to provide ongoing maintenance, software development and technology support for HealthCare.gov through 2019.[27]
In July 2015 the United States Department of Defense awarded a major Electronic Health Records contract to Cerner, Leidos and Accenture. The contract valued $4.33 billion will serve 55 hospitals and 600 clinics. Accenture federal services and Leidos will play the role of configuration specialist while Cerner is the prime contractor.[28]

History[edit]
Formation and early years[edit]
Accenture began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm Arthur Andersen[13] in the early 1950s when it conducted a feasibility study for General Electric to install a computer at Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky,[14] which led to GE's installation of a UNIVAC I computer and printer,[15] believed to be the first commercial use of a computer in the U.S.[16] Joseph Glickauf, an early pioneer of computer consulting, held a position as head of Arthur Andersen's administrative services division.[14]
Splitting from Arthur Andersen[edit]
In 1989, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting became separate units of Andersen Worldwide Société Coopérative (AWSC).
Throughout the 1990s, there was increasing tension between Andersen Consulting and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – pay the other the 15 percent ), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting claimed breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2 billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.[17]
Emergence of Accenture[edit]
On 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted its current name, "Accenture". The word "Accenture" is supposedly derived from "Accent on the future". The name "Accenture" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Accenture felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates.[18]




Accenture's banner hanging on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) building for its initial public offering on July 19, 2001.


On 19 July 2001, Accenture’s initial public offering (IPO) was priced at $14.50 per share, and the shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE); Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley served as its lead underwriters. Accenture stock closed the day at $15.17, with the day's high at $15.25. On the first day of the IPO, Accenture raised nearly $1.7 billion.[19]
Bermuda headquarters[edit]
In October 2002, the Congressional General Accounting Office (GAO) identified Accenture as one of four publicly traded federal contractors that were incorporated in a tax haven country.[20] The other three, unlike Accenture, were incorporated in the United States before they re-incorporated in a tax haven country, thereby lowering their US taxes. Critics, most notably former CNN journalist Lou Dobbs,[21] have reported Accenture's decision to incorporate in Bermuda as a US tax avoidance ploy, because they viewed Accenture as having been a US-based company.[22] The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a US-based company; it stated that "prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity."
Accenture engaged in a very large and ambitious IT overhaul project for the National Health Service (NHS) in 2003, making headlines when it withdrew from the contract in 2006 over disputes related to delays and cost overruns.[23] The government of the United Kingdom ultimately abandoned the project 5 years later for the same reasons.[24]
Ireland headquarters[edit]
Accenture announced on 26 May 2009 that its Board of Directors unanimously approved changing the company’s place of incorporation to Ireland from Bermuda and would become Accenture plc.[25]
Accenture was chosen to replace CGI Group as the lead contractor for HealthCare.gov in January 2014.[26] In December 2014, Accenture won a $563 million contract to provide ongoing maintenance, software development and technology support for HealthCare.gov through 2019.[27]
In July 2015 the United States Department of Defense awarded a major Electronic Health Records contract to Cerner, Leidos and Accenture. The contract valued $4.33 billion will serve 55 hospitals and 600 clinics. Accenture federal services and Leidos will play the role of configuration specialist while Cerner is the prime contractor.[28]

From at least 2005[38] until December 2009, Accenture used Tiger Woods as a celebrity spokesperson and advertised using the service mark "Go on, be a Tiger" and the ancillary statement "We know what it takes to be a Tiger" in association with his image. On 13 December 2009 after details of Woods' extra-marital affairs were exposed, the company terminated Woods' six-year sponsorship deal.[39]
The company uses a standardised system of branding, with extensive use of the font Graphik.[40]
From 1999, the firm's culture was parodied by the webcomic Bigtime Consulting, operated pseudonymously by its San Francisco-based employee James Sanchez.[41][42] The comic operated a store offering merchandise branded with the names 'Bigtime Consulting' and 'Indenture'. Sanchez left the company in 2000 but continued to operate the comic for some years.[43][44][45]

History[edit]
Formation and early years[edit]
Accenture began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm Arthur Andersen[13] in the early 1950s when it conducted a feasibility study for General Electric to install a computer at Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky,[14] which led to GE's installation of a UNIVAC I computer and printer,[15] believed to be the first commercial use of a computer in the U.S.[16] Joseph Glickauf, an early pioneer of computer consulting, held a position as head of Arthur Andersen's administrative services division.[14]
Splitting from Arthur Andersen[edit]
In 1989, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting became separate units of Andersen Worldwide Société Coopérative (AWSC).
Throughout the 1990s, there was increasing tension between Andersen Consulting and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – pay the other the 15 percent ), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting claimed breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2 billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.[17]
Emergence of Accenture[edit]
On 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted its current name, "Accenture". The word "Accenture" is supposedly derived from "Accent on the future". The name "Accenture" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Accenture felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates.[18]




Accenture's banner hanging on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) building for its initial public offering on July 19, 2001.


On 19 July 2001, Accenture’s initial public offering (IPO) was priced at $14.50 per share, and the shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE); Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley served as its lead underwriters. Accenture stock closed the day at $15.17, with the day's high at $15.25. On the first day of the IPO, Accenture raised nearly $1.7 billion.[19]
Bermuda headquarters[edit]
In October 2002, the Congressional General Accounting Office (GAO) identified Accenture as one of four publicly traded federal contractors that were incorporated in a tax haven country.[20] The other three, unlike Accenture, were incorporated in the United States before they re-incorporated in a tax haven country, thereby lowering their US taxes. Critics, most notably former CNN journalist Lou Dobbs,[21] have reported Accenture's decision to incorporate in Bermuda as a US tax avoidance ploy, because they viewed Accenture as having been a US-based company.[22] The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a US-based company; it stated that "prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity."
Accenture engaged in a very large and ambitious IT overhaul project for the National Health Service (NHS) in 2003, making headlines when it withdrew from the contract in 2006 over disputes related to delays and cost overruns.[23] The government of the United Kingdom ultimately abandoned the project 5 years later for the same reasons.[24]
Ireland headquarters[edit]
Accenture announced on 26 May 2009 that its Board of Directors unanimously approved changing the company’s place of incorporation to Ireland from Bermuda and would become Accenture plc.[25]
Accenture was chosen to replace CGI Group as the lead contractor for HealthCare.gov in January 2014.[26] In December 2014, Accenture won a $563 million contract to provide ongoing maintenance, software development and technology support for HealthCare.gov through 2019.[27]
In July 2015 the United States Department of Defense awarded a major Electronic Health Records contract to Cerner, Leidos and Accenture. The contract valued $4.33 billion will serve 55 hospitals and 600 clinics. Accenture federal services and Leidos will play the role of configuration specialist while Cerner is the prime contractor.[28]
Services and operations[edit]

The company also operates a "National Security Services" business.[34]
Marketing, branding and identity[edit]
In 2011, Accenture launched a new campaign of results-based ads featuring clients such as Marriott, Unilever and the Royal Shakespeare Company alongside its slogan “High performance. Delivered”.[35] As of 2016, Interbrand ranked Accenture No. 37 of its list of best global brands.[36] The brand consultancy noted Accenture's focus on branding and marketing of its Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations divisions.[37]
From at least 2005[38] until December 2009, Accenture used Tiger Woods as a celebrity spokesperson and advertised using the service mark "Go on, be a Tiger" and the ancillary statement "We know what it takes to be a Tiger" in association with his image. On 13 December 2009 after details of Woods' extra-marital affairs were exposed, the company terminated Woods' six-year sponsorship deal.[39]
The company uses a standardised system of branding, with extensive use of the font Graphik.[40]
From 1999, the firm's culture was parodied by the webcomic Bigtime Consulting, operated pseudonymously by its San Francisco-based employee James Sanchez.[41][42] The comic operated a store offering merchandise branded with the names 'Bigtime Consulting' and 'Indenture'. Sanchez left the company in 2000 but continued to operate the comic for some years.[43][44][45]

Management Consulting
  Our management consulting growth platform is responsible for the development 
  and delivery of our strategic, operational, functional, industry, process and 
  change consulting capabilities, working closely with the professionals in our 
  operating groups and the other growth platforms. Our management consulting professionals 
  help large, complex organizations design and execute changes to their business 
  and operating models, either for one or more business units or across the entire 
  organization. This growth platform comprises seven function-based service areas, 
  as well as industry-focused teams of management consulting professionals with 
  deep skills in the numerous industry segments that we serve. The majority of 
  management consulting professionals have a primary focus on either one of the 
  seven service areas or on an industry, with a secondary focus on the other (i.e., 
  industry or service area).

The service areas are as follows:

  Finance & Enterprise Performance. The professionals in Finance & Enterprise 
  Performance work with our clients’ finance and business unit executives 
  to develop financial transaction processing, corporate finance and business 
  performance reporting capabilities. Among the services we provide are strategic

  help them align their companies’ investments with their business objectives 
  and establish security relating to the exchange of information with reporting 
  institutions.

  Operations. The professionals in Operations work with clients across a broad 
  range of industries to develop and implement measurable, lasting improvements 
  in all aspects of operations to enable profitable growth in new and existing 
  markets. Our professionals combine global industry expertise and skills in a 
  variety of areas, including operations and process transformation; sourcing 
  and procurement; innovation and product development; manufacturing strategy 
  and operations; service strategy and operations; integrated planning and fulfillment;

  industry and geographic regulations to drive positive business impact; and develop 
  capabilities to collect, model and analyze business information for better risk-based 
  decision-making.

  Sales & Customer Services. The professionals in Sales & Customer Services 
  (formerly Customer Relationship Management) help companies acquire, develop 
  and retain more profitable customer relationships to accelerate growth, improve 
  sales and profitability, and reduce sales operations and customer service costs. 
  We offer a full range of capabilities that address every aspect of sales and 
  post-sales customer service, including pricing strategy and profitability assessment, 
  customer analytics, direct and indirect salesforce performance improvement, 
  customer service, field support and customer contact operations.

  experience to help clients turn insights into results at both the enterprise

  corporate restructuring, growth and innovation strategies, mergers and acquisitions,

  transform organizations and drive sustained high performance.

  sustainability approaches into their business strategies, operating models, 
  critical processes and infrastructure, including technical operations and support, 
  to help them balance positive economic, environmental and social impact.

  Talent & Organization. The professionals in Talent & Organization work 
  with clients on a wide range of talent management, human resources, organizational 
  effectiveness, human capital, learning and change issues to deliver improved 
  business and operational results. Our integrated approach and end-to-end capabilities 
  include services and solutions in organization and change management, human 
  resources transformation, learning and collaboration, organizational performance 
  management, talent management and overall transformation of key workforces. 
  We help companies and governments improve the efficiency and effectiveness of 
  talent and organization capabilities while lowering associated costs; deliver 
  improvements in employee, workforce and business performance; improve the efficiency 
  and effectiveness of the human resources function and transform organizations 
  through project-, program- and enterprise-level change management.

In addition to our function-based service areas, we have specialized teams 
  that provide industry-specific management consulting services, which draw from 
  our functional service areas but are customized and adapted to each industry. 
  The majority of our management consultants—whether in a function-based 
  service area or on an industry management consulting team—have a specific 
  industry alignment, underscoring the strength of our industry assets and experience.

Technology
  Our technology growth platform comprises three service areas: systems integration 
  consulting, technology consulting and technology outsourcing.

Systems Integration Consulting
  Our systems integration consulting services and solutions include:

  Enterprise Solutions and Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”). We 
  implement a variety of application software—including SAP, Oracle, Salesforce.com 
  and Workday, among others—to consolidate operations, streamline business 
  processes, connect geographies and manage and exploit data to make more informed 
  business decisions.

  Industry and Functional Solutions. We provide clients with industry and functional 
  solutions that streamline, integrate and manage business processes, systems 
  and information, based on other vendors’ software assets or our own assets. 
  These are typically “add-ons” to our clients’ core ERP systems 
  or software to support industry-unique functions such as trading solutions and 
  billing systems. From design to implementation, these end-to-end services help 
  our clients improve analytics-based decision-making, financial management, customer 
  service excellence, supply chain management and human resource management.

  Information Management Services. We provide services to help organizations manage 
  the full range of their information needs to improve data quality, enhance decision-making 
  capabilities and meet compliance requirements across social media, cloud and 
  mobile platforms, as well as legacy environments. Our services include business 
  intelligence; content management and portals; data management; and data quality 
  solutions.

  Custom Solutions. With deep skills and expertise in both J2EE (Java-based) and 
  .NET technology architectures, we work with clients to develop custom solutions 
  that meet unique business needs, often using open-source technology products 
  and platforms.

  Microsoft Solutions. Together with our alliance partner Microsoft and our Avanade 
  subsidiary, we develop and deliver cost-efficient, innovative business solutions 
  across the Microsoft platform and full set of software, leveraging our deep 
  industry expertise and practical applications of technologies. We have also 
  helped a significant number of clients implement Microsoft’s BPOS (Business 
  Productivity Online Standard Suite) and other cloud-based tools using Microsoft’s 
  Azure platform.

Technology Consulting
  Our key technology consulting services and solutions include:

  Information Technology (“IT”) Strategy. We help client CEOs and 
  CIOs link IT investments to business results and help manage those investments 
  to ensure that the planned business impact is achieved. We also help CIOs transform 
  how IT works, both internally and with business partners, so that IT is “run 
  like a business” to deliver high performance.

  Infrastructure Consulting. We provide solutions to help clients optimize their 
  IT infrastructures—whether on-premise, in the cloud, or a hybrid—while 
  reducing costs. From virtualization of servers and desktops and service integration, 
  to data center operations engineering and enterprise network design and implementation, 
  our services are designed to enable clients to rationalize, standardize, optimize, 
  secure and transform their IT infrastructures for improved performance of mission-critical 
  business processes, applications and end-users.

  IT Security Consulting. We help clients integrate security into key business 
  processes and implement security tools and processes so they can become more 
  agile in response to changing market forces and evolving threats. Working with 
  us, our clients are better able to secure data and applications, protect identities, 
  address threats and vulnerabilities, and meet compliance demands while reducing 
  costs and improving efficiency.

  Application Modernization and Optimization. We specialize in defining and executing 
  strategies that transform our clients’ application portfolios into rationalized, 
  flexible, cost-efficient and reliable assets. Our services and solutions help 
  clients define and implement innovative approaches to extending the useful life 
  of legacy applications at a significantly reduced cost or help to retire platforms 
  and replace them with more modern, sustainable solutions.

Technology Outsourcing
  Our approach to technology outsourcing goes beyond traditional cost-cutting 
  measures to help clients improve the total performance of application and infrastructure 
  development and maintenance. We provide a full range of application outsourcing 
  and infrastructure outsourcing services and solutions:

  Application Outsourcing. We provide a wide array of application outsourcing 
  services under flexible arrangements, managing custom or packaged software applications—including 
  enterprise-wide applications such as SAP and Oracle—over their complete 
  development and maintenance lifecycles. Our scope of services ranges from standardized, 
  discrete application outsourcing services—including application testing, 
  application management of enterprise-wide software programs, and capacity services—to 
  large-scale application enhancement and development for individual or multiple 
  applications, or an entire portfolio of applications. 

  Infrastructure Outsourcing. We provide ongoing management of clients’ 
  IT infrastructure capabilities and functions, with expertise in six service 
  areas: service desk; workplace services; data-center services; network services; 
  security services; and IT spend management. We provide discrete skills (e.g., 
  capacity services) as well as fully managed services. Our services offer clients 
  a more cost-effective, secure and responsive infrastructure that can be scaled 
  and adapted to their business needs.
  Accenture helps business leaders and IT leaders define and execute a digital 
  agenda to support their business strategy, harnessing the power of digital technology 
  innovation, including social media, cloud, big data and analytics, and mobility 
  to help the entire organization better compete, innovate and expand. The following 
  initiatives span our three service areas described above:

  Cloud Computing. We provide cloud services in three areas to help clients improve 
  IT efficiency and agility: we help clients plan, implement and manage services 
  from our provider ecosystem; we develop Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions 
  built on our proprietary assets; and we provide provisioning, integration and 
  management of services to bridge operations across traditional and cloud environments 
  through the Accenture Cloud Platform. In addition, we help clients implement 
  SaaS, Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions 
  to meet their business needs with the added benefits of increasing flexibility 
  and reducing total cost of ownership. Our cloud methodology and toolset enable 
  delivery of cloud solutions across a wide range of services with leading providers 
  including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft, NetSuite, Oracle, Pivotal, 
  Salesforce.com, SAP, Verizon and Workday.

  Mobility Services. Accenture helps clients deliver mobility solutions, which 
  are designed to run their businesses more efficiently so they can focus on improving 
  connections with their customers and workforces. We develop and implement enterprise 
  mobile solutions incorporating strategies, applications, and managed services; 
  create and deliver mobile commerce solutions; and help organizations become 
  digital businesses.

Business Process Outsourcing
  Our business process outsourcing (“BPO”) growth platform provides 
  business process services that help clients drive business value, achieve higher 
  levels of performance and results, and/or reduce costs. Through our BPO services, 
  we manage specific business processes or functions for clients, providing solutions 
  that are more efficient and cost-effective than if the functions were provided 
  in-house while also providing business insight to drive business outcomes.
  We offer clients across all industries a variety of BPO services for specific 
  business functions and/or processes, including finance and accounting, human 
  resources, learning and procurement, among others. We also offer industry-specific 
  BPO services, such as credit services, designed to address the unique needs 
  of client organizations and deliver business outcomes. We provide these services 
  on a global basis and across industry sectors through our Global Delivery Network.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.

For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company.

Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

Question:
What are the focus areas of your organization? For example, is your organization focused solely on the pursuit of a profit, or is it focused on corporate citizenship and stewardship, or somewhere in between? How do these focus areas relate to the Seven Levels on an Ethical Organization? What level(s) is your organization operating at? What challenges or opportunities does this present when leading Project Teams?
 
Answer:

Overview of the company:
Accenture PLC is one of the largest global professional services occupying a predominant place in the realm of digital and technological operations (accenture.com, 2016). More than 373,000 employees are stretching their widespread wings in various branches of Accenture all over the World. Headquartered in Chicago, this particular organization tendhs to maintain some specific organizational cultures and beliefs from the very beginning. Employees have to maintain those organizational cultures and behaviors at the workplace. These cultures and ethics should reflect on the customers as well at the time of purchasing the service and products.
Seven levels of ethics:
In order to lead a business successfully every organization has to follow several values, culture and ethics at the workplace. Employees have to maintain those ethics at the time of their performance (Casmir, 2013). As per the article of David Gebler, the seven levels of ethics that Accenture tends to focus for maintaining at the workplace include:

Focusing on the financial stability
Effective communication among the employees as well as the managers
Maintaining a discipline in system and processes
Accountability
Alignment
Following corporate social responsibility
Focusing on the sustainability

These seven levels of organizational ethics are able to set the future mission and vision of the organization. Employees would like to perform well only when they would get a good gesture and behavior from the managers as well as from their leaders. Based on the employee performance the revenue status of the organization is highly dependent (Zadek, Evans & Pruzan, 2013). Therefore, maintaining effective communication among the employees is the workplace culture of Accenture. Furthermore, accountability has also been considered as one of the major focus for the organization. The overarching term accountability refers to liability.
At the time of recruitment, the human resource managers of Accenture clearly mention that responsibility should be the ultimate focus for every employee in this organization. Employees have to take the liability for whatever they are doing at the workplace, be it for the customers or for the internal services (Hu et al. 2014). If all the six levels of organizational ethics can be maintained successfully, the sustainable process would automatically go on.
 
Focus area of the company:
Maintaining only a good communication with the customers in order to keep a constant profit-planning making is not the primary concern of Accenture. This particular organization has left immense contribution in CSR actives for the communities (Shin, 2012). The managing director of UK stated in an occasion that the primary focus of this organization in UK is social sustainability. Youth unemployment is the primary focus of Accenture UK.
On one hand, the organization is able to receive a goodwill form the society after providing job opportunity to unemployed youths. On the other hand, these skillful and competent employees intend to provide their best endeavor for rendering the success of organization. Consequently, company does not have to face any difficulties in maintaining their financial stability in their entire business process (Schaubroeck et al. 2014). Therefore, only profit planning is not the key focus of Accenture, rather maintaining image and sustainability of their brand are also been taken into consideration.
How do these seven levels of ethics reflect on the focus area of the organization?
These seven levels of ethics reflect highly on the focus area of the organization. As per the belief of Accenture’s’ business experts, employees play a major role for the success of an organization. Therefore, maintaining employee relation at the workplace is highly important to get the best services from them. Thus, effective communication is one of the most important ethics maintained by the business experts of Accenture.
Revenue is the key source based on which the entire growth of business is highly dependent. Therefore, maintaining financial stability is one of the most important values maintained by the organization (Schneider, Ehrhart & Macey, 2013). In addition, as per the work culture of Accenture, CSR activities is one of the major concerns based on which the company is able to gain organizational reputation along with the profit making. With the help of CSR activities, Accenture has already created an impression in the mind of stakeholders.
Conclusions:
This particular study has provided an in-depth understanding about the importance of maintaining organizational ethics and culture at the workplace. The organizational ethics of Accenture is one of the major causes for rendering the success. This particular organization maintains the community relation in such a way that community people have already left an impressive appearance towards Accenture. On the other hand, the service providers of Accenture have also received immense positive response from the customers as well about their organizational beliefs and culture.

History[edit]
Formation and early years[edit]
Accenture began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm Arthur Andersen[13] in the early 1950s when it conducted a feasibility study for General Electric to install a computer at Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky,[14] which led to GE's installation of a UNIVAC I computer and printer,[15] believed to be the first commercial use of a computer in the U.S.[16] Joseph Glickauf, an early pioneer of computer consulting, held a position as head of Arthur Andersen's administrative services division.[14]
Splitting from Arthur Andersen[edit]
In 1989, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting became separate units of Andersen Worldwide Société Coopérative (AWSC).
Throughout the 1990s, there was increasing tension between Andersen Consulting and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – pay the other the 15 percent ), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting claimed breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2 billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.[17]
Emergence of Accenture[edit]
On 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted its current name, "Accenture". The word "Accenture" is supposedly derived from "Accent on the future". The name "Accenture" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Accenture felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates.[18]




Accenture's banner hanging on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) building for its initial public offering on July 19, 2001.


On 19 July 2001, Accenture’s initial public offering (IPO) was priced at $14.50 per share, and the shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE); Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley served as its lead underwriters. Accenture stock closed the day at $15.17, with the day's high at $15.25. On the first day of the IPO, Accenture raised nearly $1.7 billion.[19]
Bermuda headquarters[edit]
In October 2002, the Congressional General Accounting Office (GAO) identified Accenture as one of four publicly traded federal contractors that were incorporated in a tax haven country.[20] The other three, unlike Accenture, were incorporated in the United States before they re-incorporated in a tax haven country, thereby lowering their US taxes. Critics, most notably former CNN journalist Lou Dobbs,[21] have reported Accenture's decision to incorporate in Bermuda as a US tax avoidance ploy, because they viewed Accenture as having been a US-based company.[22] The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a US-based company; it stated that "prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity."
Accenture engaged in a very large and ambitious IT overhaul project for the National Health Service (NHS) in 2003, making headlines when it withdrew from the contract in 2006 over disputes related to delays and cost overruns.[23] The government of the United Kingdom ultimately abandoned the project 5 years later for the same reasons.[24]
Ireland headquarters[edit]
Accenture announced on 26 May 2009 that its Board of Directors unanimously approved changing the company’s place of incorporation to Ireland from Bermuda and would become Accenture plc.[25]
Accenture was chosen to replace CGI Group as the lead contractor for HealthCare.gov in January 2014.[26] In December 2014, Accenture won a $563 million contract to provide ongoing maintenance, software development and technology support for HealthCare.gov through 2019.[27]
In July 2015 the United States Department of Defense awarded a major Electronic Health Records contract to Cerner, Leidos and Accenture. The contract valued $4.33 billion will serve 55 hospitals and 600 clinics. Accenture federal services and Leidos will play the role of configuration specialist while Cerner is the prime contractor.[28]
Services and operations[edit]

The company also operates a "National Security Services" business.[34]
Marketing, branding and identity[edit]
In 2011, Accenture launched a new campaign of results-based ads featuring clients such as Marriott, Unilever and the Royal Shakespeare Company alongside its slogan “High performance. Delivered”.[35] As of 2016, Interbrand ranked Accenture No. 37 of its list of best global brands.[36] The brand consultancy noted Accenture's focus on branding and marketing of its Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations divisions.[37]
From at least 2005[38] until December 2009, Accenture used Tiger Woods as a celebrity spokesperson and advertised using the service mark "Go on, be a Tiger" and the ancillary statement "We know what it takes to be a Tiger" in association with his image. On 13 December 2009 after details of Woods' extra-marital affairs were exposed, the company terminated Woods' six-year sponsorship deal.[39]
The company uses a standardised system of branding, with extensive use of the font Graphik.[40]
From 1999, the firm's culture was parodied by the webcomic Bigtime Consulting, operated pseudonymously by its San Francisco-based employee James Sanchez.[41][42] The comic operated a store offering merchandise branded with the names 'Bigtime Consulting' and 'Indenture'. Sanchez left the company in 2000 but continued to operate the comic for some years.[43][44][45]

History[edit]
Formation and early years[edit]
Accenture began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm Arthur Andersen[13] in the early 1950s when it conducted a feasibility study for General Electric to install a computer at Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky,[14] which led to GE's installation of a UNIVAC I computer and printer,[15] believed to be the first commercial use of a computer in the U.S.[16] Joseph Glickauf, an early pioneer of computer consulting, held a position as head of Arthur Andersen's administrative services division.[14]
Splitting from Arthur Andersen[edit]
In 1989, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting became separate units of Andersen Worldwide Société Coopérative (AWSC).
Throughout the 1990s, there was increasing tension between Andersen Consulting and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – pay the other the 15 percent ), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting claimed breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2 billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.[17]
Emergence of Accenture[edit]
On 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted its current name, "Accenture". The word "Accenture" is supposedly derived from "Accent on the future". The name "Accenture" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Accenture felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates.[18]




Accenture's banner hanging on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) building for its initial public offering on July 19, 2001.


On 19 July 2001, Accenture’s initial public offering (IPO) was priced at $14.50 per share, and the shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE); Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley served as its lead underwriters. Accenture stock closed the day at $15.17, with the day's high at $15.25. On the first day of the IPO, Accenture raised nearly $1.7 billion.[19]
Bermuda headquarters[edit]
In October 2002, the Congressional General Accounting Office (GAO) identified Accenture as one of four publicly traded federal contractors that were incorporated in a tax haven country.[20] The other three, unlike Accenture, were incorporated in the United States before they re-incorporated in a tax haven country, thereby lowering their US taxes. Critics, most notably former CNN journalist Lou Dobbs,[21] have reported Accenture's decision to incorporate in Bermuda as a US tax avoidance ploy, because they viewed Accenture as having been a US-based company.[22] The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a US-based company; it stated that "prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity."
Accenture engaged in a very large and ambitious IT overhaul project for the National Health Service (NHS) in 2003, making headlines when it withdrew from the contract in 2006 over disputes related to delays and cost overruns.[23] The government of the United Kingdom ultimately abandoned the project 5 years later for the same reasons.[24]
Ireland headquarters[edit]
Accenture announced on 26 May 2009 that its Board of Directors unanimously approved changing the company’s place of incorporation to Ireland from Bermuda and would become Accenture plc.[25]
Accenture was chosen to replace CGI Group as the lead contractor for HealthCare.gov in January 2014.[26] In December 2014, Accenture won a $563 million contract to provide ongoing maintenance, software development and technology support for HealthCare.gov through 2019.[27]
In July 2015 the United States Department of Defense awarded a major Electronic Health Records contract to Cerner, Leidos and Accenture. The contract valued $4.33 billion will serve 55 hospitals and 600 clinics. Accenture federal services and Leidos will play the role of configuration specialist while Cerner is the prime contractor.[28]
Services and operations[edit]

Accenture Strategy provides business strategy, technology strategy and operations strategy services.[29]

The company also operates a "National Security Services" business.[34]
Marketing, branding and identity[edit]
In 2011, Accenture launched a new campaign of results-based ads featuring clients such as Marriott, Unilever and the Royal Shakespeare Company alongside its slogan “High performance. Delivered”.[35] As of 2016, Interbrand ranked Accenture No. 37 of its list of best global brands.[36] The brand consultancy noted Accenture's focus on branding and marketing of its Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations divisions.[37]
From at least 2005[38] until December 2009, Accenture used Tiger Woods as a celebrity spokesperson and advertised using the service mark "Go on, be a Tiger" and the ancillary statement "We know what it takes to be a Tiger" in association with his image. On 13 December 2009 after details of Woods' extra-marital affairs were exposed, the company terminated Woods' six-year sponsorship deal.[39]
The company uses a standardised system of branding, with extensive use of the font Graphik.[40]
From 1999, the firm's culture was parodied by the webcomic Bigtime Consulting, operated pseudonymously by its San Francisco-based employee James Sanchez.[41][42] The comic operated a store offering merchandise branded with the names 'Bigtime Consulting' and 'Indenture'. Sanchez left the company in 2000 but continued to operate the comic for some years.[43][44][45]

History[edit]
Formation and early years[edit]
Accenture began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm Arthur Andersen[13] in the early 1950s when it conducted a feasibility study for General Electric to install a computer at Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky,[14] which led to GE's installation of a UNIVAC I computer and printer,[15] believed to be the first commercial use of a computer in the U.S.[16] Joseph Glickauf, an early pioneer of computer consulting, held a position as head of Arthur Andersen's administrative services division.[14]
Splitting from Arthur Andersen[edit]
In 1989, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting became separate units of Andersen Worldwide Société Coopérative (AWSC).
Throughout the 1990s, there was increasing tension between Andersen Consulting and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – pay the other the 15 percent ), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting claimed breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2 billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.[17]
Emergence of Accenture[edit]
On 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted its current name, "Accenture". The word "Accenture" is supposedly derived from "Accent on the future". The name "Accenture" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Accenture felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates.[18]




Accenture's banner hanging on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) building for its initial public offering on July 19, 2001.


On 19 July 2001, Accenture’s initial public offering (IPO) was priced at $14.50 per share, and the shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE); Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley served as its lead underwriters. Accenture stock closed the day at $15.17, with the day's high at $15.25. On the first day of the IPO, Accenture raised nearly $1.7 billion.[19]
Bermuda headquarters[edit]
In October 2002, the Congressional General Accounting Office (GAO) identified Accenture as one of four publicly traded federal contractors that were incorporated in a tax haven country.[20] The other three, unlike Accenture, were incorporated in the United States before they re-incorporated in a tax haven country, thereby lowering their US taxes. Critics, most notably former CNN journalist Lou Dobbs,[21] have reported Accenture's decision to incorporate in Bermuda as a US tax avoidance ploy, because they viewed Accenture as having been a US-based company.[22] The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a US-based company; it stated that "prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity."
Accenture engaged in a very large and ambitious IT overhaul project for the National Health Service (NHS) in 2003, making headlines when it withdrew from the contract in 2006 over disputes related to delays and cost overruns.[23] The government of the United Kingdom ultimately abandoned the project 5 years later for the same reasons.[24]
Ireland headquarters[edit]
Accenture announced on 26 May 2009 that its Board of Directors unanimously approved changing the company’s place of incorporation to Ireland from Bermuda and would become Accenture plc.[25]
Accenture was chosen to replace CGI Group as the lead contractor for HealthCare.gov in January 2014.[26] In December 2014, Accenture won a $563 million contract to provide ongoing maintenance, software development and technology support for HealthCare.gov through 2019.[27]
In July 2015 the United States Department of Defense awarded a major Electronic Health Records contract to Cerner, Leidos and Accenture. The contract valued $4.33 billion will serve 55 hospitals and 600 clinics. Accenture federal services and Leidos will play the role of configuration specialist while Cerner is the prime contractor.[28]
Services and operations[edit]




A worldmap showing the countries where Accenture has operations as of 2016



Accenture Strategy provides business strategy, technology strategy and operations strategy services.[29]
Accenture Consulting provides technology, business and management consulting.[30]

The company also operates a "National Security Services" business.[34]
Marketing, branding and identity[edit]
In 2011, Accenture launched a new campaign of results-based ads featuring clients such as Marriott, Unilever and the Royal Shakespeare Company alongside its slogan “High performance. Delivered”.[35] As of 2016, Interbrand ranked Accenture No. 37 of its list of best global brands.[36] The brand consultancy noted Accenture's focus on branding and marketing of its Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, Accenture Digital, Accenture Technology and Accenture Operations divisions.[37]
From at least 2005[38] until December 2009, Accenture used Tiger Woods as a celebrity spokesperson and advertised using the service mark "Go on, be a Tiger" and the ancillary statement "We know what it takes to be a Tiger" in association with his image. On 13 December 2009 after details of Woods' extra-marital affairs were exposed, the company terminated Woods' six-year sponsorship deal.[39]
The company uses a standardised system of branding, with extensive use of the font Graphik.[40]
From 1999, the firm's culture was parodied by the webcomic Bigtime Consulting, operated pseudonymously by its San Francisco-based employee James Sanchez.[41][42] The comic operated a store offering merchandise branded with the names 'Bigtime Consulting' and 'Indenture'. Sanchez left the company in 2000 but continued to operate the comic for some years.[43][44][45]

Fortune named Accenture one of the top 100 companies to work for from 2009 to 2017.[51]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
