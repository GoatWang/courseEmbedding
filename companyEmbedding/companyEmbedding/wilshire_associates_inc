History[edit]
Wilshire was founded in 1972 by Dennis Tito, who was an early pioneer of applying computer-based technologies to investment applications. Since the early 1970s, the firm developed from a technology firm into an investment management operation. In 1974, the firm created its signature Wilshire 5000 Stock index, which is a widely used index of all stocks actively traded in the United States.
Wilshire established an early reputation by creating the first asset/liability model for pension funds in the 1970s, ten years before actuarial and accounting firms began to adopt this technology. Wilshire was also among the first to produce investment management tools to create index funds, optimize portfolios, construct bond portfolios and measure performance.
In 1981, Wilshire launched its investment consulting business to address the needs of the plan sponsor community providing support for the pensions' investment professionals. Also in the early 1980s, Wilshire began to develop its own investment products. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Wilshire began to expand its investment activities into private market investments creating a series of private equity and venture capital product offerings.
In 2003, Wilshire was targeted by New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in connection to its trading practices as part of a wide ranging 2003 investigation of mutual funds.[3][4]

History[edit]
Wilshire was founded in 1972 by Dennis Tito, who was an early pioneer of applying computer-based technologies to investment applications. Since the early 1970s, the firm developed from a technology firm into an investment management operation. In 1974, the firm created its signature Wilshire 5000 Stock index, which is a widely used index of all stocks actively traded in the United States.
Wilshire established an early reputation by creating the first asset/liability model for pension funds in the 1970s, ten years before actuarial and accounting firms began to adopt this technology. Wilshire was also among the first to produce investment management tools to create index funds, optimize portfolios, construct bond portfolios and measure performance.
In 1981, Wilshire launched its investment consulting business to address the needs of the plan sponsor community providing support for the pensions' investment professionals. Also in the early 1980s, Wilshire began to develop its own investment products. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Wilshire began to expand its investment activities into private market investments creating a series of private equity and venture capital product offerings.
In 2003, Wilshire was targeted by New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in connection to its trading practices as part of a wide ranging 2003 investigation of mutual funds.[3][4]

Investment Consulting



	Established in 1981, Wilshire Consulting provides customized consulting and investment solutions, including outsourced-CIO (OCIO) services. Through its investment consulting services to public and corporate clients, Wilshire Consulting assists in ensuring secure and safe retirements for approximately 49 million Americans including those participating in some of the nation’s largest public and corporate retirement plans.  Combined with our endowment, foundation and major insurance company clients, we consult on combined total assets of nearly $1 trillion.  Wilshire consultants provide strategic advice on asset allocation, risk management, investment policy development, asset class structuring, investment manager evaluation and monitoring. 

Mission statement

Wilshire Consulting serves institutional clients with custom solutions including advisory consulting, discretionary management, and investment technology resources. Our clients’ satisfaction defines our position as a premier, employee-owned investment consulting firm.

Client profile

	Wilshire Consulting’s client base includes more than 115 corporate and public defined contribution and defined benefit pension funds, foundations, endowments, healthcare, and insurance companies.


	We also provide discretionary consulting services, tailored to each client’s unique objectives and risk tolerances.

Competitive advantages

	We distinguish our investment consulting services from those of our competitors based on the experience of our consultants, our proprietary investment technology, culture of risk management and our investment research. In addition, we are also characterized by our unique service delivery model.

Consultant experience

	Wilshire's consultants have diverse backgrounds with experience in the investment management, plan sponsor, and custody businesses. Our senior consultants provide client service through a dedicated team structure, with specialized support provided by departments within Wilshire Consulting. Wilshire’s senior consulting staff averages over 13 years at Wilshire and 21 years with the industry. Moreover, 87% have post-graduate degrees and 73% hold the Chartered Financial Analyst designation.

Proprietary investment technology

	Wilshire has been building commercial investment analytics for 40 years and earned a leadership position in the industry by consistently delivering innovative investment research and services to the institutional market. Our clients trust Wilshire to transform complex theory into practical applications.

Culture of risk management

	Wilshire Consulting’s expertise in building risk models helps us understand the benefits and limitations inherent in many common approaches fund sponsors use to make investment decisions. We are able to manage the transition from theory to practice, with the goal of helping clients manage, rather than eliminate, risk. Wilshire advises clients on the best ways to implement a culture of risk accountability.

Investment research capabilities

	Investing requires the union of both art and science. Accordingly, Wilshire relies on a combination of independent research, performed by a dedicated research team, along with client-driven advocacy through consultant involvement in the research process. We’re known for the depth and breadth of our research topics as well as our thoughtful recommendations.

Service delivery model

	We believe that each client is unique, with an individual set of investment challenges. To meet those challenges, Wilshire combines two prominent service models in investment consulting today - centralized resources and dedicated client service. This gives each client the personalized attention available through a smaller firm, as well as the resources of a large firm.

About Us


Our Mission

Wilshire Associates' mission is to provide innovative investment solutions and objective, independent investment advice to investors throughout the world.

Wilshire fulfills its mission by:

Promoting a culture of integrity
Aligning client objectives with individual & firm growth
Balancing tradeoffs between investment return & risk
Rewarding both teamwork and individual initiative

History

Since its founding in 1972, Wilshire Associates has evolved from an investment technology firm into a global advisory company specializing in investment products, consulting services, and technology solutions. We have worked throughout our history to maintain a strong commitment to our clients and to retain a position of leadership in providing innovative ideas to the investment industry.

Wilshire was an early innovator of the integrated asset/liability modeling technique, as well as risk management and portfolio optimization models. These models help plan sponsors and institutional investors arrive at optimal portfolios based on their specific needs. We also produce investment management tools designed to create index funds, optimize portfolios, develop dedicated and immunized bond portfolios, and measure performance. The Wilshire 5000 Total Market IndexSM, and the Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service® (Wilshire TUCS®) — two very familiar products in today's investment community — were developed in our first decade.
In 1981, Wilshire Consulting was established to provide the fund sponsor community with customized consulting solutions designed to enhance every stage of the investment decision-making process. For over 35 years, Wilshire Consulting has served many of the world’s largest asset owners and taken great pride for its innovations in the areas of performance fees and style mapping in equity management. These capabilities, combined with an established infrastructure and industry-leading technology, have helped Wilshire Consulting effectively deliver full discretionary advisory services or Outsourced Chief Investment Officer (OCIO) Solutions to institutional investors seeking economies of scale for the ultimate benefit of their constituents. As of 12/31/16, Wilshire Consulting has $1 trillion in assets under advisement and $7.5 billion in discretionary assets under management.
In the mid-1990s, Wilshire launched its first Private Equity fund of funds, meeting institutional investors' growing appetite for alternative investments. As of 12/31/16, Wilshire Private Markets has over $4 billion in committed capital and serves more than 100 investors around the world with private equity solutions.
In 2005, Wilshire began leveraging its strong institutional brand by developing investment solutions for the retail market. Wilshire Funds Management (WFM) works with financial intermediaries to create customized investment solutions for a wide variety of retail distribution channels. As of 12/31/2016, WFM advises on more than $157 billion in assets, serving approximately 50 leading financial intermediaries.
