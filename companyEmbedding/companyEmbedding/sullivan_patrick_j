                           "The Environmental Science of Drinking Water illustrates the need for fundamental changes in our approach towards protecting
                              drinking water, and proves the extent to which our water resources are polluted. The authors present factual and circumstantial
                              evidence to explain how current drinking water standards fail to adequately protect human health, and outline the available
                              technologies which, if properly employed, can move us towards a healthier future." "This book provides a basis for understanding
                              the threat posed by man-made chemicals in water sources and the available solutions for minimizing the potential health risks
                              associated with the abuse of our natural assets."--Jacket

                           Any professional examination of existing or potential new toxins in a population must account for those already present from
                              past problems and natural conditions.Toxic Legacy provides extensive information on the occurrence of chemical hazards and
                              their potential dangers in combinations in the food, water and air in cities around the United States. The book illustrates
                              consumer preferences for specific food and water products, as well as particular diets and discusses the toxicity and risks
                              associated with our exposure to synthetic chemicals. The authors offer unique guidance to environmental engineers, scientists,
                              process engineers, and planners and specify what steps can be taken to limit exposure to complex chemical mixtures

                              Edition has been fully reworked and reorganized into three separate, succinct volumes to adapt to a more complex and scientifically

                              offers new process and plant design examples and added coverage of such subjects as urban and rural systems. Stressing the

Item Description: ELSEVIER SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY, United Kingdom, 2005. Hardback. Book Condition: New. New.. Language: English . Brand New Book. In today s chemically dependent society, environmental studies demonstrate that drinking water in developed countries contains numerous industrial chemicals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and chemicals from water treatment processes. This poses a real threat. As a result of the ever-expanding list of chemical and biochemical products industry, current drinking water standards that serve to preserve our drinking water quality are grossly out of date. Environmental Science of Drinking Water demonstrates why we need to make a fundamental change in our approach toward protecting our drinking water. Factual and circumstantial evidence showing the failure of current drinking water standards to adequately protect human health is presented along with analysis of the extent of pollution in our water resources and drinking water. The authors also present detail of the currently available state-of-the-art technologies which, if fully employed, can move us toward a healthier future.  Bookseller Inventory # AA59780750678766
