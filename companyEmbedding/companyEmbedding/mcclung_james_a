McClung-Logan Equipment Co. has appointed Austin Frederick vice president of product support. Frederick joined McClung-Logan in 2003 as a service technician in the Baltimore location. He has since risen to positions of increasing responsibility including branch service manager, and most recently, vice president of parts, where he oversaw parts department personnel and operations across the company’s eight Mid-Atlantic locations.  In his new role, Frederick will have direct responsibility for the McClung-Logan Parts and Service departments while serving as the key point of contact for the company’s after-market manufacturers. Frederick will report to company president Darrin Brown. “Austin has made significant contributions to McClung-Logan over the past 14 years,” said Brown. “The leadership that he has demonstrated in parts and service management positions make him a perfect fit for this new role. Austin will help us to streamline efficiencies and increase communication across the company so we can better support our customers.” Frederick will be based at McClung-Logan’s Baltimore headquarters. McClung-Logan is a privately owned construction equipment distributor with eight full-service locations in Maryland, Delaware and Virginia, providing equipment sales, rentals, parts and service support for new and used equipment. McClung-Logan has been in business since 1939 and represents Volvo Construction Equipment, Terramac, Bandit Industries, Komptech, Gradall and Doosan Portable Power.

Jim H. McClung Biography







Jim McClung, Chairman and CEO of the Lithonia Lighting Group, retired on December 31, 2000, after 36 years with Lithonia Lighting. He joined Lithonia in 1964 after receiving his MBA from Harvard Business School and service in the Air Force as Communication Electronics Officer. Mr. McClung also holds a degree in Physics from Emory University. Mr. McClung worked in several capacities within the company holding such titles as Controller, Vice President of Sales, Vice President of Manufacturing before becoming President and CEO in 1976.
During his 36 year tenure, 24 years as President, Lithonia Lighting grew to become the largest lighting fixture manufacturer in the world with annual sales of $1.5 billion. In 1964, the annual sales were $22 million. The dramatic growth was driven primarily by Lithonia brand products, but key acquisitions contributed including Holophane, Peerless, Hydrel, York (Canada), Reloc and Gotham.
In addition to his leadership of the Lithonia organization, McClung also served as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. He served as Senior Manufacturers Advisor to the National Association of Electrical Distributors and was also a member of the Board of Governors and Executive Committee of the Industry Data Exchange Association. He was a member of the World Presidents Organization, the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America and the Electrical Manufacturer Club, as well as, a member of National Service Industries, Inc. Board.

At the time of his retirement, McClung said in a letter to the 9,000 Lithonia Lighting Employees "We built not only the largest, but I believe the best lighting fixture manufacturing company in the world. It has been an honor to be part of this achievement."

Jo, I just heard of Jim's passing and wanted to express my sympathy. I have so many good memories of times with you two at your house and mine. I will never forget the good advice you gave and your kindness. From you, I realized that denominations aren't what is important. You are in my thoughts and will always be in my prayers.
Love, Becky  (It was so good to see you again, just sad that it was at Orpha's funeral)

From your friends at Gateway Motors in Clarksburg...what a treasure we have all lost.  I feel so incredibly fortunate to have known Jim.  He was always willing to share, whether it was a smile, a story, a memory, or a pot scraper! (by the way-love those pot scrapers!).  We loved Jim and will miss him, and will never forget this extraordinary person.
Love, Heidi

Jim H. McClung Lighting Research Foundation








Jim McClung's career has been marked by nobility - nobility of character, nobility of action and nobility of purpose. His 36 years of leadership at Lithonia Lighting are testimony to what a person with noble vision can bring to a company and an industry.
To honor his contributions and create a permanent legacy, the Jim H. McClung Lighting Research Foundation was established by Acuity Brands, his company associates, his industry colleagues and friends. It is the first foundation of its kind to provide grants to teachers, scientists and visionaries of the lighting industry . . . those who will improve the human condition through lighting research in the new millennium.
The Foundation Provides a forum for sharing knowledge, increasing the appeal of lighting careers, and creating alliances among commercial and academic institutions.
