Ratners jewellery chain has admitted for the first time that its business was decisively wounded when former chairman Gerald Ratner described one of its products as “total crap”.
Mr Ratner’s ill-judged comments accelerated a spiral of decline for Britain’s biggest jewellery group which plunged £122.3m into the red in the year to February and is to close 330 shops in Britain and the US.
The company, which now intends to move more upmarket, said the crash from profits a year earlier of £112.1 million was largely caused by the impact of recession, but a particularly poor performance from its 250-strong Ratners chain resulted from “adverse publicity” following Gerald Ratner’s infamous description of a decanter set sold by the group as “total crap”.
Some time after those remarks, which he claimed were taken out of context, he resigned as chairman, though he remains chief executive. The slur contributing to a dire sales performance over Christmas last year when the group’s sales slumped by 15 per cent at a time when jewellers traditionally expect to generate about 40 per cent of total revenues. A similar performance this Christmas could cast doubt on the group’s survival.
James McAdam, who took over as executive chairman at the start of this year, said Mr Ratner’s future with the company was not in doubt.
Many shoppers who objected to the comment would have avoided Ratners shops only to go into one of the group’s other stores.
The revamp of Ratners’ business over the next three years, following a refinancing package from its bankers, will mean the closure of 180 of the group’s 880 shops in Britain.
Another 150 stores are to close in America with the probable loss of more than 1,000 jobs. The reorganisation will cost the group almost £100 million. Shares in Ratners fell 1/2 p to 11 1/2 p, valuing the group at just 33.7 million pounds in contrast to its 1990 peak of £840 million when Mr Ratner’s pile-it-high, sell-it-cheap approach to jewellery retailing seemed unconquerable.
Mr McAdam was yesterday critical of this strategy which he said was inappropriate in difficult economic circumstances. He plans to drive the chain up-market, placing more emphasis on customer service, and making greater distinctions between the different outlets.

Another Ratner, Another Brooklyn

Austin Ratner, at home in Brooklyn Heights, identifies with the literary side of the borough. Mr. Ratner, an author whose new novel, “In the Land of the Living,” was released in March, was raised in Cleveland, a son of a cousin of Bruce Ratner, who masterminded the Barclays Center and brought the Nets to Brooklyn.

The last name “Ratner” usually conjures up one of two images among New Yorkers. There’s Ratner’s, the bygone Jewish dairy, and then there’s Bruce Ratner, the developer of the Atlantic Yards in Downtown Brooklyn, on whom opinion is notably more mixed. One thing that doesn’t often come up, however, is literature.But Austin Ratner, 41, the most artsy member of the real estate clan, is trying to change that. “I know very little about the family business,” he said over breakfast at Maialino the other day. “Everything I do is in genuine pursuit of truth and beauty.”Mr. Ratner recently gave a reading for his latest novel, “In the Land of the Living,” at Book Court, a bookstore in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, that drew a respectable crowd for a mid-list author reading from his sophomore effort. There were lots of Ratners (though no Bruce), some family friends and a few disaffected youth cadging free Champagne.Mr. Ratner, who combines the boyish handsomeness of Clark Kent with the nebbishness of Woody Allen, stood at the rostrum. His glasses were thick; his hair neatly combed. His book, heavily annotated, lay open in front of him.

He is both a Ratner and not a Ratner. Eleven days shy of his third birthday, his biological father, a Cleveland hematologist named Norman Gordon, died of lymphoma at age 29. A few years later, his mother married James Ratner, Bruce Ratner’s cousin and a Cleveland real estate mogul, and the boy was adopted. Continue reading the main story

Much of the autobiographical novel chronicles the pervading sense of loss. “It’s very much drawn from my own personal experiences,” he said. Like Leo Auberon, the book’s protagonist, Mr. Ratner has spent his life trying both to live up to his father’s memory and almost, but not quite, realizing how quixotic the quest was. Like Leo, he grew up in the affluent Cleveland neighborhood of Shaker Heights, buried in books and shrouded in the sense of perpetual mourning familiar to any Cleveland sports fan. “Losing is the only narrative we have,” he said.And also like his character, Mr. Ratner was fixated on attending Yale, where his biological father had gone, but refused to use his father’s name on the application. “It was all about merit,” he said, chortling bitterly, “as if Yale was a meritocracy.” Mr. Ratner was rejected, then strangely accepted, and, after attending for a year, was overcome by feelings of inferiority, and eventually transferred to the University of Michigan. It’s all chronicled in the book, under the chapter “Yalensis.”He graduated from college in 1994 and, at the age of 26, earned a medical degree from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

But in 1998, at about the same age that his father’s path had ended prematurely, Mr. Ratner tried to find his own. “I was left looking into a grave and I thought, ‘I’m not going there,’ ” he said.He quit medicine and moved to New York City to become a fiction writer. He moved into an apartment on the Upper West Side, wrote health care copy for a dot-com by day, and struggled to complete manuscripts by night. He completed a first novel, for which he couldn’t find a publisher, and a medical school textbook, “Concepts in Medical Physiology,” which sold rather well. But it wasn’t the sort of writing he had in mind.By this time, Mr. Ratner had a family of his own. In 2002, he had married Kristin Kubiak, whom he had met at a wedding (Page 299: “the attractive one”), and the couple had a son, Virgil, born in 2004.Though unburdened by financial exigencies, he was saddled with the existential dread familiar to every struggling writer. “I hit the absolute bottom of the ocean,” he said. “I was very depressed.” He worked on a second novel, applied to graduate school for creative writing and won a fellowship at the prestigious Iowa Writers’ Workshop.Eventually his novel, “The Jump Artist,” a fictionalized account of the life of the photographer Philippe Halsman, sold and won the Sami Rohr Prize for Jewish Literature. The prize was accompanied by a $100,000 purse and breathless press coverage. Harper’s called the book “a remarkable work.” GQ called it “elegantly written.” Soon, Mr. Ratner dropped out of the workshop and moved to Brooklyn.Brooklyn, broadly speaking, is a borough where the brightest literary stars live in nice brownstones and write about dead parents (see Foer, Jonathan Safran; Lethem, Jonathan; Auster, Paul). So it’s not entirely surprising that Mr. Ratner also lives in Brooklyn, in a $3 million Brooklyn Heights brownstone he bought in 2011, or that he writes about not having a father. That Mr. Ratner’s manse is a product not of books but of bloodline is a bit of a touchy subject. “Of course, the Ratner family is the benefactor of my work,” he said. “But Melville came from a wealthy family, too. Some people consider him a pretty good writer.”

After the reading, Mr. Ratner and his followers left the bookstore to head to the after-party at a nearby restaurant in Carroll Gardens. They turned their backs on the Atlantic Yards and walked toward what was, presumably, truth and beauty. Or at least, a glass of wine.

Moreover, these laws may be used to bring claims against entities that are heavily regulated by the U.S. government, especially pharmaceutical companies. From his New York office, whistleblower attorney James T. Ratner can guide plaintiffs nationwide through the process of bringing qui tam claims based on pharmaceutical fraud. Any type of misconduct that forces the government to incur financial losses may be an appropriate basis for legal action.Drug Companies and the Federal GovernmentPharmaceutical drug companies interact with the federal government primarily in the development and regulation of new and existing drugs. Any drug that a company seeks to put on the open market must first be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This process can be lengthy and often limits companies to very particular uses for certain medications. As a result, it is prone to fraud and corruption by companies seeking to circumvent these strict requirements.Some pharmaceutical companies also provide medications directly to the government in a more typical form of contractor relationship. In particular, Medicare and Medicaid offer specific drugs to patients through their prescription programs. They set the availability and pricing for prescriptions on a federal level. When pharmaceutical companies seek to have their medications included and priced competitively on Medicare’s or Medicaid’s drug lists, fraudulent misrepresentations about the expense of such drugs may occur.Combating Fraud and Financial Misconduct in the Pharmaceutical SectorBecause of the unique industry in which they work, pharmaceutical companies are susceptible to particular types of fraud that can be exposed by whistleblowers. One of the most common problems, and the subject of several high-profile whistleblower lawsuits, is the off-market labeling of drugs by pharmaceutical companies.When the FDA approves a drug, it may do so for a very limited purpose – known as the “on-label” use. Pharmaceutical companies are subsequently limited to that particular purpose or medical condition when advertising their drugs. Physicians, by contrast, are able to prescribe such medications for “off-use” purposes, including other conditions or diseases for which they believe the drug may be helpful. In several significant cases, including a 2012 settlement with GlaxoSmithKline for three billion dollars, pharmaceutical companies have been found to be marketing their medications for these off-label purposes, despite being prohibited from doing so. This off-label marketing is a form of fraud punishable under the False Claims Act.Off-label marketing often occurs hand-in-hand with another type of fraud perpetrated by pharmaceutical companies: kickbacks. These are payments made to doctors or hospitals in order to encourage medical providers to prescribe the pharmaceutical company’s drugs to their patients. Instead of directly providing cash to these parties, pharmaceutical companies may offer lavish dinners, trips, nonmonetary gifts, and payments for “advisory” or “consulting” services. Providing these types of incentives is illegal and can be pursued under both the Anti-Kickback Statutes and the False Claims Act.Finally, pharmaceutical companies may also engage in the more common practice of attempting to deceive the government as to the price and value of the product it is receiving. This is known as best price fraud. In order to contract with Medicare and Medicaid, pharmaceutical companies are required to provide their drugs at the best price available. Thus, they are not allowed to have contracts with other private third parties for rates lower than what the government is being charged. However, in practice, pharmaceutical companies may hide or disguise discounts being offered to others in order to keep Medicare or Medicaid prices higher than they should be, thereby causing the government to pay more than it should.Consult a Knowledgeable Qui Tam Attorney in New YorkThe fraudulent practices of large pharmaceutical companies are frequently to blame for rising drug costs and the increasing financial burden of health care. One effective means for addressing these problems is through the work of whistleblowers, who seek to expose and eliminate the corruption within the industry. If you currently work in the pharmaceutical or health care field and wish to report misconduct, New York lawyer James T. Ratner can advise you on the possibility of bringing a qui tam claim. With 18 years of experience, he can advise whistleblowers throughout the U.S. Call us at (845) 688-5222 or contact us online for a free consultation.

Ratner is a New York lawyer who has represented whistleblowers nationwide in a wide gamut of qui tam cases, such as health care fraud, pharmaceutical fraud, government contractor fraud. With rare exception, a predicate for a meritorious qui tam case, is substantial financial loss to the government.Since the government is frequently unaware of fraud against it, the FCA empowers private citizens to so alert it, through the filing of qui tam lawsuits, and receive a percentage of what the government recovers. When a qui tam complaint is initiated, it is filed under seal to allow an opportunity for the government to investigate. If the government believes that fraud has occurred, it may then intervene in the case to pursue the lawsuit. If the government chooses not to intervene, the qui tam relator may still be permitted to continue with the lawsuit on his or her own. A successful relator is entitled to an award of anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of the amount recovered by the government. Common Types of Qui Tam CasesQui tam cases may be brought in any situation in which corruption or fraud occurs, and the government suffers financial losses. Government contractor fraud is increasingly widespread due to the dramatic increase in the provision of government contracting services. Thanks to recent changes in the FCA, both contractors and subcontractors may now be held liable for corruption and fraud, including practices of false or inflated billing, fraud in the contract procurement process, and efforts by GSA contractors to avoid providing their true best pricing terms to the government on GSA contracts.Another common type of qui tam case involves health care fraud, which typically occurs among companies that bill the government through Medicare and Medicaid. These health care providers may inaccurately represent the services that have been provided, or even create false patients, in order to obtain more money from Medicare or Medicaid than would otherwise be allowed.Whistleblowers often also identify pharmaceutical fraud, wherein drug companies try to avoid paying the government money that it should be entitled to receive. Illegal actions include promoting off-label uses of drugs not previously approved by the FDA, or seeking too much money from the government by inflating drug prices.Explore Your Options with a Whistleblower Lawyer in New YorkIf you are aware of fraud or corruption occurring in your company or industry, you may have questions about what you can do to stop the misconduct and how helping the government may benefit you. New York attorney James T. Ratner can bring qui tam claims based on pharmaceutical fraud, health care fraud, government contractor fraud, and any other type of misconduct.
