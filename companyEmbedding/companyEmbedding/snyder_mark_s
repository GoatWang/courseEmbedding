   Mark 

              Snyder has been in radio for over thirty years-starting as a nine 

              year old hosting a local kid's show. After college, he followed 

              that early success with the highly-acclaimed Singles Lifeline Show, 

              which ran on eight radio stations and resulted in over 200 marriages.

Playing career[edit]
The South Point, Ohio, native is a 1988 graduate of Marshall. Snyder played in 1987 for the football squad, leading the Southern Conference with 10 interceptions and was second on the team with 124 tackles his senior year at Marshall and helped lead the Herd to a landmark come from behind win at Louisville and a berth in Marshall's first-ever national championship game. He captured honorable mention All-America honors and first-team All-Southern Conference honors that season as the Thundering Herd posted a 10-5 overall record and finished as national runners-up to Northeast Louisiana (43-42) in the 1987 Division 1-AA National Championship game. Snyder's 10 interceptions in 1987 still stands as the Marshall and Southern Conference single-season record.
Coaching career[edit]
Early coaching[edit]
After graduating from Marshall, the following fall he began his coaching career as a student assistant coach for the Herd. He moved on to the UCF Knights the following year and spent two seasons there, the first as a graduate assistant and the second coaching linebackers.
In 1991, Snyder joined Jim Tressel at Youngstown State University as the outside linebacker coach. Snyder was given special teams and inside linebacker responsibilities in 1994, and then promoted to defensive coordinator and secondary coach in 1996. During his tenure at Youngstown State, the Penguins won three NCAA Division 1-AA national championships and played in four consecutive national championship games, facing Marshall in three of those contests (1991, 1992, and 1993).
Following the 1996 season, Snyder went on to spend four years as the defensive ends coach under Glen Mason at Minnesota. While coaching the Golden Gophers, Minnesota's defense twice set school records for single-season sacks and averaged 40.7 sacks during a three-year span. While at Minnesota, Snyder's best players were Lamanzer Williams, who led the nation in sacks in 1997, and Karon Riley, the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year in 2000.
Ohio State Buckeyes[edit]
Snyder again reunited with Jim Tressel at Ohio State University and was coming off of his first season as the Buckeyes' defensive coordinator. In Snyder's four years at Ohio State, the Buckeyes posted a 40-11 overall record and tallied a 3-1 record in bowl games, including victories in the 2003 and 2004 Tostitos Fiesta Bowls. Snyder helped develop a number of outstanding players at Ohio State, including All-Americans Matt Wilhelm, Cie Grant, and A. J. Hawk. Both Wilhelm and Grant played key roles in Ohio State's 2002 national championship before going on to become NFL draft picks. Hawk led OSU with 141 tackles en route to becoming the No. 5 overall pick by the Green Bay Packers in the 2006 NFL Draft.
Return to Marshall[edit]
Marshall University's football program welcomed home one of its own when Mark Snyder was introduced as Marshall's 28th head football coach on April 14, 2005. "I am pleased that Mark decided to return to his alma mater and lead our football program into a new era," Marshall Director of Athletics Bob Marcum said at Snyder's hiring. "He brings a great deal of experience, enthusiasm, and a proven record of success at the highest levels of college football to Marshall."
Snyder was the head coach at Marshall for five seasons (2005-09) and helped lead the Thundering Herd transition from the Mid-American Conference to Conference USA. In Snyder's final year in 2009, Marshall went 6-6 during the regular-season and earned a berth in the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl. His program produced 40 all-conference selections, including 2006 Conference USA Defensive Player of the Year Albert McClellan, who had 18.5 tackles for loss and 11.5 sacks his sophomore season. Snyder produced a 22-37 overall record at Marshall (17-23 Conference USA).
Under Snyder, running back Ahmad Bradshaw was a two-time All-C-USA pick and ran for 19 touchdowns and 1,523 yards as a junior in 2006 to earn first-team all-league honors. Bradshaw was selected in the seventh round of the 2007 NFL Draft (No. 250 overall) by the New York Giants and won two Super Bowls with the Giants (XLII, XLVI); he is one of just eight running backs in NFL history to be the leading rusher in two Super Bowls.
McClellan, who had to sit out the 2007 season due to a knee injury, returned in 2008 to earn first-team All-C-USA honors for the second time in his career. He signed with the Baltimore Ravens as a rookie free agent in 2009 and is currently playing his fourth season in the NFL, all in Baltimore.
South Florida[edit]
On January 18, 2010, Snyder was named the defensive coordinator at South Florida.[1] Snyder spent two seasons (2010-11) as the defensive coordinator/linebackers coach at South Florida. Both of his defenses in Tampa ranked in the FBS Top 25 in rushing defense (22nd in 2010 at 125.6 ypg. and 15th in 2011 at 107.3 ypg.). During USF's 2010 season that ended with an 8-5 record and a win over Clemson in the Meineke Car Care Bowl, the Bulls ranked 17th in total defense (317.9 ypg.) and 22nd in scoring defense (20.0 ppg.). Snyder helped mentor first-team All-BIG EAST defensive tackle Terrell McClain, who was selected in the third round of the 2011 NFL Draft (No. 65 overall) by the Carolina Panthers. The Bulls were also one of the top defensive teams during the 2011 season in tackles for loss (No. 2 in FBS with 99; 8.25 pg.) and sacks (No. 4 with 39; 3.25 pg.).
Texas A&M[edit]
On January 10, 2012, Snyder was hired by first-year head coach Kevin Sumlin as the defensive coordinator at Texas A&M.[2] During Snyder's stint as defensive coordinator at Texas A&M, two of his defensive linemen earned All-SEC honors, including consensus first-team All-American Damontre Moore in 2012. A third-round NFL Draft pick by the New York Giants (No. 81 overall) in 2013, Moore led the Aggies his junior season with 85 tackles, including 21 for losses and 12.5 sacks, to land on the All-SEC First Team. In 2014, true freshman Myles Garrett set a Texas A&M and SEC-freshman record with 11.5 sacks and was named a consensus first-team Freshman All-American as well as second-team All-SEC. During Texas A&M's 11-2 campaign in 2012 that ended with a win in the Cotton Bowl Classic over Oklahoma, Snyder's defense ranked 26th in the NCAA FBS in scoring defense, allowing 21.8 points per game.
Michigan State[edit]
On January 9, 2015, Snyder was hired by Mark Dantonio as the linebackers coach and special teams coordinator at Michigan State[3]

Playing career[edit]
The South Point, Ohio, native is a 1988 graduate of Marshall. Snyder played in 1987 for the football squad, leading the Southern Conference with 10 interceptions and was second on the team with 124 tackles his senior year at Marshall and helped lead the Herd to a landmark come from behind win at Louisville and a berth in Marshall's first-ever national championship game. He captured honorable mention All-America honors and first-team All-Southern Conference honors that season as the Thundering Herd posted a 10-5 overall record and finished as national runners-up to Northeast Louisiana (43-42) in the 1987 Division 1-AA National Championship game. Snyder's 10 interceptions in 1987 still stands as the Marshall and Southern Conference single-season record.
Coaching career[edit]
Early coaching[edit]
After graduating from Marshall, the following fall he began his coaching career as a student assistant coach for the Herd. He moved on to the UCF Knights the following year and spent two seasons there, the first as a graduate assistant and the second coaching linebackers.
In 1991, Snyder joined Jim Tressel at Youngstown State University as the outside linebacker coach. Snyder was given special teams and inside linebacker responsibilities in 1994, and then promoted to defensive coordinator and secondary coach in 1996. During his tenure at Youngstown State, the Penguins won three NCAA Division 1-AA national championships and played in four consecutive national championship games, facing Marshall in three of those contests (1991, 1992, and 1993).
Following the 1996 season, Snyder went on to spend four years as the defensive ends coach under Glen Mason at Minnesota. While coaching the Golden Gophers, Minnesota's defense twice set school records for single-season sacks and averaged 40.7 sacks during a three-year span. While at Minnesota, Snyder's best players were Lamanzer Williams, who led the nation in sacks in 1997, and Karon Riley, the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year in 2000.
Ohio State Buckeyes[edit]
Snyder again reunited with Jim Tressel at Ohio State University and was coming off of his first season as the Buckeyes' defensive coordinator. In Snyder's four years at Ohio State, the Buckeyes posted a 40-11 overall record and tallied a 3-1 record in bowl games, including victories in the 2003 and 2004 Tostitos Fiesta Bowls. Snyder helped develop a number of outstanding players at Ohio State, including All-Americans Matt Wilhelm, Cie Grant, and A. J. Hawk. Both Wilhelm and Grant played key roles in Ohio State's 2002 national championship before going on to become NFL draft picks. Hawk led OSU with 141 tackles en route to becoming the No. 5 overall pick by the Green Bay Packers in the 2006 NFL Draft.
Return to Marshall[edit]
Marshall University's football program welcomed home one of its own when Mark Snyder was introduced as Marshall's 28th head football coach on April 14, 2005. "I am pleased that Mark decided to return to his alma mater and lead our football program into a new era," Marshall Director of Athletics Bob Marcum said at Snyder's hiring. "He brings a great deal of experience, enthusiasm, and a proven record of success at the highest levels of college football to Marshall."
Snyder was the head coach at Marshall for five seasons (2005-09) and helped lead the Thundering Herd transition from the Mid-American Conference to Conference USA. In Snyder's final year in 2009, Marshall went 6-6 during the regular-season and earned a berth in the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl. His program produced 40 all-conference selections, including 2006 Conference USA Defensive Player of the Year Albert McClellan, who had 18.5 tackles for loss and 11.5 sacks his sophomore season. Snyder produced a 22-37 overall record at Marshall (17-23 Conference USA).
Under Snyder, running back Ahmad Bradshaw was a two-time All-C-USA pick and ran for 19 touchdowns and 1,523 yards as a junior in 2006 to earn first-team all-league honors. Bradshaw was selected in the seventh round of the 2007 NFL Draft (No. 250 overall) by the New York Giants and won two Super Bowls with the Giants (XLII, XLVI); he is one of just eight running backs in NFL history to be the leading rusher in two Super Bowls.
McClellan, who had to sit out the 2007 season due to a knee injury, returned in 2008 to earn first-team All-C-USA honors for the second time in his career. He signed with the Baltimore Ravens as a rookie free agent in 2009 and is currently playing his fourth season in the NFL, all in Baltimore.
South Florida[edit]
On January 18, 2010, Snyder was named the defensive coordinator at South Florida.[1] Snyder spent two seasons (2010-11) as the defensive coordinator/linebackers coach at South Florida. Both of his defenses in Tampa ranked in the FBS Top 25 in rushing defense (22nd in 2010 at 125.6 ypg. and 15th in 2011 at 107.3 ypg.). During USF's 2010 season that ended with an 8-5 record and a win over Clemson in the Meineke Car Care Bowl, the Bulls ranked 17th in total defense (317.9 ypg.) and 22nd in scoring defense (20.0 ppg.). Snyder helped mentor first-team All-BIG EAST defensive tackle Terrell McClain, who was selected in the third round of the 2011 NFL Draft (No. 65 overall) by the Carolina Panthers. The Bulls were also one of the top defensive teams during the 2011 season in tackles for loss (No. 2 in FBS with 99; 8.25 pg.) and sacks (No. 4 with 39; 3.25 pg.).
Texas A&M[edit]
On January 10, 2012, Snyder was hired by first-year head coach Kevin Sumlin as the defensive coordinator at Texas A&M.[2] During Snyder's stint as defensive coordinator at Texas A&M, two of his defensive linemen earned All-SEC honors, including consensus first-team All-American Damontre Moore in 2012. A third-round NFL Draft pick by the New York Giants (No. 81 overall) in 2013, Moore led the Aggies his junior season with 85 tackles, including 21 for losses and 12.5 sacks, to land on the All-SEC First Team. In 2014, true freshman Myles Garrett set a Texas A&M and SEC-freshman record with 11.5 sacks and was named a consensus first-team Freshman All-American as well as second-team All-SEC. During Texas A&M's 11-2 campaign in 2012 that ended with a win in the Cotton Bowl Classic over Oklahoma, Snyder's defense ranked 26th in the NCAA FBS in scoring defense, allowing 21.8 points per game.
Michigan State[edit]
On January 9, 2015, Snyder was hired by Mark Dantonio as the linebackers coach and special teams coordinator at Michigan State[3]
Personal life[edit]
Mark and his wife Beth, who is a native of nearby Ironton, Ohio and a graduate of the University of Kentucky, have three daughters: Chelsea, Lindsay, and Shaylee.

Playing career[edit]
The South Point, Ohio, native is a 1988 graduate of Marshall. Snyder played in 1987 for the football squad, leading the Southern Conference with 10 interceptions and was second on the team with 124 tackles his senior year at Marshall and helped lead the Herd to a landmark come from behind win at Louisville and a berth in Marshall's first-ever national championship game. He captured honorable mention All-America honors and first-team All-Southern Conference honors that season as the Thundering Herd posted a 10-5 overall record and finished as national runners-up to Northeast Louisiana (43-42) in the 1987 Division 1-AA National Championship game. Snyder's 10 interceptions in 1987 still stands as the Marshall and Southern Conference single-season record.
Coaching career[edit]
Early coaching[edit]
After graduating from Marshall, the following fall he began his coaching career as a student assistant coach for the Herd. He moved on to the UCF Knights the following year and spent two seasons there, the first as a graduate assistant and the second coaching linebackers.
In 1991, Snyder joined Jim Tressel at Youngstown State University as the outside linebacker coach. Snyder was given special teams and inside linebacker responsibilities in 1994, and then promoted to defensive coordinator and secondary coach in 1996. During his tenure at Youngstown State, the Penguins won three NCAA Division 1-AA national championships and played in four consecutive national championship games, facing Marshall in three of those contests (1991, 1992, and 1993).
Following the 1996 season, Snyder went on to spend four years as the defensive ends coach under Glen Mason at Minnesota. While coaching the Golden Gophers, Minnesota's defense twice set school records for single-season sacks and averaged 40.7 sacks during a three-year span. While at Minnesota, Snyder's best players were Lamanzer Williams, who led the nation in sacks in 1997, and Karon Riley, the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year in 2000.
Ohio State Buckeyes[edit]
Snyder again reunited with Jim Tressel at Ohio State University and was coming off of his first season as the Buckeyes' defensive coordinator. In Snyder's four years at Ohio State, the Buckeyes posted a 40-11 overall record and tallied a 3-1 record in bowl games, including victories in the 2003 and 2004 Tostitos Fiesta Bowls. Snyder helped develop a number of outstanding players at Ohio State, including All-Americans Matt Wilhelm, Cie Grant, and A. J. Hawk. Both Wilhelm and Grant played key roles in Ohio State's 2002 national championship before going on to become NFL draft picks. Hawk led OSU with 141 tackles en route to becoming the No. 5 overall pick by the Green Bay Packers in the 2006 NFL Draft.
Return to Marshall[edit]
Marshall University's football program welcomed home one of its own when Mark Snyder was introduced as Marshall's 28th head football coach on April 14, 2005. "I am pleased that Mark decided to return to his alma mater and lead our football program into a new era," Marshall Director of Athletics Bob Marcum said at Snyder's hiring. "He brings a great deal of experience, enthusiasm, and a proven record of success at the highest levels of college football to Marshall."
Snyder was the head coach at Marshall for five seasons (2005-09) and helped lead the Thundering Herd transition from the Mid-American Conference to Conference USA. In Snyder's final year in 2009, Marshall went 6-6 during the regular-season and earned a berth in the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl. His program produced 40 all-conference selections, including 2006 Conference USA Defensive Player of the Year Albert McClellan, who had 18.5 tackles for loss and 11.5 sacks his sophomore season. Snyder produced a 22-37 overall record at Marshall (17-23 Conference USA).
Under Snyder, running back Ahmad Bradshaw was a two-time All-C-USA pick and ran for 19 touchdowns and 1,523 yards as a junior in 2006 to earn first-team all-league honors. Bradshaw was selected in the seventh round of the 2007 NFL Draft (No. 250 overall) by the New York Giants and won two Super Bowls with the Giants (XLII, XLVI); he is one of just eight running backs in NFL history to be the leading rusher in two Super Bowls.
McClellan, who had to sit out the 2007 season due to a knee injury, returned in 2008 to earn first-team All-C-USA honors for the second time in his career. He signed with the Baltimore Ravens as a rookie free agent in 2009 and is currently playing his fourth season in the NFL, all in Baltimore.
South Florida[edit]
On January 18, 2010, Snyder was named the defensive coordinator at South Florida.[1] Snyder spent two seasons (2010-11) as the defensive coordinator/linebackers coach at South Florida. Both of his defenses in Tampa ranked in the FBS Top 25 in rushing defense (22nd in 2010 at 125.6 ypg. and 15th in 2011 at 107.3 ypg.). During USF's 2010 season that ended with an 8-5 record and a win over Clemson in the Meineke Car Care Bowl, the Bulls ranked 17th in total defense (317.9 ypg.) and 22nd in scoring defense (20.0 ppg.). Snyder helped mentor first-team All-BIG EAST defensive tackle Terrell McClain, who was selected in the third round of the 2011 NFL Draft (No. 65 overall) by the Carolina Panthers. The Bulls were also one of the top defensive teams during the 2011 season in tackles for loss (No. 2 in FBS with 99; 8.25 pg.) and sacks (No. 4 with 39; 3.25 pg.).
Texas A&M[edit]
On January 10, 2012, Snyder was hired by first-year head coach Kevin Sumlin as the defensive coordinator at Texas A&M.[2] During Snyder's stint as defensive coordinator at Texas A&M, two of his defensive linemen earned All-SEC honors, including consensus first-team All-American Damontre Moore in 2012. A third-round NFL Draft pick by the New York Giants (No. 81 overall) in 2013, Moore led the Aggies his junior season with 85 tackles, including 21 for losses and 12.5 sacks, to land on the All-SEC First Team. In 2014, true freshman Myles Garrett set a Texas A&M and SEC-freshman record with 11.5 sacks and was named a consensus first-team Freshman All-American as well as second-team All-SEC. During Texas A&M's 11-2 campaign in 2012 that ended with a win in the Cotton Bowl Classic over Oklahoma, Snyder's defense ranked 26th in the NCAA FBS in scoring defense, allowing 21.8 points per game.
Michigan State[edit]
On January 9, 2015, Snyder was hired by Mark Dantonio as the linebackers coach and special teams coordinator at Michigan State[3]
Personal life[edit]
Mark and his wife Beth, who is a native of nearby Ironton, Ohio and a graduate of the University of Kentucky, have three daughters: Chelsea, Lindsay, and Shaylee.

About Mark Snyder













































About Mark Snyder



        Mark Snyder is a California Licensed Home Improvement, C-10 Contractor; a Master Electrician licensed in 24 states, and is recognized internationally as an alternative energy expert.


        In 1979, Mark established Mark Snyder Electric, a full service electrical contracting, alternative energy installer, energy efficiency auditor, and a parts distribution business.


        Mark has been working on and investigating commercial and residential fires for 30 years, and is also recognized as an expert in grounding, bonding, code violations and has investigated in and provided expert witness testimony in hundreds of power surges, fires, and code compliance issues.


        Mark Snyder is committed to the creation of a sustainable future and has been recognized worldwide as an 

        expert on evolving alternative energy technologies and applications. Mark, a Master Electrician, Forensic Electrical 

        Specialist, Inventor, and Officer in a publicly listed Energy company, is the descendent of 5 generations of family 

        farmers and has been a commercial organic farmer for 30 years.


        Mark’s work has been the object of TV and other 

        media commentary in the US, UK, Japan, Germany, 

        and around the world on the web. Notable appearances 

        included a segment on the Daily Show with Jon 

        Stewart and the first green built episode of Extreme 

        Makeover: Home Edition on ABC-TV 


        From 1992-2002 Mark contracted to perform energy efficiency improvements 

        in nearly 28,000 convenience and grocery 

        Stores in chains from coast to coast. Mark’s 

        Contracting company was installing solar 

        power to homeowners in the western states, 

        from 1972 to 1996 off grid and from 1996 

        to the present both on and off grid. Mark is 

        also a third party warranty provider, 

        forensic electrician, and expert witness for 

        San Diego Gas & Electric and has been so 

        for 28 years. In 2010-2011, Mark Snyder Electric (Mark’s electrical 

        contracting company) contracted to install poly –phase (smart meters) in San 

        Diego and Orange Counties. 


        In 1998, in recognition of his understanding of our national electrical 

        infrastructure and his commitment to excellence, Mark was selected by 

        the Clinton Administration to serve on a White House Council to 

        address the readiness of national infrastructure in anticipation of the 

        Year 2000 Conversion. 


        A lifelong proponent of sustainable development Mark co-authored a bell weather paper early in 2001 published by 

        the Sierra Club, supporting the region wide development of Solar Power for the Energy Engineers of America in 

        part to replace a proposed gas fired 300 megawatt plant then under consideration. 


        Also recognized as a pioneer in waste to energy production, was trained in Europe with Dantrim International, a 

        Danish company and world wide leader in biomass energy systems. In 1985 Mark designed and installed Southern 

        California’s first large scale bio-energy conversion project in San Diego County using agricultural waste to produce 

        100 kW of electricity and waste heat for 20 acres of greenhouses using peach pits from a cannery. 


        In 2006 Mark co-founded Clean Air USA and partnered with 

        Willie Nelson Biodiesel to bring clean alternative motor fuels 

        to California. Mark was selected by Willie Nelson to accept 

        an EPA Achievement Award, issued as a result of Mark’s 

        work in opening the State’s first Bio-Willie station. 


        Mark’s long standing expertise in solar power and in 

        particular high efficiency passive solar tracking 

        systems, led to Mark being selected to build the 

        world’s largest passive solar tracking array for the 

        Alpine United School District in Alpine California.


        Mark’s dedication to finding energy efficient solutions to home heating and cooling costs, led to his development of 

        the Silent Night Aire™ super energy efficient, clean air, home ventilating, space heating, and cooling system. The 

        Silent Night Aire™ line of products dramatically reduces the cost of air conditioning and flush harmful pollutants 

        out of homes silently and seamlessly each night or day. 


        Mark’s work in energy efficiency, healthy green building, solar power, and affordable green housing, found 

        expression in the construction of Green Ribbon® manufactured and modular homes employing all those principles.

Center for the Study of the Individual and Society






How individuals create their own social worlds is the over-arching theme of my programs of research. Understanding these processes has involved theoretical and empirical inquiries into the linkages among personality, motivation, and social behavior. Specifically, I have been concerned with the processes by which individuals construct and enact motivational 'agendas for action' that draw upon and integrate features of their personal identities and their social settings, and that guide and direct their pursuit of relevant life outcomes in diverse domains of functioning.The investigative strategy that I employ constitutes something of a marriage between personality and social psychology. It brings together personality's concern with the psychology of the individual and social psychology's focus on the influence of the situation in coordinated programs of basic and applied research, conducted in laboratory and field settings, on the motivational foundations of individual and social behavior.  In these programs of research, my colleagues and I are addressing matters of functioning within individuals (which we have examined in studies of self and identity), between individuals (which we have investigated in studies of social interaction sequences), and in the context of groups and collectives (which we have studied in the context of voluntary action in response to societal problems)..Much of this research is conducted within the Center for the Study of the Individual and Society, a research center at the University of Minnesota dedicated to understanding how and why people become actively involved in doing good for others and for society. Such involvement can take the form of participation in volunteerism and philanthropy, social activism, community and neighborhood organizations, social and political movements. Among the questions being addressed are: Why do individuals become involved in such pro-social action? What sustains their involvement over time? What are the consequences of such action for individuals and for society? Research relevant to these concerns can and does have a basic/theoretical or applied/action-oriented focus, or both, and is being conducted with the investigative strategies of both social psychology and personality psychology.
