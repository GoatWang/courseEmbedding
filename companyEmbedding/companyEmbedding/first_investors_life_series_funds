FIRST INVESTORS LIFE SERIES FUND                                                

Dear Investor:                                                                  

We are pleased to present this Market Overview of the annual report for         
the First Investors Life Series Fund for the year ended December 31,
2002.*                                                                          

The Economy                                                                     

The economy, recovering from the 2001 recession, grew at a modest 2.8%          
pace over the past 12 months. Although the unemployment rate rose to 6%,        
the consumer sector accounted for most of the economy's growth, assisted        
by an extremely positive interest rate environment. The lowest mortgage         
rates in 40 years spurred record new home sales and mortgage                    
refinancings, the latter of which increased consumers' discretionary            
income. Zero-percent auto financing helped boost retail sales 4.2% in           
2002. Inflation was benign, as the consumer price index (CPI), an               
inflation benchmark, rose only 2.4% during the year.                            

In contrast to the consumer sector, the business sector was weak. While         
lower prices benefited the consumer, they did not help businesses.              
Despite improved earnings due to increased productivity, lack of revenue        
growth and geopolitical uncertainty discouraged capital investment and          
hiring. Industrial production increased only 2.1% year-over-year, and           
manufacturing payrolls declined by 592,000 employees.                           

The Federal Reserve kept monetary policy unchanged until November, when         
it  surprised the market by lowering the federal funds rate from 1.75%          
to 1.25% in response to continued slow economic growth. The substantial         
Republican victory  in the mid-term elections in November increased             
market expectations for a fiscal stimulus proposal from the Bush                
Administration in early 2003.                                                   

The Equity Market                                                               

Despite a fourth quarter rally, the equity market posted disappointing          
results during 2002. In fact, the 12-month period was the worst year for        
the Standard & Poor's 500 Index since 1974 and the first time since             
before U.S. involvement in World War II that the stock market posted            
negative returns for a third consecutive year. Many factors converged to        
hold back stock performance, including the sluggish rate of economic            
growth, corporate governance and accounting scandals and tensions with          
Iraq and North Korea.                                                           

Given the high level of uncertainty, all broad market indexes were              
negative for the period, with the Standard & Poor's 500 Index down 23.5%        
and the Dow Jones Industrial Average off 16.8%. Most business sectors           
were down for the period, with the information technology,                      
telecommunications and utilities sectors among the worst performers. The        
materials and consumer staples sectors were rare bright spots. The              
technology benchmark, the Nasdaq Composite, lost 31.5% of its value.            

Market Overview (continued)                                                     
FIRST INVESTORS LIFE SERIES FUND                                                

Although all market capitalization sectors were in negative territory,          
the mid-cap sector did somewhat better than the small-cap and large-cap         
sectors. On the international front, most developed markets posted              
negative returns.                                                               

The Bond Market                                                                 

In general, the bond market posted strong results in 2002. The primary          
factors that impacted the market were a substantial decline in interest         
rates due to the sluggish economy, low inflation, the weak stock market         
and geopolitical instability (in  particular, terrorism and Iraq).              

The bond market experienced a substantial rally during the reporting            
period, as interest rates declined significantly. For example, the              
two-year Treasury note yield began the period at 3.03% and ended the            
period at 1.60%, and the 10-year Treasury note yield dropped from 5.05%         
to 3.82%. In early October, Treasury yields fell to their lowest levels         
since the 1960s before rising slightly later in the fourth quarter.             

Driven by this substantial decline in interest rates, the Lehman                
Aggregate Bond Market Index was up 10.26%. Among the sectors of the bond        
market, U.S. government securities had the highest return, as the Lehman        
U.S. Government Index increased by 11.50%. Government securities                
benefited from their high credit quality and liquidity, and were seen as        
a "safe haven." Investment grade corporate bonds were the second best           
performing sector, as the Lehman Corporate Index increased by 10.12%.           
The returns of corporate bonds varied substantially by issuer and credit        
rating. Higher quality bonds substantially outperformed those of lower          
credit quality. Mortgage-backed securities also posted solid                    
performance, as the Lehman Mortgage-Backed Index was up 8.75%. This             
sector benefited from high credit ratings and relatively high yields,           
although the record number of mortgage refinancings held returns back.          
High yield bonds posted disappointing results, as the Lehman High Yield         
Index was down 1.30%. The highly indebted companies in this sector were         
particularly  vulnerable to the sub-par economic recovery, weak stock           
market and corporate  governance issues.                                        

Looking Ahead                                                                   

The economy remains sluggish despite substantial monetary -- and likely         
fiscal -- stimulus. The probability of war with Iraq appears high and           
North Korea is a new source of tension. These factors have combined to          
keep interest rates near historically low levels. The year 2003 began           
with great uncertainty, but renewed economic growth or successful               
resolution of geopolitical issues would likely result in higher interest        
rates and lower bond prices. For the stock market, with equity                  
valuations at more reasonable levels and the scandals of corporate              
malfeasance now largely passed, stocks may benefit if the economy grows         
moderately. As always, investors are best served by a well-diversified          
portfolio and a long-term commitment.                                           

Because it is impossible to predict the future direction of the markets,        
particularly over the short term, there are certain basic investment            
principles that we encourage our clients to follow to reduce exposure to        
risk.** First, we encourage clients to take a long-term view and to             
avoid trying to time the market. Attempting to time the market is               
extremely difficult, even for professional investors. Second, we                
encourage our clients to diversify their portfolios among stock funds,          
bond funds and money market funds. Third, we encourage our clients to           
follow a regular investment plan, investing a specific amount of money          
at defined intervals. This strategy is known as "dollar cost averaging."        
It may help you to avoid getting caught up in the excitement of a               
rising market and will reduce the risk of buying at high points.                

Of course, no financial plan or program, no matter how well designed, is        
guaranteed to be successful. In addition, nothing eliminates the risk           
associated with overall market trends. However, utilizing these various         
strategies may help to minimize the risk by reducing the extent to which        
an investor may be affected by a decline in any one security or segment         
of the market. It's important to note that systematic investment                
programs like dollar cost averaging do not assure a profit or protect           
against loss in declining markets. These types of plans involve regular         
investment in securities, regardless of fluctuating price levels.               
Investors should consider their financial ability to continue purchases         
through periods of low price levels.

* The Funds are only available through the purchase of variable life        
insurance policies and variable annuity contracts issued by First       
Investors Life Insurance Company. The reports do not reflect the        
additional expenses and charges that are applicable to variable life    
insurance policies and variable annuity contracts.                      

** There are a variety of risks associated with investing in all              
variable life and annuity subaccounts. For the stock subaccounts, the   
risks include market risk (the risk that the entire stock market will   
decline because of an event such as a deterioration in the economy or a 
rise in interest rates), as well as special risks associated with       
investing in certain types of stock subaccounts, such as small-cap,     
global and international subaccounts. For bond subaccounts, the risks   
include interest rate risk and credit risk. Interest rate risk is the   
risk that bonds will decrease in value as interest rates rise. As a     
general matter, longer-term bonds fluctuate more than shorter-term bonds
in reaction to changes in interest rates. Credit risk is the risk that  
bonds will decline in value as the result of a decline in the credit    
rating of the bonds or the economy as a whole, or that the issuer will  
be unable to pay the interest and/or principal when due. You should     
consult your prospectus for a precise explanation of the risks          
associated with your subaccounts.

FIRST INVESTORS LIFE BLUE CHIP FUND                                             

Dear Investor:                                                                  

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Fund's return on a net asset          
value basis was -25.8%. During the period, the Fund declared dividends          
from net investment income of 8.5 cents per share.                              

The general downturn of the stock market was particularly difficult for         
large capitalization stocks. Holdings in a number of sectors were not           
beneficial to the Fund's performance. Health care companies suffered            
from negative sentiment as well as stock-specific issues. Positions in          
Pfizer and Merck did not perform well due to concerns about their drug          
pipelines. The Fund's holdings in Tenet Healthcare hurt performance             
significantly, as the stock price fell substantially due to                     
investigations regarding improper billing of government programs.               

Many stocks within the consumer discretionary sector were hurt by               
overall  concerns regarding consumer debt levels. These concerns were           
particularly acute  for large-cap stocks. Holdings in this sector, such         
as Home Depot and Sears, hurt performance. Technology sectors were              
generally weak due to doubts regarding future growth potential. Holdings        
in these sectors were disappointing across the board, with Intel,               
Motorola and Cisco being major underachievers. Shares in the financial          
sector performed poorly, as concerns about debt loads and the financial         
health of customers plagued consumer-oriented names such as Capital One         
Financial, Citigroup and MBNA.                                                  

Despite the downturn, the Fund was able to benefit from holdings in             
several sectors. Investments in the traditionally defensive consumer            
staples sector, such as Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola and Kroger, held up           
fairly well. The materials sector benefited from improved commodity             
pricing, and the Fund was helped by its overweight position in Newmont          
Mining in the gold sector. Selected holdings in the utilities sector            
held up well, specifically defensive industries and companies without           
trading exposure, such as Consolidated Edison. Selected stocks of firms         
in the telecommunications services helped performance, as the Fund held         
shares of several regional Bells.                                               

Throughout the reporting period, the Fund's sector-neutral stance               
relative to the  S&P 500 hurt performance as it was unable to fully             
participate in rallies in certain sectors. Effective December 31, 2002,         
the Fund's sector-neutral mandate has been lifted, empowering the Fund          
to take overweight or underweight sector positions. This will give the          
Fund greater flexibility in pursuing its objective of high total                
investment return consistent with preservation of capital.

The graph compares a $10,000 investment in the First Investors Life Blue    
Chip Fund beginning 12/31/92 with a theoretical investment in the           
Standard & Poor's 500 Index. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is an          
unmanaged capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks designed to           
measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the    
aggregate market value of such stocks, which represent all major            
industries. It is not possible to invest directly in this Index. In         
addition, the Index does not take into account fees and expenses that an    
investor would incur in purchasing securities in the Index. For purposes    
of the graph and the accompanying table, it is assumed that all             
dividends and distributions were reinvested.                                

* The Average Annual Total Return figures are for the periods ended             
12/31/02.                                                                   

The returns shown do not reflect any sales charges, since the               
Fund sells its shares solely to variable annuity and/or variable life       
insurance subaccounts at net asset value. The returns do not reflect the    
fees and charges that an individual would pay in connection with an         
investment in a variable annuity or life contract or policy. Results        
represent past performance and do not indicate future results.              
Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so    
that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than    
the original cost. Standard & Poor's 500 Index figures are from Standard    
& Poor's and all other figures are from First Investors Management

FIRST INVESTORS LIFE CASH MANAGEMENT FUND                                       

Dear Investor:                                                                  

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Fund's return on a net asset          
value basis was 1.2%. The Fund maintained a $1.00 net asset value per           
share throughout the year.*                                                     

The Life Series Cash Management Fund continued to pursue its objectives         
by investing conservatively in short-term instruments considered to             
present minimal credit risk at the time of purchase.                            

Short-term interest rates remained generally stable for much of last            
year, albeit  at their lowest levels in decades. Though the economy             
improved marginally in  2002, manufacturing remained weak, equity prices        
continued to be depressed, the unemployment rate rose and global                
political uncertainties increased. Consequently, the Fed was compelled          
to lower short-term interest rates in November from 1.75%  to 1.25%.            

The Fund invested a large portion of its assets in U.S. government and          
agency securities over the last year in an effort to mitigate credit            
risk in the portfolio. The Fund also invested large portions of its             
assets in securities issued by domestic corporations and banks. As              
corporate credit quality deteriorated, however, the Fund increased its          
diversification of non-government issuers. In addition to limiting              
exposure, the Fund also began to limit its investments in non-government        
issuers to those with shorter maturities.                                       

The Fund maintained a weighted average maturity that was longer than its        
peer  group average through most of the last year, which benefited              
performance. Though interest rates were low and stable, the yield curve         
remained positively sloped during most of the period and offered                
opportunities for incremental return by investing in securities with            
longer maturities. The Fund also effectively used corporate bonds and           
notes for incremental return, in addition to floating rate securities           
and various types of callable securities.                                       

The Fund will continue to purchase only those securities that it                
believes present minimal credit risk to its shareholders. In addition,          
the Fund is likely to maintain a large percentage of its assets in U.S.         
government and agency obligations, while maintaining additional                 
constraints on investments in corporate debt. The Fund is also likely to        
maintain a weighted average maturity that is close to that of its peers.        

Money market funds remained an integral part of the financial markets in        
2002, continuing to offer investors stability of principal and the              
convenience of liquidity. The severe strain on corporate credit quality         
over the last year highlights the importance of the quality, diversity          
and maturity guidelines under which money market funds operate.

Although the potential returns of money market funds may be lower than          
returns offered by other types of mutual funds, their liquidity and             
relatively stable asset value remain key attractions to investors. Money        
market funds continue to be among the most conservative investment              
vehicles available, offering relative stability of principal, easy              
access to account information, generally free check writing privileges          
and a return that is comparable to that available on bank savings and           
checking accounts.                                                              

Thank you for making the Life Cash Management Fund part of your                 
investment strategy. As always, we appreciate the opportunity to serve          
your investment needs.                                                          

Sincerely,

* Although the Fund attempts to maintain a stable net asset value of            
$1.00 per share, there can be no assurance that the Fund will be able do    
so. Moreover, money market mutual funds are not insured by the Federal      
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.

FIRST INVESTORS LIFE DISCOVERY FUND                                             

Dear Investor:                                                                  

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Fund's return on a net asset          
value basis was -27.1%.                                                         

The primary factors driving the Fund's performance were the sluggish            
economy, the overall decline of the stock market and the generally              
disappointing performance of the small-cap growth stock sector.                 

At the start of 2002, the Fund shifted to overweight positions in the           
industrial and consumer cyclical sectors, and underweight positions in          
the technology and health care sectors. These moves helped the Fund, as         
industrial and consumer cyclical stocks held up fairly well, while              
stocks in the technology and health care sectors tumbled through the            
first half of 2002. Starting in the summer, the Fund increased its              
holdings in the health care sector to an overweight position, and               
boosted its holdings in the financial sector while reducing holdings in         
the consumer discretionary sector. In the fourth quarter, the Fund moved        
closer to a market neutral position in the technology sectors, and              
reduced holdings in the defensive health care sector. A strong rally in         
the final months of the year did help mitigate some of the damage               
inflicted earlier in the year.                                                  

Two technology holdings that hurt the Fund were Retek, a supply                 
chain software supplier to retailers, and Aeroflex, a networking                
communications provider. Both firms were harmed by a cutback in                 
technology spending. In the health care arena, Province Healthcare, an          
operator of rural hospitals, and Enzon Pharmaceuticals, a drug discovery        
company, were poor performers. In general, the Fund's underweight               
position in technology stocks for most of the year helped performance.          
Several consumer cyclical stocks posted good results, such as Chico's           
FAS, a specialty retailer that offers women's clothing. Another area            
that helped the Fund was the financial sector, where smaller, regional          
companies posted solid returns, such as Doral Financial, a mortgage             
bank.                                                                           

Going forward, the Fund will continue to seek out high-quality smaller          
companies that have strong, active management teams, solid financial            
fundamentals, profitable product niches and above-average growth                
potential.

The graph compares a $10,000 investment in the First Investors Life         
Discovery Fund beginning 12/31/92 with a theoretical investment in the      
Russell 2000 Index. The Russell 2000 Index consists of the smallest         
2,000 companies in the Russell 3000 Index (which represents                 
approximately 98% of the investable U.S. equity market). The Russell        
2000 Index is an unmanaged index widely accepted as a proxy of small        
capitalization stocks. It is not possible to invest directly in this        
Index. In addition, the Index does not take into account fees and           
expenses that an investor would incur in purchasing securities in the       
index. For purposes of the graph and the accompanying table, it is          
assumed that all dividend and distributions were reinvested.                

* The Average Annual Total Return figures are for the periods ended

The returns shown do not reflect any sales charges, since the               
Fund sells its shares solely to variable annuity and/or variable life       
insurance subaccounts at net asset value. The returns do not reflect the    
fees and charges that an individual would pay in connection with an         
investment in a variable annuity or life contract or policy. Results        
represent past performance and do not indicate future results.              
Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so    
that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than    
the original cost. Russell 2000 Index figures are from Frank Russell and

FIRST INVESTORS LIFE FOCUSED EQUITY FUND                                        

Dear Investor:                                                                  

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Fund's return on a net asset          
value basis was -28.1%. During the period, the Fund declared dividends          
from net investment income of 2.3 cents per share.                              

Despite positive returns in the fourth quarter, U.S. equity markets             
declined for the third consecutive year in 2002, marking one of the             
worst investment periods in decades. There was a gradual economic               
recovery over the course of 2002 in both the economy and corporate              
earnings, and the consumer was the mainstay of growth. Every sector             
declined in 2002, with information technology and telecommunication             
services being the biggest laggards, while consumer staples and                 
materials posted the strongest returns. Weak corporate profits,                 
geopolitical uncertainties, corporate governance and accounting                 
scandals, and high consumer leverage all weighed on investor confidence.        

Poor stock selection in the first half of the year in the consumer              
discretionary and industrials sectors negatively impacted the Fund.             
However, stock selection in both of these sectors was decidedly positive        
in the second half of 2002. Sector allocation was a positive contributor        
during the second half of the year. Our underweight position in the             
utilities sector and our overweight position in the health care sector          
most favorably impacted the Fund's performance for the period. At               
year-end, our largest overweight position was in the health care sector         
and largest underweight position was in the utilities sector. Top               
performers for the year included Schlumberger, Hewlett-Packard, and EMC.        
The most disappointing stocks for the year included AOL Time Warner,            
Intel and in particular, Tyco, whose difficulties had a significant             
negative impact on the Fund.                                                    

Looking forward to 2003, we foresee a moderately improving economic             
environment, with deflationary risks gradually receding, but with global        
growth remaining sub-par. A sluggish consumer will be partially offset          
by a modest recovery in capital equipment spending. A combination of            
better profits and slowly improving corporate balance sheets should lead        
to positive investment spending in 2003. Factors that point to better           
macroeconomic trends this year include low interest rates, rising fiscal        
spending, money supply growth, and likely tax cuts. Offsetting these            
expansionary factors are high individual debt levels, weak employment           
trends, globally competitive pricing, low industrial capacity                   
utilization and weak state budgets. Overall, while significant                  
crosscurrents remain, particularly the various geopolitical                     
uncertainties, we can begin to envision an environment of declining             
risks associated with the bursting of the technology bubble, which              
increases the likelihood of better stock market returns.

The graph compares a $10,000 investment in the First Investors Life         
Focused Equity Fund beginning 11/8/99 (inception date) with a               
theoretical investment in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. The Standard     
& Poor's 500 Index is an unmanaged capitalization-weighted index of 500     
stocks designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy        
through changes in the aggregate market value of such stocks, which         
represent all major industries. It is not possible to invest directly in    
this Index. In addition, the Index does not take into account fees and      
expenses that an investor would incur in purchasing securities in the       
Index. For purposes of the graph and the accompanying table, it is          
assumed that all dividends and distributions were reinvested.               

* The Average Annual Total Return figures are for the periods ended             
12/31/02.                                                                   

The returns shown do not reflect any sales charges, since the               
Fund sells its shares solely to variable annuity and/or variable life       
insurance subaccounts at net asset value. The returns do not reflect the    
fees and charges that an individual would pay in connection with an         
investment in a variable annuity or life contract or policy. Results        
represent past performance and do not indicate future results.              
Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so    
that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than    
the original cost. Standard & Poor's 500 Index figures are from Standard    
& Poor's and all other figures are from First Investors Management

FIRST INVESTORS LIFE GOVERNMENT FUND                                            

Dear Investor:                                                                  

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Fund's return on a net asset          
value basis was 7.8%. During the period, the Fund declared dividends            
from net investment income of 52.3 cents per share.                             

The Life Government Fund continued to invest primarily in Government            
National Mortgage Association (GNMA) mortgage-backed bonds ("Ginnie             
Maes"). The factors that drove the Fund's performance during the year           
were the substantial decline in interest rates and record prepayments on        
mortgage-backed bonds.                                                          

The record amount of prepayments occurred as homeowners took advantage          
of both the lowest mortgage rates in decades (the 30-year mortgage rate         
fell to 6%), and rising property prices to refinance outstanding                
mortgages. In this environment, lower-coupon, mortgage-backed bonds             
generally outperformed higher-coupon, mortgage-backed bonds. Also, while        
mortgage-backed bonds had relatively high returns, non-mortgage-backed          
bonds -- such as U.S. Treasury securities -- had higher returns.                

At the beginning of 2002, the Fund's composition was 70% mortgage-backed        
bonds, 26% U.S. Treasury and agency notes, and 4% in cash equivalents.          
The Fund benefited during the year from its relatively high percentage          
of assets in intermediate maturity U.S. agency notes, which outperformed        
mortgage-backed bonds. The Fund's returns were negatively affected by a         
high level of prepayments on its high-coupon, mortgage-backed holdings.         
In particular, a position in GNMA 8% coupon, mortgage-backed bonds that         
accounted for 8% of the Fund's assets was prepaid in its entirety in            
April. The Fund ended the reporting period with 76% of its assets in            
mortgage-backed bonds, 19% in Treasury and agency holdings, and 5% in           
cash equivalents.                                                               

Thank you for making the Life Government Fund part of your investment           
strategy. As always, we appreciate the opportunity to serve your                
investment needs.

The graph compares a $10,000 investment in the First Investors Life         
Government Fund beginning 12/31/92 with theoretical investments in the      
Salomon Brothers Mortgage Index and the Salomon Brothers                    
Treasury/Government Sponsored Index. The Salomon Brothers Mortgage Index    
is a market capitalization- weighted index that consists of all agency      
pass-throughs and FHA and GNMA project notes. The Salomon Brothers          
Treasury/Government Sponsored Index is a market capitalization-weighted     
index that consists of debt issued by the U.S. Treasury and U.S.            
Government sponsored agencies. Every issue included in the Indices is       
trader-priced, and the Indices follow consistent and realistic              
availability limits, including only those securities with sufficient        
amounts outstanding. It is not possible to invest directly in these         
Indices. In addition, the Indices do not take into account fees and         
expenses that an investor would incur in purchasing securities in the       
Indices. For purposes of the graph and the accompanying table, it is        
assumed that all dividends and  distributions were reinvested.              

* The Average Annual Total Return figures are for the periods ended             
12/31/02. During the periods shown, some or all of the expenses of the      
Fund were waived or assumed. If such expenses had been paid by the Fund,    
the Average Annual Total Return for One Year, Five Years and Ten Years      
would have been 7.64%, 6.97% and 6.26%, respectively.                       

The returns shown do not reflect any sales charge, since the Fund sells         
its shares solely to variable annuity and/or variable life insurance            
subaccounts at net asset value. The returns do not reflect the fees and         
charges that an individual would pay in connection with an investment in        
a variable annuity or life contract or policy. Results represent past           
performance and do not indicate future results. Investment return and           
principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's           
shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.        
Salomon Brothers Mortgage Index and Salomon Brothers Treasury/Government

FIRST INVESTORS LIFE GROWTH FUND                                                

Dear Investor:                                                                  

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Fund's return on a net asset          
value basis was -22.2%. During the period, the Fund declared dividends          
from net investment income of 6.2 cents per share.                              

U.S. equity markets finished in negative territory for the third                
consecutive year. The equity markets reacted negatively to news of a            
sluggish job market, rising oil prices, and a potential invasion of             
Iraq. Although we do share concerns regarding the global outlook toward         
war and terrorism we are less concerned about the long-term implications        
of corporate fraud. Changes have begun to be made within corporate              
reporting standards and our belief is the net result of this period will        
be increased confidence in the quality of earnings. For the year, value         
outperformed growth while mid-cap stocks outperformed both large and            
small caps.                                                                     

There was a gradual economic recovery over the course of 2002 in both           
the economy and corporate earnings. In the third quarter, real GDP grew         
by 3.2% versus a year ago and S&P operating earnings rose 10%. We expect        
similar growth rates in 2003. The consumer has been the mainstay of             
growth, but support from this sector is expected to be moderate going           
forward. Over the past few months, spending has been helped by record           
"cash-outs" from mortgage refinancing. Going forward, however, we expect        
a slow employment recovery, geopolitical concerns, and higher oil prices        
to slow spending gains. A stronger job market later in 2003 should set          
the stage for stronger consumption in 2004. We are hopeful that                 
accommodative monetary policies and the ongoing improvement in corporate        
balance sheets will improve the growth environment in 2004.                     

The Fund's performance for the year was driven not only by the overall          
equity markets but also by some negative stock selection, most notably          
in the telecommunication services and consumer staples sectors. However,        
our sector allocation was positive  for the year and served to partially        
offset the impact of stock selection. We were appropriately underweight         
in the poor-performing telecommunication services sector, which declined        
35% for the year. In fact, this underweight position represented the            
largest positive sector contribution to the Fund's performance.                 
Nevertheless, one of our telecommunication services holdings was                
WorldCom, and the negative impact of this holding largely counteracted          
the positive effect gained by underweighting the sector for most of             
2002.                                                                           

Our current investment posture has a modest cyclical bias toward                
industrial areas but with an underweight toward consumer cyclical and           
financial sectors. At year-end, the largest overweight positions were in        
the software, materials, media, and energy sectors. The largest                 
underweight positions were in the food, beverage and tobacco,

telecommunication services, and bank sectors. We believe software               
spending will pick up in 2003, aided by a business upgrade cycle and/or         
expanded write-offs for capital expenditures. Media is overweight as            
this sector continues to enjoy above average earnings trends. The               
overweight positions in the energy and materials sectors are based on           
expected global economic growth later this year.                                

Looking forward to 2003, we retain our view of a moderately improving           
economic environment with deflationary risks gradually receding but with        
global growth remaining sub-par as corporate and consumer balance sheets        
remain a top priority. Factors that point to better macroeconomic trends        
this year include low interest rates, rising fiscal spending, money             
supply growth, and likely tax cuts. Factors offsetting these                    
expansionary factors are high individual debt levels, weak employment           
trends, globally competitive pricing, low industrial capacity                   
utilization and weak state budgets. While low interest rates and                
gradually improving earnings are pluses for valuation, uncertain capital        
flows, a large U.S. current account deficit, and a weaker currency may          
limit valuation expansion. Overall, while significant crosscurrents             
remain, particularly the various geopolitical uncertainties, we can             
begin to envision an environment of declining risks associated with the         
bursting of the technology bubble, which increases the likelihood of            
better stock market returns.

The graph compares a $10,000 investment in the First Investors Life         
Growth Fund beginning 12/31/92 with a theoretical investment in the         
Standard & Poor's 500 Index. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is an          
unmanaged capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks designed to           
measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the    
aggregate market value of such stocks, which represent all major            
industries. It is not possible to invest directly in this Index. In         
addition, the Index does not take into account fees and expenses that an    
investor would incur in purchasing securities in the Index. For purposes    
of the graph and the accompanying table, it is assumed that all             
dividends and distributions were reinvested.                                

* The Average Annual Total Return figures are for the periods ended             
12/31/02.                                                                   

The returns shown do not reflect any sales charges, since the               
Fund sells its shares solely to variable annuity and/or variable life       
insurance subaccounts at net asset value. The returns do not reflect the    
fees and charges that an individual would pay in connection with an         
investment in a variable annuity or life contract or policy. Results        
represent past performance and do not indicate future results.              
Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so    
that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than    
the original cost. Standard & Poor's 500 Index figures are from Standard    
& Poor's and all other figures are from First Investors Management

FIRST INVESTORS LIFE HIGH YIELD FUND                                            

Dear Investor:                                                                  

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Fund's return on a net asset          
value basis was 2.3%. During the period, the Fund declared dividends            
from net investment income of 89.4 cents per share.                             

Macroeconomic factors that contributed to the Fund's performance during         
the fiscal year were the pace of economic recovery, the prospect of war,        
and a flight to quality by investors. The lack of sustainability of the         
economic recovery cut short the corporate profit cycle and concerns             
about a "double dip" recession caused a reduction in corporate                  
investment. The prospect of war with Iraq and its effect on oil prices          
throughout the year hurt the profitability of many industrial companies.        
The seemingly endless stream of corporate fraud announcements and the           
resulting market volatility shattered investor confidence. Reflecting           
these concerns, the yield spread between high yield bonds and Treasuries        
reached its widest level since the early 1990s recession.                       

Given the bearish market environment, market participants shifted their         
profiles based  on their appetite for risk. Asset classes perceived as          
less risky (i.e., U.S. Treasuries, high quality investment grade                
corporate bonds and government-backed mortgage securities) were the best        
performers in fiscal year 2002; the riskiest asset classes such as              
equities  suffered steep losses. The high-yield market was between these        
extremes.                                                                       

In this environment, the main contributor to Fund performance was its           
defensive positioning. Our view entering 2002 was that the economic             
recovery would be slower than the market consensus. Therefore, the Fund         
took overweight positions in defensive industries such as cable                 
television, diversified media, and health care. Diversified media was           
one of the top performing sectors in 2002 and health care also                  
outperformed the market. Our attempt to position the Fund defensively           
did not work perfectly, however. The cable television sector,                   
traditionally a defensive play, was the worst performing sector in the          
high yield market in 2002. Nonetheless, our strategy overall was                
successful and aided Fund performance.                                          

Other factors that positively contributed to the Fund's performance were        
overweight positions in the energy and transportation sectors. The              
energy sector continued to perform well due to strong oil and gas               
prices. The transportation sector was helped by strong automotive sales.        
An underweight position in the utilities sector helped performance as           
this sector suffered from the fallout from Enron and overcapacity as            
newly constructed power plants drove down power prices.                         

By contrast, underweight positions in the gaming/leisure and financial          
services sectors hurt performance as both sectors outperformed the              
market. Given our view entering  2002 that the economic recovery would          
be slower than the market consensus, we were surprised that the                 
gaming/leisure sector, which relies on discretionary spending by                
consumers, outperformed the market.                                             

Corporate defaults were also an important factor in the performance of          
the Fund and the high yield market in general. Moody's issuer-weighted          
default rate for speculative grade bonds ended November 2002 at 8.7%,           
down from a peak of 10.8% in January 2002. The good news was that the           
default rate fell nine out of eleven months in 2002. On the flip side,          

Portfolio Managers' Letter (continued)                                          
FIRST INVESTORS LIFE HIGH YIELD FUND                                            

the default rate was at a higher level for a longer period of time than         
in previous years. Moody's forecasting model predicts that the default          
rate will finish 2002 near 8.5%. Moody's 12-month forecast indicates            
that the default rate will continue to trend downward towards 7.1% by           
the end of the fourth quarter of 2003. A 7% default rate, though, is            
still approximately double the historical default rate.                         

Looking to 2003, we are cautiously optimistic. The U.S. economy seems to        
be in a low-growth, low-inflation environment. While this will make it          
difficult for high yield issuers to "grow out" of their debts,                  
productivity gains and low interest rates do allow some room for                
deleveraging. Additionally, low dollar prices on existing bonds combined        
with a declining default rate are bullish for our market. On the                
negative side, geopolitical uncertainty looms large. The biggest risk to        
our outlook is on the geopolitical front, where the escalation of               
hostilities in the Middle East or elsewhere can trigger a flight of             
capital out of "risky" asset classes. In addition, the recent run up in         
oil prices due to the Iraqi situation and the strike by workers at              
PDVSA, Venezuela's state-operated energy company, have hurt the                 
profitability of industrial companies and may lower business investment         
in the near term. In the longer run, if a "double-dip" recession were to        
occur, the decline of default rates would slow.

The graph compares a $10,000 investment in the First Investors Life High    
Yield Fund beginning 12/31/92 with a theoretical investment in the CS       
First Boston High Yield Index. The CS First Boston High Yield Index is      
designed to measure the performance of the high yield bond market. As of    
12/31/02, the Index consisted of 1,500 different issues, most of which      
are cash pay, but also included in the Index are zero-coupon bonds, step    
bonds, payment-in-kind bonds and bonds which are in default. As of          
12/31/02, approximately 4.3% of the market value of the Index was in        
default. The bonds included in the Index have an average life of 6.3        
years, an average maturity of 7.1 years, an average duration of 4.0         
years and an average coupon of 9.35%. It is not possible to invest          
directly in this Index. In addition, the Index does not take into           
account fees and expenses that an investor would incur in purchasing        
securities in the Index. For purposes of the graph and the accompanying     
table, it is assumed that all dividends and distributions were              
reinvested.

The returns shown do not reflect any sales charges, since the               
Fund sells its shares solely to variable annuity and/or variable life       
insurance subaccounts at net asset value. The returns do not reflect the    
fees and charges that an individual would pay in connection with an         
investment in a variable annuity or life contract or policy. Results        
represent past performance and do not indicate future results.              
Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so    
that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than    
the original cost. The issuers of the high yield bonds, in which the        
Fund primarily invests, pay higher interest rates because they have a       
greater likelihood of financial difficulty, which could result in their     
inability to repay the bonds fully when due. Prices of high yield bonds     
are also subject to greater fluctuations. CS First Boston High Yield

FIRST INVESTORS LIFE INTERNATIONAL SECURITIES FUND                              

Dear Investor:                                                                  

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Fund's return on a net asset          
value basis was -18.4%. During the period, the Fund declared dividends          
from net investment income of 8.3 cents per share.                              

Global equity markets declined in 2002 for the third year in a row as           
investors struggled to find good news amidst an environment                     
characterized by economic malaise, geopolitical turmoil, corporate              
scandals and continued fears over the war on terrorism. The market              
reaction to these fears peaked at the end of September and early                
October, with the third quarter ending as one of the worst in recent            
memory. Investors returned to the equity markets in the fourth quarter,         
resulting in the second best quarter for global equity markets in the           
last three years.                                                               

For the year, our stock selection in the technology and consumer                
discretionary sectors, as well as the overweight position in the                
materials sector, contributed positively to the Fund's performance. The         
biggest detractors from performance were stock selection in the                 
industrial and financial sectors, and our underweight position in               
consumer staples. We also benefited from our overweight position in             
Japan and our decreased exposure to the U.S. In the second half of 2002,        
we modestly increased our holdings in the technology, financial, and            
materials sectors, as we felt that the market had become overly                 
pessimistic about the prospects for many of these stocks and that they          
had become attractively priced. These changes in the portfolio had a            
significant impact on performance in the second half of the year and            
made it possible for us to recover some of the ground we lost earlier in        
the year.                                                                       

Our global economic outlook remains unchanged. We continue to expect            
that economic growth over the next year will be quite modest in                 
comparison to prior recoveries as economies around the globe recover            
from the excesses of the 1990s. Within this environment, we favor the           
telecommunications services sector, as companies continue to cut debt,          
reduce spending, shed unnecessary assets and focus on their core                
businesses. We continue to like selected names in the technology sector,        
as growth expectations remain relatively modest. Looking into 2003, we          
will look to trim our holdings in the consumer discretionary sector due         
to slower consumer spending and will have underweight positions in the          
energy and industrials sectors.                                                 

From a regional perspective, we have become more favorably disposed             
towards the U.S. over Europe. The U.S. is being aggressive on both the          
monetary and fiscal fronts and looks likely to see improving growth             
before Continental Europe. With regard  to the U.K., we believe that the        
economy will face a consumer slowdown once the housing boom cools down.         
Emerging markets may be the most interesting this year, particularly in         
Asia, where they have respectable domestic growth, benefit from a weaker        

dollar, are no longer dependent on foreign capital, and have a large and        
growing export market in China.                                                 

Thank you for making the Life International Securities Fund part of your

The graph compares a $10,000 investment in the First Investors Life         
International Securities Fund beginning 12/31/92 with a theoretical         
investment in the MSCI All Country World Free Index. The MSCI All           
Country World Free Index represents both the developed and the emerging     
markets. The Index includes 49 markets of which emerging markets            
represent approximately 4.05%. It is not possible to invest directly in     
this Index. In addition, the Index does not take into account fees and      
expenses that an investor would incur in purchasing securities in the       
Index. For purposes of the graph and the accompanying table, it is          
assumed that all dividends and  distributions were reinvested.              

* The Average Annual Total Return figures are for the periods ended             
12/31/02.                                                                   

The returns shown do not reflect any sales charges, since the               
Fund sells its shares solely to variable annuity and/or variable life       
insurance subaccounts at net asset value. The returns do not reflect the    
fees and charges that an individual would pay in connection with an         
investment in a variable annuity or life contract or policy. Results        
represent past performance and do not indicate future results.              
Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so    
that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than    
the original cost. MSCI All Country World Free Index figures are from       
Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc. and all other figures are from First

Portfolio Manager's Letter                                                      
FIRST INVESTORS LIFE INVESTMENT GRADE FUND                                      

Dear Investor:                                                                  

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Fund's return on a net asset          
value basis was 7.9%. During the period, the Fund declared dividends            
from net investment income of  64.0 cents per share.                            

The Fund's performance was driven mainly by the sluggish economic               
recovery, the  falling interest rate environment, avoidance of the brunt        
of corporate scandals, and  decisive management when our portfolio              
encountered credit problems.                                                    

As is often the case, the key issues that defined these twelve months           
were very different from what the world expected as the year began.             
Immediately after the terrorist attacks in 2001, there were widespread          
expectations of a significant economic contraction. After all, economic         
activity had been decelerating before the cataclysmic event and much            
equity value had evaporated in the immediate aftermath. However, several        
policies prevented this from happening. Instead, we saw a surprisingly          
steady macroeconomic picture, thanks to monetary support and a rally in         
the Treasury market. With both fiscal stimulus and falling interest             
rates, capital markets began 2002 with some confidence.                         

However, some unfinished business from the buoyant period of the late           
1990s to 2000 had accumulated. Apart from usual company-specific                
challenges, some large and formerly favored sectors had begun to                
stumble, even after benefiting from a very aggressive investing climate.        
As they did so, it became apparent that problems deeper than those of           
management strategy and execution had occurred. Telecommunications,             
technology, deregulated utilities and energy trading, had been promising        
but faced some real, practical problems as 2002 unfolded.                       

Enron filed for bankruptcy protection late in 2001. The rot that was            
found to underlie that company created very profound implications for           
corporate financing, governance and investor confidence throughout 2002.        
In several situations, the accounting profession, a basic part of the           
infrastructure of the financial system, became suspect, hurting private         
sector capital markets. Confidence suffered badly, as a number of               
incidents in close succession caused markets to become very negative,           
which hurt valuations and the trading liquidity of corporate bonds.             

During the year, bond rating agencies became especially eager to bolster        
their credibility. Markets correctly anticipated that this defensiveness        
would affect vulnerable credits most severely. A chain of events started        
as several borderline issuers were downgraded to below investment grade,        
and lost their access to the commercial paper market. As they were              
forced to resort to bank backup lines of credit, a widespread move to           
extend debt maturities ensued, putting further pressure on corporate            
bonds in general. Other abuses became known. For example, when                  
accounting fraud at WorldCom was reported, that disclosure destroyed            
that company's finances, hurt the telecom sector, scarred many corporate        
bond investors and generally harmed the corporate bond sector. Positive         
returns for much of 2002 were due to declining Treasury yields rather           
than good news from the credit front.                                           

Despite all the negative events of the early part of 2002, corporate            
bonds rallied in the fourth quarter, as they became perceived as being          
undervalued. Catalysts were the Federal Reserve's reduction of                  
short-term interest rates, and the announcement of the acquisition of a

large, widely held but troubled finance issuer -- Household Finance --          
by the  managerially and financially strong HSBC.                               

In a year that became defined by event risk, the Fund did well. Success         
came from a few rather basic sources. The Fund's diversified portfolio          
was distributed across many industries and companies. In the aftermath          
of September 11th, economically cyclical industries such as automotive,         
retail, and manufacturing surprised everyone with their resilience and          
their bonds outperformed for much of the year. Most recently, as                
economic growth slowed, some of these holdings have given back some of          
their earlier gains. Defensive industries such as consumer nondurables,         
food, and food retailing performed their missions within the Fund,              
although market competition was intense in virtually all categories and         
allowed for few credit upgrades. Real estate investment trusts, many of         
which we bought last year, have proven resilient and are widely regarded        
as being good investments in a slowing economy.                                 

The negative performers were concentrated in a couple of deregulated            
industries: telecommunications and diversified energy companies. Here,          
the effects of difficult competition were compounded by corporate               
wrongdoing. Regulatory responses within industries, company-specific            
problems and a virtual stampede of sellers when bad news occurs, all            
combined to hurt many bonds this past year. We have been well served by         
often being among the earlier sellers when bonds held in the Fund               
encountered difficulties.                                                       

Looking ahead, much of the outlook is colored by the uncertainty about          
the war on terrorism and the probability of war with Iraq. The range of         
potential outcomes is wide. The drag on the economy caused by these             
uncertainties could persist, worsen or be removed. Regardless of the            
direction in which the economy and the market move, the Fund will               
continue to seek out investment grade corporate bonds that represent            
solid values.                                                                   

Thank you for making the Life Investment Grade Fund part of your                
investment strategy. As always, we appreciate the opportunity to serve          
your investment needs.

The graph compares a $10,000 investment in the First Investors Life         
Investment Grade Fund beginning 12/31/92 with a theoretical investment      
in the Lehman Brothers U.S. Credit Index. The Lehman Brothers U.S.          
Credit Index includes all publicly issued, fixed rate, nonconvertible       
investment grade dollar-denominated, S.E.C.-registered corporate debt.      
All issues have at least one year to maturity and an outstanding par        
value of at least $150 million. It is not possible to invest directly in    
this Index. In addition, the Index does not take into account fees and      
expenses that an investor would incur in purchasing securities in the       
Index. For purposes of the graph and the accompanying table, it is          
assumed that all dividends and distributions were reinvested.               

* The Average Annual Total Return figures are for the periods ended             
12/31/02. During the periods shown, some of the expenses of the Fund        
were waived or assumed. If such expenses had been paid by the Fund, the     
Average Annual Total Return for One Year, Five Years and Ten Years would    
have been 7.71%, 6.13% and 6.78%, respectively.                             

The returns shown do not reflect any sales charges, since the Fund sells    
its shares solely to variable annuity and/or variable life insurance        
subaccounts at net asset value. The returns do not reflect the fees and     
charges that an individual would pay in connection with an investment in    
a variable annuity or life contract or policy. Results represent past       
performance and do not indicate future results. Investment return and       
principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's       
shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.

Dear Investor:                                                                  

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Funds' returns on a net asset         
value basis were 15.1% for Target Maturity 2007, 18.9% for Target               
Maturity 2010 and 23.4% for Target Maturity 2015. During the period,            
Target Maturity 2007, Target Maturity 2010 and Target Maturity 2015             
declared dividends from net investment income of 69.0 cents, 64.8 cents         
and 47.3 cents per share, respectively.                                         

The Funds' investment objective is to seek a predictable compounded             
return for investors who hold the Funds until maturity. In order to meet        
this objective, the Funds are fully invested in high-quality zero coupon        
bonds. These bonds are very sensitive to changes in interest rates.             

The primary factor affecting the performance of the Funds was a large           
decline in interest rates during 2002. This decline resulted in                 
substantial total returns for the Target Maturity Funds. Reflecting the         
fact that longer maturity bonds are more sensitive to changes in                
interest rates, the Target Maturity 2007 Fund had the lowest return             
while the Target Maturity 2015 had the highest return.                          

Thank you for making the Life Target Maturity Funds part of your                
investment strategy. As always, we appreciate the opportunity to serve          
your investment needs.                                                          

Sincerely,

The graph compares a $10,000 investment in the First Investors Life         
Target Maturity 2007 Fund beginning 4/26/95 (inception date) with a         
theoretical investment in the Salomon Brothers Treasury/Government          
Sponsored Index. The Salomon Brothers Treasury/Government Index is a        
market capitalization-weighted Index that consists of debt issued by the    
U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government sponsored agencies. Every issue           
included in the Index is trader-priced, and the Index follows consistent    
and realistic availability limits, including only those securities with     
sufficient amounts outstanding. It is not possible to invest directly in    
this Index. In addition, the Index does not take into account fees and      
expenses that an investor would incur in purchasing securities in the       
Index. For purposes of the graph and the accompanying table, it is          
assumed that all dividends and distributions were reinvested.               

* The Average Annual Total Return figures are for the periods ended             
12/31/02. During the periods shown, some or all of the expenses of the      
Fund were waived or assumed. If such expenses had been paid by the Fund,    
the Average Annual Total Return for One Year, Five Years and Since          
Inception would have been 14.94%, 8.38% and 9.63%, respectively.            

The returns shown do not reflect any sales charges, since the Fund sells    
its shares solely to variable annuity and/or variable life insurance        
subaccounts at net asset value. The returns do not reflect the fees and     
charges that an individual would pay in connection with an investment in    
a variable annuity or life contract or policy. Results represent past       
performance and do not indicate future results. Investment return and       
principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's       
shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.

The graph compares a $10,000 investment in the First Investors Life         
Target Maturity 2010 Fund beginning 4/30/96 (inception date) with a         
theoretical investment in the Salomon Brothers Treasury/Government          
Sponsored Index. The Salomon Brothers Treasury/Government Sponsored         
Index is a market capitalization-weighted Index that consists of debt       
issued by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government sponsored agencies.         
Every issue included in the Index is trader-priced, and the Index           
follows consistent and realistic availability limits, including only        
those securities with sufficient amounts outstanding. It is not possible    
to invest directly in this Index. In addition, the Index does not take      
into account fees and expenses that an investor would incur in              
purchasing securities in the Index. For purposes of the graph and the       
accompanying table, it is assumed that all dividends and distributions      
were reinvested.                                                            

* The Average Annual Total Return figures are for the periods ended         
12/31/02. During the periods shown, some of the expenses of the Fund        
were waived or assumed. If such expenses had been paid by the Fund, the     
Average Annual Total Return for One Year, Five Years and Since Inception    
would have been 18.73%, 8.71% and 10.62%, respectively.                     

The returns shown do not reflect any sales charges, since the Fund sells    
its shares solely to variable annuity and/or variable life insurance        
subaccounts at net asset value. The returns do not reflect the fees and     
charges that an individual would pay in connection with an investment in    
a variable annuity or life contract or policy. Results represent past       
performance and do not indicate future results. Investment return and       
principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's       
shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.    
Salomon Brothers Treasury/Government Sponsored Index figures are from       
Salomon Brothers and all other figures are from First Investors

The graph compares a $10,000 investment in the First Investors Life         
Target Maturity 2015 Fund beginning 11/8/99 (inception date) with a         
theoretical investment in the Salomon Brothers Treasury/Government          
Sponsored Index. The Salomon Brothers Treasury/Government Sponsored         
Index is a market capitalization-weighted Index that consists of debt       
issued by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government sponsored agencies.         
Every issue included in the Index is trader-priced, and the Index           
follows consistent and realistic availability limits, including only        
those securities with sufficient amounts outstanding. It is not possible    
to invest directly in this Index. In addition, the Index does not take      
into account fees and expenses that an investor would incur in              
purchasing securities in the Index. For purposes of the graph and the       
accompanying table, it is assumed that all dividends and distributions      
were reinvested.                                                            

* The Average Annual Total Return figures are for the periods ended             
12/31/02. During the periods shown, some of the expenses of the Fund        
were waived or assumed. If such expenses had been paid by the Fund, the     
Average Annual Total Return for One Year and Since Inception would have     
been 23.21% and 13.09%, respectively.                                       

The returns shown do not reflect any sales charges, since the Fund sells    
its shares solely to variable annuity and/or variable life insurance        
subaccounts at net asset value. The returns do not reflect the fees and     
charges that an individual would pay in connection with an investment in    
a variable annuity or life contract or policy. Results represent past       
performance and do not indicate future results. Investment return and       
principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's       
shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.

FIRST INVESTORS LIFE VALUE FUND                                                 

Dear Investor:                                                                  

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Fund's return on a net asset          
value basis was -21.6%. During the period, the Fund declared dividends          
from net investment income of 26.9 cents per share.                             

Effective December 31, 2002, the Fund was changed into a general "value"        
fund  that focuses on total return and does not concentrate in utilities        
or any other sector. Therefore, the Fund's name has changed from the            
Life Utilities Income Fund to the Life Value Fund. The transition of its        
holdings began in December.                                                     

Since the Fund operated as the Life Utilities Income Fund in 2002, it           
was subject  to the utilities sector's harsh climate. It was a difficult        
year as the electric, gas and telecommunications industries all produced        
negative returns. Shareholders may wonder why a historically stable             
sector of the stock market has performed so poorly over the past couple         
of years. Headline issues such as the California energy crisis, power           
and natural gas market manipulation, and the alleged accounting fraud at        
companies like Enron and WorldCom tell only part of the tale.                   

A big reason for the increased volatility in the sector is the                  
deregulation activity that has occurred over the last several years.            
Business risk has increased, as companies in each of the three major            
utilities subsectors have had to adjust to a more competitive                   
environment.                                                                    

In recent years, many utilities management teams invested capital in            
unregulated businesses in an effort to enhance their growth prospects.          
Several electric and gas utilities built or bought unregulated power            
plants and engaged in extensive power  and gas trading operations.              
Subsequently, the power generation market suffered from oversupply. The         
trading business has all but evaporated due to increased credit risk,  a        
lack of a solid regulatory framework, and, in some cases, the unethical         
behavior of market participants.                                                

The telecommunications industry has had its own share of difficulties.          
Fierce competition has continued to take its toll on long distance and          
wireless companies. Even the regional Bells have been humbled. A weak           
economy erased earnings growth, while wireless substitution and                 
competition from high-speed cable modems have nibbled away at the Bells'        
stable local franchise.                                                         

Going forward, the new investment objective of the Fund will result in          
reduced sector risk and increased flexibility to adjust to tough market         
conditions. The Fund will maintain its focus on dividend-paying                 
companies.                                                                      

Thank you for making the Life Value Fund part of your investment                
strategy. As always, we appreciate the opportunity to serve your                
investment needs.                                                               

Sincerely,

The graph compares a $10,000 investment in the First Investors Life         
Value Fund beginning 11/15/93 (inception date) with theoretical             
investments in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Standard & Poor's    
500 Utilities Index. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is an unmanaged        
capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks designed to measure             
performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the            
aggregate market value of such stocks, which represent all major            
industries. The Standard & Poor's 500 Utilities Index is a                  
capitalization-weighted index of 37 stocks designed to measure the          
performance of the utility sector of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. It    
is not possible to invest directly in these Indices. In addition, the       
Indices do not take into account fees and expenses that an investor         
would incur in purchasing securities in the Indices. For purposes of the    
graph and the accompanying table, it is assumed that all dividends and      
distributions were reinvested.                                              

* The Average Annual Total Return figures are for the periods ended             
12/31/02. During certain of the periods shown, some or all of the           
expenses of the Fund were waived or assumed. If such expenses had been      
paid by the Fund, the Average Annual Total Return for Five Years and        
Since Inception would have been (3.90%) and 3.13%, respectively.            

The returns shown do not reflect any sales charges, since the Fund sells    
its shares solely to variable annuity and/or variable life insurance        
subaccounts at net asset value. The returns do not reflect the fees and     
charges that an individual would pay in connection with an investment in    
a variable annuity or life contract or policy. Results represent past       
performance and do not indicate future results. Investment return and       
principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's       
shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.    
Standard & Poor's 500 Index and Standard & Poor's 500 Utilities Index       
figures are from Standard & Poor's and all other figures are from First     
Investors Management Company, Inc.                                          

+ Prior to 12/31/02, the Fund invested primarily in securities issued           
by companies in the utilities industry. After this year, we will not        
show a comparison to the Standard & Poor's 500 Utilities Index.

Notes to Financial Statements                                                   
December 31, 2002                                                               

1. Significant Accounting Policies--First Investors Life Series Fund            
(the "Life Series Fund"), a Massachusetts business trust, is registered         
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as an                
open-ended management investment company. The Life Series Fund operates         
as a series fund, issuing shares of beneficial interest in the Blue             
Chip, Cash Management, Discovery, Focused Equity, Government, Growth,           
High Yield, International Securities, Investment Grade, Target Maturity         
2007, Target Maturity 2010, Target Maturity 2015, and Value (formerly           
Utilities Income) Funds (each a "Fund") and accounts separately for its         
assets, liabilities and operations. The objective of each Fund is as            
follows:                                                                        

Blue Chip Fund seeks high total investment return consistent with the           
preservation of capital.                                                        

Cash Management Fund seeks to earn a high rate of current income                
consistent with the preservation of capital and maintenance of                  
liquidity.                                                                      

Discovery Fund seeks long-term growth of capital without regard to              
dividend or interest income.                                                    

Focused Equity Fund seeks capital appreciation.                                 

Government Fund seeks to achieve a significant level of current income          
which is consistent with security and liquidity of principal.                   

Growth Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation.                               

High Yield Fund primarily seeks high current income and secondarily             
seeks capital appreciation.                                                     

International Securities Fund primarily seeks long-term capital growth          
and secondarily a reasonable level of current income.                           

Investment Grade Fund seeks to generate a maximum level of income               
consistent with investment in investment grade debt securities.                 

Target Maturity 2007, Target Maturity 2010 and Target Maturity 2015             
Funds seek a predictable compounded investment return for investors who         
hold their Fund shares until the Fund's maturity, consistent with the           
preservation of capital.                                                        

Value Fund seeks total return.                                                  

A. Security Valuation--Except as provided below, a security listed or           
traded on an exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market is valued at its last          
sale price on the exchange or market where the security is principally          
traded, and lacking any sales, the security is valued at the mean               
between the closing bid and asked prices. Securities traded in the              
over-the-counter ("OTC") market (including securities listed on                 
exchanges whose primary market is believed to be OTC) are valued at the         
mean between the last bid and asked prices prior to the time when assets        
are valued based upon quotes furnished by a market maker for such               
securities. Securities may also be priced by a pricing service. The             
pricing service uses quotations obtained from investment dealers or             
brokers, information with respect to market transactions in comparable          
securities and other available information in determining value.                
Short-term debt securities that mature in 60 days or less are valued at         
amortized cost. Securities for which market quotations are not readily          
available and other assets are valued on a consistent basis at fair             
value as determined in good faith by or under the supervision of the            
Life Series Fund's officers in the manner specifically authorized by the        
Board of Trustees of the Life Series Fund. At December 31, 2002, the            
High Yield Fund held five securities that were fair valued by its               
Valuation Committee with an aggregate value of $225,584 representing            
..46% of the Fund's net assets. For valuation purposes, where applicable,       
quotations of foreign securities in foreign currencies are translated to        
U.S. dollar equivalents using the foreign exchange quotation in effect.         

The Cash Management Fund values its portfolio securities in accordance          
with the amortized cost method of valuation under Rule 2a-7 under the           
1940 Act. Amortized cost is an approximation of market value of an              
instrument, whereby the difference between its acquisition cost and             
value at maturity is amortized on a straight-line basis over the                
remaining life of the instrument. The effect of changes in the market           
value of a security as a result of fluctuating interest rates is not            
taken into account and thus the amortized cost method of valuation may          
result in the value of a security being higher or lower than its actual         
market value.                                                                   

B. Federal Income Tax--No provision has been made for federal income            
taxes on net income or capital gains since it is the policy of each Fund        
to continue to comply with the special provisions of the Internal               
Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies, and to make          
sufficient distributions of income and capital gains (in excess of any          
available capital loss carryovers), to relieve each Fund from all, or           
substantially all, federal income taxes. At December 31, 2002, capital          
loss carryovers were as follows:

C. Foreign Currency Translations--The accounting records of                     
International Securities Fund are maintained in U.S. dollars. Portfolio         
securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign              
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the date of valuation.           
Purchases and sales of investment securities, dividend income and               
certain expenses are translated to U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange        
prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions.                        

The International Securities Fund does not isolate that portion of gains        
and losses on investments which is due to changes in foreign exchange           
rates from that which is due to changes in market prices of the                 
investments. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized and           
unrealized gains and losses from investments.                                   

Net realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency                
transactions includes gains and losses from the sales of foreign                
currency and gains and losses on accrued foreign dividends and related          
withholding taxes.                                                              

D. Distributions to Shareholders--Distributions to Shareholders from net        
investment income and net realized capital gains are generally declared         
and paid annually on all Funds, except for the Cash Management Fund             
which declares dividends from the total of net investment income (plus          
or minus all realized short-term gains and losses on investments) daily         
and pays monthly. Dividends from net investment income and capital gain         
distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations          
which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the           
United States of America. These differences are primarily due to                
differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, capital loss            
carryforwards and deferral of wash sales.                                       

E. Expense Allocation--Expenses directly charged or attributable to a           
Fund are paid from the assets of that Fund. General expenses of the Life        
Series Fund are allocated among and charged to the assets of each Fund          
on a fair and equitable basis, which may be based on the relative assets        
of each Fund or the nature of the services performed and relative               
applicability to each Fund.                                                     

F. Repurchase Agreements--Securities pledged as collateral for                  
repurchase agreements are held by the Fund's custodian until maturity of        
the repurchase agreement. The agreements provide that the Fund will             
receive, as collateral, securities with a market value which will at all        
times be equal to at least 100% of the amount invested by the Fund.             

G. Use of Estimates--The preparation of the financial statements in             
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United          
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions         
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date          
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and             
expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from           
those estimates.                                                                

H. Other--Security transactions are accounted for on the date the               
securities are purchased or sold. Cost is determined and gains and              
losses are based, on the identified cost basis for securities, for both         
financial statement and federal income tax purposes. Dividend income is         
recorded on the ex-dividend date. Shares of stock received in lieu of           
cash dividends on certain preferred stock holdings of the High Yield            
Fund are recognized as dividend income and recorded at the market value         
of the shares received. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the High          
Yield Fund recognized $12,935, from these taxable "pay-in-kind"                 
distributions. Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily.        
Bond premiums and discounts are amortized/accreted using the interest           
method. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Bank of New York,

4. Advisory Fee and Other Transactions With Affiliates--Certain officers        
and trustees of the Life Series Fund are officers and directors of its          
investment adviser, First Investors Management Company, Inc. ("FIMCO")          
and/or its transfer agent, Administrative Data Management Corp. Trustees        
of the Life Series Fund who are not "interested persons" of the Life            
Series Fund as defined in the 1940 Act are remunerated by the Funds. For        
the year ended December 31, 2002, total trustees fees accrued by the            
Funds amounted to $50,900.                                                      

The Investment Advisory Agreement provides as compensation to FIMCO an          
annual fee, payable monthly, at the rate of .75% on the first $250              
million of each Fund's average daily net assets, declining by .03% on           
each $250 million thereafter, down to .66% on average daily net assets          
over $750 million. For the year ended December 31, 2002, total advisory         
fees accrued to FIMCO were $6,024,444 of which $175,220 was waived by           
the investment adviser. In addition, other expenses in the amount of            
$15,444 were assumed by FIMCO.                                                  

Wellington Management Company, LLP serves as investment subadviser to           
the Focused Equity Fund, Growth Fund and the International Securities           
Fund. The subadviser is paid by FIMCO and not by the Funds.                     

5. Rule 144A Securities--Under Rule 144A, certain restricted securities         
are exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of          
1933 and may only be resold to qualified institutional investors. At            
December 31, 2002, the Cash Management Fund held eight 144A securities          
with an aggregate value of $3,091,678 representing 22.6% of the Fund's          
net assets, the High Yield Fund held eleven 144A securities with an             
aggregate value of $2,459,549 representing 5.0% of the Fund's net assets        
and the Investment Grade Fund held five 144A securities with an                 
aggregate value of $1,424,858 representing 4.2% of the Fund's net               
assets. These securities are valued as set forth in Note 1A.                    

6. Forward Currency Contracts and Futures Contracts--A forward currency         
contract is an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency for an        
agreed-upon price at a future date. When the International Securities           
Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it customarily enters into a         
forward currency contract to minimize foreign exchange risk between the         
trade date and the settlement date of such transactions. The                    
International Securities Fund could be exposed to risk if                       
counter-parties to the contracts are unable to meet the terms of their          
contracts or if the value of the foreign currency changes unfavorably.          

The International Securities Fund had the following forward currency            
contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002:

Initial margin deposits required upon entering into futures contracts           
are satisfied by the segregation of specific securities or cash, and/or         
by securing a standby letter of credit from a major commercial bank, as         
collateral, for the account of the broker (the Fund's agent in acquiring        
the futures position). During the period the futures contract is open,          
changes in the value of the contract are recognized as unrealized gains         
or losses by "marking to market" on a daily basis to reflect the market         
value of the contract at the end of each day's trading. Variation margin        
payments are made or received depending upon whether unrealized gains or        
losses are incurred. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a            
realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the proceeds from         
(or cost of) the closing transaction and the Fund's basis in the                
contract. The Fund may purchase or sell stock index futures contracts as        
a hedge against changes in market conditions. Risk includes the                 
possibility of an illiquid market and that a change in the value of the         
contract may not correlate with changes in the securities being hedged.         
At December 31, 2002, U.S. Treasury Bills with a market value of                
$334,423 were pledged to cover margin requirements for futures                  
contracts. Open futures contracts at December 31, 2002 were:

7. Concentration of Credit Risk--The High Yield Fund's investment in            
high yield securities, whether rated or unrated, may be considered              
speculative and subject to greater market fluctuations and risks of loss        
of income and principal than lower-yielding, higher-rated, fixed-income         
securities. The risk of loss due to default by the issuer may be                
significantly greater for the holders of high yielding securities,              
because such securities are generally unsecured and are often                   
subordinated to other creditors of the issuer.                                  

8. Tax Components of Capital and Distributions to Shareholders--The tax         
character of distributions declared for the years ended December 31,

To the Shareholders and Trustees of                                             
First Investors Life Series Fund                                                

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,           
including the portfolios of investments, of the thirteen Funds                  
comprising First Investors Life Series Fund as of December 31, 2002, the        
related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statement          
of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then           
ended, and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated           
thereon. These financial statements and financial highlights are the            
responsibility of the Life Series Fund's management. Our responsibility         
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial            
highlights based on our audits.                                                 

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally         
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that          
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about              
whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of           
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,            
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial                
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as         
of December 31, 2002, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers.         
Where brokers have not replied to our confirmation requests, we have            
carried out other appropriate auditing procedures. An audit also                
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant               
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall                 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a          
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights               
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the                 
financial position of each of the thirteen Funds comprising First               
Investors Life Series Fund as of December 31, 2002, and the results of          
their operations for the year then ended, changes in their net assets           
for each of the two years in the period then ended and their financial          
highlights for the periods presented, in conformity with accounting             
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The Cash Management Fund is a money market fund and seeks to maintain a         
stable net asset value of $1.00 per share. However, there can be no             
assurance that the Fund will be able to do so or achieve its investment         
objective. An investment in the Fund is neither insured nor guaranteed          
by the U.S. Government.                                                         

It is the Funds' practice to mail only one copy of their annual and             
semi-annual reports to any address at which more than one shareholder           
with the same last name has indicated that mail is to be delivered.             
Additional copies of the reports will be mailed if requested by any             
shareholder in writing or by calling 800-423-4026. The Funds will ensure        
that separate reports are sent to any shareholder who subsequently              
changes his or her mailing address.                                             

This report is authorized for distribution only to existing                     
shareholders, and, if given to prospective shareholders, must be                
accompanied or preceded by the Funds' prospectus.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
