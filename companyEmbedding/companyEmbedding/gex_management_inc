DIGITAL Marketing
 







DIGITAL Marketing
 



Old school forms of media, such as print advertising, newspaper ads, magazine ads, etc. are becoming relics of a past world, much like the horse and buggy. In order to stay competitive, it is important that businesses have a serious approach to digital marketing. If your business does not have a digital presence that is being actively managed and maintained, you are doing a disservice to your organization. GEX Management has an internal team that creates content and targets your specific demographic in order to increase sales for your company. Logo and Brand DesignClient Relationship ManagementWeb-Based Client DatabaseStrategic, Written Marketing PlanOverall Website OptimizationSocial Media Marketing Implementation










Information Technology
 







Information Technology
 



Information Technology (IT) covers a large range of areas for a company. Unfortunately, most people view IT as simply the department that fixes computers when they break, as opposed to a strategic business unit for the company. Our holistic approach to IT takes all  business operations into consideration. We implement specific IT tools that support the overall company mission. Here are some of the ares that we focus on:Data Access and Security SolutionsCloud-Based Storage ImplementationOngoing Software MaintenanceBusiness Process Creating and ManagementEmail and Server MigrationWeb-Based Database Implementation/ManagementImprove Web HostingHardware Review and Consulting










Strategic Business Consulting
 







Strategic Business Consulting
 



It's easy to get caught up in day-to-day routines in business and find your business in a spot where things are being done because that's what's always been done, as opposed to doing what's best for your company overall. Having an experienced outside perspective can make all the the difference and take your company to the next level. Our team takes the time to learn about your company and overall goals. We help strategize and implement strategic initiatives that focus on increasing your bottom line. We also give you access to a virtual board. This board is made up of experts in a variety of fields and is available to give insight into your business processes and to help grow your company.  Goal SessionsCompany Operation TroubleshootingLeadership DevelopmentStrategic PlanningAccess to a Virtual BoardMission Statement and Values Discovery










Medical Practice Management
 







Medical Practice Management
 



Most doctors didn't get into the medical field because they wanted to run a business - they did it because they love helping people. Our practice management solutions allow doctors to focus on doing what they do best, while we work alongside them as their outsourced Operations Officer to make sure everyone gets paid, bills go out on time, and patients, as well as employees, are being managed. In addition to everything above, below is a list of additional services we provide to our medical clients:Batch process patient billingProcess credit cardsGenerate payment plan statementsTrack follow-up historyManage collection lettersPinpoint & resolve A/R issuesElectronic ERAsSubmit, review & edit claimsEMR for iPad, Android & WindowsPM: Demographics, Schedule & Check In/OutPatient PortalHIPAA Compliant / SSL SecurityAppointment Reminders: Text & EmailMedical Voice Dictation (Speech-to-Text)Centralized Medical BillingPatient statementsSend soft collection letters

DALLAS, June 28, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GEX Management, Inc.’s (OTCQB:GXXM) Chief Operating Officer, Chelsea Christopherson, published an article in Forbes entitled, “How Leaders and Managers Unknowingly Suppress Their Team Members.”  As one of the youngest women to be an Officer and Director of a public company, Mrs. Christopherson discusses her personal experiences, as well as various situations she has witnessed in which managers suppress, albeit sometimes inadvertently, their own team members.  Mrs. Christopherson details these instances in this article and provides suggestions about how managers can avoid these common missteps that can stifle a project, or even lead to employee morale issues.     “I hope that writing about my experiences and what I have observed, at the executive and managerial levels, will provide other business leaders with some simple concepts that can help their team members reach their full potential, and potentially lead to a higher project success rate,” said Mrs. Christopherson.To view this article in its entirety please visit: https://www.forbes.com/sites/yec/2017/06/27/how-leaders-and-managers-unknowingly-suppress-their-team-members/Previous publication in Forbes: https://www.forbes.com/sites/yec/2016/12/13/four-strategies-for-boosting-productivity-and-increasing-daily-output/#7a89fb366d80About GEX Management, Inc.:GEX Management, Inc. is a licensed Professional Employer Organization (PEO) and a Professional Services Company that provides comprehensive back office services to our clients in a variety of industries.

The total cost of the offering is estimated to be $27,831 if the minimum is
sold, or $41,451 if the maximum is sold consisting primarily of legal,
accounting and blue sky fees (the fees charged by regulatory agencies or states
with regard to this offering).

The following table sets forth how we anticipate using the proceeds from selling
common stock in this offering, reflecting the minimum and maximum subscription
amounts:

                                                                      $600,000          $1,500,000  
                                            $300,000 Minimum         Midpoint           Maximum    
Legal, Accounting & Printing Expenses      $         21,500        $   28,500        $     30,500  
Other Offering Expenses                               6,331             8,376              10,951  
Net Proceeds to Company                             272,169           863,124           1,458,549  
TOTAL                                      $        300,000        $  900,000        $  1,500,000  

The following describes each of the expense categories:

• Legal, accounting and printing expense is the estimated costs associated with  
  this offering. As more shares are sold, we anticipate legal fees to increase   
  due to the likelihood of investors being from other states, which could result 
  in state blue sky securities filings. Although our legal fees are not          
  contingent on the number of shares sold, it is likely that the legal fees will 
  increase as our attorney will charge us for these filings. Also, as more shares
  are sold, our printing expenses will increase.                                 

• Other offering expenses include the Securities and Exchange Commission         
  registration fee, blue sky fees and miscellaneous expenses with regards to this
  offering. The blue sky fees are fees charged by the states to pay for          
  registering to sell securities in various states, which vary by state, as well 
  as additional legal fees.                                                      

The following table sets forth how we anticipate using the net proceeds to the
Company:

                                                    $900,000     
                               $300,000 Minimum     Midpoint      $1,500,000 Maximum 
Marketing/Advertising         $          5,000     $  10,500     $           30,000  
Additional Staffing                    150,000       350,000                500,000  
Salaries, commissions                  100,000       150,000                200,000  
General corporate overhead*             17,169       352,624                728,549  
Proceeds to company           $        272,169     $ 863,124     $        1,458,549  
 
* General Corporate overhead includes office rent, office supplies, utilities,
taxes, and any other expense incurred in the normal course of business.

We do not intend to use any of the proceeds to pay off debts owed by the
Company. Additionally, we intend that all amounts allocated for
salaries/commissions will be for new hires and not for officers or directors of
the company. For a more detailed discussion of the use of proceeds, the reader
is referred to the Management’s Discussion and Plan of Operation section of this
offering.

The categories above describe the intended use of proceeds from this offering.
However, the Company reserves the right to use the proceeds raised in this
offering in other categories and amounts in the best judgement and discretion of
the management of the Company.

The proceeds from this offering will enable the Company to further develop its
service-based business model which, in turn, provides access to markets that are
currently unreachable. We plan to expand our service-based business through
integrated marketing campaigns which include: social media, our personal
relationships, and current client referrals.

Social Media: We plan to utilize sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter to
reach audiences internationally that can use our services.

Personal Relationships: The three officers of GEX have numerous relationships
with professions that generally have small practices and need back office and
administration support. We intend to reach out to all of our personal
relationships to expand the business to these potential clients.


The back office and employee/employer administration industry, including the
Professional Employer Organizations (PEO) and Administrative Services
Organizations (ASO), is highly fragmented, resulting in intense competition.
Competition affects our ability to succeed in both the market segments we
currently serve and new market segments that we may enter in the future. We
compete with several large back office and administration companies, as well as
PEOs and ASOs that provide the same services we provide, but also provide
additional services. These companies may have greater financial, marketing, and
other resources than we do. Competition in our industry is based primarily on
quality of service to the customer, price, and new and improved innovative
services offerings.


Company Description
GEX Management, Inc. was originally formed in 2004 as Group Excellence
Management, LLC. d/b/a MyEasyHQ. In March of 2016 it was converted from a
limited liability company into a corporation and changed its name to GEX
Management, Inc. in April of 2016.

Carl Dorvil founded a company called Group


 Excellence, LLC out of his dorm room
at Southern Methodist University in 2004. Group Excellence provided tutoring and
mentoring to students with the goal of inspiring kids to achieve excellence. The
company quickly grew to more than six hundred employees. Through this rapid
growth, midway through 2004, Mr. Dorvil realized that he had two businesses on
his hands. One was the tutoring and mentoring business, and the other was the
back office business that was handling the day-to-day operations of his company.
This back office business provided Group Excellence, LLC with human resources,
IT, accounting/bookkeeping, social media, payroll, and conducted a majority of
the overall operations of the company. Mr. Dorvil then decided to separate the
two businesses. GEX Management was formed to continue the back office
operations, and Group Excellence, LLC went on to become an Inc. 500 company,
provided over 800,000 hours of tutoring to students around the country, and
created over 2,000 jobs. Mr. Dorvil sold his tutoring business, Group
Excellence, LLC, in 2011 butcontinued to own and operate GEX Management, which
continued as a Professional Services Company that provided back office support
to the tutoring company, as well as third-parties that needed these services. In
2016 GEX restructured its business model in order to grow the business, and to
provide the same quality of support that it has for the last twelve years to its
clients.

As a Professional Services Company, GEX offers progressive and complete
solutions for our customer’s back office and administration needs. These
services include: digital marketing and sales, IT support and consultation,
accounting and bookkeeping, human resources, general business consulting,
staffing and software and billing services specifically for the medical
industry. The specific services in each of these categories are further
described below:

Digital Marketing and Sales:

We work continuously to expand our service offerings to our clients in order to
help them achieve their personal business goals. Our unique approach that allows
customized service options for our clients, and our wide array of services that
we offer allows our company to differentiate itself from other back office and
administrative companies. We also pride ourselves on constant client interaction
to ensure that we are providing not only the best support, but the right support
to help them achieve their individual goals.

When our staff meets with a potential client they ask them what keeps them up at
night. In other words, what services can we provide so that they can focus on
what they do best. Many businesses are complex and require people with
specialized skills to keep up with current regulation, customer relations,
marketing and public relations, and bookkeeping and accounting. It can be very
costly for a small or even mid-sized business to hire people to focus on all of
these different roles. Our company already has the staff in place with many
years of knowledge in these areas, and for a fraction of the cost we can provide
these same services for a fraction of the price.

Clients typically will sign a three month service agreement with the Company,
which serves as an evaluation period for both the client and the company to
ensure a good working relationship is established. If the client feels the
Company’s services are benefitting them, and if the Company feels that they’ve
established a good working relationship with the client then both the client and
the Company will generally enter into a six month to yearlong contract.

GEX Management, Inc. Chief Operating Officer Discusses Management And Leadership Topic In Forbes






GlobeNewswire



Jun 28, 2017 9:00 AM EDT













 


















































 DALLAS, June 28, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GEX Management, Inc.'s (OTCQB:GXXM) Chief Operating Officer, Chelsea Christopherson, published an article in Forbes entitled, "How Leaders and Managers Unknowingly Suppress Their Team Members."  As one of the youngest women to be an Officer and Director of a public company, Mrs. Christopherson discusses her personal experiences, as well as various situations she has witnessed in which managers suppress, albeit sometimes inadvertently, their own team members.  Mrs. Christopherson details these instances in this article and provides suggestions about how managers can avoid these common missteps that can stifle a project, or even lead to employee morale issues.      "I hope that writing about my experiences and what I have observed, at the executive and managerial levels, will provide other business leaders with some simple concepts that can help their team members reach their full potential, and potentially lead to a higher project success rate," said Mrs. Christopherson. To view this article in its entirety please visit: https://www.forbes.com/sites/yec/2017/06/27/how-leaders-and-managers-unknowingly-suppress-their-team-members/ Previous publication in Forbes: https://www.forbes.com/sites/yec/2016/12/13/four-strategies-for-boosting-productivity-and-increasing-daily-output/#7a89fb366d80  About GEX Management, Inc.:  GEX Management, Inc. is a licensed Professional Employer Organization (PEO) and a Professional Services Company that provides comprehensive back office services to our clients in a variety of industries.
