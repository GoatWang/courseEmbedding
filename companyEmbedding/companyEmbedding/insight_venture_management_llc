Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Planview, which is backed by Insight Venture Partners, has acquired Troux, an enterprise solutions provider. No financial terms were disclosed. Lazard was financial advisor to Troux on the transaction.
PRESS RELEASE
AUSTIN, TEXAS – May 21, 2015 Planview® has acquired Troux™ to advance the company’s IT portfolio management offering and enable CIOs and other IT leaders to effectively manage the strategy and business of IT. Bringing together Planview and Troux represents the industry’s first combination of market leading Project Portfolio Management (PPM) and Enterprise Architecture (EA) solutions. Together, these solutions provide IT leaders with a comprehensive approach that integrates strategic planning and execution with complete insight into architecture and technology.
Today’s IT organizations are under pressure given the escalating dynamics of the digital business economy. IT leaders continuously need to optimize all of their resources – people, finances, applications, services, products and technology. As a result, Enterprise Architects are transforming into champions of business outcomes, orchestrating technology and business model change through roadmaps and managing application and service portfolios.
Similarly, the role of project management offices (PMOs) is transitioning to focus on continuous portfolio planning to adjust priorities and ensure resources and work are delivering the most value to internal and external customers. As the Enterprise Architect and PMO roles evolve, there is an increased need to manage resources in one IT portfolio that optimizes across strategy, execution, and architecture. 





“The traditional goal of IT alignment with the business is simply not good enough in today’s technology-driven economy,” said Gregory S. Gilmore, CEO of Planview. “Driving innovation and accelerating strategic and business outcomes must be the charter for IT. With Troux as part of Planview, we are taking portfolio management to the next level by giving IT leaders a way to manage one integrated portfolio that optimizes their resources for maximum business impact.”
With the acquisition of Troux, the newly combined entity creates a $150 million global company with close to 600 employees and more than 1000 enterprise customers. The Planview product line now spans project collaboration, resource and portfolio management, and enterprise architecture solutions.
“Joining Planview sets the stage for the next chapter for Troux and its customers,” said David Hood, CEO of Troux. “Planview is the right partner to take Troux forward. Our solutions are perfect complements and will provide a great combination for today’s IT leaders who are looking to integrate planning, execution, and architecture.”
By acquiring Troux, Planview continues its transformation as a provider of solutions to the enterprise, mid-sized organizations and teams. The company’s acquisition of Projectplace in 2014 brought to life its “No Matter How You Work” approach, which combines resource and portfolio management with project collaboration solutions to help IT and Lines of Business understand how their resources are being used across the organization. 





Lazard served as financial advisor to Troux.
About Planview

From small teams to large enterprises, leaders in every industry rely on the company’s cloud solutions to empower organizations to reach their goals and drive results by optimizing the capacity of their people and financial resources.
