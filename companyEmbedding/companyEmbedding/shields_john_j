Take A Tour








Bespoke Timber Buildings
John Shields and his team at Shields Buildings produce quality bespoke timber buildings in all shapes and sizes. They have been designing, crafting and installing garden buildings, sheds, studios, garages and workshops since 1991. The business is run from an ancient farm in a valley on the edge of Dartmoor in mid-Devon, South West England, situated in the home that has been part of his family since John’s great-grandfather, Ernest May, bought it in 1916. 
With vast experience, Shields Buildings has become the foremost supplier of timber buildings in Devon and throughout Cornwall, Somerset and Dorset. Product quality and service underpin everything they do and John and his team possess the rare ability to interpret a customer’s requirement and translate it into their dream outdoor space using materials and designs which are proven to stand the test of time.
Comprehensive Range of Beautiful Timber Buildings
The comprehensive range of beautiful timber buildings are used as anything from a simple garden shed to art studios, workshops, summerhouse for garden entertaining, storage and displays for model trains, gyms, garages for classic cars or home office space.
With one simple quote the timber building can be built, delivered and installed in as little as eight weeks, with a reliable delivery service all offered as part of the job.
Shields Buildings also work on turnkey projects offering a complete service including planning permission applications, site clearance, base work, building design, delivery and construction; ensuring that the process is as smooth and hassle-free as possible.
A range of the timber buildings are available to view at the Shields Buildings site, easily accessed on the A3124 between North Tawton and Whiddon Down. Equally, many of our buildings are purchased both as standard and bespoke after viewing the product descriptions online.
Lifestyle Timber Buildings;
Timber Studios are top of the range lifestyle timber buildings, with an apex roof and vaulted ceiling giving you a spacious extra room. Fully insulated and with uPVC windows and doors – they really are the ultimate in timber garden buildings. If you prefer, the windows and doors can be in wood
Timber Offices are fully insulated and can have a pent or low profile apex roof. You can choose to have either uPVC or wooden windows and door – a warm and practical solution for working from home
Timber Summerhouses have glazed doors and deep windows for a light airy feel. Inside the walls are lined pine with tongue and groove pine – giving you a bright, natural garden room
Garden Buildings;
Timber Workshops buildings and Sheds are non-insulated buildings with a choice of a pent or low profile apex roof – robust everyday buildings for storage and hobbies
Car Parking Shelters;
Bespoke Garages and Carports can be single, double, triple, open fronted or enclosed, the choice is yours! A workshop can be integrated into your building, or a log store added – the answer to all your vehicle and storage needs
Timber Outbuildings;
Stables in a choice of layouts to suit you, straight row, L-shape or U-shape. A tack room and hay or feed store can also be included – giving your horse the very best
