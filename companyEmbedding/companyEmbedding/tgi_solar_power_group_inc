Best brands of solar panels
To find the best brands of solar panels you can use America's most trusterd solar panel comparison and reviews website, SolarReviews.
However, reviews of solar panels can be a bit meaningless because most consumer owners have not had any issues and so whilst solar company reviews are very important when choosing solar installers they are of less use when choosing solar panels.

How much electricity will solar panels produce in California
Solar panels produce different amounts of energy in different locations.
Around the Sacramento area solar panels installed on a south facing 29 degree pitch roof will typically produce:
1,550 kWh per year per 1kw of peak DC (direct current) capacity
For more information about how your location, roof direction and roof tilt affects solar power production use the solar panels calculator and enter your address below.









What rebates, solar tax credits and other solar incentives are available in California
What solar incentives and tax credits are available in California?
The main incentives to install solar in California is the 30% federal solar tax credit and the net metering law.
The upfront utility based incentives from each of the main publically owned utilities are now exhausted for residential customers and almost exhausted for commercial customers.
However, the investment case for buying solar panels for your home has never been stronger because reductions in the price of solar systems has more than compensated for the loss of some upfront rebates.
 

 
Net Metering in California
The California Public Utility Commission voted by a narrow majority of 3 to 2 to extend the ability of residential energy customers in California to be credited with full retail rates for excess solar power that they generate and feed back into the grid at times when the electrical loads in their house are less than their solar production.
Whilst this didn't affect people that had already had installed solar panels on their homes in California it was a massive win for the millions of Californian homeowners who are yet to install the solar panels.
The reason net metering law is so important is that solar systems by their nature produce most power in the middle of the day when most homeowners are at work and using little power.
This is a very generous incentive and should not be taken for granted.
It means you can now install solar panels and sign a contract with your utility (known as a net metering agreement) where the utility guarantees to pay you a retail rate for exported solar power, usually for 10 or 15 years.
Each of the major utilities may offer slightly different net metering contracts but they are similar in nature.
To see more visit www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=3800
 

 
Is a purchase, lease or PPA agreement best?
Generally speaking you will make the largest savings over time if you purchase your solar panels outright yourself (whether you use cash you have at hand or finance secured against your home).
 However this is not always the case.
If you are in a position where you do not have a federal income tax liability then you will not be able to take advantage of the 30% federal solar tax credit.
In this case you may be better off with a third party owned solar lease where the solar company retains the right to this tax credit.
 

 
What is the payback period from installing solar panels in California?
The payback period from installing solar panels in California is usually between 4 and 8 years depending on the size of the system, the brand of solar panels you buy, the amount you were previously paying for power and whether you lease or buy your system.
This represents an excellent low risk investment.
 

 
Why analysis of solar savings and payback periods can be difficult in California
As California has net metering then the value of a solar power system is simply the annual production multiplied by the rate for power.
However, working this out can be difficult for two reasons.
Firstly for people on time of use metering the value power value changes with the time of day that the solar power is generated.
The second issue relates to the tiered rates of power prices.
With most utilities the amount you are charged for power increases as your usage increases.

Among them is US based TGI Solar Power ,which is involved in the commercialization of the latest generation of thin-film PV technologies, such as copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (CIGS) manufacturing equipment, as well as its standard amorphous silicon (a-Si) technology. TGI Solar Power markets at this time full turnkey manufacturing facilities to produce both a-Si and CIGS thin-film PV modules, which represent an optimum way to enter the thin-film PV manufacturing industry.  TGI Solar Power has a vast experience in research and development, design and production of manufacturing equipment, as well as, operation of manufacturing facilities for a-Si thin-films which spans over 25 year period. Our team had developed various equipment such as the RF-glow discharge process using a box carrier, which has become the industry manufacturing standard for a-Si, as one of the many examples of leading innovations throughout our career. Due to our unprecedented track record, as well as, current innovations, TGI Solar Power is able to offer a "next generation" of modular thin-film PV factories.  The profitability of thin-film manufacturing facilities is based on the manufacturing cost of these modules. In addition to its standard amorphous silicon production lines, TGI Solar Power offers facilities to manufacture CIGS-based thin-film PV modules. CIGS is the latest thin-film technology.

Best brands of solar panels
To find the best brands of solar panels you can use America's most trusterd solar panel comparison and reviews website, SolarReviews.
However, reviews of solar panels can be a bit meaningless because most consumer owners have not had any issues and so whilst solar company reviews are very important when choosing solar installers they are of less use when choosing solar panels.

How much electricity will solar panels produce in California
Solar panels produce different amounts of energy in different locations.
Around the Sacramento area solar panels installed on a south facing 29 degree pitch roof will typically produce:
1,550 kWh per year per 1kw of peak DC (direct current) capacity
For more information about how your location, roof direction and roof tilt affects solar power production use the solar panels calculator and enter your address below.









What rebates, solar tax credits and other solar incentives are available in California
What solar incentives and tax credits are available in California?
The main incentives to install solar in California is the 30% federal solar tax credit and the net metering law.
The upfront utility based incentives from each of the main publically owned utilities are now exhausted for residential customers and almost exhausted for commercial customers.
However, the investment case for buying solar panels for your home has never been stronger because reductions in the price of solar systems has more than compensated for the loss of some upfront rebates.
 

 
Net Metering in California
The California Public Utility Commission voted by a narrow majority of 3 to 2 to extend the ability of residential energy customers in California to be credited with full retail rates for excess solar power that they generate and feed back into the grid at times when the electrical loads in their house are less than their solar production.
Whilst this didn't affect people that had already had installed solar panels on their homes in California it was a massive win for the millions of Californian homeowners who are yet to install the solar panels.
The reason net metering law is so important is that solar systems by their nature produce most power in the middle of the day when most homeowners are at work and using little power.
This is a very generous incentive and should not be taken for granted.
It means you can now install solar panels and sign a contract with your utility (known as a net metering agreement) where the utility guarantees to pay you a retail rate for exported solar power, usually for 10 or 15 years.
Each of the major utilities may offer slightly different net metering contracts but they are similar in nature.
To see more visit www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=3800
 

 
Is a purchase, lease or PPA agreement best?
Generally speaking you will make the largest savings over time if you purchase your solar panels outright yourself (whether you use cash you have at hand or finance secured against your home).
 However this is not always the case.
If you are in a position where you do not have a federal income tax liability then you will not be able to take advantage of the 30% federal solar tax credit.
In this case you may be better off with a third party owned solar lease where the solar company retains the right to this tax credit.
 

 
What is the payback period from installing solar panels in California?
The payback period from installing solar panels in California is usually between 4 and 8 years depending on the size of the system, the brand of solar panels you buy, the amount you were previously paying for power and whether you lease or buy your system.
This represents an excellent low risk investment.
 

 
Why analysis of solar savings and payback periods can be difficult in California
As California has net metering then the value of a solar power system is simply the annual production multiplied by the rate for power.
However, working this out can be difficult for two reasons.
Firstly for people on time of use metering the value power value changes with the time of day that the solar power is generated.
The second issue relates to the tiered rates of power prices.
With most utilities the amount you are charged for power increases as your usage increases.
