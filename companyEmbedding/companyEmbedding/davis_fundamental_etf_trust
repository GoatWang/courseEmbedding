Value
 Is Davis Fundamental ETF Trust - Davis Select Financial ETF undervalued based on future cash flows and its price relative to the stock market?

Value is all about what a company is worth versus what price it is available for. If you went into a grocery store and all the bananas were on sale at half price, they could be considered undervalued.



INTRINSIC VALUE BASED ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS 

 It is not possible to calculate the future cash flow value for Davis Fundamental ETF Trust - Davis Select Financial ETF. This is due to cash flow or dividend data being unavailable. The share price is $22.1.



PRICE RELATIVE TO MARKET 


We can also value a company based on what the stock market is willing to pay for it. This is similar to the price of fruit (e.g. Mangoes or Avacados) increasing when they are out of season, or how much your home is worth.

Discounted cash flow (Dividend Discount Model)
The calculations below outline how an intrinsic value for Davis Fundamental ETF Trust - Davis Select Financial ETF is arrived at by discounting future dividends to their present value. This approach is used for finance firms where free cash flow is difficult to estimate (e.g. Banks/ Insurance firms).
If the firm does not pay the majority of its earnings out as a dividend this method will often arrive at a value significantly lower than the share price.
See our documentation to learn about this calculation.

Value of the stock
Value = Expected dividends per share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual growth rate)
$0 = ($0 / (10.55% - 2.33%)
Value per share: $0
Current discount (share price of $22.1): %

Estimate of Discount Rate
The discount rate, or required rate of return, is estimated by calculating the Cost of Equity.
Discount rate = Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
Discount rate = 10.55% = 2.33% + (1.072 * 7.67%)

Estimate of Bottom Up Beta
The Levered is used in the case of financial firms, but it is not adjusted for financial leverage like with non-finance firms. Therefore the average levered beta from comparable firms is used as the bottom-up beta. It is limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm).
Average Levered Beta from peers = 1.072
Levered Beta used in calculation = 1.072

Assumptions

The risk free rate of 2.33% is from the 10 year government bond rate in US.
The bottom-up beta is estimated by analysing other companies in the same industry.
The Equity Risk Premium is calculated by subtracting the risk free rate from the market return premium (10%) (source: Buffet).
The dividend discount model is automatically used for companies in the following industries: Banks, Insurance, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Diversified Financial Services and Capital Markets.

They are the first ETFs offered by Davis and among the first true actively-managed equity ETFs in the industry, using a fundamental bottom up approach. Davis has decades of experience investing in these areas. Each ETF utilizes the Davis Investment Discipline and is a high-conviction, best ideas, benchmark-agnostic portfolio. The ETFs have low expected portfolio turnover and a strategic long-term time investment horizon. Davis ETFs offer investors the traditional benefits of ETFs in general, which include low costs, tax efficiency, intraday liquidity, and transparency.1“We’re pleased to offer investment solutions that previously have not been widely available: actively managed equities in a traditional ETF,” said Chris Davis, Portfolio Manager and Chairman. “Davis ETFs offer a differentiated combination of active stock selection and our proven time-tested investment discipline with the traditional benefits of an ETF.”DUSA is a portfolio of U.S., large-cap businesses, managed by Chris Davis and his partner Danton Goei. It has about 20 holdings and an expense ratio of 0.60%.2 DUSA may serve as an attractive core holding to provide investors with exposure to best-of-breed, U.S. large-cap companies or as a complement to passive, index-oriented strategies, potentially enhancing returns.DFNL is a portfolio of best-of-breed financial companies managed by Chris Davis. It has about 20 holdings and an expense ratio of 0.65%.2 Mr. Davis commented, “The financial sector is one of the most attractive areas in today’s market; however, it is vast and inefficient, so we believe selectivity and experienced active management are key to outperformance.” Davis has managed financial stock portfolios for more than 25 years.DWLD is a portfolio of best-of-breed businesses in the U.S. and abroad managed by Danton Goei and Chris Davis. It has about 40 holdings and an expense ratio of 0.65%.2 As roughly 75% of the world’s publicly traded companies lie outside of the U.S., DWLD seeks to provide investors with diversification and access to attractive businesses around the world. Davis has decades of experience investing in international equities.To find out more about Davis ETFs, visit: www.davisetfs.com.About Davis AdvisorsDavis Advisors is an independent, employee-owned investment management firm founded in 1969 with more than $25 billion in assets under management as of December 31 2016.

Objective and Risks. Davis New York Venture Fund’s investment objective is long-term growth of capital. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its objective. The Fund invests primarily in equity securities issued by large companies with market capitalizations of at least $10 billion. Some important risks of an investment in the Fund are: stock market risk: stock markets have periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices, including sharp declines; manager risk: poor security selection may cause the Fund to underperform relevant benchmarks; common stock risk: an adverse event may have a negative impact on a company and could result in a decline in the price of its common stock; large-capitalization companies risk: companies with $10 billion or more in market capitalization generally experience slower rates of growth in earnings per share than do mid- and small-capitalization companies; mid- and small-capitalization companies risk: companies with less than $10 billion in market capitalization typically have more limited product lines, markets and financial resources than larger companies, and may trade less frequently and in more limited volume; headline risk: the Fund may invest in a company when the company becomes the center of controversy. The company’s stock may never recover or may become worthless; financial services risk: investing a significant portion of assets in the financial services sector may cause the Fund to be more sensitive to problems affecting financial companies; foreign country risk: foreign companies may be subject to greater risk as foreign economies may not be as strong or diversified. As of December 31, 2014, the Fund had approximately 15.0% of assets invested in foreign companies; emerging market risk: securities of issuers in emerging and developing markets may present risks not found in more mature markets; foreign currency risk: the change in value of a foreign currency against the U.S. dollar will result in a change in the U.S. dollar value of securities denominated in that foreign currency; depositary receipts risk: depositary receipts may trade at a discount (or premium) to the underlying security and may be less liquid than the underlying securities listed on an exchange; and fees and expenses risk: the Fund may not earn enough through income and capital appreciation to offset the operating expenses of the Fund. See the prospectus for a complete description of the principal risks.
