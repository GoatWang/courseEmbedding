Kodak Sharpens Its Focus on Quality 
By Prezzano, Wilbur J.

Article excerpt

KODAK SHARPENS ITS FOCUS ON QUALITY    Make good goods" is a slogan that has been part of Eastman Kodak Company's heritage since the turn of the century.  At that time, George Eastman was popularizing photography with the $1 Kodak Brownie camera.    Today Kodak employees make good goods faster than ever before and for an international consumer who cna't be compared to the unsophisticated customer of the early 1900s.  Maintaining quality throughout an organization as large and complex as Kodak--it employs 100,000 people around the world--does not mean fashioning a program to fit the entire organization.    Kodak established a line of business (LOB) structure in 1985 to accommodate the many different product categories and work styles. Each LOB is accountable for worldwide research and development, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of its own products.  Each makes its own decisions and succeeds or fails accordingly.    The establishment of this structure was a big step toward accomplishing our overall quality objectives in a much changed business environment.  The purpose was to give newly appointed LOB managers the ability to be more responsive to the needs of their customers.  They were freed up to make and implement decisions faster.    What follows is a profile of the quality effort in the Photographic Products Group, which is responsible for catering to more than 120,000 dealers and retailers who sell Kodak products.  Our quality process began with an important goal: Halve the time it takes to bring to market quality products that match our customers' needs.  We did this in a number of areas:    ] Our Photofinishing Systems Division modified an existing product that allows mini-labs to halve the time it takes to process rolls of color negative film.  The result: improved service for customers and better productivity for the minilabs.  The project involved an integrated effort that required advances in process chemistry, as well as modification of an existing processing machine.  Under the old regime, it would have taken us four years to bring this improved process to the marketplace.  We did it in two.    ] Our Electronic Photography Division developed a tabletop color video printer as a component of a photo identification system.  We developed the printer in about 18 months--just in time for the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, Korea.    ] Our Consumer Products Division brought two 35 millimeter (mm) single-lens reflex cameras to the marketplace in a record two years. The timing couldn't have been better: The market was ready for low-cost, high-quality 35 mm cameras.    ] The Motion Picture and Audiovisual Products Division introduced two 35 mm films in 1987.  Both films earned technical achievement awards--equivalent to the Oscars--from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  It was the first time in the award's 60-year history that a company received the honor twice in one year.  Both films were developed in record time in response to specific industry needs.       POLLING CUSTOMERS    Several years ago, when Ray DeMoulin was appointed vice-president and general manager of our Professional Photography Division, he decided to learn firsthand what the marketplace thought of Kodak's products.  First, he commissioned market research that pinpointed soft spots in customer perceptions.  Then, he visited customers and watched as they went about their daily jobs.  While accompanying a news photographer on assignment, DeMoulin noticed the photographer was having difficulty opening our film canister with one hand while holding his camera with the other hand.    DeMoulin came back to Rochester determined to manufacture a film container that could easily be opened with one hand.  This involved considerable capital investment in retooling equipment and didn't add to our immediate profits, but we did it in record time and made a name for ourselves among news photographers as well. …
