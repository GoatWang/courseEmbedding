Product[edit]
Like other robo-advisors, FutureAdvisor automates portfolio management with software that adjusts for investors' age and risk appetite.[7] Robo-advisors apply modern portfolio theory, the Black-Litterman model and other algorithms to manage investments passively, much like a traditional financial adviser. They adjust asset allocation according to notions of a "balanced" portfolio, rather than pursuing "active" strategies like market timing, stock picking and value investing. FutureAdvisor manages assets directly across multiple Fidelity Investments or TDAmeritrade brokerage accounts and IRAs.[8]
College Investments[edit]
FutureAdvisor manages tax-advantaged educational investment accounts such as 529s, Coverdell ESAs, UTMA/UGMAs for free.[9] The company has a financial planning service that helps investors estimate the price of college tuition for their children. It also helps them select and create educational savings accounts online, and manage those investments until the day the funds need to be used for college or other educational expenses. In addition, FutureAdvisor automates the monthly contributions to those accounts, as well as the disbursement to schools when the child attends college.[10]
Methodology[edit]
FutureAdvisor uses index funds and low-fee exchange-traded funds to create portfolios that adhere to modern portfolio theory. Under MPT, the proportion of assets allocated to foreign and domestic equities, bonds and Real estate investment trusts should vary according to an investor's age and risk appetite.
History[edit]




Co-founders Jon Xu and Bo Lu


FutureAdvisor was founded by two former Microsoft engineers - Bo Lu and Jon Xu - in Seattle. The company graduated from the incubator YCombinator in 2010, took $1 million in seed funding, and raised $5 million in Series A funding from Sequoia Capital in 2012. Canvas Venture Fund led FutureAdvisor's Series B round worth $15.5 million in 2014.[11]

In addition, FutureAdvisor automates the monthly contributions to those accounts, as well as the disbursement to schools when the child attends college.[10]
Methodology[edit]
FutureAdvisor uses index funds and low-fee exchange-traded funds to create portfolios that adhere to modern portfolio theory. Under MPT, the proportion of assets allocated to foreign and domestic equities, bonds and Real estate investment trusts should vary according to an investor's age and risk appetite.
History[edit]




Co-founders Jon Xu and Bo Lu


FutureAdvisor was founded by two former Microsoft engineers - Bo Lu and Jon Xu - in Seattle. The company graduated from the incubator YCombinator in 2010, took $1 million in seed funding, and raised $5 million in Series A funding from Sequoia Capital in 2012. Canvas Venture Fund led FutureAdvisor's Series B round worth $15.5 million in 2014.[11]

Product[edit]
Like other robo-advisors, FutureAdvisor automates portfolio management with software that adjusts for investors' age and risk appetite.[7] Robo-advisors apply modern portfolio theory, the Black-Litterman model and other algorithms to manage investments passively, much like a traditional financial adviser. They adjust asset allocation according to notions of a "balanced" portfolio, rather than pursuing "active" strategies like market timing, stock picking and value investing. FutureAdvisor manages assets directly across multiple Fidelity Investments or TDAmeritrade brokerage accounts and IRAs.[8]
College Investments[edit]
FutureAdvisor manages tax-advantaged educational investment accounts such as 529s, Coverdell ESAs, UTMA/UGMAs for free.[9] The company has a financial planning service that helps investors estimate the price of college tuition for their children. It also helps them select and create educational savings accounts online, and manage those investments until the day the funds need to be used for college or other educational expenses. In addition, FutureAdvisor automates the monthly contributions to those accounts, as well as the disbursement to schools when the child attends college.[10]
Methodology[edit]
FutureAdvisor uses index funds and low-fee exchange-traded funds to create portfolios that adhere to modern portfolio theory. Under MPT, the proportion of assets allocated to foreign and domestic equities, bonds and Real estate investment trusts should vary according to an investor's age and risk appetite.

I Was a Wealth Manager, and I Cashed Out During the Crash


Don’t time it. After almost a decade working in wealth management firms and large banks, I’ve come to understand this simple fact: unless you’re a standup comedian, you probably don’t have timing down. I started my career in 2004 — heady days — researching on contract for investment teams while I was still an undergrad. After college,…

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

FutureAdvisor Review 2017 


 


Arielle O'Shea

SavedSave 



Advisors, Investing





FutureAdvisor is a robo-advisor with a bit of a twist: Several of the company’s services are free, including a comprehensive retirement analysis. The tool allows users to link their accounts and get specific recommendations tailored to their portfolio and goals.
The company’s paid offering, which charges 0.50% as a management fee and requires a balance of $10,000 or more, is comprehensive investment management with automatic rebalancing, tax-loss harvesting and access to a team of financial advisors. Accounts are held with two well-established brokers, Fidelity or TD Ameritrade, and FutureAdvisor currently manages over $900 million in assets.

Where FutureAdvisor shines
Free tools and advice: FutureAdvisor has two main offerings: a free portfolio analysis service, and FutureAdvisor Premium, which is direct management of investments and carries a 0.50% management fee.
The DIY investor who wants a second opinion will love FutureAdvisor for the company’s free, personalized recommendations, which can be used on any account held at any broker. This platform analyzes your portfolio and gives you free trade recommendations based on modern portfolio theory, the same investing methodology used by the bulk of robo-advisors. You can then initiate trades through your online broker.
FutureAdvisor’s free service will also alert you of the need to rebalance. It doesn’t provide tax-loss harvesting opportunities to free customers, as they can be complicated to execute. However, tax-loss harvesting is included on all FutureAdvisor Premium accounts.

Use of popular online brokers: For FutureAdvisor Premium, accounts must be held at TD Ameritrade or Fidelity. If your accounts are already at one of those brokers, there is no need to move them; you’ll simply give FutureAdvisor management rights and the company will be able to trade on your behalf. That means you get all the perks of a robo-advisor at a trusted online broker, and giving the service a try is virtually risk-free, without the need to transfer funds.
If your accounts are elsewhere, this is potentially a disadvantage, as you’ll need to move them to one of those brokers. However, the company will help you do it (and the need to move accounts is typical of robo-advisors), and assets can be transferred in kind.
Financial advisor support: FutureAdvisor walks the line between a standard robo-advisor and a hybrid service: The company gives clients access to a team of financial advisors via chat, email and phone, five days a week. Users can set up an appointment with one of the advisors, and each trade within an account is also monitored by a real person in addition to the company’s investing algorithm.
Where FutureAdvisor falls short
Account minimum: In order to have your assets directly managed by the company — the FutureAdvisor Premium service — you’ll need an account balance of at least $10,000, which is high compared with the bulk of the company’s robo-advisor competitors. It’s worth noting, however, that this minimum is actually significantly lower than other services that offer access to financial advisors, like Personal Capital and Vanguard Personal Advisor Services. Personal Capital requires a minimum $100,000, and Vanguard requires $50,000.
Management fee: The cost here is high when compared with other robo-advisors: FutureAdvisor Premium carries an annual fee of 0.50%, which is in addition to investment expenses. The company notes that customers may also occasionally incur transaction fees, though it prioritizes the use of commission-free funds.
Maximum age restriction: This service will take you to retirement, but you’ll have to get through it on your own: The company doesn’t accept new Premium clients over age 68, due to allocations that are focused on return rather than income generation.
Is FutureAdvisor right for you?
FutureAdvisor is worth a test drive for its free offerings alone: The account analysis with rebalance reminders can give you valuable insight into how to manage your own portfolio.
It’s also a good fit for clients who have accounts at Fidelity or TD Ameritrade and who don’t want to transfer funds in order to take advantage of a robo-advisor. Outside of that, other advisors may provide a similar level of service and account management for a lower management fee and a lower account minimum.

A Complete Review of FutureAdvisor’s Investment Services


Eric Rosenberg
Updated on October 26, 2016 




 

If you want to invest but don’t know how, leave the complicated investment decisions to someone else you can trust. For a long time, your only option was to pick a traditional financial advisor for a big fee.
Nowadays, however, there is a new crop of automated financial advisors to choose from. So-called “robo-advisors” come at a much lower cost and include a simple, fast online sign-up process.
FutureAdvisor is one such robo-advisor, and a long-time industry player paving the path for automated, digital financial management. Continue on for a comprehensive FutureAdvisor review that discusses how it works, what it costs, and whether or not it may be a good fit for your investment management needs.
FutureAdvisor review
At a high level, the FutureAdvisor app manages your investments based on your age, risk tolerance, and current market conditions to give you the best investment returns possible.
Its automated trading analysis tools even go so far as to take advantage of investment losses to offset gains for a tax savings known as “tax loss harvesting.”
The entire package of investment strategies employed by FutureAdvisor are designed to give you the best long-term investment gains possible for your unique situations — and in some cases, you don’t even have to sign up for a new investment account to make it work.
Visit FutureAdvisor
FutureAdvisor products
The primary FutureAdvisor product is a web-based application that manages your investments to take advantage of low-cost investment funds chosen and tailored to your unique needs and retirement-planning goals.
Investment decisions are made by computer algorithms, which connect to accounts at Fidelity or TD Ameritrade.
If you don’t have an account with Fidelity or TD Ameritrade, you are given the option to create one when you sign up for FutureAdvisor. A FutureAdvisor account specialist will handle migrating your assets from your existing investment account into your FutureAdvisor account.
Because of the restriction to Fidelity and TD Ameritrade accounts, FutureAdvisor will not work with your existing investment account at any other brokerage firm. If you love your current brokerage and are not willing to change, FutureAdvisor will not work for you.
The FutureAdvisor app offers several major features for its customers:

Automated investing: This is the core feature of the app. FutureAdvisor will make actual trades in connected accounts based on its analysis and your user profile that is completed during the sign-up process. Investments are driven by complex algorithms designed by PhD investment analysts and a team of seasoned investment advisors.
Intelligent trading for taxes and fees: FutureAdvisor is programmed to minimize the total number of trades and focuses on low-cost index funds and ETFs to ensure you keep as many of your investment dollars as possible — rather than spend them on fees.
Tax loss harvesting: Automated selling and purchasing to lower your tax bill every April, thanks to tax loss harvesting.
Trades take place in an account you control: FutureAdvisor never holds your funds. They live in your connected account at Fidelity or TD Ameritrade. FutureAdvisor acts as a fiduciary investment manager while your brokerage holds your account and assets.

These features can help you make more efficient investing decisions, boosting your portfolio overall.
Using the FutureAdvisor online platform
Signing up for FutureAdvisor is simple and straightforward. Start by heading to the sign-up page, then enter your email address and a secure password.
After you are presented with the FutureAdvisor user agreement, you fill out a questionnaire that will tell the algorithm how to manage your investments. Enter your information carefully, as this determines how your hard-earned dollars are invested.

Once you fill out this simple profile, you’re prompted to either open a new investment account or connect your existing investment accounts to the FutureAdvisor platform for automated analysis.
If you are uncomfortable linking your accounts, you can also add your information manually. However, taking advantage of everything FutureAdvisor has to offer does require linking your accounts.
When you complete the setup process, you will have access to a dashboard showing your investment goals and linked account progress.

If you click on a specific goal, you are presented with best practices and ideas for improving your existing accounts. If you choose to sign up for the premium product where FutureAdvisor manages your accounts, these best practices are automatically implemented for you.

Users can also access a page of specific investment advice for your existing portfolio accounts, even those at other financial institutions that are not supported with the premium product.

Again, with the paid version of FutureAdvisor this advice is implemented automatically. However, you can access this level of information for free and manually implement FutureAdvisor’s suggestions at any brokerage.
Overall, the web platform is well-designed and easy for newbies to use.
Visit FutureAdvisor
FutureAdvisor interest rates and fees
No FutureAdvisor review would be complete without a look at the company’s fees and charges.
FutureAdvisor offers two versions of its product. The free version offers access to the views above, where you can see an analysis of your current investment portfolio and advice about how to improve it.
The second option — FutureAdvisor’s primary offering, which includes automated investment management and tax loss harvesting — has a flat fee of 0.5% of your investment account balance annually.
The 0.5% fee is billed quarterly as a 0.125% fee on total assets managed. When possible, this fee is deducted from a linked account that is not a tax-advantaged retirement account. Fee-only financial advisors often charge up to 2% annually, so compared to a human financial advisor FutureAdvisor is a bargain.
You may also incur trading fees from Fidelity or TD Ameritrade for trades in your linked accounts. There are no charges for opening or maintaining your accounts.
FutureAdvisor eligibility requirements
FutureAdvisor is open to anyone who is looking to invest for their future. The only requirements to sign up for and use the service are that you are a United States citizen and 18 years of age or older.
Data obtained from Credio indicates that the company is a registered financial advising firm in all states, with the exception of Wyoming.
FutureAdvisor customer service
Due to the automated nature of the product, the likelihood that you will need to interact with customer service is very low. However, if you do need customer service, they can be reached through an email form on the website.

More about FutureAdvisor
FutureAdvisor was founded in 2010 and is reported to have $969 million in assets under management. Headquartered in San Francisco, California, the company raised $21.5 million in investment capital before agreeing to an acquisition by Wall Street investment management firm BlackRock in August 2015.
The company employs around 100 individuals, and was founded by Bo Lu (CEO) and Jon Xu (CTO) to apply modern portfolio theory, the Black-Litterman model, and other investment theories to client portfolios. Their aim was to give average investors access to investment advice and technologies previously reserved for only wealthy investors.

FutureAdvisor can be reached via email through its contact form. It can also be reached by phone at (800) 975-7199 or by mail at:

Frequently Asked Questions






What is the total cost of investment management with FutureAdvisor?

The total cost of FutureAdvisor Premium is comprised of three parts: our management fee, the expense ratios of the funds in which you’re invested, and trading commissions (i.e. the $7.95 you pay to execute a trade at Fidelity). Over 90% of the funds we use at FutureAdvisor are commission-free.
FutureAdvisor’s management fee is 0.5% annually --­­ half of one percent ­­-- on assets that we directly manage. Average expense ratios and trading fees are minimized, and result in an all­-in average cost of 0.65% per year of assets managed.
Our strategy also considers trade-­offs between ETF trading commissions and expense ratios to help minimize the total cost of investing. For small accounts, commission fees often have a larger impact in terms of costs, whereas for large accounts, the expense ratio alone can represent the largest fee.  We’ll help you get into the right funds for your portfolio’s size.



How are the fees billed?

We bill our management fee in quarterly installments of 0.125%, deducted from one of the accounts we manage for you.  When possible, we deduct this fee from taxable (e.g. taxable IRA) instead of tax­ advantaged (rollover IRA) accounts.



Are there costs to move my accounts to FutureAdvisor?

FutureAdvisor and our custodians (Fidelity and TD Ameritrade) don’t charge any account opening fees.  Maintaining accounts at those custodians is also free.



Are there costs to cancel?

There are no fees associated with discontinuing FutureAdvisor Premium. Should you make the decision to cancel our services, we’ll simply remove ourselves as an advisor on your Fidelity and/or TD Ameritrade accounts, which returns them to your full control.
