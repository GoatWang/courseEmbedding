Progress Completes Acquisition of Telerik and Expands Executive Management Team


Acquisition Extends Leadership in App Dev, Deployment and Integration

      with Cross-Platform Tools and Technology

 BEDFORD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Progress

      (NASDAQ: PRGS), announced today that it has completed its acquisition of

      Telerik AD, a provider of tools and technologies to address the entire

      application development lifecycle. Through this acquisition, Progress

      will now provide comprehensive cloud and on-premise platform offerings

      that enable developers to rapidly create beautiful applications, driven

      by data for any web, desktop or mobile platform. The acquisition builds

      on Progress' strong heritage of enabling developers to rapidly create

      data-driven, device and platform agnostic applications.

    


      Progress acquired Telerik for an aggregate purchase price of

      approximately $262.5 million. Progress funded the purchase price from a

      combination of existing cash resources and a $150 million term loan,

      which is part of a new $300 million term and revolving credit facility

      with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and a syndicate of other lenders. In

      addition, a portion of the purchase price payable to Telerik's founders

      and certain other key employees is payable in restricted stock units,

      subject to a vesting schedule and continued employment.

    

Developer-Driven Products


Telerik, which will be known as Telerik: a Progress Company, has been at

      the forefront of innovation for more than twelve years, enabling

      developers at more than 450 of the Fortune 500 to deliver best-in-class

      web, desktop and mobile applications. Customers that deploy Telerik

      tools and technologies in combination with Progress solutions for

      development, deployment and integration will benefit from app dev

      support, at every level—from a clean UI to data integration and cloud

      services—across .NET, JavaScript, NodeJS, and ABL.

    


      Adding Telerik® products to the Pacific™ Platform as a Service (PaaS)

      will enable Progress to create a very powerful developer experience, not

      only by offering tools to build highly customized user interfaces, but

      also to help relieve the complexity of managing back-end services.

      Telerik's cloud-based mobile application development platform, which has

      been named to the "Visionary" category of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for

      Mobile Application Development Platforms, strongly complements Progress'

      Rollbase® and Modulus™ product offerings, providing a full lifecycle

      industry-best mobile application development platform for JavaScript

      developers.

    

Progress Further Enhances Visionary Leadership Team



      In addition to a synergistic product portfolio, the acquisition combines

      two talented teams of industry visionaries. Under the leadership of CEO

      Phil Pead, Progress has appointed several Telerik executives to

      senior-level positions. Telerik co-CEO and co-founder, Vassil Terziev

      has become Chief Innovation Officer, and co-CEO and co-founder Svetozar

      Georgiev has become Senior Vice President of Application Platforms for

      the Application Development and Deployment business unit. Dimitre

      Taslakov, Chief Talent Officer for Telerik, will become Chief Talent

      Officer for the overall Progress business. All three individuals will

      serve on the company's executive committee.

Phil Pead, President and Chief Executive Officer at Progress, said:

      "Developers have more freedom than ever before. But there are inherent

      challenges—platform preference, cross functional capabilities,

      competitive and customer pressure to deliver the most attractive, yet

      fully-functional apps that work across the myriad devices available

      today. Through the Telerik acquisition, Progress is easing the

      development burden by becoming the preferred destination for the entire

      developer community. In addition to stellar products, including Telerik

      DevTools, Telerik Platform and Telerik Sitefinity®, Telerik brings with

      it the people that made Telerik great—those that understand the needs of

      its community and can keep pace with the highly-diverse and demanding

      world of application development. The knowledge, spirit and passion that

      this organization brings to Progress will undoubtedly impact us, our

      customers and partners in a highly-positive way."

    

Vassil Terziev, Chief Innovation Officer at Progress, Co-Founder and

      formerly Co-CEO at Telerik, said: "Joining the Progress executive

      management team is the next step in a journey for us that has been

      nothing short of amazing. We've been true partners to more than 130,000

      customers for more than twelve years. In our new capacity at Progress,

      we will be able to leverage this experience in building a high-growth,

      successful organization and deliver amazing value to our combined

      customer base."

    

Leonard Nagel, SVP of Technology and Services at Suncoast Solutions,

      said: "We are thrilled that Progress and Telerik are joining forces and

      hope other partners and customer dev teams see the same value and

      successes that we've seen using both company's industry leading tools.

      As a healthcare industry solutions provider, it's life-critical that we

      provide seamless customer care across lines of business. We've used the

      Progress® OpenEdge® product to build and manage the back-end of our

      SaaS-based (EHR) Electronic Health Record applications and are also

      using Telerik's Kendo® product to bring our application experience to a

      whole new level for our customers. We look forward to continuing our

      path to innovation with the combined organization."
