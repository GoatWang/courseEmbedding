ENERGY 11, L.P. - S-1/A - 20141212 - DISTRIBUTION_PLAN






	PLAN

	OF DISTRIBUTION



	 




	We are selling the common units using the services of David Lerner Associates, Inc. as the managing dealer. David Lerner Associates, Inc. is not affiliated with us. The common units are being offered on a “best efforts” basis, meaning that the managing dealer is not obligated to purchase any common units. No common units will be sold unless at least a minimum of 1,315,790 common units have been sold no later than two years after the date of this prospectus.




	 




	Common units purchased by our affiliates will not be counted in determining whether we have met the minimum offering amount.  However, common units may be purchased by other parties with a financial interest in the offering, including persons who may receive fees or other compensation or otherwise benefit from the success of this offering such as employees and affiliates of the Manager or other service providers or vendors.  Such purchases may be made at any time, and may be counted in determining whether the required minimum level of purchases has been met for the closing of the offering.  You should therefore not expect that the sale of sufficient common units to reach the specified minimum, or in excess of that minimum, indicates that such sales have been made to investors who have no financial or other interest in the offering, or who otherwise are exercising independent investment discretion.




	 




	The sale of the specified minimum, while necessary to our business operations, is not designed as a protection to investors, to indicate that their investment decision is shared by other unaffiliated investors.  Because there may be substantial purchases by persons who have a financial stake in the success of the offering, you should not place any reliance on the sale of the specified minimum offering amount as an indication of the merits of this offering. Each investor must make his own investment decision as to the merits of this offering.




	 




	If the minimum offering of common units is not sold before December   2016 , the offering will terminate and all funds deposited by investors into the non- interest   bearing escrow account will be promptly refunded to investors in full, without deduction and with out interest. We will not charge fees on funds returned if the minimum offering is not met.   Branch Banking and Trust Company will act as escrow agent for the escrow account until the minimum offering of common units is sold. The address of the escrow agent is: 223 West Nash Street, Wilson, North Carolina 27893 . Unless and until the minimum offering amount is sold within the required time period of two years, all checks from investors will be transmitted to the escrow agent no later than close of business of the next business day after receipt of such funds by David Lerner Associates , Inc. unless the subscription checks are received at a David Lerner Associates, Inc. office which does not conduct internal supervisory review, in which case the checks will be transmitted to the escrow agent by close of business on the second succeeding business day, and otherwise in accordance with all applicable Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, rules.




	 




	The common units are offered at $19.00 per common unit until 5,263,158 ( $100,000,000 )  common units are sold . Thereafter, the common units will be offered at $20 .00 per common unit.




	 




	On the earlier of the sale of 5,263,158 common units and the final termination date , each of Glade M. Knight, David McKenney,  Anthony “Chip” F. Keating III, and Michael J. Mallick or an affiliate of such individuals, will purchase 5,000 common units at $20.00 per common unit from us. Each of Messrs. Knight, McKenney, Keating and Mallick undertakes not to sell his common units (other than to an affiliate, as defined in our bylaws) so long as he is an officer and director of us.




	 




	Neither prospective investors nor common unitholders should assume that the per-common unit prices reflect the intrinsic or realizable value of the common units or otherwise reflect our value, earnings or other objective measures of worth. If we were to list the common units on a national securities exchange, the common unit price might drop below our common unitholders’ original investment.




	 




	The offering of common units is expected to terminate when all common units offered by this prospectus have been sold or two years from the date hereof, unless extended by us for up to an additional three months in order to achieve the maximum offering of 100,263,158 common units.




	 




	Purchasers will be sold common units at one or more closings. Following the initial closing date and after we have broken escrow, investors should make their checks payable to “David Lerner Associates, Inc.” and David Lerner Associates, Inc. will transmit funds directly to us at the next monthly closing date.   We plan to have additional closings monthly during the offering period as orders are received. The final closing will be held shortly after the termination of the offering period or, if earlier, upon the sale of 100,283,158 common units. It is expected that after the initial closing of the sale of the minimum offering, purchasers will be sold common units no later than the last day of the calendar month following the month in which their orders are received. Funds received during the offering but after the initial disbursement of funds will be held in purchasers’ accounts with David Lerner Associates, Inc. until the next closing, and then disbursed to us.




	 




	In no event are we required to accept the subscription of any prospective investor, and no subscription shall become binding on us until a properly completed subscription agreement prepared and executed by the prospective investor has been accepted by our duly authorized representative, David Lerner Associates, Inc. By executing the subscription agreement, the investor is not waiving any rights under the Securities Act of 1933.

	Table of Contents






	 







	We intend to hold investors’ funds in escrow in a non- interest   bearing account with  Branch Banking and Trust Company until the minimum offering of 1,315,790 common units is achieved and the initial closing has occurred. After the initial closing, investors’ funds will be held in each purchaser’s account with David Lerner Associates, Inc. or other broker-dealers pending each applicable closing. Investors’ subscriptions will be revocable by written notice delivered to the escrow agent at least five days before the initial closing.








	 




	Each investor who desires to purchase common units will be required to complete and sign a subscription agreement in the form attached to this prospectus as Exhibit B. In addition to requesting basic identifying information concerning the investor, such as his or her name and address, the number of common units subscribed for, and the manner in which ownership will be held, the subscription agreement requires the investor to make a series of representations to us set forth in paragraphs designated “(a)” through

	“(i).”





	 




	We ask for these representations to help us determine whether you have received the disclosure materials pertaining to the investment, meet certain suitability requirements we have established, and understand what you are investing in. Should a dispute later arise between you and us concerning matters that are the subject of any representation, we would expect to rely upon your making of that representation in the subscription agreement if you later claim that that representation is not correct.



	 




	We have established suitability standards in determining whether we should accept a subscription agreement from any purchaser.  Each purchaser of common units must certify that he or she has either:



	 







	·







	a minimum annual gross income


	, or joint income with a spouse,


	of $45,000 and a net worth


	, or joint net worth with his or her spouse,


	(exclusive of equity in home, home furnishings and personal automobiles) of at least $45,000, or








	 







	·







	a net worth (similarly defined)


	, or joint net worth with his or her spouse,


	of at least $150,000








	 



	These standards impose minimum income and net worth standards that we believe are reasonable considering our planned business activities and the risks associated with a purchase of the common units. These risks are summarized under “Risk Factors.”



	 



	We will require each purchaser to review and complete a subscription agreement in which he or she will represent that he meets the applicable suitability standards described above. The form of the subscription agreement is attached as Exhibit B.  We and David Lerner Associates, Inc. rely on the representations made by the purchaser in the subscription agreement in assuring adherence to these suitability standards.





	 




	Set forth below is a brief summary of the nature of each representation in the lettered paragraphs of the subscription agreement. You should, however, carefully review the subscription agreement in its entirety.



	 



	(a)           You acknowledge that you have received a copy of the prospectus and that you understand that your investment will be governed by the terms of that prospectus.



	 



	(b)           You represent that you are of majority age and, therefore, can enter into a binding contract to purchase the common units.



	 



	(c)           You represent that you have adequate financial resources, understand the financial risks of an investment in common units, and understand that there is no ready ability to sell or otherwise dispose of your investment in common units.



	 



	(d)           You specifically represent that you either have a net worth (excluding home, furnishings and automobiles) of at least $45,000 and gross income of $45,000, or a net worth (with the same exclusions) of at least $150,000. This representation helps us determine that your proposed investment is suitable for you based on your financial condition.



	 



	(e)           If you are acting on behalf of an entity, you represent that you have authority to bind the entity.



	 



	(f)            You represent that the taxpayer identification number (social security number in the case of an individual) provided is correct and that you are not subject to backup withholding. This representation allows us to make distributions to you without any requirement to withhold for income tax purposes.



	 



	(g)           You understand that we have the right, in our sole discretion, to accept or reject your subscription for common units.



	 




	(h)           You authorize the return of subscription funds not used to acquire units to your account with David Lerner Associates, Inc.



	 




	(i)            You agree to settle by arbitration any controversy between you and your broker concerning the subscription agreement and the investment represented by the subscription agreement.

	Funds not invested in oil and gas properties may be invested by us only in:



	 



	(a)           bank accounts, including savings accounts and bank money market accounts (as bank is defined in Section 3(a)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) (including bank money market accounts managed by the escrow agent and its affiliates);



	 



	(b)           short-term direct obligations of the United States of America or obligations the principal of and the interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America;



	 



	(c)           short-term certificates of deposit issued by any bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) (including the escrow agent and its affiliates) located in the United States and having net worth of at least $50,000,000; or



	 



	(d)           similar highly liquid investments to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations.



	 






	We will pay to David Lerner Associates, Inc. selling commissions on all sales made in an amount equal to 5% of the purchase price of the common units or $0.95 per common unit sold for $19.00 prior to selling 5,263,158 common units and $1.00 per common unit purchased for $20.00 thereafter.  We also will pay to David Lerner Associates, Inc. a marketing expense allowance equal to 1% of the purchase price of the common units, as a non-accountable reimbursement for expenses incurred by it in connection with the offer and sale of the common units. The marketing expense allowance will equal $0.19 per common unit sold for $19.00 prior to reaching the minimum offering and $0.20 per common unit purchased for $20.00 thereafter. The maximum selling commission payable to David Lerner Associates, Inc. is $100,000,000. The maximum marketing expense allowance payable to David Lerner Associates, Inc. is $20,000,000. The selling commissions and marketing expense allowance are payable to David Lerner Associates, Inc. at the times of the issuance of common units to purchasers.




	 




	David Lerner Associates, Inc. will provide the following services to us until the offering termination date: (i) maintain up-to-date contact and other information regarding its customers who are common unitholders and make such information available to us upon request, (ii) assist us in communicating with common unitholders and (iii) coordinate the ongoing provision of information regarding the partnership to common unitholder as may be required or desirable from time to time.  For providing such services, David Lerner Associates, Inc. will be paid (i) an initial one-time fee of $5 for each of its customer who acquires common units and (ii) an annual fee of $10 per such customer.  The total of these account maintenance fees will not exceed $500,000.




	 






	The following table reflects the compensation payable to David Lerner Associates, Inc. for the offer and sale of the common units (see “Compensation” for a further discussion of compensation):

	(1)                 Once 5,263,158 common units have been sold , the per common unit price will increase to $20.00 per common unit, the commissions will increase to $1.00 per common unit and the marketing expense allowance will increase to $0.20 per common unit.





	 





	(2)                 We will pay the dealer manager a contingent, incentive fee based on the amount of distributions made by the Partnership after Payout occurs.  The contingent, incentive fee will be payable solely in cash and will not exceed 4% of the gross proceeds of the offering of common units.  If the minimum offering is achieved, the contingent, incentive fee will not exceed $ 1 ,000,000 and if the maximum offering is achieved, the fee will not exceed $80,000,000.

	 


	The maximum amount of the contingent, incentive fee will be reduced by the amount of any account maintenance fees paid to David Lerner Associates, Inc.






	 





	The dealer manager or other broker-dealers will not purchase common units from us.





	 







	The exclusive dealer manager agreement between us and David Lerner Associates, Inc. permits David Lerner Associates, Inc. to use the services of other broker-dealers in offering and selling the common units, subject to our approval.  However, no such broker-dealers have been identified or approved at this time and none will be employed prior to the initial sale of common units after the minimum offering is achieved.  If any other broker-dealers are engaged to offer common units, David Lerner Associates, Inc. will pay the compensation owing to the broker-dealers out of the selling commissions or marketing expense allowance payable to it. Sales by the broker-dealers will be carried on in accordance with customary securities distribution procedures. David Lerner Associates, Inc. may be deemed to be an “underwriter” for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with this offering. Purchasers should make their checks payable to “Branch Banking and Trust Company, as escrow agent for Energy 11” .  David Lerner Associates, Inc. will transmit to the escrow agent funds representing subscription payments by close of business of the next business day following receipt by David Lerner Associates, Inc. of the subscription payments , unless the subscription checks are received at a David Lerner Associates, Inc. office which does not conduct internal supervisory review, in which case the checks will be transmitted to the escrow agent by the close of business on the next business day .  If for some reason your funds are returned by the escrow agent, they will be returned to you directly by the escrow agent in the form of a check or wire transfer.





	 




	David Lerner Associates, Inc. is a member of FINRA. Any other broker-dealers allowed to sell common units will be FINRA members. The maximum total underwriting compensation from any source that we will pay to David Lerner Associates, Inc. or any other FINRA member firm or their affiliates will not exceed 10% of the gross proceeds of this offering.




	 





	 






	101











	Table of Contents






	 






	Purchasers are required to purchase a minimum of $5,000 in common units.  Existing common unitholders may purchase additional common units pursuant to procedures and minimum amounts established by David Lerner Associates, Inc. In addition, upon the earlier of the sale of 5,263,158 common units or the final termination date , each of the four principals of our general partner (or their affiliates) will purchase in this offering 5,000 common units for $20.00 per common unit, on the same terms and conditions as the public.  The four principals will be permitted to vote on any matters submitted to a vote of holders of the common units. Any purchase of common units in this offering by the four principals of our general partner must be for investment, and not for resale or distribution.







	 




	There has been no previous market for any of our common units. The initial offering price for the common units is arbitrary and was determined on the basis of our proposed capitalization, market conditions and other relevant factors.



	 



	We have agreed to indemnify David Lerner Associates, Inc. against a limited number of liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These liabilities include liabilities arising out of untrue statements of a material fact contained in this registration statement or arising out of the omission of a material fact required to be stated in this registration statement. We will also indemnify David Lerner Associates, Inc. for losses from a breach of any warranties made by us in the agency agreement.



	 




	FINRA

	Action



	 




	In connection with the resolution of two FINRA disciplinary actions, on October 22, 2012, David Lerner Associates, Inc., without admitting or denying, agreed to pay fines and restitution totaling $14 million.  Of that amount, David Lerner Associates, Inc. agreed to pay approximately $12 million in restitution to certain investors in Apple REIT Ten, a real estate investment trust formed by affiliates of two of the owners of our general partner. In addition, David Lerner, individually, without admitting or denying, was fined $250,000 and suspended for one year from the securities industry, followed by a two year suspension from acting as a principal.  While the order also imposed sanctions and penalties and fines on both David Lerner Associates, Inc. and David Lerner, individually, the order does not prohibit David Lerner Associates, Inc. from serving as the managing dealer for our best-efforts offering of common units. We do not believe this settlement will affect the administration of our common units.









	In the disciplinary actions, FINRA alleged that David Lerner Associates, Inc. failed to conduct adequate due diligence with respect to Apple REIT Ten, thereby leaving it without a reasonable basis for recommending customer purchases of Apple REIT Ten, in addition to using false, exaggerated and misleading statements regarding the performance of earlier closed Apple REIT programs.  FINRA also alleged that David Lerner Associates, Inc. made false, exaggerated and misleading communications to the public, through customer correspondence and investment seminars, about the investment returns, market values, performance of earlier closed Apple REITs as well as untrue statements and/or omitted material facts concerning the prior performance, steady distribution rates, unchanging valuations, and prospects of the earlier closed Apple REITs and/or Apple REIT Ten.

	Each potential investor must sign the subscription agreement found on pages B-1 to B-

	5

	. The partnership will promptly review each subscription and will accept or decline to accept you as limited partner in its sole and absolute discretion. If your subscription is accepted, you will be given prompt written confirmation of your admission to the partnership.




	 




	By your signature on the signature page of the subscription agreement (on page B-

	5

	), you are indicating your desire to become a limited partner and to be bound by all the terms of the Partnership Agreement. You also appoint the general partner to be your true and lawful attorney-in-fact to sign documents, including the Partnership Agreement, which may be required for your admission to the partnership.

	Table of Contents








	 




	Your signature and initials on the signature page of the subscription agreement also serve as your affirmation that the acknowledgments, agreements and representations printed in that section on page B-1 to B-

	3

	of the subscription agreement are true, by which you confirm, among other things, that:




	 










	·  






	you have received a copy of the prospectus at least five business days before tendering your subscription;







	 







	·  






	you have read the Important Information for Subscriber(s) on page B-3 of the subscription agreement;







	 







	·  






	you acknowledge that an investment in the common units is not a liquid investment;







	 







	·  






	you affirm that the partnership may rely on the accuracy of the factual data about yourself that you report in the subscription agreement, including your representation that:







	 








	(a)  






	if you are purchasing common units for an IRA, you have accurately identified the subscriber as such;







	 







	(b)  






	you have accurately identified yourself, or the investing entity, as a U.S. citizen, resident in the U.S. or Puerto Rico (individuals only) or a U.S. resident alien, having determined such status in the manner described below;







	 







	(c)  






	you have accurately reported your social security number or the federal taxpayer identification number of the investing entity;







	 







	(d)  






	you are not subject to backup withholding of federal income taxes; and







	 







	(e)  






	you agree to redeem all of your common units if you are no longer a U.S. citizen with a resident address in the United States or Puerto Rico (individuals only) or a resident alien, or if you otherwise are or become a foreign partner for purposes of Section 1446 of the Code at any point while holding Interests;







	 







	·  






	you meet the minimum income and net worth standards established by us; and







	 







	·  






	you are purchasing common units for your own account and not with a view to distribution.







	 




	The partnership will require that everyone who wishes to purchase the common units make these representations in order to assist FINRA ­registered securities sales representatives, selling dealers and the dealer manager in determining whether this investment is suitable for each subscriber. The partnership will rely upon the accuracy and completeness of your representations in the subscription agreement in complying with its obligations under state and federal securities laws.



	 



	The subscription agreement asks that you acknowledge receipt of this prospectus and of the instruction to rely only on information contained in this prospectus and certain related materials, including supplements to the prospectus and promotional brochures marked as being prepared by the partnership or by the dealer manager for use in connection with this offering, so that the partnership may make an informed judgment as to whether it should accept your offer to subscribe for the common units. While the partnership recognizes that in the sales process a potential investor will usually discuss an investment in the common units with his or her broker, it is possible that you may misunderstand what you are told or that someone might tell you something different from, or contrary to, the information contained in this prospectus. You might also read or hear something that contradicts the information contained in this prospectus.



	 



	If you become a limited partner and later make a claim against the partnership, the general partner and/or the dealer manager alleging that you did not receive a prospectus for this offering, or that although you received a prospectus you relied on information that is contradictory to that disclosed in this prospectus, then the partnership and its affiliates anticipate relying on the representations you made in your subscription agreement. Your signature on the subscription agreement is your acknowledgment that you received this prospectus and the instructions to rely exclusively on the information contained in the prospectus in making your investment decision. Do not sign the subscription agreement if you do not understand this section.




	 





	Instruction

	Concerning “Important Information”



	 





	The Important Information on page B-3 of the subscription agreement asks you to review the disclosures in this prospectus concerning certain conflicts of interest the partnership faces, certain risks involved in this investment and the management of the general partner.  These disclosures are found in the sections entitled “Risk Factors,” “Conflicts of Interest,” “Management” and “Federal Income Tax Consequences.”




	 






	The partnership included this instruction because, as this investment involves inherent conflicts of interest and risks, the partnership does not intend to admit you unless it has reason to believe that you are aware of the risks involved in this investment. If you become a limited partner and later make claims against the partnership, the general partner and/or the dealer manager to the effect that you were not aware that this investment involved the inherent risks described in this prospectus, the partnership, the general partner, and the dealer manager anticipate relying on this instruction as evidence that you were aware of the risks involved in this investment.




	 







	 






	103











	Table of Contents






	 






	Bin

	ding Effect of the Limited Partnership Agreement on You




	 




	The representation in the subscription agreement that you have agreed to all the terms and conditions of the Partnership Agreement is necessary because the general partner and every limited partner are bound by all of the terms and conditions of that agreement, notwithstanding the fact that investors do not actually sign the partnership agreement. Though you do not actually sign the Partnership Agreement, your signature on the subscription agreement gives the general partner the power of attorney pursuant to which it obligates you to be bound by each of the terms and conditions of the Partnership Agreement. If you become a limited partner and later make claims against the partnership, the general partner and/or the dealer manager that you did not agree to be bound by all of the terms of the Partnership Agreement and the subscription agreement, the partnership, the general partner and/or the dealer manager anticipate relying on your representation and on the power of attorney as evidence of your agreement to be bound by all of the terms of the Partnership Agreement and the subscription agreement.




	 





	Your

	Citizenship and Residency




	 




	All investors will be required to represent and warrant that they are either a United States citizen or a resident alien, each with an address in the United States. The partnership will not admit anyone who is either a United States citizen living outside of the United States or a non-resident of the United States. An investor will be required to tender to the partnership for sale, upon demand, all of its common units if such investor is no longer a United States citizen, resident in the United States or Puerto Rico (individuals only), or a resident alien or if an investor otherwise is or becomes a foreign partner for purposes of Section 1446 of the Code at any time while it is holding common units.




	 




	You will also be required to represent to us your state of residence.




	 




	Co-Signature By Selling Dealer




	 




	Selling dealers must countersign each subscription agreement for subscribers solicited by their firm. By this signature, the selling dealer certifies that it has obtained information from the potential investor sufficient to enable the selling dealer to determine that the investment is suitable for the investor based on the investor’s income, net worth and other characteristics. Since the general partner and the dealer manager will not have had the opportunity to obtain financial and other relevant information directly from you, the general partner and the dealer manager will rely on the selling dealer’s representation to determine whether to admit you as a limited partner (as you designate in your subscription agreement). If you become a limited partner and later make claims against the Partnership, the general partner and/or the dealer manager alleging that the common units were not a suitable investment because you did not meet the financial requirements contained in the investor suitability standards, the partnership, the general partner and the dealer manager anticipate relying upon the selling dealer’s representation (and your representation) as evidence that you did meet the financial requirements for this investment. FINRA’s Conduct Rules require that any person associated with the dealer manager or a selling dealer who sells or offers to sell common units must make every reasonable effort to ensure that a potential subscriber is a suitable investor for this investment in light of such subscriber’s age, education level, knowledge of investments, need for liquidity, net worth and other pertinent factors.




	 





	How to

	Subscribe




	 




	If you are an individual investor, you must personally sign the subscription agreement and deliver it, together with a check for all subscription monies payable in connection with your subscription, to a selling dealer. In the case of IRA, the trustee or custodian must also sign the subscription agreement. In the case of donor trusts or other trusts in which the donor is the fiduciary, the donor must sign the subscription agreement. In the case of other fiduciary accounts in which the donor neither exercises control over the account nor is a fiduciary of the account, the plan fiduciary alone may sign the subscription agreement.




	 






	Until subscriptions for 1,315,790 common units are received by the partnership, checks for the purchase of common units should be made payable to

	  “

	Branch Banking and Trust Company as escrow agent for Energy 11” . After the initial closing date, checks for the purchase of common units should be made payable to “ David Lerner Associates, Inc. ” for deposit in the subscriber’s brokerage account and David Lerner Associates will transmit a subscriber’s funds to the partnership on the next monthly closing date .

	SALES

	MATERIAL



	 



	In addition to this prospectus, the Partnership may use sales material in connection with the offering of its common units. In some jurisdictions, sales material may not be available. This material will include information relating to this offering, the general partner and to its affiliates, and may include brochures, articles, presentations for group meetings and publications about the oil and gas industry and oil and gas drilling partnerships. All advertisements of, and oral or written invitations to seminars or other group meetings at which common units are to be described, offered or sold will clearly indicate that the purpose of such meeting is to offer such common units, for sale, the minimum purchase price thereof, the suitability standards to be employed, and the name of the person selling the common units. If required by regulatory agencies, the Partnership will submit supplementary materials, including prepared presentations for group meetings, in advance of use, to such agencies, and will use only sales material that they have approved. The offering of the common units, however, is made only by means of this prospectus and all sales material used must either be preceded by or accompanied with this prospectus. Although the information contained in the sales material does not conflict with any of the information contained in this prospectus, the material does not purport to be complete and should not be considered as a part of this prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, or as incorporated in this prospectus by reference or as forming the basis of this offering of the common units.

The United States Energy Revolution






You've probably have heard about the shale energy boom happening in the United States right now. Thanks to hydraulic fracturing, the United States is producing more natural gas and oil than it ever has before and is closer to becoming energy independent each day. This revolution has supported 2.1 million jobs across all 50 states, created a manufacturing renaissance and contributed nearly $284 billion to the GDP. 

The United States is on a clear path to Energy Independence.
The Energy Information Administration estimates that energy imports and exports come into balance around 2028. From 2035 to 2040, energy exports account for about 23% of total annual U.S. energy production.

This energy revolution has created many investing opportunities. David Lerner Associates is proud to offer Energy 11, LP, a limited partnership investment program available exclusively for David Lerner Associates' clients.













Energy 11, LP






Energy 11, LP was formed in 2013 by Glade Knight and David McKenney of the Virginia-based Apple REIT companies, as well as Anthony Keating and Michael Mallick. 

The offering period for purchasing units of Energy 11, LP began on January 22, 2015 and concluded on April 24, 2017. At the conclusion of the offering period, David Lerner Associates had raised $374,322,962.

Energy 11, LP was formed to enable investors to invest in oil and gas properties located onshore in the United States. Primary objectives are:


to acquire producing and non-producing oil and gas properties with development potential, and to enhance the value of those properties through drilling and other development activities;
to make distributions to investors;
after five to seven years following the termination of this offering, to engage in a liquidity transaction in which they will sell properties and distribute the net sales proceeds to investors, merge with another entity or list common units on a national securities exchange; and
to enable common unitholders to invest in oil and gas properties in a tax efficient manner.

Energy 11, LP is a Delaware limited partnership formed to acquire and develop oil and gas properties located onshore in the United States. They seek to acquire working interests, leasehold interests, royalty interests, overriding royalty interests, production payments and other interests in producing and non-producing oil and gas properties. Recent developments include:


On December 18, 2015, Energy 11, LP acquired an 11% working interest in approximately 215 existing producing wells and approximately 262 future development locations in the Sanish field located in Mountrail County, North Dakota. 
In November of 2016, Energy 11, LP acquired an additional 11% working interest in the Sanish field assets for a total of approx. 22-23% total interest in the area.


Whiting Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:WLL), a publicly traded oil and gas company, operates the Sanish Field Assets.





Energy 11, LP was made available exclusively at David Lerner Associates and is no longer open to investors.

In addition, investors can have no more than 10% of their liquid net worth invested in non-publicly traded direct investment programs, including Energy 11, L.P.

Oil & Gas Industry Risks*The general partner of Energy 11, L.P. plans to invest its available cash in development of oil and gas properties, and does not intend to cause it to distribute more than the preferred distribution prior to commencing the sale of all or substantially all of their properties, which the general partner does not anticipate will occur until at least five years after the termination of this offering.


If oil, natural gas or other hydrocarbon prices remain depressed for a prolonged period, the cash flows from operations will decline and Energy 11, L.P. may have to lower distributions or may not be able to pay distributions at all.
If unable to find suitable prospects and properties, Energy 11, L.P.  may not be able to achieve their investment objectives or pay distributions. They may experience delays in locating oil and gas properties to acquire.
Properties that Energy 11, L.P.  buys or develops may not produce as projected and they may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities, which could adversely affect cash available for distribution.
The hedging activities of Energy 11, L.P.  will expose it to counter-party credit risk and could result in financial losses or could reduce its net income, which may adversely affect its ability to pay cash distributions to holders of common units.
Energy 11, L.P.  plans to rely on drilling to fully develop the properties acquired. If drilling is unsuccessful, cash available for distributions and financial condition will be adversely affected.
Energy 11, L.P.  may be unable to compete effectively with larger companies and may not be able to implement new technology as efficiently as larger companies, which may adversely affect its ability to generate sufficient revenue and its ability to pay distributions to holders of common units and service debt obligations.
The financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if Energy 11, L.P. incurs costs and liabilities due to a failure to comply with environmental regulations or a release of hazardous substances into the environment.
Energy 11, L.P.  is subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting operations.
Significant physical effects of climatic change have the potential to damage facilities, disrupt production activities and cause Energy 11, L.P.  to incur significant costs in preparing for, or responding to, those effects.
Federal legislation and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays and more widespread or prolonged moratoriums or prohibitions of hydraulic fracturing could, depending on the makeup of our assets, cause the partnership to cease business operations.

Energy 11, L.P. Risk Factors*
	An investment in the common units is an illiquid, non-traded investment. Energy 11, L.P.  may be unable to sell its properties, merge or list the common units on a national securities exchange to achieve liquidity within its planned timeline of five(5) to seven(7) years after the termination of this offering, or at all.


The Partnership has limited prior operating history, no established financing sources, and this is the first oil and gas program sponsored by the general partner and its affiliates.
This offering is a blind pool because the general partner has not identified all of the properties it will acquire with future proceeds of this offering.
The distributions to common unit holders may not be sourced from cash generated from operations but from offering proceeds, return of investor capital, or indebtedness, and this will decrease distributions in the future. A portion of cash distributions are expected to be made out of the capital contributions received from purchasers of common units.
Energy 11, L.P. cannot guarantee any investment return or the amount or frequency of any distributions it may make or that distributions will be sufficient to pay your tax liability attributable to your ownership of common units.
The general partner and the Manager will be subject to conflicts of interest, including that affiliates of the owners of the general partner have made investments in and loans to affiliates of the Manager. The Partnership Agreement limits the general partner's fiduciary duties to Energy 11, L.P.  in connection with these conflicts of interest.
Holders of common units have limited voting rights and will not be able to remove the general partner if they are dissatisfied with the manner in which the general partner manages the business. 
Energy 11, L.P.  will depend on the Manager to identify investment opportunities and provide Energy 11, L.P. services necessary to operate its business. If the Manager is unable or unwilling to identify opportunities and provide these services, it would result in disruption in business, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to make cash distributions to holders of our common units and service our debt obligations 
The Manager, which will manage the business under the Management Agreement, is a newly formed entity with limited operating history. The Management Agreement limits the Manager’s liability to us for monetary damages and the Manager, as a newly formed entity, is not expected to possess significant assets other than the Management Agreement, which would make collection of any monetary damages against the Manager unlikely.
The Manager may be subject to conflicts of interest in managing business under the Management Agreement.
Under the Management Agreement, the Manager will not be liable to Energy 11, L.P.  for damages unless the Manager is grossly negligent or engages in intentional misconduct, and even if the Manager is determined to have been grossly negligent or engaged in intentional misconduct, the Manager is a newly formed entity with only nominal assets;
Affiliates of the Manager will compete with Energy 11, L.P.  in investing in and developing oil and gas properties and they are expected to provide comparable management services to similarly situated unaffiliated oil and gas investment programs.
Energy 11, L.P.  will be subject to the operating and other risks of owning and developing oil and gas properties, including environmental and operational risks, risks of reductions in the prices of oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbons produced, risks associated with hedging production, and regulatory risks.
Limited Partners of Energy 11 will be subject to tax risks:

You may be required to pay taxes on income from Energy 11, L.P.  even if you do not receive any cash distributions.
Tax gain or loss on disposition of common units could be more or less than expected.
Holders of common units may be subject to state and local taxes and tax return filing requirements in states where they do not live as a result of investing in Energy 11, L.P.  units.
Certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.

Federal legislation and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing in areas where Energy 11, L.P.  acquires producing properties could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays and could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that is ultimately produced.
The status of Energy 11, L.P. as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act may make it more difficult to raise capital in this offering. 

Sanish Field Assets Acquisition


Energy 11, L.P.  will need additional funding post-closing of the acquisition of the Sanish Field Assets in order to retain its full interest therein. Energy 11, L.P.  will have limited control over the activities on properties they do not operate.

*Investors should read the prospectus, starting at page 20, for a more comprehensive and detailed description of the risk factors.
