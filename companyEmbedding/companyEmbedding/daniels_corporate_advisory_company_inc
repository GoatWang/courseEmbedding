(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, included elsewhere within this report. The Annual Report on Form 10-K/A contains forward-looking statements including statements using terminology such as "can", "may", "believe", "designated to", "will", "expect", "plan", "anticipate", "estimate", "potential" or "continue", or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology regarding beliefs, plans, expectations or intentions regarding the future. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they:  - discuss our future expectations;  - contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial condition; and  - state other "forward-looking" information.  We believe it is important to communicate our expectations. However, forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under "Risk Factors," "Business" and elsewhere in this report. All forward-looking statements and risk factors included in this document are made as of the date hereof, based on information available to us as of the date thereof, and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statement or risk factor, unless we are required to do so by law.  Organizational Overview  The company has a growth goal of providing advisory services to business services as well as non-business services client companies. The company works with companies seeking to create and/or acquire adjunct service businesses, whose services will initially provide better lifestyles for its existing workforce, and ultimately will be packaged, on an additional profit center basis, for sale to other small companies for the retention of their employees. The profits generated from all the financial consulting assignments will be available for venture investment in public or private client companies, as well as other quality business concept/operating companies, both public and private; through the Daniels' Merchant Bank Division.  The Daniels Merchant Bank has an in-house equity funding program, whereby Daniels will participate in consulting client potential growth by helping finance the growth of public and private client, business service companies, as well as non-business service companies. The Merchant Bank will also participate in non-client potential growth by the purchase of equity in attractive small public companies whose growth strategies are in line with a philosophy of growth through leveraged acquisitions.  General  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Critical Accounting Policies  Financial Reporting Release No. 60, published by the SEC, recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations and we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates.  We believe that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.  The accounting policies identified as critical are as follows:  - Revenue recognition;  - Fair value of assets.  - Use of estimates  Revenue Recognition  Revenues are derived from research, development, qualification and production testing for certain commercial products.  Revenue from fixed price testing contracts is generally recorded upon completion of the contracts, which are generally short-term, or upon completion of identifiable contractual tasks. At the time we enter into a contract that includes multiple tasks, we estimate the amount of actual labor and other costs that will be required to complete each task based on historical experience. Revenues are recognized which provide for a profit margin relative to the testing performed. Revenue relative to each task and from contracts which are time and materials based is recorded as effort is expended. Billings in excess of amounts earned are deferred. Any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to income when identified. To the extent management does not accurately forecast the level of effort required to complete a contract, or individual tasks within a contract, and we are unable to negotiate additional billings with a customer for cost over-runs, we may incur losses on individual contracts. All selling, general and administrative costs are treated as period costs and expensed as incurred.  For revenue from product sales, we recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-10, Revenue Recognition ("ASC 605-10"). ASC 605-10 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. We defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that we and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.  ASC 605-10 incorporates Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 605-25, Multiple-Element Arraignments ("ASC 605-25"). ASC 605-25 addresses accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The effect of implementing ASC 605-25 on our financial position and results of operations was not significant.  Fair Value of Assets  The Company has adopted the standard FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC 820) " Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures " which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between  ? Level 1-Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. ? Level 2-Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability; either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g. interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.  The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These financial instruments include investments in available-for-sale securities and accounts payable and accrued expenses. The Company has also applied ASC 820 for all non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The adoption of ASC 820 for non-financial assets and liabilities did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.  Use of Estimates  In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our primary source of liquidity has been the operating profits of our logistics subsidiary. As of November 30, 2014, we had $89,538 in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of $410,041.  Financing Activities  We will have to raise capital by means of borrowings or through a private placement or a subsequent registered offering.. At present, we do not have any commitments with respect to future financings. If we are unable to raise adequate capital, in the near term, to finance all phases of a client corporate consulting assignment, our proposed business will experience slow growth because it will be very hard to compete for business without a sound capital base to support advisory and implementation efforts on our suggested corporate growth strategies.  At present, we do have sufficient capital on hand to fund very limited operations for the immediate future. Our consulting income on current and expected assignments (and continued support from Arthur D. Viola, our sole officer and director, is believed to be sufficient to support current capital demands. Management estimates that we will need at least $2 million to fund client corporate development consulting projects over the next 12 months. However, even if limited funds are raised, consulting services can still be provided for Phase One of assignments, (the providing of consulting expertise). Phase Two, (the providing of short term capital to client companies), will have to be curtailed because of a limited capital raise or be provided by Mr. Viola and/or a joint-venture partner who will share in the potential revenues from Phase Two portions of any project. This joint-venture sharing will limit the amount of profit we can earn in any one project.  Limited growth prospects, because of lack of sufficient capital to implement results of corporate consulting assignments, may very well not produce sufficient profit to cover the costs that will now be incurred by Daniels Corporate Advisory. Legal and accounting expenses are significant for a reporting company and we will have to cover them out of limited consulting operations fees due to lack of adequate funding. This may place additional constraints on the growth prospects of Daniels Corporate Advisory as it may have to curtail added assignments for lack of adequate working capital to manage these new assignments. If sufficient capital is not raised over the next 12 months, the limited consulting assignments current available will not be sufficient to sustain our long term operations as a public company, and we could fail.  Comparison of the Year Ended November 30, 2014 to the Year Ended November 30, 2013  Revenues  Sales for the year ended November 30, 2014 were $739,586 compared to $131,360 for the year ended November 30, 2013 an increase of $608,226. All of our 2014 revenue was from logistics which operated for twelve months as opposed to one month of activity in 2013.  Cost of Sales  During the year ended November 30, 2014, we incurred $446,334 in expenses, compared to $28,664 in the same period ended November 30, 2013 an increase of $417,670. This is cost of sales relating solely to our logistics subsidiary started in the prior year.  Operating Expenses  During the year ended November 30, 2014, we incurred $424,520 in expenses, compared to $212,642 the same period ended November 30, 2013 an increase of $211,877. Our expenses was about the same year over year except for stock issued as wages in 2014 for $218,000. There was zero in 2013.  Other Income and Expenses  During the year ended November 30, 2014, we incurred a net income of $502,998 in other items, compared to $27,052 in net expense in the same period ended November 30, 2013 an increase of $26,252. Our major 2014 other income was $500,000 of debt forgiveness. In 2013 the Company had debt forgiveness of $78,426 which was offset by an impairment charge on an investment of $103,800.  Net Income  The Company had a net income for the year ended November 30, 2014 of $297,899 compared to a net loss of $5,303 for the year ended November 30, 2013. This increase of $303,202 was in majority due to the due to our increase in logistics activity as described above.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  None.  Inflation  We believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the two years ended November 30, 2014 and 2013, and since inflation rates have generally remained at relatively low levels our operations are not otherwise uniquely affected by inflation concerns.  Going Concern  The accompanying audited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this filing have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles that contemplate our continuance as a going concern. Our auditors, in their report, have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as going concern. Our cash position may be inadequate to pay all of the costs associated with the testing, production and marketing of our products. Management intends to use borrowings and the sale of equity or convertible debt to mitigate the effects of its cash position, however no assurance can be given that debt or equity financing, if and when required will be available. The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue existence.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  There are no other new accounting pronouncements adopted or enacted during the year ended November 30, 2014 that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our financial statements.

(  OTCQB :  DCAC ) ("the Company") is pleased to announce that the corporation and Board of Directors is set to issue a specific class of Anti-Dilutive Convertible Preferred Securities to all of its common shareholders.CEO Arthur D. Viola states, "We are removing the compounding convertible debt off our balance sheet because it is a derivative liability that would have hampered DCAC's future growth prospects. We knew that signing off on these issuance resolutions might create fluctuation in shareholder value, but it was a necessary step forward, in order to attract new equity to our balance sheet, and start meeting the objectives of our New Agenda. We have thus come up with a solution to protect our stockholders from the losses they incurred in the open market."DCAC will issue one (1) Restricted Anti-Dilutive Convertible Preferred Share of the Company for every 100,000 shares held as of Record Date April 15th, 2016, to stockholders who are on the NOBO list.These shares are priced at $2.50 per share, but convert at a par value .00001. These Restricted Convertible Preferred shares will serve as the redemption for the dilution of shareholders investments in the open market, through the debt conversions.The shares are restricted for six months. Upon maturity, the Company will ask preferred stockholders to convert 1 or 2 preferred shares into 100,000 / 200,000 common shares, through a Transfer Agent. Each shareholder keeps their present common shares and will be required to show proof of purchase, which can include a processed cheque, bank statement, wire receipt or other verifiable evidence of each purchase."The Company is also negotiating to acquire several profitable enterprises as wholly owned subsidiaries, for Convertible Preferred Stock to meet the $4,000,000 shareholder equity threshold to qualify for a listing on a NYSE MKT," adds Viola. "Much more information will be forthcoming on these companies as DCAC moves to closure on each of these agreements.""We thank all shareholders for their continued support. As we meet certain milestones, the investment community will be more thoroughly aware of this through our disclosures and public records," closes Viola.Safe Harbor StatementThis release includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E and/or 27E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are based upon assumptions that in the future may prove not to have been accurate and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including statements as to the future performance of the company and the risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
