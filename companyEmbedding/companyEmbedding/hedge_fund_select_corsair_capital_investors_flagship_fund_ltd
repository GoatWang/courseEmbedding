The firm has begun offering its wealthiest customers the opportunity to invest in about a half-dozen hedge funds, according to regulatory filings, including well-known names like Brevan Howard and Jana Partners, without having to go to the funds themselves, which require much higher minimum investments. The new offering, called Hedge Fund Select, is similar to products that other big brokers like Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp's Merrill Lynch division have offered for many years. But the model is new to Goldman, which has historically preferred to market its own hedge fund products, or steer customers into a so-called fund-of-funds that spreads money between an array of portfolios. Over the years, some clients of Goldman have complained that the firm's own hedge funds have performed poorly, while its outside hedge fund offerings were not as robust as those at other Wall Street firms. With the new arrangement, Goldman clients who have $25 million or more with the investment bank can invest in the funds on the Hedge Fund Select platform, according to a person familiar with the product. There is a minimum $500,000 investment in any single fund, and Goldman will earn a 1 percent fee on the money invested with any particular fund. A big name hedge fund typically requires an investor to put in at least $1 million. A bank that boasts a hedge fund platform can reduce the minimum investment needed because it pools all its customers' money together into a single portfolio. And Wall Street hedge fund platforms sometimes offer shorter redemption periods than the underlying funds. So far, 10 funds have been incorporated for Hedge Fund Select, which Goldman began rolling out this summer. Regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show that Goldman has begun raising money for five funds, and a person familiar with the situation said the firm may offer its customers as many as a dozen hedge funds to choose from. Goldman spokeswoman Andrea Raphael declined to comment. Goldman has been making subtle changes to its $836 billion asset management division for the past couple of years in an effort to boost profits as fees have declined and some of its own funds have struggled to produce big gains. Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) underwent a management overhaul last year and shuttered its Global Alpha Fund after the quantitative fund lost more than $10 billion from its 2007 peak. The new hedge fund offering is being rolled out at a time when the hedge fund industry has lost its swagger as the smartest investors on Wall Street. Through the end of August, hedge funds gained around 4 percent, lagging well behind total returns of 13.5 percent in the benchmark S&P 500 index, according to Credit Suisse. The effort by Goldman appears to be getting off to a slow start. An SEC filing reveals that a Hedge Fund Select portfolio that invests in a Brevan Howard fund had raised just $500,000 as of August. And a Hedge Fund Select portfolio that invests in an Eminence Partners Fund had raised $2 million. Other managers on the Hedge Fund Select platform that have already raised capital include Bocage Global Resources, a commodity-focused fund run by former Caxton Associates trader Kurt Billick, and New York-based Select Equity Group, which specializes in trading stocks. Corsair Capital and Brigade Capital Management have also registered an entity with the GSAM entity, according to a filing with the SEC. The hedge funds Goldman is offering to its customers either declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. The new hedge fund offering is consistent with the terms of the Volcker rule, which allows Wall Street firms to offer hedge funds but limits the amount of firm capital that can be invested in those funds.

Goldman Sachs Adds New Funds to Hedge Fund Platform


					October 16, 2013

Goldman Sachs





					The firm's Hedge Fund Select platform allows clients to access brand-name hedge funds with less money than is typically required. 
				



Goldman Sachs has added three funds to its Hedge Fund Select
    platform, which allows its clients to invest in well-regarded
    and in some cases brand-name hedge funds with much lower
    minimums than the underlying fund would charge.
The investment bank disclosed in separate filings Tuesday
    that it has launched Hedge Fund Select: Halcyon Partners
    Offshore, Hedge Fund Select: Dymon Asia Macro Fund and Hedge
    Fund Select: Corsair Capital Investors Flagship Fund. This
    brings to 16 the number of funds it has introduced under this
    format since last September. Other funds on the platform
    include those run by Alan Howard’s London-based
    Brevan Howard Asset Management, Barry Rosenstein’s
    New York-based Jana Partners and Paul Tudor Jones
    II’s Greenwich, Connecticut-based Tudor Investment
    Corp.
Goldman only requires Hedge Fund Select investors to plunk
    down $500,000 for each of the funds, compared with a minimum of
    $1 million to $5 million typically required by the underlying
    firms. However, there is a catch: A client must have at least
    $25 million invested with Goldman altogether.
Having Goldman’s imprimatur, however, does not
    guarantee superior performance. Many of the underlying funds
    that Goldman is offering to its clients have produced mediocre
    performance of late.
For example, the Brevan Howard Multi-Strategy Fund was down
    0.50 percent through August after rising just 4.61 percent in
    2012. The Dymon Asia Macro Fund, run by Singapore-based Dymon
    Asia Capital, lost nearly 1 percent in September and is now up
    just 5.68 percent for the first nine months. It rose less than
    1 percent last year. (To be fair, the fund was up a stellar
    20.11 percent in 2011 and 15.23 percent in 2010.)
David Chan, who last year joined Dymon Asia as chief
    executive officer, was previously the head of macro trading at
    Goldman in Asia. Firm founder Danny Yong also worked on the
    Goldman macro desk. The firm was initially seeded, in part, by
    Tudor as well as several of its partners and employees.
Greenwich, Connecticut-based Tudor Discretionary Macro Fund,
    a multi-manager fund, lost 2 percent last month and is up 8.19
    percent through the first three quarters. It gained just 2.82
    percent in the half year of its existence in 2012.
Halcyon Partners Offshore, managed by New York-based Halcyon
    Asset Management, lost 0.42 percent last month through
    September 27, putting its gains for the year at 5.68 percent.
    It rose 11.24 percent in 2012.
Perhaps the best performing fund on the Goldman platform is
    Jana Partners Qualified, one of the offerings from
    Rosenstein’s activist fund family. It rose 3.20
    percent in September and is now up 14.3 percent through the
    first three quarters of the year.
