If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

Asset Allocation Model Portfolios











InR Process

                                We use the same process consistently in working with our clients to optimize their retirement program.
                            


Risk Tolerance

                                Conservative. Moderate. Aggressive. How much risk are you willing to take on? It correlates to your comfort level.
                            


Time Horizon

                               At what age do you want to retire? The longer the time, research shows that the expected return diminishes.  
                            


Financial Need

                                Have you decided what you want to do after your retire? Do you know how much money you will need to live the life you want?

Personal Investors












Getting Retirement Ready
Our entire program is built upon helping investors manage their retirement funds based on their risk acceptance level, time horizon, and other important factors.
InR Advisory Services strives to achieve success by bringing the same institutional approach used in large pension management to individual investors. Academic research has shown that a proper asset allocation strategy accounts for 90% of your return.* InR has concentrated on developing risk-based models ranging from conservative to aggressive that will provide probable expected returns over time. This is extremely important when investors are making decisions based on the projected returns of the models. This same academic research has shown that using low-cost passive or index investments from firms such as Vanguard® is more likely to lead to expected returns.
Traditional IRA – Allows individuals to direct pre-tax income, up to specific annual limits, toward investments that can grow tax-deferred. Distributions are taxed.
Roth IRA – Contributions are not tax deductible and qualified distributions are tax free. Non-qualified distributions may be subject to penalty.
Personal and Joint Taxable Accounts – If you are saving long-term for something other than retirement, we use low cost index funds. Index funds are less likely to distribute taxable capital gains to you, although this is not guaranteed.

The first step in this process is to answer the InR risk assessment questionnaire by clicking the link to the right. Answering these questions will provide us with a blueprint for what your retirement can look like based on your current retirement savings, the risk you want to take, when you want to retire, and how much money you will need to live the lifestyle you want after you stop working.


Questionnaire


If you are interested in working with InR, please contact us at 1-877-InR-1733 to schedule an appointment to set up a Traditional or Roth IRA using our process or contact us.

Navigating Today for Your Tomorrow
We build retirement solutions that support the plan sponsors / trustees we work with. 
Our guidance helps fulfill the highest level of fiduciary responsibility required. We accept fiduciary responsibility in writing for the investments in the plans we manage. We submit our practices to peer review by an independent credentialing firm named Dalbar. They follow the Department of Labor guidelines and issue an opinion letter confirming that our process meets or exceeds the DOL guidelines.

We’re dedicated to helping make clients’ financial goals a reality.
Our customized approach, leading-edge software, and investment vehicles allow you to help you offer your employees confidence during their working years—and a secure transition into retirement.

We focus on the needs of plan participants.
The InR Philosophy provides a methodology that is designed to drive economic stability. We follow the InR Principles of Successful Investing: Choose the proper allocation, rebalance every quarter, stay the course!

We offer a low-cost investment approach.
Our goal is to see to it that more of your money is converted into investment dollars. We educate our participants not to make common mistakes—like chasing returns or not developing a plan based upon risk tolerance, time, and other important factors.
