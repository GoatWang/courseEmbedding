To have and maintain a healthy head of hair, there are many products available to help you accomplish just that. shampoos, conditioners, styling and cutting tools, hair brushes and much more all might become part of your daily ritual to keep your hair looking good. With low prices, every day, on everything, you can get the hair care supplies you need for less. Here's how to figure out what you need.ShampoosNo matter what type of hair you have, there's a shampoo just for you. There are shampoos specific to men's, women's and children's hair. Other hair conditions that shampoo can improve include dandruff, oily hair or frizzy hair. If you have dry or damaged hair, there are hydrating shampoos that can reverse the damage. Fine, thin hair is easy to protect and improve through the use of shampoos designed to add volume and texture. For simplicity, there are also shampoos and conditioners combined into one product.ConditionersConditioners help maintain various types of hair as well. If you have color-treated hair, it helps to use a conditioner that maintains the color and retains the treatment longer. All types of hair can benefit from the proper conditioner, including curly, frizzy, thick, long, straight, dry, oily and fine hair. Some conditioners are those that you massage into your hair, then rinse out immediately. Some, you massage in and leave in for a few minutes. There are even some conditioners that require you to leave them in overnight, especially if you have damaged or heat-styled hair.Hair coloring productsWhen choosing hair coloring products, the two most common reasons are to change the color of your hair or to address a specific issue, such as creating highlights in your hair or covering up some gray hair. Although hair coloring can be gender- and age-specific, most people can use any type of hair coloring. Some hair coloring products are extremely simple to use and just require you to brush the color in or even lather the color, much like you'd with shampoo. When coloring your hair, the time involved is directly related to how much you're changing the color. If you're just changing your shade slightly, the time involved is minimal. However, if you're going dark brown to light blonde, for example, there are several steps involved and a great deal of time involved. There are also temporary hair colors you can add in, representing many assorted colors   including those not normally found on hair   that naturally wash out after several showers.Styling productsProbably no tool is more important when it comes to styling hair than the hair dryer. These powerful devices allow you to both blow dry your hair and style it at the same time. hair dryers reduce the amount of time it takes to dry your hair by a great deal. Hair dryers are available by the amount of wattage they use and what type of accessories they have. Many hair dryers run on 1,875 watts but can have fewer than 1,000 watts and more than 2,000 watts. If you use curlers or prefer that salon-like feeling while at home, there are also bonnet-style hair dryers that cover your head completely.A couple of other key styling tools for hair are curling irons and flat irons. Although they work much the same way, one makes small or large curls, and the other one flattens and straightens hair   both with heat. Both types of irons are available in varied sizes, with most being between 3/4 of an inch to 2 inches wide. Larger sizes work best on thicker hair.Other hair care productsAll of the styling you want to do with your hair is much easier with a good hair brush or comb to remove tangles and smooth things out. Some common types include natural, synthetic and mixed bristle brushes that are either paddle, vented, round, teasing or wet brushes. Bristle brushes are good for using with long hair, and synthetic or mixed bristle brushes don't create as much static as natural bristle brushes. Natural bristle brushes are soft and help spread your hair's natural oils throughout your hair, making it look shiny.Paddle brushes are flat and wide and work well when doing a blowout on your hair. Vented brushes, with their increased airflow, help cut down drying time even more. Round brushes also work well when doing a blowout and help create extra volume. Teasing brushes allow you to tease the ends of your hair in different styles for more volume. Rattail combs make it easier for you to section hair for braids and other styles. Wide-tooth combs are easier on your hair when it's wet and reduce breakage.For holding hair in place, you can use barrettes, French combs, claw clips, snap clips, headbands, bobby pins or elastic bands. These allow you to hold your hair in different styles, such as ponytails, pigtails, updos and French twists.Show moreElectrode, Comp-167700713, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35.
