Dona D. Young Retires From The Phoenix Companies Inc.



The Hartford Courant




Dona D. Young retired Wednesday as chairman, president and chief executive of The Phoenix Companies Inc., leaving the 158-year-old Hartford company, which is struggling against daunting odds, in the hands of incoming CEO James D. Wehr.Wehr, who has been senior executive vice president and chief investment officer, starts today as president, chief executive and a member of the board, as previously announced.Young, 55, who had spent 29 years at Phoenix — six of them as CEO — retires with accumulated pension benefits that totaled $14.6 million as of Dec. 31. She will now serve as a consultant to Phoenix for one year for $300,000.Young has said that her retirement was purely her decision. But at least some analysts and investors believe that she was finally pressured to leave after many years of turnaround efforts that ran into a meltdown of credit and equity markets and a deepening recession.Phoenix has suffered investment losses and multiple ratings downgrades, which led to the loss of distributors, including its two largest — State Farm and National Life Group. Phoenix has moved to preserve capital by eliminating its shareholder dividend and announcing a cut of 25 percent of its workforce — 250 employees companywide.Last week, Phoenix said that it is "well capitalized and does not face imminent capital needs."Wehr is expected to continue with the revised strategy that Phoenix announced Feb. 27, shortly before State Farm suspended sales of Phoenix products. In the new game plan, Phoenix is trying to expand alternative retirement product offerings, develop new distribution channels for its main product offerings and find partners for private labeling ventures.The company's stock closed up 9 cents at $1.95 a share Wednesday in a rising market.

HARTFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Phoenix Companies, Inc. (NYSE: PNX) today announced that Dona D. 
      Young, chairman, president and chief executive officer, will retire from 
      the company after 29 years. As a result, James D. Wehr, senior executive 
      vice president and chief investment officer, has been promoted to 
      president and chief executive officer and will join the Phoenix Board of 
      Directors. Thomas S. Johnson was named non-executive chairman. All 
      changes will be effective April 15, 2009. Mrs. Young will step down from 
      the Board of Directors and will become a consultant to the company for 
      one year.
    


      “Dona Young’s commitment to this company and its people is unmatched,” 
      said Peter C. Browning, Phoenix’s lead director. “She has been CEO 
      during one of the most difficult periods in the company’s 158-year 
      history, and throughout those six years, demonstrated steadfast 
      leadership, courage and foresight. She leaves Phoenix with many core 
      strengths that will stand it in good stead during these difficult times, 
      and we are very grateful for her dedicated service.”
    

      “Jim Wehr has significant investment experience, including managing the 
      portfolio for our insurance and annuity business. He has skillfully 
      taken the right steps to assure that our investments meet our criteria 
      for preserving value for shareholders and delivering the security our 
      customers expect,” Mr. Browning said. “His financial markets experience 
      will serve the company well during these unprecedented times.”
    

      Mrs. Young commented, “My entire career has been at Phoenix, which made 
      this a particularly difficult decision. Ultimately, however, I 
      determined that it was the right time to make the change for the company 
      and for my family. Obviously, the past several months have been 
      challenging as never before, and Jim Wehr’s deep market expertise has 
      been invaluable. Clearly, Jim is ready to lead the company at this 
      critical point in its history. The management team is deep and strong, 
      and the Board is experienced and resourceful. I look forward to working 
      with Jim and the Board to assure a seamless transition and as a 
      consultant for the next year.”
    

      “I am excited by this opportunity,” said Mr. Wehr. “Although it will not 
      be easy, I am fortunate to have a great management team and Board, and 
      together we will continue to take the decisive steps necessary to 
      advance the company for our shareholders, customers and business 
      partners. I want to thank Dona for her leadership and counsel, 
      particularly over the last few years, and I am pleased to have benefit 
      of her counsel for the next 12 months.”
    

      Mrs. Young, 55, joined Phoenix as an attorney in 1980 after serving as a 
      summer law intern in 1979. She progressed through increasingly 
      responsible positions in law, reinsurance, sales and marketing, and 
      operations and was named chairman, president and chief executive officer 
      in 2003. Mrs. Young holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in political 
      science from Drew University and a law degree from the University of 
      Connecticut.
    

      Mr. Wehr, 51, joined Phoenix in 1981 and has held a series of 
      increasingly senior investment positions, including credit research, 
      trading and portfolio management. He has served as chief investment 
      officer since 2004, was named executive vice president in 2005, and 
      senior executive vice president in 2007. Mr. Wehr has a bachelor’s 
      degree from Fairfield University and a master of business administration 
      from the University of Connecticut.
    

      Mr. Johnson, 68, joined Phoenix’s Board in 2000 and serves as chairman 
      of the compensation committee. He is the retired chairman and chief 
      executive officer of GreenPoint Financial Corporation, where he served 
      from 1993 to 2004, was president and director of Manufacturers Hanover 
      Trust Company and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. from 1989 to 1991, and is 
      also a director of R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company, Inc. and Alleghany 
      Corporation. Mr. Johnson has a bachelor’s degree from Trinity College 
      and a master of business administration from Harvard Business School.

      intend for these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe 
      harbor provisions of the federal securities laws relating to 
      forward-looking statements. These include statements relating to 
      trends in, or representing management’s beliefs about, our future 
      transactions, strategies, operations and financial results, as well as 
      other statements, including but not limited to, words such as 
      “anticipate,” “believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” 
      “may,” “should” and other similar expressions. Forward-looking 
      statements are made based upon our current expectations and beliefs 
      concerning trends and future developments and their potential effects on 
      the company. They are not guarantees of future performance. Our 
      actual business, financial condition and results of operations may 
      differ materially from those suggested by forward-looking statements as 
      a result of risks and uncertainties, which include, among others: (i) unfavorable 
      general economic developments including, but not limited to, specific 
      related factors such as the performance of the debt and equity markets 
      and changes in interest rates; (ii) the effect of continuing adverse 
      capital and credit market conditions on our ability to meet our 
      liquidity needs, our access to capital and our cost of capital; (iii) 
      the possibility of losses due to defaults by others including, but not 
      limited to, issuers of fixed income securities; (iv) changes in our 
      investment valuations based on changes in our valuation methodologies, 
      estimations and assumptions; (v) the effect of guaranteed benefits

      amount of our statutory capital due to factors beyond our control; (vii) 
      downgrades in our debt or financial strength ratings; (viii) the 
      possibility that mortality rates, persistency rates, funding levels or 
      other factors may differ significantly from our pricing expectations;

      generally and the inability or unwillingness of our reinsurers to meet 
      their obligations to us specifically; (x) our dependence on 
      non-affiliated distributors for our product sales; (xi) our dependence 
      on third parties to maintain critical business and administrative

      competitive environment; (xiii) the strong competition we face in our 
      business from banks, insurance companies and other financial services 
      firms; (xiv) our reliance, as a holding company, on dividends and other 
      payments from our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations and pay 
      future dividends, particularly since our insurance subsidiaries’ ability 
      to pay dividends is subject to regulatory restrictions; (xv) the 
      potential need to fund deficiencies in our Closed Block; (xvi) tax 
      developments that may affect us directly, or indirectly through the cost 
      of, the demand for or profitability of our products or services; (xvii) 
      the possibility that the actions and initiatives of the U.S. Government, 
      including those that we elect to participate in, may not improve adverse 
      economic and market conditions generally or our business, financial 
      condition and results of operations specifically (xviii) other 
      legislative or regulatory developments; (xix) legal or regulatory 
      actions; (xx) changes in accounting standards; (xxi) the potential

      control over financial reporting on the accuracy of our reported 
      financial results; and (xxiii) other risks and uncertainties described
