Welcome, 
Over the past ten years, I’ve had the opportunity to watch an interest turn into a hobby, and eventually, into a creative passion that never seems to feel like “work.”  Every time I pick up the camera, my creativity is sparked, my vision is cleared, and my view of the world is opened wider.

I never grow tired of pursuing intriguing images, and I hope you’ll enjoy the results.

All the best,

I’ve had the extreme good  fortune to work with politicians, championship coaches and athletes,  best-selling authors, television personalities, entertainers, business  professionals and actors at all levels.  No matter your occupation (or  aspiration!) a great head shot separates you from your peers and  showcases your energy, confidence and charisma.                 

My basic actor’s head shot package includes two  different looks, online proofing and digital retouching on one image  from each look - all for $250.
Feel free to contact me for all the details. request more info..
