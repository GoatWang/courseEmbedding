How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Morgan Michael C carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Morgan Michael C



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Morgan Michael C



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Morgan Michael C



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Prop Store - Ultimate Movie Collectables



























Dexter (TV Series)


                SEASONS 1-8 Dexter Morgan’s (Michael C. Hall) Kill Room Costume
            
Stock # 68346








































Share









Description


Dexter Morgan’s (Michael C. Hall) kill room costume from the hit Showtime Original Series, Dexter. Throughout the series, Dexter often wears an olive green jumpsuit and apron when taking another victim in his kill room. Dexter’s kill room costume includes an olive green henley shirt, green jumpsuit, black apron, arm sleeves, gloves, and boots. The Schneeman Studios Ltd. Jumpsuit is made of synthetic green material with a mesh lining.  The faux leather apron has a neck strap and hip ties. The Stansport brand boots (size 9) are made of black rubber. Paired with the costume are two production wardrobe tags, one referencing a kill costume from episode 806 ‘A Little Reflection,’ though the size of the boots noted does not coincide with those included in the lot. Elements of this lot show light wear but remain in good condition.

This item comes with a Prop Store Certificate of Authenticity.
