The total gross proceeds to us from this offering, before expenses, underwriting
discounts and commissions, are expected to be approximately $50,000,000, based
on an assumed offering price of $10.00  per share (which is the midpoint of the

proceeds to us from this offering and third-party mortgage financing for
acquisitions of real properties and for general working capital as follows: 

Net proceeds of the offering                                          $   45,000,000

Proceeds from mortgage refinancings net of

Net Refinancings and Repayments                                       $    7,549,103
General working capital, including offering                                       
expenses                                                                  11,008,897
                                                                                   
Total Use of Proceeds                                                 $   45,000,000

(1) In connection with our acquisition of the Castle Hills ESSC, we will 
    purchase up to $1,600,000 of the Class B OPCO Units that will be issued in  
    connection with the Castle Hills property at a price per unit that is equal 
    to 85% of the initial offering price per share of our common stock sold in  
    this offering. Uses of cash includes the assumption that $1,600,000 of such 
    Class B OPCO Units will be purchased.                                       
                                                                                  
(2) Concurrently with the closing of this offering, we plan to obtain mortgage  
    financing in connection with the purchase of these properties.                 
                                                                                  
(3) Mortgage financing at closing, less estimated closing costs to be incurred  
    of $235,675.                                                                

We intend to invest our cash balances in interest-bearing, short-term,
investment-grade securities or money-market accounts and, to the extent
necessary to qualify as a REIT and continue to not be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act, invest in certain qualified investments, for
example, Agency Whole Pool Certificates, certificates of deposit and
interest-bearing bank deposits.


We believe that the identification and operation of quality realty investments
are subject to intense competition by numerous market participants, including
other niche investment funds and REITs, larger REITs, pension funds, private
equity funds, private family owned businesses and, more recently, to non U.S.
investors that are willing to pay a premium for U.S. based assets.

Our strategy focuses on certain niche markets and property types, specifically
ESSCs, Limited Service Hotels, medical service centers and senior living
facilities. While we believe that this niche is presently fragmented and has
fewer active competitors, other property investors have recently been increasing
their participation in our core niche markets.

We face competition to maintain a valuable tenant base from other existing
properties and from properties that may be developed or are under development.
Local zoning regulations and building codes that restrict competing properties
are subject to variance and modification, which may permit additional
competition. 

We face significant competition when renewing lease terms to quality tenants
which may adversely affect our ability to maintain our targeted price per square
foot as other competing properties may offer tenants with lease grace periods,
construction and other allowances that make other properties more attractive in
the near term.

We face significant competition in the hospitality sector. This competition
could reduce occupancy levels and rental revenues at our properties, which would
adversely affect our operations.

We also face competition for investment opportunities. These competitors may be
other real estate investment trusts, hotel chains and other entities that may
have substantially greater financial resources than we do. We also face
competition for investors from other real estate investment trusts and real
estate entities.


Company Description
We are a Maryland corporation that was formed on August 11, 2016. Our business 
strategy will focus on the acquisition, development and management of property 
across all non-residential real property investment segments within the 
Southwestern part of the United States. We intend to capitalize on


 the market 
mispricing in underpriced properties, including under-capitalized, 
under-developed, distressed, or mismanaged properties, using the long-standing
relationships that our senior management team has cultivated in the commercial
real estate industry.

General working capital, including offering                                       
expenses                                                                  11,008,897

(1) In connection with our acquisition of the Castle Hills ESSC, we will 
    purchase up to $1,600,000 of the Class B OPCO Units that will be issued in  
    connection with the Castle Hills property at a price per unit that is equal 
    to 85% of the initial offering price per share of our common stock sold in  
    this offering. Uses of cash includes the assumption that $1,600,000 of such 
    Class B OPCO Units will be purchased.                                       
                                                                                  
(2) Concurrently with the closing of this offering, we plan to obtain mortgage  
    financing in connection with the purchase of these properties.                 
                                                                                  
(3) Mortgage financing at closing, less estimated closing costs to be incurred  
    of $235,675.                                                                

We intend to invest our cash balances in interest-bearing, short-term,
investment-grade securities or money-market accounts and, to the extent
necessary to qualify as a REIT and continue to not be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act, invest in certain qualified investments, for
example, Agency Whole Pool Certificates, certificates of deposit and
interest-bearing bank deposits.


We believe that the identification and operation of quality realty investments
are subject to intense competition by numerous market participants, including
other niche investment funds and REITs, larger REITs, pension funds, private
equity funds, private family owned businesses and, more recently, to non U.S.
investors that are willing to pay a premium for U.S. based assets.

Our strategy focuses on certain niche markets and property types, specifically
ESSCs, Limited Service Hotels, medical service centers and senior living
facilities. While we believe that this niche is presently fragmented and has
fewer active competitors, other property investors have recently been increasing
their participation in our core niche markets.

We face competition to maintain a valuable tenant base from other existing
properties and from properties that may be developed or are under development.
Local zoning regulations and building codes that restrict competing properties
are subject to variance and modification, which may permit additional
competition. 

We face significant competition when renewing lease terms to quality tenants
which may adversely affect our ability to maintain our targeted price per square
foot as other competing properties may offer tenants with lease grace periods,
construction and other allowances that make other properties more attractive in
the near term.

We face significant competition in the hospitality sector. This competition
could reduce occupancy levels and rental revenues at our properties, which would
adversely affect our operations.

We also face competition for investment opportunities. These competitors may be
other real estate investment trusts, hotel chains and other entities that may
have substantially greater financial resources than we do. We also face
competition for investors from other real estate investment trusts and real
estate entities.


Company Description
We are a Maryland corporation that was formed on August 11, 2016. Our business 
strategy will focus on the acquisition, development and management of property

 the market 
mispricing in underpriced properties, including under-capitalized, 
under-developed, distressed, or mismanaged properties, using the long-standing
