Founder's Award - Clara T. Rankin



from

Margaret Clark Morgan Fdn.



 Plus 




2 years ago







Clara T. Rankin was honored with the Founder’s Award. She embodies qualities of creativity, discovery, and steadfastness and is committed to family and has a spirit of selfless giving, as Peg Morgan, Founder of the Margaret Clark Morgan Foundation.

For many years, Clara Taplin (Mrs. Alfred M.) Rankin has been a major catalyst for the arts in Northeast Ohio and an advocate for individuals dealing with mental illness. Guided by her motto, “family first,” and dedication to family, Mrs. Rankin envisioned a healing place. With the help of a small group of devoted friends, including Peg and Burt Morgan, raised the necessary funds, identified a suitable property in rural Mesopotamia, and founded Hopewell. It is Ohio’s only therapeutic farm community for adults with mental illness.
