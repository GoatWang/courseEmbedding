Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1985 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. 62 pages.

Gary Stewart Hume RA (born 9 May 1962)[1] is an English artist. Hume's work is strongly identified with the YBA artists who came to prominence in the early 1990s. Hume currently lives and works in London and Accord, New York.[2]

Life and career[edit]




Gary Hume Snowman, 1996.


Hume was born in 1962 in Tenterden, Kent. He attended Homewood School. He graduated from Goldsmiths College in 1988. His work was included in both Freeze, an exhibition organised by Damien Hirst in 1988, and East Country Yard, a warehouse exhibition organised by Henry Bond and Sarah Lucas in 1990.[3]
Hume has become known for depicting everyday subjects using high-gloss industrial paints.[4] His earliest notable works are his "door paintings", life-size representations of hospital doors. These proved a critical success, being shown in Germany and the United States, as well as attracting the attention of collector Charles Saatchi. Hume's work was included in the 1995 exhibition Brilliant!, a showcase of work by YBA artists. In 1997, his work was included in Sensation, a touring show of the Charles Saatchi art collection at the Royal Academy, London.
Hume abandoned doors in the mid-1990s, turning to paintings in household gloss paint on aluminium panel, for these often used appropriated images, including pictures of celebrities (e.g. DJ Tony Blackburn) and animals. Their forms and colours are dramatically simplified, with people being reduced to just two or three colours. Snowman (1996), for example, is made up of three shades of red, showing a circle on top of a larger circle against a lighter background. At first, Hume used mainly bright colours, but later pieces have used more muted tones.
Around 2005, Hume revisited his Door pictures, this time anthropomorphising the doors, arranging them into pairs of lovers and giving them the titles The Couple and The Argument.[5] Hume's “Yellow Window,” [6] from 2002, broke records when sold at auction at Christie's.[7] The work inspired a later limited edition entitled "1000 Windows," produced for London's Tate Modern in 2013.[8]
Besides his London studio, Hume maintains a second studio in a converted barn on the grounds of a former chicken farm in New York's Catskill Mountains region.[9]
Philosophy and approach to painting[edit]
In 2012, Hume made an exhibition titled 'Indifferent Owl'. Speaking about his work in 2011, Hume had stated, 'Where I live in New York, there's a wood. I heard an owl in the night. Next day I found one of those "Happy Birthday" balloons caught in the trees. It had almost deflated. I imagined the owl, utterly indifferent, watching the balloon float by as it slowly collapsed. That's how I see life. I'm the owl, totally disengaged as the balloon bobs by…'[10]




Water Painting, 1999, Tate Collection. Part of Hume's "Water" Series of paintings.


Exhibitions[edit]
Hume represented Great Britain at the 1999 Venice Biennale, where he showed his Water series, a number of superimposed line drawings of women (again, these were gloss paint on aluminium). His work was the subject of a one-person exhibition at Whitechapel Gallery, London, in 1999. Later monographic shows of Hume's work were organised at the Kestnergesellschaft, Hannover, and the Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria, in 2004, and Modern Art Oxford mounted a survey show of his Door paintings in 2008.[11]
Recognition[edit]
In 1996, Hume was nominated for the Turner Prize, but lost out to Douglas Gordon. He was later awarded Great Britain's 1997 Jerwood Painting Prize.[12] Hume was elected a Royal Academician in 2001.

Born in 1962, Gary Hume emerged as a leading figure in the YBAs (Young British Artists) and achieved success with paintings based on hospital doors, rendered in high gloss. In the early 1990s, Hume transitioned to simple, flat, figurative and abstract paintings featuring startling color combinations and images ranging from animals to celebrities to flowers. Hume was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1996, represented Britain at the Venice Biennale in 1999, and was elected a Royal Academician in 2001. Published as a companion to the joint exhibition Gary Hume and Patrick Caulfield at Tate Britain in June 2013, this book showcases 30 works spanning more than 20 years as well as brand-new pieces, and is a timely addition to the bibliography of this important British painter.

OC7510576 x 435 mm (22 x 17 inches)
Japanese woodblock print
Edition of 45 
Signed and numbered
Published by Other CriteriaWith this new print, Hume refers to the artists of Western Europe at the turn of the nineteenth century whose work was influenced by the Japanese woodblock wrapping papers used to protect porcelain and other goods shipped over from the East. He sums up the piece as “two roses with a lilac area of disappointment”.
The traditional and labour-intensive Ukiyo-e process involves cutting shina-ply wood blocks with Japanese chisels and moistening them with water and rice paste. Ink is then dabbed on and a maru-bake horse hair brush mixes it together. The handmade washi thin rice paper, which is made of 100% kozo fibre, a relation of hemp, and which has previously been dampened, is registered to the block and laid onto the inked surface.  A paper disk, or baren, burnishes the paper to the block, printing the coloured ink into the paper. The inks are created directly from the pigments: Cadmium Red Light, Cadmium Red Medium, Cadmium Yellow Light, Pencil Clay and Ultramarine Violet, printed in that order and several times over to build colour intensity and luminosity.




BiographyNewsLinks & Press
Gary Hume
	English artist Gary Hume (b.1962) graduated from Goldsmith’s College, London, in 1988. He was part of Damien Hirst’s 1988 Freeze exhibition now considered to be the launch of the Young British Artists. He currently lives and works in London and upstate New York.



	Departing from his ‘door paintings’ Hume started making small-scale gloss paintings on aluminium, using images from the media, celebrities and animals. His bright palette and 2-D surfaces describe simplified forms often describing pop culture and child hood idioms. 

	Solo exhibitions include Cave Paintings, White Cube, London, 2006; baby Birds and Things That Are Left Behind, Galleries Lorcan O’ Neill, Rome, 2008 and Door Paintings, Modern Art, Oxford, 2008, while recent group exhibitions include Aftershock: Contemporary British Art 1990-2006, Guangdong Museum of Art, Guangzhou, China, 2006; Demons, Yarns and Tales: Tapestries by Contemporary Artists, The Dairy, London, UK, 2008 and Art Is For The Spirit: From the UBS Art Collection, Mori Art Museum, Tokyo, Japan, 2008.
