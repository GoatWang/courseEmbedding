	Fund Summary










	Investment Objective






	The
	fund seeks as high a level of current income exempt from federal and New Jersey state income taxes as
	is consistent with the preservation of capital and the maintenance of liquidity.









	Fees
	and Expenses






	This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you
	buy and hold shares of the fund.







	 




	 









	Annual Fund Operating Expenses




	(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)










	Management fees






	.50








	Other expenses (including shareholder services

	.14








	Total annual fund operating expenses






	.64










	Example





	The
	Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing
	in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods
	indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that
	your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund's operating expenses remain the same. Although
	your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

	Principal Investment Strategy






	As a money market fund, the
	fund is subject to the maturity, quality, liquidity and diversification requirements of Rule 2a-7 under
	the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which are designed to help money market funds maintain
	a stable share price of $1.00. To pursue its goal, the fund normally invests at least 80% of its net
	assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in short-term, high quality municipal obligations
	that provide income exempt from federal and New Jersey state income taxes. The fund also may invest
	in high quality, short-term structured notes, which are derivative instruments whose value is tied to
	underlying municipal obligations.




	Although the fund seeks to provide income exempt from federal and
	New Jersey state income taxes, income from some of the funds holdings may be subject to the federal
	alternative minimum tax.









	Principal Risks






	An investment
	in the fund is not a bank deposit. It is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
	Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of
	your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.




	The fund's
	yield will fluctuate as the short-term securities in its portfolio mature and the proceeds are reinvested
	in securities with different interest rates. Additionally, while the fund has maintained a constant
	share price since inception, and will continue to try to do so, neither The Dreyfus Corporation nor its
	affiliates are required to make a capital infusion, enter into a capital support agreement or take other
	actions to prevent the fund's share price from falling below $1.00. The following are the principal
	risks that could reduce the fund's income level and/or share price:





	·





	 






	Interest rate risk.




	This risk refers
	to the decline in the prices of fixed-income securities that may accompany a rise in the overall level
	of interest rates. A sharp and unexpected rise in interest rates could cause a money market fund's share
	price to drop below a dollar. A low interest rate environment may prevent the fund from providing a
	positive yield or paying fund expenses out of fund assets and could impair the fund's ability to maintain
	a stable net asset value.






	1





	 





	·





	 






	Credit risk.




	Failure of an issuer to make timely interest or principal payments,
	or a decline or perception of a decline in the credit quality of a security, can cause the security's
	price to fall. Although the fund invests only in high quality debt securities, any of the fund's holdings
	could have its credit rating downgraded or could default. The credit quality and prices of the securities
	held by the fund can change rapidly in certain market environments, and the default or a significant
	price decline of a single holding could impair the fund's ability to maintain a stable net asset value.





	·





	 






	Liquidity risk.




	When
	there is little or no active trading market for specific types of securities, it can become more difficult
	to sell the securities in a timely manner at or near their perceived value. In such a market, the value
	of such securities may fall dramatically, potentially impairing the fund's ability to maintain a stable
	net asset value, even during periods of declining interest rates. Also, during such periods, redemptions
	by a few large investors in the fund may impair the fund's ability to maintain a stable net asset value
	and adversely affect remaining fund shareholders.





	·





	 






	Regulatory risk




	. The Securities and
	Exchange Commission has adopted amendments to the rules governing money market funds that may change
	the way that the fund, and similar money market funds, operate. Under the amended rules, as of October
	14, 2016, the share price of money market funds that will be designated as "institutional prime" or "institutional
	municipal" type money funds would fluctuate and, as a result, shares of those funds when sold may be
	worth more or less than their original purchase price. In addition, as of October 14, 2016, all prime
	and all municipal money market funds become subject to a regime of liquidity fees imposed upon the sale
	of their shares or the temporary suspension of redemptions, in each case triggered (and subject to board
	determination) by the percentage of a fund's Weekly Liquid Assets falling below certain minimums as defined
	in amended Rule 2a-7. The amendments impose additional regulatory and reporting requirements on all
	money market funds, which generally are expected to be implemented by the funds by April 14, 2016. As
	a result of the amendments, additional expenses may be incurred by the fund.





	·





	 






	Municipal securities
	risk




	. The amount of public information available about municipal securities is generally less
	than that for corporate equities or bonds. Special factors, such as legislative changes, and state and
	local economic and business developments, may adversely affect the yield and/or value of the fund's investments
	in municipal securities. Other factors include the general conditions of the municipal securities market,
	the size of the particular offering, the maturity of the obligation and the rating of the issue. Changes
	in economic, business or political conditions relating to a particular municipal project, municipality,
	or state, territory or possession of the United States in which the fund invests may have an impact on
	the fund's ability to maintain a stable net asset value.

	Tax risk.




	To be tax-exempt, municipal
	obligations generally must meet certain regulatory requirements. If any such municipal obligation fails
	to meet these regulatory requirements, the interest received by the fund from its investment in such
	obligations and distributed to fund shareholders will be taxable.





	·





	 






	Structured notes risk.




	Structured notes,
	a type of derivative instrument, can be volatile, and the possibility of default by the financial institution
	or counterparty may be greater for these instruments than for other types of money market instruments.
	Structured notes typically are purchased in privately negotiated transactions from financial institutions
	and, thus, an active trading market for such instruments may not exist.





	·





	 






	State-specific risk.




	The fund is subject
	to the risk that New Jersey's economy, and the revenues underlying its municipal obligations, may decline.
	Investing primarily in a single state makes the fund more sensitive to risks specific to the state and
	may magnify other risks.





	·





	 






	Non-diversification risk.




	The fund
	is non-diversified, which means that the fund may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in
	a limited number of issuers. Therefore, the fund's performance may be more vulnerable to changes in
	the market value of a single issuer or group of issuers and more susceptible to risks associated with
	a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a diversified fund.

	Tax Information






	The
	fund anticipates that dividends paid by the fund generally will be exempt from federal and New Jersey
	state income taxes. However, the fund may realize and distribute taxable income and capital gains from
	time to time as a result of the funds normal investment activities.






	Payments to
	Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries






	If you purchase shares through
	a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the fund and its related companies
	may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services. These payments may create
	a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to
	recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's
	website for more information.

	Fund Details









	Goal and Approach






	The fund seeks as high a level
	of current income exempt from federal New Jersey state income taxes, consistent with the preservation
	of capital and the maintenance of liquidity. As a money market fund, the fund is subject to the maturity,
	quality, liquidity and diversification requirements of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of
	1940, as amended, which are designed to help money market funds maintain a stable share price of $1.00.




	To
	pursue its goal, the fund normally invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment
	purposes, in short-term, high quality municipal obligations that provide income exempt from federal New
	Jersey state income taxes. The fund also may invest in high quality, short-term structured notes, which
	are derivative instruments whose value is tied to underlying municipal obligations.




	While the
	fund generally invests solely in securities with the highest credit rating or the unrated equivalent
	as determined by Dreyfus, it may invest up to 3% of its assets in securities with the second-highest
	credit rating that mature in 45 days or less.




	The fund is required to hold at least 30% of
	its assets in cash, U.S. Treasury securities, certain other government securities with remaining maturities
	of 60 days or less, or securities that can readily be converted into cash within five business days.
	The maximum weighted average maturity of the fund's portfolio is 60 days and the maximum weighted average
	life to maturity of the fund's portfolio is 120 days.




	Although the fund seeks to
	provide income exempt from federal New Jersey state income taxes, income from some of the fund's holdings
	may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. The fund also may invest temporarily in high
	quality, taxable money market instruments, including when the portfolio manager believes acceptable
	New Jersey State municipal obligations are not available for investment. During such periods, the fund
	may not achieve its investment objective. In addition, a portion of the funds assets may be invested
	in short-term, high quality municipal obligations that do not pay income that is exempt from New Jersey
	state income taxes.




	In response to liquidity needs or unusual market conditions, the
	fund may hold all or a significant portion of its total assets in cash for temporary defensive purposes.
	This may result in a lower current yield and prevent the fund from achieving its investment objective.




	The
	fund is non-diversified.






	Investment Risks








	An investment
	in the fund is not a bank deposit. It is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government
	agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible
	to lose money by investing in the fund.




	The fund's yield will fluctuate as the short-term
	securities in its portfolio mature and the proceeds are reinvested in securities with different interest
	rates. Additionally, while the fund has maintained a constant share price since inception, and will
	continue to try to do so, neither The Dreyfus Corporation nor its affiliates are required to make a capital
	infusion, enter into a capital support agreement or take other actions to prevent the fund's share price
	from falling below $1.00. The following are the principal risks that could reduce the fund's income
	level and/or share price:





	·





	 






	Interest rate risk.




	This risk refers
	to the decline in the prices of fixed-income securities that may accompany a rise in the overall level
	of interest rates. A sharp and unexpected rise in interest rates could cause a money market fund's share
	price to drop below a dollar. A low interest rate environment may prevent the fund from providing a
	positive yield or paying fund expenses out of fund assets and could impair the fund's ability to maintain
	a stable net asset value.





	·





	 






	Credit risk.




	Failure of an issuer to
	make timely interest or principal payments, or a decline or perception of a decline in the credit quality
	of a security, can cause the security's price to fall. Although the fund invests only in high quality
	debt securities, any of the fund's holdings could have its credit rating downgraded or could default.
	The credit quality and prices of the securities held by the fund can change rapidly in certain market
	environments, and the default or a significant price decline of a single holding could impair the fund's
	ability to maintain a stable net asset value.






	4





	 





	·





	 






	Liquidity risk.




	When there is little or no active trading market for specific
	types of securities, it can become more difficult to sell the securities in a timely manner at or near
	their perceived value. In such a market, the value of such securities may fall dramatically, potentially
	impairing the fund's ability to maintain a stable net asset value, even during periods of declining interest
	rates. Also, during such periods, redemptions by a few large investors in the fund may impair the fund's
	ability to maintain a stable net asset value and adversely affect remaining fund shareholders.





	·





	 






	Regulatory risk




	.
	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted amendments to the rules governing money market funds
	that may change the way that the fund, and similar money market funds, operate. Under the amended rules,
	as of October 14, 2016, the share price of money market funds that will be designated as "institutional
	prime" or "institutional municipal" type money funds would fluctuate and, as a result, shares of those
	funds when sold may be worth more or less than their original purchase price. In addition, as of October
	14, 2016, all prime and all municipal money market funds become subject to a regime of liquidity fees
	imposed upon the sale of their shares or the temporary suspension of redemptions, in each case triggered
	(and subject to board determination) by the percentage of a fund's Weekly Liquid Assets falling below
	certain minimums as defined in amended Rule 2a-7. The amendments impose additional regulatory and reporting
	requirements on all money market funds, which generally are expected to be implemented by the funds by
	April 14, 2016. As a result of the amendments, additional expenses may be incurred by the fund.





	·





	 






	Municipal securities
	risk




	. The amount of public information available about municipal securities is generally less
	than that for corporate equities or bonds. Special factors, such as legislative changes, and state and
	local economic and business developments, may adversely affect the yield and/or value of the fund's investments
	in municipal securities. Other factors include the general conditions of the municipal securities market,
	the size of the particular offering, the maturity of the obligation and the rating of the issue. Changes
	in economic, business or political conditions relating to a particular municipal project, municipality,
	or state, territory or possession of the United States in which the fund invests may have an impact on
	the fund's ability to maintain a stable net asset value.





	·





	 






	Tax risk.




	To be tax-exempt, municipal
	obligations generally must meet certain regulatory requirements. If any such municipal obligation fails
	to meet these regulatory requirements, the interest received by the fund from its investment in such
	obligations and distributed to fund shareholders will be taxable.





	·





	 






	Structured notes risk.




	Structured notes,
	a type of derivative instrument, can be volatile, and the possibility of default by the financial institution
	or counterparty may be greater for these instruments than for other types of money market instruments.
	Structured notes typically are purchased in privately negotiated transactions from financial institutions
	and, thus, an active trading market for such instruments may not exist.





	·





	 






	State-specific risk




	. The fund is subject
	to the risk that New Jersey's economy, and the revenues underlying its municipal obligations, may decline.
	Investing primarily in a single state makes the fund more sensitive to risks specific to the state and
	may magnify other risks.





	·





	 






	Non-diversification risk




	. The fund
	is non-diversified, which means that the fund may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in
	a limited number of issuers. Therefore, the fund's performance may be more vulnerable to changes in
	the market value of a single issuer or group of issuers and more susceptible to risks associated with
	a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a diversified fund.









	Management

	New York 10166. Founded in 1947, Dreyfus manages approximately $245 billion in 165 mutual fund portfolios.
	For the past fiscal year, the fund paid Dreyfus a management fee at the annual rate of 0.08% of the
	fund's average daily net assets. A discussion regarding the basis for the board's approving the fund's
	management agreement with Dreyfus is available in the fund's annual report for the fiscal year ended
	November 30, 2014. Dreyfus is the primary mutual fund business of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation
	(BNY Mellon), a global financial services company focused on helping clients manage and service their
	financial assets, operating in 35 countries and serving more than 100 markets. BNY Mellon is a leading

	the corporate brand of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. BNY Mellon Investment Management is

	The Dreyfus asset management philosophy is based on the belief that discipline and consistency
	are important to investment success. For each fund, Dreyfus seeks to establish clear guidelines for
	portfolio management and to be systematic in making decisions. This approach is designed to provide
	each fund with a distinct, stable identity.




	MBSC Securities Corporation (MBSC), a wholly-owned
	subsidiary of Dreyfus, serves as distributor of the fund and of the other funds in the Dreyfus Family
	of Funds. Any Rule 12b-1 fees and shareholder services fees, as applicable, are paid to MBSC for financing
	the sale and distribution of fund shares and for providing shareholder account service and maintenance,
	respectively. Dreyfus or MBSC may provide cash payments out of its own resources to financial intermediaries
	that sell shares of funds in the Dreyfus Family of Funds or provide other services. Such payments are
	separate from any sales charges, 12b-1 fees and/or shareholder services fees or other expenses that may
	be paid by a fund to those intermediaries. Because those payments are not made by fund shareholders
	or the fund, the fund's total expense ratio will not be affected by any such payments. These payments
	may be made to intermediaries, including affiliates, that provide shareholder servicing, sub-administration,
	recordkeeping and/or sub-transfer agency services, marketing support and/or access to sales meetings,
	sales representatives and management representatives of the financial intermediary. Cash compensation
	also may be paid from Dreyfus' or MBSC's own resources to intermediaries for inclusion of a fund on a
	sales list, including a preferred or select sales list or in other sales programs. These payments sometimes
	are referred to as "revenue sharing." From time to time, Dreyfus or MBSC also may provide cash or non-cash
	compensation to financial intermediaries or their representatives in the form of occasional gifts; occasional
	meals, tickets or other entertainment; support for due diligence trips; educational conference sponsorships;
	support for recognition programs; technology or infrastructure support; and other forms of cash or non-cash
	compensation permissible under broker-dealer regulations. In some cases, these payments or compensation
	may create an incentive for a financial intermediary or its employees to recommend or sell shares of
	the fund to you. Please contact your financial representative for details about any payments they or
	their firm may receive in connection with the sale of fund shares or the provision of services to the
	fund.




	Class A shares of the fund are subject to an annual shareholder services fee of up to
	.25% to reimburse the fund's distributor for shareholder account service and maintenance expenses.




	The
	fund, Dreyfus and MBSC have each adopted a code of ethics that permits its personnel, subject to such
	code, to invest in securities, including securities that may be purchased or held by the fund. Each
	code of ethics restricts the personal securities transactions of employees, and requires portfolio managers
	and other investment personnel to comply with the code's preclearance and disclosure procedures. The
	primary purpose of the respective codes is to ensure that personal trading by employees does not disadvantage
	any fund managed by Dreyfus or its affiliates.

	Shareholder Guide









	Buying and Selling Shares








	You pay no
	sales charges to invest in Class A shares of the fund. Your price for Class A shares is the net asset
	value (NAV) per share, which is calculated as of 12:00 noon Eastern time on days the New York Stock Exchange
	is open for regular business. Your order will be priced at the next NAV calculated after your order
	is received in proper form by the fund's transfer agent or other authorized entity.




	The fund's
	investments are valued at amortized cost, which does not take into account unrealized gains or losses.
	As a result, portfolio securities are valued at their acquisition cost, adjusted over time based on
	the discounts or premiums reflected in their purchase price. The fund uses the amortized cost method
	of valuation pursuant to Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, in order to
	be able to maintain a share price of $1.00. Because the fund seeks tax exempt income, it is not recommended
	for purchase in IRAs or other qualified retirement plans.




	When calculating its NAV, the
	fund compares the NAV using amortized cost to its NAV using available market quotations or market equivalents,
	which generally are provided by an independent pricing service approved by the fund's board. The pricing
	service's procedures are reviewed under the general supervision of the board.

	General Policies






	The
	fund and the fund's transfer agent are authorized to act on telephone or online instructions from any
	person representing himself or herself to be you and reasonably believed by the fund or the transfer
	agent to be genuine. You may be responsible for any fraudulent telephone or online order as long as
	the fund or the fund's transfer agent (as applicable) takes reasonable measures to confirm that the instructions
	are genuine.




	All shareholder services and privileges offered to shareholders may be modified or terminated
	at any time, except as otherwise stated in the fund's Statement of Additional Information (SAI). Please
	see the fund's SAI for additional information on buying and selling shares, privileges and other shareholder
	services.

	If you invest through a financial intermediary (rather than directly through the fund),
	the policies and fees may be different than those described herein. Banks, brokers, financial advisers
	and financial supermarkets may charge transaction fees and may set different minimum investments or limitations
	on buying or selling shares. Please consult your financial representative.




	Money market
	funds generally are used by investors for short-term investments, often in place of bank checking or
	savings accounts, or for cash management purposes. Investors value the ability to add and withdraw their
	funds quickly, without restriction. For this reason, although Dreyfus discourages excessive trading
	and other abusive trading practices, the fund has not adopted policies and procedures, or imposed redemption
	fees or other restrictions such as minimum holding periods, to deter frequent purchases and redemptions
	of fund shares. Dreyfus also believes that money market funds, such as the fund, are not targets of
	abusive trading practices, because money market funds seek to maintain a $1.00 per share price and typically
	do not fluctuate in value based on market prices. However, frequent purchases and redemptions of the
	fund's shares could increase the fund's transaction costs, such as market spreads and custodial fees,
	and may interfere with the efficient management of the fund's portfolio, which could detract from the
	fund's performance. Accordingly, the fund reserves the right to reject any purchase or exchange request
	in whole or in part. Funds in the Dreyfus Family of Funds that are not money market mutual funds have
	approved policies and procedures that are intended to discourage and prevent abusive trading practices
	in those mutual funds, which may apply to exchanges from or into the fund. If you plan to exchange your
	fund shares for shares of another Dreyfus fund, please read the prospectus of that other Dreyfus fund
	for more information.




	The fund also reserves the right to:





	·





	 




	change
	or discontinue fund exchanges, or temporarily suspend exchanges during unusual market conditions





	·





	 




	change
	its minimum or maximum investment amounts





	·





	 




	delay sending
	out redemption proceeds for up to seven days (generally applies only during unusual market conditions
	or in cases of very large redemptions or excessive trading)





	·





	 




	"redeem
	in kind," or make payments in securities rather than cash, if the amount redeemed is large enough to
	affect fund operations (for example, if it exceeds 1% of the fund's assets)




	The fund
	also may process purchase and sale orders and calculate its NAV on days the fund's primary trading markets
	are open and the fund's management determines to do so.





	Small Account Policies





	To
	offset the relatively higher costs of servicing smaller accounts, the fund charges regular accounts with
	balances below $2,000 an annual fee of $12. The fee will be imposed during the fourth quarter of each
	calendar year.




	The fee will be waived for: any investor whose aggregate Dreyfus mutual fund investments
	total at least $25,000; accounts participating in automatic investment programs; and accounts opened
	through a financial institution.




	If your account falls below $500, the fund may ask you to increase
	your balance. If it is still below $500 after 45 days, the fund may close your account and send you
	the proceeds.





	Escheatment





	If your account is deemed "abandoned" or "unclaimed" under state
	law, the fund may be required to "escheat" or transfer the assets in your account to the applicable state's
	unclaimed property administration. The state may sell escheated shares and, if you subsequently seek
	to reclaim your proceeds of liquidation from the state, you may only be able to recover the amount received
	when the shares were sold. It is your responsibility to ensure that you maintain a correct address for
	your account, keep your account active by contacting the fund's transfer agent or distributor by mail
	or telephone or accessing your account through the fund's website at least once a year, and promptly
	cash all checks for dividends, capital gains and redemptions. The fund, the fund's transfer agent and
	Dreyfus and its affiliates will not be liable to shareholders or their representatives for good faith
	compliance with state escheatment laws.









	Distributions and Taxes








	The
	fund earns dividends, interest and other income from its investments, and distributes this income (less
	expenses) to shareholders as dividends. The fund also realizes capital gains from its investments, and
	distributes these gains (less any losses) to shareholders as capital gain distributions. The fund normally
	pays dividends monthly and capital gain distributions, if any, annually. Fund dividends and capital
	gain distributions will be reinvested in the fund unless you instruct the fund otherwise. There are
	no fees or sales charges on reinvestments.






	9





	 




	The fund anticipates that dividends paid by the fund generally will be exempt from federal
	and New Jersey state income taxes. However, the fund may realize and distribute taxable income and capital
	gains from time to time as a result of the funds normal investment activities. For New Jersey
	state personal income tax purposes, distributions derived from interest on municipal securities of New
	Jersey issuers and from interest on qualifying securities issued by U.S. territories and possessions
	are generally exempt from tax. Distributions that are federally taxable as ordinary income or capital
	gains are generally subject to New Jersey state personal income taxes.




	The tax status of any distribution
	generally is the same regardless of how long you have been in the fund and whether you reinvest your
	distributions or take them in cash.




	Your sale of shares, including exchanges into
	other funds, may result in a capital gain or loss for tax purposes. A capital gain or loss on your investment
	in the fund generally is the difference between the cost of your shares and the amount you receive when
	you sell them.




	The tax status of your distributions will be detailed in your annual tax statement from
	the fund. Because everyone's tax situation is unique, please consult your tax adviser before investing.

	public accounting firm, whose report, along with the fund's financial statements, is included in the
	annual report, which is available upon request.

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of any mutual fund carefully before investing. Download a money market fund prospectus, or a summary prospectus, if available, that contains this and other information about a fund. Read it carefully before investing.You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. Beginning October 14, 2016, the fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.Yield and investment return fluctuate and past performance is no guarantee of future results. As a measure of current income, 7-day yield most closely reflects the fund's current income generating ability. 30-day yield is based upon dividends per share from net investment income during the past 30 days, divided by the period ended maximum offering price per share and annualized. Daily and 30-day yield quotations may reflect current expense absorptions, without which performance would have been lower.While dividends are declared daily, they are paid monthly (if any).Market Value NAV: Calculated based on available market quotations (except overnight securities which are valued at amortized cost) related to the Fund’s securities at the close of business on the date stated. It is calculated to the nearest hundredth of a cent or (or $0.0001).WAM: A measure of the average maturity of all of the underlying money market instruments in the fund, weighted to reflect the relative percentage ownership of each instrument, and taking into account applicable “maturity shortening” provisions provided by the Rule. Generally, for money market funds, WAM can be used primarily as a measure of relative sensitivity to interest rate changes.WAL: WAL is the WAM of the money market fund calculated without reference to the “maturity shortening” provisions of Rule 2a-7 permitted for purposes of calculating WAM. Because WAL does not reflect the rule’s “maturity shortening” provisions, WAL will generally be higher than WAM.Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) and Weighted Average Life to Maturity (WAL) statistics displayed before approximately 7:30 p.m. ET reflect calculations made prior to the afternoon time of day for pricing fund shares; WAM and WAL statistics displayed after 7:30 p.m. ET reflect updated calculations.Any order in proper form placed with Dreyfus by the Fund’s trading deadline and for which Federal Funds are received by 6:00 PM ET will be effective on that date. Investors will earn the dividend declared on that day.The information on this Web site is not an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security, nor shall any such security be offered or sold to any person in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, purchase, or sale may not lawfully be made.
