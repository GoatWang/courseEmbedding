Long/short equity

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Long/short equity is an investment strategy[1] generally associated with hedge funds, and more recently certain progressive traditional asset managers. It involves buying long equities that are expected to increase in value and selling short equities that are expected to decrease in value. This is different from the risk reversal strategies where investors will simultaneously buy a call option and sell a put option to simulate being long in a stock.

Overview[edit]
Typically, equity long/short investing is based on "bottom up" fundamental analysis of the individual companies, in which investments are made. There may also be "top down" analysis of the risks and opportunities offered by industries, sectors, countries, and the macroeconomic situation.
Long/short covers a wide variety of strategies. There are generalists, and managers who focus on certain industries and sectors or certain regions. Managers may specialize in a category — for example, large cap or small cap, value or growth. There are many trading styles, with frequent or dynamic traders and some longer-term investors.
A fund manager typically attempts to reduce volatility by either diversifying or hedging positions across individual regions, industries, sectors and market capitalization bands and hedging against un-diversifiable risk such as market risk. In addition to being required of the portfolio as a whole, neutrality may in addition be required for individual regions, industries, sectors, and market capitalization bands.
There is wide variation in the degree to which managers prioritize seeking high returns, which may involve concentrated and leveraged portfolios, and seeking low volatility, which involves more diversification and hedging.
Equitized strategy[edit]
This is in addition to market neutral strategy, as it adds a permanent stock index futures overlay, which makes profit or losses, depending on the movement of the market. Your portfolio then has a full equity market exposure.
Hedging example[edit]
A hedge fund might sell short one automobile industry stock, while buying another—for example, short $1 million of DaimlerChrysler, long $1 million of Ford. With this position, any event that causes all auto industry stocks to fall will cause a profit on the DaimlerChrysler position and a matching loss on the Ford position. Similarly, events that cause both stocks to rise—for example a rise in the market as a whole—will have little or no effect on the position.
Presumably the hedge fund has sold DaimlerChrysler and bought Ford because the manager expects Ford to perform better. If the manager is correct, the fund should profit irrespective of market and sector moves.
Market neutral strategies[edit]
Market neutral strategies can be seen as the limiting case of equity long/short, in which the long and short portfolios of the fund are balanced with great care so that a very high degree of hedging is achieved. Some advantages of market neutral strategies include being able to generate positive returns in a down market, and generating returns with a lower volatility profile.
"Market neutrality" refers to hedging out market risk, which can be managed through the use of derivatives, such as futures on market indexes. Market neutral funds usually seek to hedge against most or all predictable risk exposures.
An extension on the market neutral strategy is the factor neutral strategy. The factor neutral strategy is neutral on market risk, as well as major factors like momentum and large cap vs small cap. This is a step towards more modern capital market models like the Fama–French three-factor model.
Problems[edit]
There are many difficulties with managing long/short funds. These include the difficulties of estimating and hedging the risks to which a portfolio is exposed, and the requirement to manage unsuccessful short positions in an active manner. Short positions that are losing money grow to become an increasingly large part of the portfolio, and their price can increase without limit.
To make money, the hedge fund must successfully predict which stocks will perform better. It requires making intelligent use of the available information, but this is not enough—it also requires making better use of the available information than large numbers of capable investors. This strategy is primarily implemented by hedge funds and sophisticated institutions.

Overview[edit]
Typically, equity long/short investing is based on "bottom up" fundamental analysis of the individual companies, in which investments are made. There may also be "top down" analysis of the risks and opportunities offered by industries, sectors, countries, and the macroeconomic situation.
Long/short covers a wide variety of strategies. There are generalists, and managers who focus on certain industries and sectors or certain regions. Managers may specialize in a category — for example, large cap or small cap, value or growth. There are many trading styles, with frequent or dynamic traders and some longer-term investors.
A fund manager typically attempts to reduce volatility by either diversifying or hedging positions across individual regions, industries, sectors and market capitalization bands and hedging against un-diversifiable risk such as market risk. In addition to being required of the portfolio as a whole, neutrality may in addition be required for individual regions, industries, sectors, and market capitalization bands.
There is wide variation in the degree to which managers prioritize seeking high returns, which may involve concentrated and leveraged portfolios, and seeking low volatility, which involves more diversification and hedging.
Equitized strategy[edit]
This is in addition to market neutral strategy, as it adds a permanent stock index futures overlay, which makes profit or losses, depending on the movement of the market. Your portfolio then has a full equity market exposure.

Long/short equity - Wikipedia





















 






Long/short equity

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Long/short equity is an investment strategy[1] generally associated with hedge funds, and more recently certain progressive traditional asset managers. It involves buying long equities that are expected to increase in value and selling short equities that are expected to decrease in value. This is different from the risk reversal strategies where investors will simultaneously buy a call option and sell a put option to simulate being long in a stock.

Overview[edit]
Typically, equity long/short investing is based on "bottom up" fundamental analysis of the individual companies, in which investments are made. There may also be "top down" analysis of the risks and opportunities offered by industries, sectors, countries, and the macroeconomic situation.
Long/short covers a wide variety of strategies. There are generalists, and managers who focus on certain industries and sectors or certain regions. Managers may specialize in a category — for example, large cap or small cap, value or growth. There are many trading styles, with frequent or dynamic traders and some longer-term investors.
A fund manager typically attempts to reduce volatility by either diversifying or hedging positions across individual regions, industries, sectors and market capitalization bands and hedging against un-diversifiable risk such as market risk. In addition to being required of the portfolio as a whole, neutrality may in addition be required for individual regions, industries, sectors, and market capitalization bands.
There is wide variation in the degree to which managers prioritize seeking high returns, which may involve concentrated and leveraged portfolios, and seeking low volatility, which involves more diversification and hedging.
Equitized strategy[edit]
This is in addition to market neutral strategy, as it adds a permanent stock index futures overlay, which makes profit or losses, depending on the movement of the market. Your portfolio then has a full equity market exposure.
Hedging example[edit]
A hedge fund might sell short one automobile industry stock, while buying another—for example, short $1 million of DaimlerChrysler, long $1 million of Ford. With this position, any event that causes all auto industry stocks to fall will cause a profit on the DaimlerChrysler position and a matching loss on the Ford position. Similarly, events that cause both stocks to rise—for example a rise in the market as a whole—will have little or no effect on the position.
Presumably the hedge fund has sold DaimlerChrysler and bought Ford because the manager expects Ford to perform better. If the manager is correct, the fund should profit irrespective of market and sector moves.
Market neutral strategies[edit]
Market neutral strategies can be seen as the limiting case of equity long/short, in which the long and short portfolios of the fund are balanced with great care so that a very high degree of hedging is achieved. Some advantages of market neutral strategies include being able to generate positive returns in a down market, and generating returns with a lower volatility profile.
"Market neutrality" refers to hedging out market risk, which can be managed through the use of derivatives, such as futures on market indexes. Market neutral funds usually seek to hedge against most or all predictable risk exposures.
An extension on the market neutral strategy is the factor neutral strategy. The factor neutral strategy is neutral on market risk, as well as major factors like momentum and large cap vs small cap. This is a step towards more modern capital market models like the Fama–French three-factor model.
Problems[edit]
There are many difficulties with managing long/short funds. These include the difficulties of estimating and hedging the risks to which a portfolio is exposed, and the requirement to manage unsuccessful short positions in an active manner. Short positions that are losing money grow to become an increasingly large part of the portfolio, and their price can increase without limit.
To make money, the hedge fund must successfully predict which stocks will perform better. It requires making intelligent use of the available information, but this is not enough—it also requires making better use of the available information than large numbers of capable investors. This strategy is primarily implemented by hedge funds and sophisticated institutions.

 Hedge Fund Strategy - Equity Long-Short
An  equity long-short strategy is an investing strategy, used primarily by hedge  funds, that involves taking long positions in stocks that are expected to  increase in value and short positions in stocks that are expected to decrease  in value.
You  may know that taking a long position in a stock simply means buying it: If the  stock increases in value, you will make money. On the other hand, taking a  short position in a stock means borrowing a stock you don’t own (usually from  your broker), selling it, then hoping it declines in value, at which time you  can buy it back at a lower price than you paid for it and return the borrowed  shares.
Hedge  funds using equity long-short strategies simply do this on a grander scale. At  its most basic level, an equity long-short strategy consists of buying an  undervalued stock and shorting an overvalued stock. Ideally, the long position  will increase in value, and the short position will decline in value. If this  happens, and the positions are of equal size, the hedge fund will benefit. That  said, the strategy will work even if the long position declines in value, provided  that the long position outperforms the short position. Thus, the goal of any  equity long-short strategy is to minimize exposure to the market in general,  and profit from a change in the difference, or spread, between two stocks. 
That  may sound complicated, so let’s look at a hypothetical example. Let’s say a  hedge fund takes a $1 million long position in Pfizer and a $1 million short  position in Wyeth, both large pharmaceutical companies. With these positions,  any event that causes all pharmaceutical stocks to fall will lead to a loss on  the Pfizer position and a profit on the Wyeth position. Similarly, an event  that causes both stocks to rise will have little effect, since the positions  balance each other out. So, the market risk is minimal. Why, then, would a  portfolio manager take such a position? Because he or she thinks Pfizer will  perform better than Wyeth. 
Equity  long-short strategies such as the one described, which hold equal dollar  amounts of long and short positions, are called market neutral strategies. But  not all equity long-short strategies are market neutral. Some hedge fund  managers will maintain a long bias, as is the case with so-called “130/30”  strategies. With these strategies, hedge funds have 130% exposure to long  positions and 30% exposure to short positions. Other structures are also used,  such as 120% long and 20% short. (Few hedge funds have a long-term short bias,  since the equity markets tend to move up over time.) 
Equity  long-short managers can also be distinguished by the geographic market in which  they invest, the sector in which they invest (financial, health care or  technology, for example) or their investment style (value or quantitative, for  example). Buying and selling two related stocks—for example, two stocks in the  same region or industry—is called a “paired trade” model. It may limit risk to  a specific subset of the market instead of the market in general.
Equity  long-short strategies have been used by sophisticated investors, such as  institutions, for years. They became increasingly popular among individual  investors as traditional strategies struggled in the most recent bear market,  highlighting the need for investors to consider expanding their portfolios into  innovative financial solutions.
   
  Equity  long-short strategies are not without risks. These strategies have all the  generic hedge fund risks: For example, hedge funds are typically not as liquid  as mutual funds, meaning it is more difficult to sell shares; the strategies  they use could lead to significant losses; and they can have high fees.  Additionally, equity long-short strategies have some unique risks. The main one  is that the portfolio manager must correctly predict the relative performance  of two stocks, which can be difficult. Another risk results from what is  referred to in the industry as “beta mismatch.” While this is more complicated  that we can explain in detail here, essentially, it means that 
when  the stock market declines sharply, long positions could lose more than short  positions. 
In  summary, equity long-short strategies may help increase returns in difficult  market environments, but also involve some risk. As a result, investors  considering these strategies may want to ensure that their hedge funds follow  strict rules to evaluate market risks and find good investment opportunities.

some stocks to potentially invest in, and I feel
pretty good at my ability to predict how good a
company's going to do relative to people's expectations, or
the market's expectations. And in particular, I focus
on companies A and B. And in the case of
company A, I think it's going to do a lot worse
than the market expects it to do. So I'm tempted to short it. And in the case of
company B, I think it's going to do much better
than the market expects. So I'm tempted to
buy it, or go long. But there's one thing
about this process that gets me a little
bit uncomfortable. I have confidence in my ability
to pick out companies that are going to
outperform the market, or are going to
under-perform the market, but I have no
confidence in my ability to predict to the market. So in general-- let me draw
a little chart of the market, this is the market
price, maybe this is the S&P 500 or the
NASDAQ-- and I've just found that it's as good as
random, as opposed to me trying to pick out bottoms
of the markets, or tops of the markets,
and all the rest. And so my fear is, what
happens if I buy company B, based on my sound research,
and then the market goes down? Then company B will
probably still go down. Maybe it won't go down
as much as the market, but it will still go
down, and I'll lose money. Or what if I short company
A and the market goes up? Maybe company A won't go a won't
go up as much as the market, but I'll still lose money
on my short position, which is essentially a bet that the
stock is going to go down. So is there some
arrangement I can do, some combination of
buying company B, and selling or
shorting company A, that will essentially hedge
out a lot of this market risk? And as you can
imagine, there is. And I won't go into all of the
statistics of it, and beta, and you can really try to
statistically hedge out the market risk. But the general idea
is, if you really think this is going to
outperform the market, or definitely
outperform company A, and if you think A
going to under-perform the market, or definitely
under-perform relative to company B, you can
buy a similar amount of B as you will short company
A. So in this case, let's just do one share. You can obviously do
multiples of this. You buy one, let me
write it over here. So you buy one
share of company B, and you sell, or you short,
one share of company A. You borrow the
share, you sell it, you'll have to buy
it at a future date. So you short, I
shouldn't say one share, you short two shares of
company A. And the reason why I'm saying two shares of
company A instead of one share, is because A is only $5 per
share, and B is $10 per share. So I want to do roughly
the same amount. And once again, you can do
fancier statistics on it to tweak it, so you can
see how much they actually move with the
market, but we're not going to worry about
that right here. So for simplicity,
what we've done here is we've taken a long position,
let me write it over here. We've taken a long
position in B, and we have a $10 long
position, and we've taken a short position
in A, and it is also a $10 short position. Once again, because
A is $5 per share-- so we took two shares of A-- it
makes the same dollar amount. Now, and maybe I'll save
this for the next video, I want you to think about what
happens if the market moves up or down, but B outperforms
A, or A outperforms B.Hedge funds, venture capital, and private equityHedge fund strategies: Long short  2Up NextHedge fund strategies: Long short  2

Lipper Leader
Lipper Leader Ratings
 


Preservation Global Long/Short Equity Fund received the following Preservation ratings for the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, respectively: 5 (11,916 funds), - ( funds), and - ( funds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipper ratings for Preservation reflect funds&#39; historical loss avoidance relative to other funds within the same asset class. Preservation ratings are relative, rather than absolute, measures, and funds named Lipper Leaders for Preservation may still experience losses periodically; those losses may be larger for equity and mixed equity funds than for fixed income funds.

 


Tax Efficiency Global Long/Short Equity Fund received the following Tax Efficiency ratings for the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, respectively: 4 (195 funds), - ( funds), and - ( funds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipper ratings for Tax Efficiency (US) reflect funds&#39; historical success in postponing taxable distributions relative to peers. Tax Efficiency (US) offers no benefit to investors in tax-sheltered accounts such as retirement plans.

 


Overall Lipper Leaders ratings based on an equal-weighted average of percentile ranks for each measure over 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (if applicable) and do not take into account the effects of sales charges for these categories (Consistent Return, Preservation, Total Return, Expense, and Tax Efficiency) as of 30-Apr-2017 out of 194, 11,916, 195, 88 and 195 Funds, respectively in Lipper's Alt Long/Short Equity classification.

Important Information

 

* Volatility represented by annualized standard deviation. Compared to the MSCI World Index, an unmanaged free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets. The index consists of 23 developed countries, including the United States. It is not possible to invest directly in an unmanaged index.


Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary.  Stock values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions.  International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets.  The issuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose information that is, in the United States, considered material.  Investing in long/short strategies presents the opportunity for significant losses, including the loss of your total investment. Such strategies have the potential for heightened volatility and in general, are not suitable for all investors.  The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.  The fund may engage in active and frequent trading, resulting in short-term capital gains or losses that could increase an investors tax liability.  Short-selling entails special risks. If the fund makes short sales in securities that increase in value, the fund will lose value. Any loss on short positions may or may not be offset by investing short-sale proceeds in other investments.  Investing in small- and mid-cap companies may entail greater risk than large-cap companies, due to shorter operating histories, less seasoned management or lower trading volumes.  Morningstar Analyst Rating™is not a credit or risk rating. It is a subjective evaluation performed by Morningstar’s manager research group, which consists of various Morningstar, Inc. subsidiaries (“Manager Research Group”). In the United States, that subsidiary is Morningstar Research Services LLC, which is registered with and governed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Manager Research Group evaluates funds based on five key pillars, which are process, performance, people, parent, and price. The Manager Research Group uses this five pillar evaluation to determine how they believe funds are likely to perform relative to a benchmark, or in the case of exchange-traded funds and index mutual funds, a relevant peer group, over the long term on a risk-adjusted basis. They consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research, and the weight of each pillar may vary. The Analyst Rating scale is Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. A Morningstar Analyst Rating of Gold, Silver, or Bronze reflects the Manager Research Group’s conviction in a fund’s prospects for outperformance. Analyst Ratings ultimately reflect the Manager Research Group’s overall assessment, are overseen by an Analyst Rating Committee, and are continuously monitored and reevaluated at least every 14 months. For more detailed information about Morningstar’s Analyst Rating, including its methodology, please go to global.morningstar.com/managerdisclosures/. The Morningstar Analyst Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a fund, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause Analyst expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what they expected, and (iii) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the fund.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. Performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included. Performance during periods of exceptional market conditions should not be expected to be repeated in a normal market environment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.Fund details, holdings and characteristics are as of the date noted and subject to change. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the period. Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

Important Information

 

* Volatility represented by annualized standard deviation. Compared to the MSCI World Index, an unmanaged free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets. The index consists of 23 developed countries, including the United States. It is not possible to invest directly in an unmanaged index.


Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary.  Stock values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions.  International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets.  The issuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose information that is, in the United States, considered material.  Investing in long/short strategies presents the opportunity for significant losses, including the loss of your total investment. Such strategies have the potential for heightened volatility and in general, are not suitable for all investors.  The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.  The fund may engage in active and frequent trading, resulting in short-term capital gains or losses that could increase an investors tax liability.  Short-selling entails special risks. If the fund makes short sales in securities that increase in value, the fund will lose value. Any loss on short positions may or may not be offset by investing short-sale proceeds in other investments.  Investing in small- and mid-cap companies may entail greater risk than large-cap companies, due to shorter operating histories, less seasoned management or lower trading volumes.  Morningstar Analyst Rating™is not a credit or risk rating. It is a subjective evaluation performed by Morningstar’s manager research group, which consists of various Morningstar, Inc. subsidiaries (“Manager Research Group”). In the United States, that subsidiary is Morningstar Research Services LLC, which is registered with and governed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Manager Research Group evaluates funds based on five key pillars, which are process, performance, people, parent, and price. The Manager Research Group uses this five pillar evaluation to determine how they believe funds are likely to perform relative to a benchmark, or in the case of exchange-traded funds and index mutual funds, a relevant peer group, over the long term on a risk-adjusted basis. They consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research, and the weight of each pillar may vary. The Analyst Rating scale is Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. A Morningstar Analyst Rating of Gold, Silver, or Bronze reflects the Manager Research Group’s conviction in a fund’s prospects for outperformance. Analyst Ratings ultimately reflect the Manager Research Group’s overall assessment, are overseen by an Analyst Rating Committee, and are continuously monitored and reevaluated at least every 14 months. For more detailed information about Morningstar’s Analyst Rating, including its methodology, please go to global.morningstar.com/managerdisclosures/. The Morningstar Analyst Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a fund, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause Analyst expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what they expected, and (iii) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the fund.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. Performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included. Performance during periods of exceptional market conditions should not be expected to be repeated in a normal market environment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.Fund details, holdings and characteristics are as of the date noted and subject to change. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the period. Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 1.85% for A Shares, 2.35% for C Shares, 1.60% for I Shares, 2.10% for R2 Shares, 1.40% for R5 Shares and 1.35% for R6 Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 2/28/2018 for A Shares, 2/28/2018 for C Shares, 2/28/2018 for I Shares, 2/28/2018 for R2 Shares, 2/28/2018 for R5 Shares and 2/28/2018 for R6 Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index generally representative of the performance of large companies in the U.S. stock market. Index levels are in total return USD. The BofA Merrill Lynch 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index is comprised of a single issue purchased at the beginning of the month and held for a full month. The index is rebalanced monthly and the issue selected is the outstanding Treasury Bill that matures closest to, but not beyond 3 months from the rebalancing date. The performance of the Lipper Alternative Long/Short Equity Funds Index is based on the total returns of funds within the index. The Index includes expenses associated with with the mutual funds. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. An individual cannot invest directly in an index. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%.

Long Short Advisors﻿
Long Short Advisors, LLC is a mutual fund company based in Philadelphia that focuses on undiscovered alternative investments and boutique hedge fund investment strategies.  Our liquid alternative mutual fund products provide the advantages of daily liquidity, low initial investment minimums, more portfolio transparency, lower fees, and access to what we believe are some of the best hedge fund managers and investment managers in the business. We launched our first fund in 2010, a long/short equity mutual fund.Long Short Advisors is committed to bringing boutique institutional investment strategies once only accessible to institutions and ultra-high net worth clients.  We believe in strong alignment of interests with our partners.  Our sub advisors have significant personal investments in the strategies they manage on behalf of fund investors.Philosophy & DisciplineWe are looking for managers that do not follow the herd mentality and try to provide a unique edge and alpha to their strategies.  We believe unique investment managers are defined by several distinguishing traits.The manager has successfully implemented an investment strategy over at least one full market cycle.  There are periods between cycles when managers can generate high returns and low volatility by either explicitly or indirectly latching onto a specific, high performing factor exposure.  It is not until the end of a market cycle, after the prior excesses have been unwound, when we can then sufficiently evaluate the true sources of performance, the sustainability of the investment strategy, and the manager’s attitude towards risk management.We strongly prefer small and medium sized investment management firms as sub-advisors for our funds.  We believe there is an inflection point in the lifecycle of an investment firm where the distractions associated with managing a growing business become an impediment to investment performance.  Our sub-advisors eat their own cooking and have great passion for the investment process.  They hire world class middle and back-office professionals to minimize the time they spend away from managing the portfolio.As a corollary to our feelings on business structure, we partner with investment professionals who have clearly defined the capacity constraints associated with their strategies. We know that in most cases a portfolio manager’s ability to implement the strategy upon which the firm’s successful track record has been built is directly compromised at specific AUM thresholds.  Our sub-advisors will not compromise performance in pursuit of value destroying objectives.We require strong alignment of interests between our sub-advisors and investors in our mutual fund products.  Our sub-advisors have significant investments in the strategies they manage on behalf of Fund investors.  They also have a strong focus on our strategies with limited external business diversions.We believe our sub-advisors possess skills, attributes, and proficiencies that provide a clear competitive advantage distinguishing their strategies as unique.  We have collectively evaluated thousands of managers including who we believe are some of the best and brightest from a broad array of strategies.  This provides a high baseline standard against which we can efficiently identify core competencies that we believe are truly unique.Benefits of Liquid Alternatives?Compared to traditional hedge funds, our liquid alternative mutual fund products provide the advantages of...Daily liquidity / quoted on the exchangeFull quarterly portfolio transparencyNo performance feesLimited leverageNo need to be an accredited investorLower minimum initial investments ($5,000 for LSOFX)Alternatives Research & InsightLong Short Advisors is a resource for alternatives and liquid alternatives.

(Member FINRA)Investment in shares of a Long/Short equity fund is more volatile and risky than some other forms of investments. Since a Long/Short equity fund has both a long and a short portfolio, an investment in the Fund will involve risks associated with twice the number of investment decisions made for a typical stock fund. These types of funds typically have a high portfolio turnover that could increase transaction costs and cause short-term capital gains to be realized.Diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.Long Short Advisors is registered as an investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Information contained on this website does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of the Fund, nor shall any shares be offered or sold to any person in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, purchase, or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.This site also is not intended to provide specific individual advice including, without limitation, investment, financial, legal, accounting, or tax advice.FINRA's BrokerCheckCheck the background ofLong Short Advisors LLCon FINRA's BrokerCheck

	*Formerly known as the Turner Spectrum Fund and and subsequently Turner Titan II Fund


	 


	The Turner Titan Long/Short Fund invests in stocks of companies with primarily large capitalization ranges across all major industry sectors using a long/short strategy in seeking to capture alpha, reduce volatility, and preserve capital in declining markets.

 Investment Objectives
	The Turner Titan Long/Short Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation and is intended for investors seeking long-term growth of capital.

 Investment Process
	We understand the DNA of great growth companies:





	The heart of Turner’s stock selection process is fundamental analysis. For long positions, we seek to identify:


	Global companies benefiting from change:


Accelerating earnings
Improving expectations
High returns on capital


	Industry leaders:


Strong management
Sustainable earnings, margins, and revenue growth
Compelling new products and services
Open-ended business opportunities
Market share gains


	For short positions, we seek to identify companies that exhibit the following:


Decelerating earnings prospects and declining business momentum.
Overwhelming competitive or financial challenges with negative near-term catalysts.
Loss of market share due to poor execution or a lack of innovation.
Questionable accounting practices and deteriorating operating models.

 Risk Disclosure
The performance data quoted represents past performance and the principal value and investment return will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown here. Please call 800.224.6312 or visit our website www.turnerinvestments.com for performance current to the most recent month end. Returns shown, unless otherwise indicated, are total returns, with dividends and income reinvested. Returns spanning more than one year are annualized. Fee waivers are in effect; if they had not been in effect performance would have been lower.


Past performance can vary over short periods. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.


	Since it purchases equity securities, including common stocks, the Fund is subject to the risk that stock prices will fall over short or extended periods of time.  These factors contribute to price volatility, which is the principal risk of investing in the Fund.  


	 


	The Fund may focus its investments from time to time on one or more economic sectors.  To the extent that it does so, developments affecting companies in that sector or sectors will likely have a magnified effect on the Fund’s net asset value and total return.


	The Fund is subject to the risks associated with selling securities short. A short sale involves a finite opportunity for appreciation, but a theoretically unlimited risk of loss. 


	The smaller capitalization companies the Fund invests in may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. Therefore, small cap stock prices may be more volatile than those of larger companies.


	The Fund is subject to risks due to its foreign investments.  Foreign investments may be riskier than U.S. investments because of factors such as foreign government restrictions, changes in currency exchange rates, incomplete financial information about the issuers of securities, and political or economic instability.  Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The risks associated with foreign investments are heightened when investing in emerging markets. Such investments tend to fluctuate in price more widely and to be less liquid than other foreign investment.


	The Fund is subject to risks associated with the use of options, including: (1) the success of a hedging strategy may depend on an ability to predict movements in the prices of individual securities, fluctuations in markets and movements in interest rates; (2) there may be an imperfect correlation between the movement in prices of options and the securities underlying them; (3) there may not be a liquid secondary market for options; and (4) while the Fund will receive a premium when it writes call options, it may not participate fully in a rise in the market value of the underlying security.

Capital Gains


All mutual funds, regardless of performance, must distribute to shareholders any net realized gains from the sale of individual securities in their portfolios. Distributions are made to those who are registered shareholders of the fund on the record date. Distributions are paid on the pay date. All dates and distributions are subject to board approval. Distributions will vary depending on the funds' income and any profits realized from the sale of securities in the funds' portfolio. Past distributions are not indicative of future trends. A fund's per share capital gain distributions are the same for each share class offered.


Below is the list of Turner Funds and capital gains distributions, as of December 19, 2016. Capital gains are payable to the shareholders of record as of December 16, 2016 (the "Record Date") with the distribution occurring on December 20, 2016 (the "Payable Date"). These estimated distributions can change prior to the distribution date due to market activity and change in shares outstanding. The distributions do not include ordinary income distributions the fund may be making. In December, we plan to provide final estimates, including a breakdown between long and short-term gains and income, for all funds. Final distribution amounts will be added to each fund's profile page after the fund's declaration date in December. Shareholders are strongly advised to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of their investments in the funds.


To estimate your distribution for a fund on this list, multiply the number of shares you own by the fund’s total per-share capital gains estimates.
