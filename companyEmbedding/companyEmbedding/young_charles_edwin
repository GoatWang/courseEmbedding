                                    Patents by Inventor Charles Edwin Young
                                




                    Charles Edwin Young has filed for patents to protect the following inventions. This listing includes patent applications that are pending as well as patents that have already been granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
                







Error control for digital multipoint circuits



Patent number:  4048441
                                            

Abstract:  A multipoint synchronous data network is formed by junction units which provide signal paths that interconnect incoming branch lines to a common outgoing branch. The junction units arranged to combine the branches so that data words on one branch are propagated up the common branch, subject to the condition that only one branch can send to the common branch at a time. Each data word includes a designation whether the word carries message information or control information (such as an idle branch condition). Control words are blocked by the junction unit so that message words from a sending branch are not garbled by control words from idle branches.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed: 
                        July 6, 1976
                    

Date of Patent: 
                                                        September 13, 1977
                        

Assignee: 
                                                                        Bell Telephone Laboratories, Incorporated
                                

Inventor:

The main location for Hamilton County Sheriff's Office is downtown Chattanooga at the corner of 6th and Market streets.

Connected to this building is the Justice Building, housing the Corrections, Fugitive, and Civil Process Divisions.

The Hamilton County Jail strives to provide high-quality confinement services in a safe and humane environment. The jail has recently taken on the task of achieving national accreditation from the American Correctional Association. The Accreditation Manager monitors policies and procedures, operational practices, vulnerability assessments, Tennessee Corrections Institute (TCI) standards, American Correctional Association (ACA) standards, and National Commission on Correctional Healthcare (NCCHC) standards to obtain and maintain compliance.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/29/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
