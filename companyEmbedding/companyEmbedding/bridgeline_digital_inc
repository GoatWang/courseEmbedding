Bridgeline remains well ahead of the content management curve, offering true benefit and creative solutions to the industry. With iAPPS’ latest innovations, they have added significant advantages that organizations can easily use to manage and interpret online campaigns and enhance results on an ongoing basis.
Hugh McKellarEditor in ChiefKMWorld Magazine








The Bridgeline Difference



It’s clear. The success of your business is directly linked to the effectiveness of your web assets. Your websites, online stores, intranets, extranets, and portals are your hardest working employee and the most powerful marketing and operational tool available to you today.


But even the most accomplished websites can lose their leading edge. How do you ensure that your online efforts attract visitors, keep them engaged, convert them to customers, and maximize your revenue every single day? How do you ensure that you streamline your operations and reduce your overhead every single day?


With award-winning interactive technology solutions from Bridgeline Digital, recognized for four consecutive years as one of the top U.S. interactive technology companies by BtoB Magazine, your business can swiftly enhance and optimize its web properties – and keep them delivering maximum returns.


At Bridgeline, we believe that knowledge is power. And when your web applications are unified and deeply integrated, you can more effectively harness that power through optimized business processes, enhanced user adoption and user experiences, improved business efficiencies and data integrity, and ultimately a higher ROI. KMWorld Magazine agrees, naming Bridgeline as one of the "100 Companies That Matter in Knowledge Management" for 2012.



At the heart of our technology portfolio is the award-winning iAPPS Product Suite, an innovative, feature-rich digital engagement management platform that unifies web Content Management, Web Analytics, eCommerce, and eMarketing capabilities. iAPPS provides deep, integrated, and powerful capabilities that can propel your web assets to a whole new level. The iAPPS architecture is flexible, highly scalable, and can be installed as a traditional perpetual license or through a SaaS monthly subscription fee.

        Burlington, MA | July 26, 2017
      

        Bridgeline Digital, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLIN), a provider in cloud-based Web Content Management, eCommerce and Marketing Automation services, announced today that it will effect a one-for-five (1-for-5) reverse stock split previously approved by the Company's Board of Directors and its stockholders at the Company's annual meeting held on June 29, 2017. The one-for-five (1-for-5) reverse stock split will be effective as of close of business on July 24, 2017 and the Company's stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 25, 2017.
      

        The reverse stock split will reduce the number of shares of the Company's common stock currently outstanding from approximately 21 million shares to approximately 4 million shares. Proportional adjustments will be made to the conversion and exercise prices of the Company's outstanding convertible preferred stock, warrants, restricted stock awards, and to the number of shares issued and issuable under the Company's stock option plans. The number of authorized shares of the Company's common stock will remain 50 million shares and the par value will remain $0.001.
      

        The reverse stock split is intended to increase the market price per share of the Company's common stock to allow the Company to maintain the listing of its common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market. The Company's common stock will continue to trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol 'BLIN'. The new CUSIP number for the common stock following the reverse stock split will be 10807Q403.
      

        Information for Stockholders
      

        Upon the effectiveness of the reverse split, each five shares of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock will be automatically combined and converted into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $.001. The Company will not issue any fractional shares in connection with the reverse stock split. Instead, fractional share interests will be rounded up to the next largest whole share. The reverse stock split will not modify the rights or preferences of the common stock.
      

        The Company's transfer agent, American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC, will act as its exchange agent for the reverse stock split. American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC will provide stockholders of record holding certificates representing pre-split shares of the Company's common stock as of the effective date a letter of transmittal providing instructions for the exchange of shares. Registered stockholders holding pre-split shares of the Company's common stock electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive post-split shares. Shareholders owning shares via a broker or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split, subject to brokers' particular processes, and will not be required to take action in connection with the reverse stock split. American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC can be reached at (877) 248-6417 or (718) 921-8317.
      

        Additional information about the reverse stock split can be found in the Company's definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 16, 2017, a copy of which is also available at www.sec.gov or www.bridgelinedigital.com under the SEC Filings tab located on the Investor Information page.
      

        Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
      

All statements included in this press release, other than statements or characterizations of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management's beliefs, and certain assumptions made by us, all of which are subject to change.

These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the impact of the weakness in the U.S. and international economies on our business, our inability to manage our future growth effectively or profitably, fluctuations in our revenue and quarterly results, our license renewal rate, the impact of competition and our ability to maintain margins or market share, the limited market for our common stock, the ability to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the ability to raise capital, the volatility of the market price of our common stock, the performance of our products, our ability to respond to rapidly evolving technology and customer requirements, our ability to protect our proprietary technology, the security of our software, our dependence on our management team and key personnel, our ability to hire and retain future key personnel, or our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls as well as other risks described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Any of such risks could cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
