United Orient Capital


About Us
About United Orient Capital FundAbout United Overseas Bank LimitedAbout ORIX Corporation
About United Orient Capital Fund
The United Orient Capital Fund L.P. (UOC Fund) is sponsored by United Overseas Bank Limited (UOB),  a leading bank in Asia, and ORIX Corporation of Japan, an integrated global financial group. UOC is focused on delivering sustainable and superior risk-adjusted returns to investors through the Fund, which offers mezzanine investment products and services across Southeast Asia, Greater China and in other parts of Asia Pacific. 
Historically, mezzanine investments have provided stable returns through economic cycles.  As mezzanine funds typically receive interest income and scheduled principal repayments, they are able to provide investors with more stable and faster returns on capital compared with private equity investment funds.
The benefits of mezzanine investment products and services, compared with other alternative investments, include:

In-depth local presence to drive deal origination
Lower volatility
Faster return of capital
Reduced exit risk
More consistent returns through the investment cycle (lower J-curve effect)
Stable valuations

UOC is committed to delivering strong investment performance of the UOC Fund through the following:

Deep local presence to drive deal origination
Proven strategy to tap on the attractive but under-served demand for mezzanine financing
Strong structuring capabilities to provide tailored investment approaches
Unique value-add  to investees through extensive networks

Backed by UOB’s and ORIX’s extensive networks and relationships across Asia, UOC assists investee companies to identify new customers to drive business growth as well as new suppliers in order to lower operating costs. This also allows investee companies to diversify their customer and supplier base. 
Through UOB and ORIX, UOC’s appeal to investee companies also lies in the opportunities to identify joint venture partners in order to gain access to new markets, technology, branding and other resources.

About United Overseas Bank Limited
United Overseas Bank Limited (UOB) is a leading bank in Asia with a global network of more than 500 offices in 19 countries and territories in Asia Pacific, Western Europe and North America.  Since its incorporation in 1935, UOB has grown organically and through a series of strategic acquisitions. In Asia it operates through its branches and representative offices as well as banking subsidiaries in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.  
UOB is rated among the world’s top banks: Aa1 by Moody’s and AA- by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings respectively.
UOB provides a wide range of financial services including personal financial services, private banking, business banking, commercial and corporate banking, transaction banking, investment banking, corporate finance, capital market activities, treasury services, brokerage and clearing services, asset management, venture capital management and insurance.
