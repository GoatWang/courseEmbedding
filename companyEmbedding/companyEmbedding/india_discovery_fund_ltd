Equity Investments - The Scheme aims to provide long term capital growth by investing in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and equity related securities. The Scheme will endeavour to invest in companies that offer high relative value vis –a vis other companies and fall within top 500 by market capitalization. The Scheme will invest across market capitalization and without any sector bias.

			A company is considered as showing high relative value if it has a combination of higher Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) and higher Earnings Yield. Top 500 stocks by market capitalization would be ranked individually on both these criterion separately. Both these criterion would be assigned certain weights based on the prevailing market conditions and valuations. These individual ranks would then be multiplied with respective weights and added to arrive at a final rank score for each stock. These stocks would then be screened on the basis of strength & quality of the business & balance sheet using Piotroski score, apart from certain other criteria like corporate governance standards and liquidity, to arrive at a final list of eligible securities. Stock with highest rank scores would then be included in the portfolio. Maximum number of stocks in the portfolio would not exceed 40.

			Portfolio would ideally be reviewed on a quarterly basis or on happening of certain events like poor corporate governance practice by a company, liquidity profile changing or valuations getting stretched for individual stock or for market as a whole.

			Following is the illustration of methodology to be followed for stock selection:

			The stock selection process begins with the calculation of ‘Return on Capital’ and ‘Earning yield’ for Top 500 companies by market capitalization. These companies are then ranked based on higher ‘Return on Capital’, and higher ‘Earnings Yield’ as demonstrated below,

			Based on these calculations, the company shall be ranked for 'Return on Capital’ and ‘Earning Yield’ within the Top 500 companies. Both the individual ranks are then assigned weightages based on market conditions as specified under column ‘Ratio’. The weighted rank score is then computed and Top 500 companies are then organized as per their individual score to arrive at the final rank. The Piotroski score for each company is then assigned and considered while shortlisting the scrip. Understanding Piotroski Score: It is a discrete score between 0-9 which reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a firm's financial position. The Piotroski score is used to determine the best value stocks, nine being the best. The score was named after Chicago Accounting Professor, Joseph Piotroski who devised the scale according to specific criteria found in the financial statements. For every criteria (below) that is met the company is given one point, if it is not met, then no points are awarded. The points are then added up to determine the best value stocks.

Profitablity
			Positive return on assets in the current year (1 point).
			Positive operating cash flow in the current year (1 point).
			Higher return on assets (ROA) in the current period compared to the ROA in the previous year (1 point).
			Cash flow from operations are greater than ROA (1 point) .

Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds
			Lower ratio of long term debt to in the current period compared value in the previous year (1 point).
			Higher current ratio this year compared to the previous year (1 point).
			No new shares were issued in the last year (1 point).

Operating Efficiency
			A higher gross margin compared to the previous year (1 point).
			A higher asset turnover ratio compared to the previous year (1 point).

Debt Investments - The Scheme will retain the flexibility to invest in the entire range of debt instruments and money market instruments. Investment in Debt securities and Money Market Instruments will be as per the limits in the asset allocation table of the Scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI (MF) Regulations. The actual percentage of investment in various fixed income securities will be decided after considering the prevailing political conditions, the economic environment (including interest rates and inflation), the performance of the corporate sector and general liquidity and other considerations in the economy and markets. The investment management team is allowed full discretion to make sale and purchase decisions within the limits established.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
