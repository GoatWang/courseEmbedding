JMC Capital Partners Closes Second Platform Fund At $206M Hard Cap
Jan 13 2017  |  10:51pm ET

JMC Capital Partners has raised $206 million in capital commitments for its second platform fund. 
The new fund, named JMC Platform Fund II, was significantly oversubscribed and closed at its hard cap, the company said in a statement. Investors in the fund represent a diverse group of global private equity investors, including foundations, endowments and family offices. 
JMC’s first platform fund raised $125 million in 2014.
Consistent with JMC's private equity strategy and investment philosophy, Fund II will focus on lower-lower market opportunities in the industrial products and industrial technology industries.
"Since inception, JMC has invested heavily in all areas of the firm, and continues to do so,” said Michael D'Amelio, JMC's managing partner. “We are appreciative of the support and confidence we have received from both our existing and new investors.”
Goodwin Procter served as legal advisor to JMC Capital Partners, the company added. 
Founded in 1999 and based in Boston, JMC Capital Partners focuses exclusively on executing a platform investment strategy within the lower middle-market industrial product and technology sectors.

 Beyond the tear sheet: War stories from the front lines of hedge fund due diligence 
 Investing in private partnership structures such as hedge funds, private equity and private real estate can be a fruitful and exciting endeavor, especially when venturing into asset classes that lack competition and efficiency. An important qualification to remember when beginning due diligence on a partnership is that no investment is perfect. Each one has its own risks, however esoteric or idiosyncratic, and risks change over time, as do the operations and other intricacies of investment management.
