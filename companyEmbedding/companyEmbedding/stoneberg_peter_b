LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kilroy Realty Corporation (KRC:NYSE) today announced that Gary R.

      two decades, Mr. Stevenson has held leadership positions with PAC-12 
      Enterprises, the National Basketball Association, and the PGA Tour. In 
      1997, Mr. Stevenson founded OnSport Strategies, a sports and 
      entertainment consulting company which he led as chairman and chief 
      executive officer until its acquisition by the Wasserman Media Group in 
      2007.
    

      Mr. Stoneberg is managing partner of Velocity Ventures, LLC, a merchant 
      banking firm he founded fourteen years ago. His extensive background in 
      investment banking includes seven years as senior managing director with 
      Montgomery Securities, where he founded and led the firm’s technology 
      mergers and acquisitions group until its acquisition by Bank of America 
      in 1999.
    

      Both Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Stoneberg were elected to KRC’s board, along 
      with four currently serving directors, during the company’s annual 
      meeting held earlier this week. William P. Dickey, a KRC board member 
      since the company’s initial public offering in 1997, retired from the 
      board.
    

      "We’re delighted to welcome Peter and Gary to our board of directors," 
      said John Kilroy, Jr., KRC's chairman, president and chief executive 
      officer. "Their extensive business experience, particularly in the 
      technology and media industries, will be an invaluable asset to our 
      organization.”
    

      “We would also like to acknowledge the tremendous contributions that 
      Bill Dickey has made to KRC,” said Kilroy. “He has played a key role in 
      our organization’s growth and development since our IPO seventeen years 
      ago.”
