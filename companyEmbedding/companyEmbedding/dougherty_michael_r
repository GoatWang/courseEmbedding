I look forward to working closely with Scott Jackson and the other members of Celator's leadership team in fulfilling our mission of bringing¬†new and more effective cancer therapies to patients."

About¬†Celator Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Celator Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with locations in¬†Ewing, N.J., and¬†Vancouver, B.C., is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that is transforming the science of combination therapy, and developing products to improve patient outcomes in cancer. Celator's proprietary technology platform, CombiPlex¬Æ, enables the rational design and rapid evaluation of optimized combinations incorporating traditional chemotherapies as well as molecularly targeted agents to deliver enhanced anti-cancer activity.¬† CombiPlex addresses several fundamental shortcomings of conventional combination regimens, as well as the challenges inherent in combination drug development, by identifying the most effective synergistic molar ratio of the drugs being combined¬†in vitro, and fixing this ratio in a nano-scale drug delivery complex to maintain the optimized combination after administration and ensure its exposure to the tumor.¬† Celator's pipeline includes lead product, CPX-351 (a liposomal formulation of cytarabine:daunorubicin) for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia; CPX-1 (a liposomal formulation of irinotecan: floxuridine) for the treatment of colorectal cancer; a preclinical stage product candidate, CPX-8 (a hydrophobic docetaxel prodrug nanoparticle formulation), being studied by the¬†National Cancer Institute's¬†Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory.¬† The company is advancing the CombiPlex platform and broadening its application to include molecularly targeted therapies and epigenetic modulators.

The Long Ride Home, a classic western short story

One more gunfight brings him home

In this classic western, an old west gunfighter is tired of having to prove himself to every young upstart who wants to make a name for himself by out drawing a famous gunfighter.

But after being shot in an ambush, the gunfighter meets a woman and her young boy who make him think about hanging up his gun. But who ambushed him, and why?

One more gunfight brings him home. A classic western with a message.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
