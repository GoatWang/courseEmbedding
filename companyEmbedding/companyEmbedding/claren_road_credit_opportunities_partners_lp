THIS PLAN WARRANT AGREEMENT (this

2016, is by and among Warren Resources, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the “ Company ”), and Claren Road
Credit Master Fund, Ltd. and Claren Road Credit Opportunities
Master Fund, Ltd (collectively, “ Claren Road ”)
and the other Registered Holders from time to time party
hereto.

WHEREAS , on July 11, 2016, Warren Resources, Inc.,
a Maryland corporation and predecessor to the Company (the “
Parent Debtor ”), certain Subsidiaries of the Parent
Debtor, GSO Capital Partners LP, solely on behalf of and it its
capacity as investment adviser or sub-adviser to, certain funds and
accounts (including subsidiaries of such funds and accounts)
advised or sub-advised by it or its affiliates and named as
signatories thereto, Claren Road, and the beneficial holders of
Senior Notes Claims (as defined therein) that are party thereto,
entered into that certain Amended and Restated Restructuring
Support Agreement (the “ Restructuring Support
Agreement ”) related to the restructuring of the Debt
Claims (as defined therein) of the Parent Debtor (the “
Restructuring ”);

WHEREAS , on September 14, 2016, the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston
Division) entered the Confirmation Order (as defined in the
Restructuring Support Agreement) confirming the Agreed
Restructuring Plan (as defined in the Restructuring Support
Agreement);

WHEREAS , on the date hereof, the Agreed Restructuring
Plan became effective, pursuant to which, among other things, the
Parent Debtor was re-domiciled to the State of Delaware as the
Company and warrants exercisable, in accordance with the terms
hereof, for an aggregate of 526,316 shares of Common Stock (the
“ Warrants ”) are being issued to Claren
Road;

NOW , THEREFORE , in consideration of the
mutual agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as
follows.

1. Warrants .

1.1 Register .

1.1.1 Warrant Register . The
Warrants shall be issued in book entry only. The Company shall
maintain a register for the Warrants in which the Company shall
record the name and address of each Person in whose name Warrants
have been issued (including the name and address of each
Transferee) and the number of Warrants held by such Person (the
“ Warrant Register ”), for the registration of
original issuance and the registration of Transfer of the Warrants.
Upon the initial issuance of the Warrants, the Company shall issue
and register the Warrants in the names of the respective holders
thereof in accordance with the Warrant Register as of the date
hereof attached hereto.

1.1.2 Registered Holder .
Prior to due presentment for registration of Transfer of any
Warrant, the Company may deem and treat the Person in whose name
such Warrant is registered in the Warrant Register (the “
Registered Holder ” or “ Holder ”)
as the absolute owner of such Warrant.


2. Terms and Exercise of Warrants
.

2.1 Warrant Price . Each
Warrant shall entitle the Registered Holder thereof, subject to the
provisions of such Warrant, this Agreement and that certain
Stockholders Agreement of the Company, dated as of the date hereof,
by and among the Company and the stockholders party thereto (as the
same may be amended from time to time, the “ Stockholders
Agreement ”), to purchase from the Company up to the
number of shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01
per share (“ Common Stock ”), stated in the
Warrants Register, at an exercise price of $10.50 per share (the
“ Warrant Price ”), subject to the adjustments
provided in Section 3. “ Warrant Price ”
shall mean the price per share at which Common Stock may be
purchased at the time a Warrant is exercised, as determined
pursuant to the preceding sentence and Section 3
.

2.2 Duration of Warrants . A
Warrant may be exercised in whole or in part and only during the
period (the “Exercise Period” ) commencing on
the date hereof and terminating at 5:00 p.m., New York City time on
October 5, 2021 (the “Expiration Date” ).
Each Warrant not exercised on or before the Expiration Date shall
become void, and all rights thereunder and all rights in respect
thereof under this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement shall
cease at 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the Expiration Date. The
Company may, subject to the Stockholders Agreement, extend the
duration of the Warrants by delaying the Expiration Date. If a
Change of Control (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) is
consummated prior to the Expiration Date in which 100% of the
consideration paid to or received by non-employee holders of Common
Stock in such Change of Control consists of cash and the cash
payable per share of Common Stock is less than or equal to the
Warrant Price on the date (the “ Sale Date ”)
such Change of Control is consummated, each Warrant not exercised
at or before the Sale Date shall become void, and all rights
thereunder and all rights in respect thereof under this Agreement
and the Stockholders Agreement shall cease with respect to a
percentage of such the shares of Common Stock for which such
Warrant is exercisable corresponding to the aggregate percentage of
the shares of Common Stock or other Equity Securities that included
in such Change of Control.

2.3 Exercise of Warrants
.

2.3.1 Payment . Subject to
the provisions of the Warrant, this Agreement and the Stockholders
Agreement, a Warrant may be exercised by the Registered Holder
thereof by delivering to the Company an exercise form, as attached
hereto (each, an “ Exercise Notice ”), duly
executed, and by paying in full the Warrant Price for each full
share of Common Stock as to which the Warrant is exercised, as
follows:

(a) with respect to the exercise of
any Warrant on a “ cash basis ”, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, in good certified check or
good bank draft payable to the order of the Company; or

(b) with respect to the exercise of
any Warrant on a “ cashless basis ”, by
so indicating on the Exercise Notice, in which case such Registered
Holder will receive that number of shares of Common Stock equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the product of the
number of shares of Common Stock underlying such Warrant or any
portion thereof being exercised (at the election of the Registered
Holder as indicated on the Exercise Notice), multiplied
by the
 
2


difference between the Fair Market Value and the
Warrant Price by (ii) the Fair Market Value. “ Fair
Market Value ” means the fair market value per share of
Common Stock based on the fair market value of the Company as an
enterprise, on the date such Registered Holder delivers its
Exercise Notice to the Company ( provided that the Board may
consider such facts, events and circumstances that may arise after
such date that as of such date were known or reasonably foreseen to
be likely to occur) as determined within 10 business days of the
delivery of the Exercise Notice by the Board of Directors of the
Company (the “ Board ”), considering such
factors as it determines to be appropriate (which factors are not
required to include, and the Board’s determination of Fair
Market Value may differ materially from, the trading prices, if
any, for the Common Stock, whether on a securities exchange or
otherwise), in its good faith judgment; provided that, in
the event that the Registered Holders provide notice to the Company
of their good faith objection to the determination of Fair Market
Value made by the Board or the Board fails to make such
determination within 10 business days of the delivery of the
Exercise Notice, the Registered Holders may obtain a third party
determination of Fair Market Value by a nationally recognized
investment banking or valuation firm mutually reasonably acceptable
to the Board and such Registered Holders, at the sole cost and
expense of the Registered Holders requesting such valuation, and
such determination shall be binding on such requesting Registered
Holders and the Company with respect to such cashless exercise and
any other exercise of Warrants on a “cashless basis”
within 60 days of such determination.

2.3.2 Issuance of Common Stock on
Exercise . As soon as practicable after the exercise of any
Warrant and the clearance of the funds in payment of the Warrant
Price (if payment is on a “ cash basis ”
pursuant to Section 2.3.1(a) ), the Company shall issue
to the Registered Holder of such Warrant the number of full shares
of Common Stock to which such Registered Holder is entitled,
registered in such name or names as may be directed by such
Registered Holder.

2.3.3 Valid Issuance . All
Common Stock issued upon the proper exercise of a Warrant in
conformity with this Agreement shall be validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable, and free and clear of all liens. All shares of
Common Stock delivered upon exercise of the Warrants shall be newly
issued shares or shares held in treasury by the Company, and shall
not be subject to any preemptive rights and shall rank pari
passu in all respects with other existing Common
Stock.

2.3.4 Date of Issuance . Each
Person in whose name any Common Stock is issued shall for all
purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of such
Common Stock on the date on which the Exercise Notice was delivered
and payment of the Warrant Price was made, except that, if the date
of such delivery and payment is a date when the share transfer
books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to
have become the holder of such shares at the close of business on
the next succeeding date on which the share transfer books are
open. The Company shall, upon request of the Holder, use its
reasonable best efforts to record the ownership of the Warrant
Shares upon exercise in book entry form rather than through the
issuance of physical stock certificates ( provided that such
book entry interests will continue to be subject to any required
restrictive legends).

3. Adjustments . The number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of any Warrant, as well as the
Warrant Price, is subject to adjustment from time to time as set
forth in this Section 3 .

3.1 Share Dividends . If
after the date hereof the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock is increased by a stock dividend payable in Common Stock
(including other classes of common stock of the Company that are
pari passu with the Common Stock), or by a split-up or
sub-division of Common Stock or other similar event, then, on the
effective date of such stock dividend, split-up, sub-division or
other similar event, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
on exercise of each Warrant shall be increased in proportion to
such increase in the outstanding shares of Common Stock, subject to
Section 3.7 . If after the date hereof a dividend or
distribution is payable in equity securities other than Common
Stock, then, on the effective date of such dividend or
distribution, each Warrant shall also be exercisable for the total
number and kind of such other equity securities (so long as such
other equity securities or any equity replacement or
reclassification thereof are outstanding) to which each Registered
Holder thereof would have been entitled had it held the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Warrant as of the
record date of the dividend.

3.2 Aggregation of Shares .
If after the date hereof the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse stock
split or reclassification of Common Stock or other similar event,
then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination,
reverse stock split, reclassification or similar event, the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise of each Warrant
shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding
Common Stock, subject to Section 3.7 .

3.3 Adjustments in Warrant
Price . Whenever the number of shares of Common Stock
purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants is adjusted, as
provided in Section 3.1 or Section 3.2 ,
the Warrant Price shall be adjusted (to the nearest cent) by
multiplying such Warrant Price immediately prior to such adjustment
by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the number
of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the
Warrants immediately prior to such adjustment, and (y) the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
so purchasable immediately thereafter.

3.4 Reorganization, etc . In
case of any recapitalization, reclassification or reorganization of
the outstanding Common Stock (other than a change under
Section 3.1 or Section 3.2 or that solely
affects the par value of such Common Stock), or in the case of any
amalgamation, conversion, merger or consolidation of the Company
with or into another corporation or other entity (other than a
consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing
corporation and that does not result in any recapitalization,
reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding Common
Stock), or in the case of any sale, lease, license, transfer or
conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other
property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an
entirety in connection with which the Company is dissolved,
liquidated or wound up (any of the foregoing, an “ Organic
Change ”), but subject in all such events to the
provisions of Section 3.2 of the Stockholders Agreement, from
and after such Organic Change, each Registered Holder, following
the exercise of such Warrants in accordance herewith shall be
entitled to receive, in lieu of or addition to (as the case may be)
the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore acquirable and
receivable upon the exercise of such
 
4


Registered Holder’s Warrant, such shares
of stock, securities or assets as would have been issued or payable
in such Organic Change (if the Registered Holder had exercised its
Warrant immediately prior to such Organic Change) with respect to
or in exchange for the shares of Common Stock then acquirable and
receivable upon exercise of such Registered Holder’s Warrant
had such Organic Change not taken place. In any such case,
appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board)
shall be made in the application of the provisions set forth herein
with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of each
Registered Holder, to the end that the provisions set forth in this
Section 3 (including provisions with respect to changes
in and other adjustments of the Warrant Price) shall thereafter be
applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any
stock or other securities thereafter deliverable upon the exercise
of this Warrant.

3.5 Notices of Changes in
Warrant . Upon every adjustment of the Warrant Price or the
number of shares (or other capital stock or securities) issuable or
receivable upon exercise of a Warrant, the Company shall give
prompt written notice thereof to the Registered Holders, which
notice shall state the increase or decrease, if any, in Warrant
Price resulting from such adjustment and the increase or decrease,
if any, in the number of shares (or other capital stock or
securities) purchasable at the Warrant Price upon the exercise of a
Warrant, setting forth in reasonable detail the method of
calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based.
Upon the occurrence of any event specified in
Sections 3.1 , 3.2 , 3.3 or 
3.4 , the Company shall give written notice of the
occurrence of such event to each Registered Holder, at the last
address set forth for such holder in the Warrant Register, and the
record date or the effective date of the event. Failure to give
such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality
or validity of such event.

3.6 Notice of Record Date and
Certain Events . In the event: (a) that the Company shall
take a record of the holders of its Common Stock (or other capital
stock or securities at the time issuable upon exercise of the
Warrant) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive
any dividend or other distribution, to receive any right to
subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class
or any other securities, or to receive any other property;
(b) of any recapitalization or reorganization of the Company,
any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Company, any
amalgamation, conversion, consolidation or merger of the Company
with or into another Person, or sale, lease, license, transfer or
conveyance of all or substantially all of the Company’s
assets to another Person; or (c) of the voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company;
then, and in each such case, the Company shall send or cause to be
sent to the Registered Holders at least ten (10) business days
prior to the applicable record date or the applicable expected
effective date, as the case may be, for the event, a written notice
specifying, as the case may be, (i) the record date for such
dividend, distribution, or other right, and a description of such
dividend, distribution or other right, or (ii) the effective
date on which such reorganization, reclassification, amalgamation,
conversion, consolidation, merger, sale, lease, license, transfer,
conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to
take place, and the date, if any is to be fixed, as of which the
books of the Company shall close or a record shall be taken with
respect to which the holders of record of Common Stock (or such
other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon
exercise of the Warrant) shall be entitled to exchange their shares
of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or securities) for
securities or other property deliverable upon such
recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification, amalgamation,
conversion, consolidation or merger, sale, dissolution,
liquidation
 
5


or winding-up, and the amount per share and
character of such exchange applicable to the Warrant and the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants. Failure to
give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the
legality or validity of such event.

3.7 No Fractional Shares .
Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company shall not issue fractional shares of Common
Stock upon exercise of Warrants. If, by reason of any adjustment
made pursuant to this Section 3, the holder of any Warrant
would be entitled, upon the exercise of such Warrant, to receive a
fractional interest in a share of Common Stock, the Company shall,
upon such exercise, at its option either (a) round up to the
nearest whole number, the number of shares of Common Stock to be
issued to such holder or (b) in lieu of such fractional share
interests, pay to such holder (or, with respect to any exercise of
the Warrant on a cash basis, reduce the aggregate Warrant Price to
be paid to the Company upon such exercise by) an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled by (ii) the Fair Market Value on the exercise
date.

4. Transfer and Exchange of
Warrants .

4.1 Generally . No Registered
Holder shall Transfer any outstanding Warrant except (a) in
compliance with or pursuant to an exemption from the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities Act ”),
and any applicable state securities laws and (b) in compliance
with the Stockholders Agreement.

4.2 Registration of Transfer
. The Company shall register the Transfer, from time to time, of
any outstanding Warrant upon the Warrant Register, upon delivery of
a duly executed assignment, in the form attached hereto, and
accompanied by appropriate instructions for Transfer and the
delivery by the Transferee of an executed joinder or counterpart to
this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement, in the form attached
hereto and thereto pursuant to which such Transferee agrees to be
bound by the provisions of this Agreement and the Stockholders
Agreement.

4.3 Fractional Warrants . The
Company shall not be required to effect any registration of
Transfer or exchange that shall result in the issuance of a Warrant
exercisable for a fraction of a share of Common Stock.

5. Other Provisions Relating to
Rights of Holders of Warrants .

5.1 Stockholders Agreement .
The Warrants shall at all times be subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Stockholders Agreement.

5.2 Certain Other Notices .
The Registered Holders shall be entitled to receive copies of any
notices provided to holders of Common Stock generally. Any such
notices will be delivered to, and the obligations under this
Section 5.2 will be deemed to be satisfied when such
notices are delivered to, the Named Holder (as defined in the
Stockholders Agreement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in
the definition of Significant Interest Holder) for Registered
Holders, if applicable, initially being Claren Road Asset
Management LLC.

5.3 No Rights as Stockholder;
Limitation on Liability . Except as otherwise provided in the
Stockholders Agreement and herein, a Warrant does not entitle the
Registered Holder thereof to any of the rights of a stockholder of

                Claren Road management will buy back the 55 percent stake
            



                Carlyle shifting focus to its global credit business
            



Carlyle Group LP is selling its majority stake in Claren Road Asset Management back to the fund’s top executives as the private equity firm moves to end its six-year foray into hedge funds.

Claren Road, founded in 2005 by former Citigroup Inc. credit traders Brian Riano, John Eckerson, Sean Fahey and Albert Marino, will buy the 55 percent stake that Carlyle acquired in December 2010, according to a note sent last week to investors. The transaction is expected to occur on Jan. 31, the note said. Claren Road started this year with $1.25 billion in assets, down from a high of $8.5 billion in September 2014, amid losses and client redemptions.“With our opportunity set expected to improve with the return of volatility, we look forward to restoring our unique, long-term value proposition as a long/short credit manager focusing on the global high-grade and high-yield markets," Claren Road told its clients in the note.








Marino, Claren Road’s chief operating officer, didn’t immediately respond to a call seeking comment.Carlyle has struggled with its hedge fund business after buying majority stakes in three firms from 2010 to 2012. The firm purchased a stake in Vermillion Asset Management, which is in the process of winding down. Carlyle sold its majority stake in the $3.5 billion Emerging Sovereign Group back to its management earlier this year.Carlyle, led by founders David Rubenstein, Bill Conway and Dan D’Aniello, managed $169.1 billion in assets as of Sept. 30.“We wish Claren Road much success as an independent firm,” Christopher Ullman, Carlyle’s director of global communications, said in a statement. “Carlyle is focused on growing our global credit business, which we believe has significant potential.”
