Welcome to ANSCHÜTZ North America!For the first time in ANSCHÜTZ’s history, we are pleased to have our very own importation center located within the United States of America.  This is not a partnership with any other existing company, but rather a new extension of the parent company; J.G. ANSCHÜTZ GmbH & Co.KG, in Germany.     We are located in the newly renovated GSI (Gun South Inc.) building in Trussville, Alabama. This excellent facility and prime location within USA will help us efficiently, fairly, and directly supply, help and support our ANSCHÜTZ customer with a wide range of firearms and related products.  We have our own service center to carry out warranty repairs and a custom shop carrying out extensive modifications and upgrades. We will continue to work in conjunction with our other existing Target and Air rifle dealers and service centers within the USA, ultimately increasing our sales and service capabilities.  Along with this website, we have recently launched our Facebook page, and this will be a good place to learn about special offers, limited edition runs, and other upcoming projects. Updates on the Facebook page will be daily, so check back often.Click the icon above or follow this link here: Facebook.

The focus of ANSCHÜTZ North America is the importation, distribution, and service of all ANSCHÜTZ hunting, sporting, and target rifles. We have also recently established ourselves as a direct importer of RWS products.  This product range consists of smallbore ammunition, air rifle and air pistol pellets, and centerfire ammunition.This improvement will streamline the importation of products, offer a wider range of rifles, a larger standing inventory, and soon feature a dedicated service center just for ANSCHÜTZ customers.For standard production items, we do not sell directly to the consumer, but if you are interested in a particular ANSCHÜTZ product or Special Edition, Custom Shop, or Premium Line rifles, please contact us and we can work with one of our current dealers to meet your hunting, competition, and sporting rifle needs.  Many thanks,ANSCHÜTZ North America
