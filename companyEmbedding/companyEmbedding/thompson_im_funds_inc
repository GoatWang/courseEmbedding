Performance data quoted represents
                    past performance: past performance does not guarantee future
                    results. The investment returns and principal value of an
                    investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when
                    redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
                    Current performance of the Fund may be lower or higher than
                    the performance quoted. Performance data current to the most
