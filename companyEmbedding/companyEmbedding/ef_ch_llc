                            Global Team-Building
                        

You'll be working with people from around the world on a daily basis. Every year we hold an international sales kick-off with your team; since 2010, sales offices have rallied in Cape Town, Las Vegas, Barcelona, Puerto Rico, Bangkok and Dubai.



                            A Product to be proud of
                        

Whether you're driving business growth, fostering client relationships or creating memorable brand campaigns, you can feel proud knowing that you're selling a product that gives people confidence and freedom throughout the world.



                            Ownership
                        

At EF we encourage you to own your product and your role. You’ll feel empowered – and supported – to make decisions, test ideas, sample markets and launch new campaigns.


















                                            I love how immediate results are after we implement a new strategy, hire a strong team member, or create team goals. It's such a sales-driven company, when you work in sales you really feel closest to the beating heart of the company.

Attend high school abroad

                Attending high school abroad is a transformational experience.  Many students do not go abroad until university, so you'll be getting an educational head start. Our private international boarding schools offer a full high school education in English for native and non-native English speakers. Graduates continue on to English-speaking universities, including some very prestigious institutions like Harvard and Cambridge. These are full-time, academically challenging programs, with the on-site academic and personal support necessary to make a smooth transition from living at home to attending high school abroad.
            


Study abroad programs for high school students

                There's no better way to become fluent in a language than by studying it in an immersion environment. Enrolling in a high school study abroad program will improve your foreign language skills: a major asset to your future studies and career. You'll also become move independent and come home with an entirely new perspective  on the world. Our high school study abroad opportunities in non-English speaking countries include short-term summer study abroad programs, long-term academic courses, and university preparation programs. Whichever high school study abroad program you choose, you can be certain that you won't soon forget all that you've learned while studying in a foreign country.

SOFTWARE / VIDEO:  Opened Software and Videos
    may be exchanged within 30 days of your product's shipping date, for the same item
    only. No refunds are available for these items, if opened.

Calculating Your Refund
When the item is returned in
its original condition with all original packaging, your credit card will be credited for the price of the
purchase and any taxes, excluding shipping costs and re-stocking fees. If the return is due to a  MyPilotStore error, the return shipping charges will be waived. 
Many times we charge a 
discounted shipping cost for the original shipment.  If you return an item 
and the outbound shipping cost was greater than you paid, the difference will 
be deducted from your return.  For example, if we charged you $4.95 for 
shipping and our actual shipping cost was $8.50 we will deduct $3.55 ($8.50 
minus $4.95) from the value of the return.

If you need clarification on 
this return policy, please
email us at service@MyPilotStore.com.

English Grammar: a complete guide

English grammar guide













Do you have a question about the correct usage of the semicolon or how to place adverbs in a sentence? If so, you've come to the right place. These pages are a complete English grammar guide filled with the rules of English usage. Each grammatical rule is explained in plain English with several examples, and when needed, counter-examples. The grammatical rules covered by this guide are categorized below. English grammar is not always easy to understand, but by using this guide you should be able to remind yourself of the rules of English usage and speak or write English with confidence.


Nouns
Nouns are people, places, or things, They tell us what we are talking about. The words cat, Jack, rock, Africa, & it  are nouns.



Adjectives
Adjectives modify, or describe, nouns. The words  tall, beautiful, irresponsible, & boring  are adjectives.



Adverbs
Adverbs modify adjectives, verbs, or other adverbs. They tell us how, when, and where things happen. They express quantity, intensity, frequency, and opinions.


	 


Determiners
Articles, quantifiers, and other determiners modify nouns. They resemble adjectives in that way. Determiners help us say what we are talking about.



Verbs & Verb Tenses
Verbs are action words. They tell us what is happening and when (past, present, future). Verbs can also express possibilities and conditions.



Speech
When we report what someone says, we can cite the person directly or indirectly. Indirect speech rules are an important area of grammar.


	 


Punctuation
Punctuation is not part of oral grammar, but it is essential to master in written English.



Relative Clauses
We use relative clauses in English to create more complex and more precise sentences.



Grammar Test
Test your English grammar skills in context, both listening and reading skills included.
