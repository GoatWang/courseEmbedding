Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

                Manager Monday: Roystone Capital Management            






 Karan Katyal
Senior Analytics Associate




 
                        Today's Manager Monday takes a look at a Roystone Capital Management, which has had a hard time generating alpha in the current environment.                    





Thus far, our Manager Mondays have tended to focus on popular funds that have no trouble generating alpha. Today, we’ll examine a manager that public data indicates has had a slightly more difficult go of it (albeit over a much shorter time period in a low dispersion environment).
Roystone Capital Management is a value-oriented hedge fund founded in 2013 by Rich Barrera, formerly of Redwood and Glenview. The fund invests both long and short in equities and credit. All the below analysis is purely on their long equity book they’re required to publicly file, so does not encapsulate their entire book. Given the asset class profile of Roystone’s investments, and the fact they did not reach sufficient size to file till Q4 2013, this is an important disclaimer. This analysis does not include their first year, and the multi-asset class long/short nature of their portfolio means actual performance and portfolio composition may differ greatly.
Asset Growth / Transmission
Roystone has grown explosively: AUM (as measured by market value) has roughly doubled from where it was in the first filing in Q4 2013.

As we’ve pointed out a few times in the past, an increase in assets is typically reflected in an equity fund’s portfolio through three metrics: an increase in the number of securities (as the manager tries to find new names to deploy the capital), a rise up the market cap spectrum (as the manager searches for names big enough to be able to accept the additional money), and/or a decrease in liquidity (as the manager decides to double down on the same names).
When we inspect Roystone’s portfolio, we first see that the number of securities they’ve publicly filed on has stayed roughly stable (with some ups and downs).

Meanwhile, 30d liquidity has actually increased.

Given this, one would posit that Roystone has likely pushed the third lever to accommodate asset growth – and sure enough, examination of their portfolio shows that on a weighted average basis, the fund has crept up the market cap spectrum. Later, we will explore whether this shift has been a good thing.

Absolute and Relative Analysis
On an absolute basis, Roystone seems to have done a decent job, generating nearly 1,300bps of contribution. Of the 80 names they’ve filed on since Q4 2013, they’ve made money on 61% of their names (what we here at Novus refer to as a batting average), and have deployed 66% of capital into these winnings. These impressive metrics have been hamstrung slightly by the fact their average winner makes 66.6bps, whereas their average loser detracts 64.1 bps. This unimpressive win/loss ratio of 1.04x suggests that Roystone may have some issues around sizing up their winners and cutting their losers (see this Novus paper that goes into some more depth about the importance of the win/loss ratio).

More worries come up when we look at Roystone’s performance on a relative basis. Comparing each security to the market and to its relevant sector benchmark, we can dissect how much of the fund’s contribution from that security has come from exposure to the market/sector (“beta”), and how much has come from security selection/trading (“alpha”). The results of this analysis across the portfolio can be seen below:

The data suggests that the entirety of the 1,277bps that Roystone has generated on its long equity book has come from beta. Security selection/trading detracted 530bps. While this obviously isn’t great, there is an interesting observation one can make upon examining the biggest alpha generators/detractors.


With the exception of Valeant on the long side, and Media General on the short side, none of these names are particularly popular amongst hedge funds. Indeed, when we examine the Novus Top 50 (the 50 most popular names among hedge funds our research has found), we find just 5% overlap with Roystone’s book. What this means is, for better or for worse, Roystone (unlike numerous other funds) is not collecting 2 and 20 to go to “idea lunches” and schmooze stock picks off the competition.
Sector Analysis
Since their first filing, the fund has been focused on three main sectors: Consumer Discretionary, Healthcare, and Tech. More recently, they have increased exposure slightly to Industrials and Utilities, and have exited the financials space entirely.

As we dig in further, we see that the book has generated alpha primarily in healthcare. Positive performance in other segments has largely been driven by market/sector exposure. Worryingly, significant alpha has been detracted in the core Consumer Discretionary and Tech sectors. In the chart below, the lighter bars are beta, and the darker bars are alpha.

Additionally, despite relatively small allocations, utilities and materials have been the heaviest detractors. With the lack of success in their core sectors, the manager can’t be blamed for exploring other options, but these do not seem to be working out.

Market Cap Analysis
As we previously noted, the avenue that Roystone has appeared to have gone down to incorporate asset growth is a move into larger market capitalization names. Often, this can be a sign that a manager’s style is drifting into an area in which they don’t have expertise. Let’s see if that’s the case here.
As expected, mega and large cap exposure have risen since late 2014, at the expense of mid and small cap exposure.

Fortunately, it appears that this move up the market cap spectrum has been additive to the portfolio: substantively all alpha has been generated by large and mega cap names.


Position Sizing
Position sizing is another way for a manager to generate alpha. Getting one name in ten right is fine if 90% of your money is in that winning name. Splitting Roystone’s book into various position sizing buckets, we can examine the returns they generated across the buckets.

What the chart above is showing is had they deployed 100% of their capital into names in the 0-50bps bucket, Roystone would have annualized at 78%. This points to an underlying issue with conviction: the right securities are being picked, but are not being sized up.
Final Thoughts
In previous Manager Mondays, public data has shown managers to be rock stars. While the data does not show Roystone in equally favorable light, all this analysis needs to be taken with a grain of salt – their shorts, along with their credit positions may have performed very differently to the names we examined. Additionally, the time period in question is probably not statistically significant, especially given the low dispersion environment that has made it difficult for most managers to generate alpha. Finally, there are a few positives to be taken: their relatively unique portfolio, along with a move up the market capitalization spectrum into names where they’ve been able to generate more alpha.


Activist vs. Activist vs. Activist




One of the most polarizing strategies a hedge fund manager can employ is to be an activist investor. Carl Icahn, the largest and most renowned of activists, recently weighed in on the issue stating, “There are bad activists, and we agree that it’s bad. All they want to do is get in and rock the boat and make a quick trade.” But we have found that data speaks favorably of activist managers, or at the very least the returns they are able to generate for their investors.
Without opining on the “good” or “bad,” it’s clear that activists can be very different in the strategies they use to create value for the companies they target and their investors.
This article performs a deep-dive holdings analysis on three prominent activist hedge fund managers.

                Healthcare Sector, Hedge Funds            

                How Hedge Funds Are Making Billions in Healthcare            






 Stan Altshuller

                        Hedge Funds have made billions by investing heavily in healthcare. We use our platform to break down manager investments and biggest wins.                    





Healthcare stocks have been on a tear recently and have nearly doubled (on average) from January 2013 through March 2015, the date range for this analysis. Looking at the performance of the S&P1500 by industry, Healthcare is the highest-performing sector by a wide margin, trouncing IT, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, and the dividend-rich Utilities sectors. Buoyed by the Affordable Care Act, aging baby boomers, as well as increased global demand for medical devices, the sector shows no signs of cooling.

Hedge Funds Increase Exposure
This outperformance has not gone unnoticed by the hedge fund industry. While the index weighting of healthcare grew due to the recent outperformance, hedge funds have moved aggressively into the sector.
Consider this: in 2013 hedge funds were underweight the sector relative to S&P 1500 by almost 2%. But recently, they have moved their dollars to Healthcare, and are currently overweight the sector. Here is their relative weight through time as tracked by the Novus Alpha platform.

What This Means for Hedge Fund Investors
Given the increased importance of the Healthcare sector to hedge funds, the question that every investor should now be asking is whether hedge fund managers actually pick stocks that outperform the broad Healthcare index, or are they simply chasing a different flavor of beta? The answer surprised even us. They are chasing some beta. But they are generating tons of Alpha in the sector as well. Let me briefly explain how we got there. First, we took every hedge fund manager that files with the SEC and constructed a comingled, value-weighted portfolio of all hedge funds. We call that the Hedge Fund Universe (HFU) and it currently tracks over $2T in long market value. Next we ran our own attribution framework called Novus framework on that portfolio. Speaking simply, Novus Framework allows us to decompose returns and understand the portion of returns attributable to market volatility versus picking stocks.
Below you can see the results, so let’s digest them. The sector contributed 1,088bps of cumulative return since Jan 2013 (right most column in the below table). Of that, 623bps were simply a result of market movement and 301 was due to being in the Healthcare sector. But an extra 167bps was generated by hedge funds picking the right stocks within the healthcare sector. This number is the largest of all sectors. So, while there was beta to be had for sure, Hedge funds did their jobs and picked stocks that also generated Alpha. That has made the sector a godsend for hedge funds in the recent years.

Greatest Wins in Healthcare
Over the period analyzed, Hedge Fund managers invested in 900 unique Healthcare stocks, 68% of which were profitable. More importantly, the average contributor made managers 1.92Bps, while the average detractor cost only .22bps – a great risk reward ratio.

The biggest contributors were Valeant, Allergan and Actavis, followed by Gilead and Thermo Fisher.

Digging deeper
If you assume that all hedge funds generate the same amount of alpha in the Healthcare sector – you would of course be mistaken. While on average, hedge funds picked outperforming stocks, many funds detracted value. Looking at just the ones that have managed to outperform, we constructed a list of the top healthcare stock pickers among hedge funds from 2005-2014. These managers have been exceptional at picking the right stocks within Healthcare. See if some of your funds have made the list:
