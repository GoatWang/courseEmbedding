Delicious McCutcheon’s Recipes
Bringing the family together one meal at a time. 


Fig, Mustard, and Champagne Vinaigrette Roast Chicken
This roast chicken is by far one of the more shocking, but surprisingly rewarding, combinations I have ventured to try.only  

Apricot-Mustard Pork Tenderloin
Pork and apricot? Could the combination work. I was assured it did work, and work very well. So, I took the dive and tried Apricot Preserves.only  

Apricot Sauce Grilled Chicken Sandwiches
They are savory, hearty, and a great way to close a busy day without investing a ton of effort. And let me tell you, these are delicious, and easy, and I promise that they will become a family favorite.only  

Fig and Goat Cheese Grilled Sandwiches
My personal favorite of the three is the fig. It is sweet with just a touch of cinnamon. And with the crunch of the seeds it is just irresistible.only  

Eggplant Parmesan
This recipe came from one of those familiar faces that wandered into our shop. only  

Pretzel Mustard Chicken
Healthier than deep fried, tastier than the old classic oven-fried chicken, this recipe is quick, easy, and delicious!only

McCutcheon’s History



 





 

 

William O. McCutcheon
 

 In 1938 at the age of eighty William O. McCutcheon retired from the Colt & Dixon Canning Co. in Frederick, MD. Being an energetic and industrious man he was not ready to give up working.

 

1937
 







 

Robert & Hellen McCutcheon
 

With the help of his son Robert J.McCutcheon and Robert's wife Helen they purchased a used apple press for $25.00
 

 

1938
 







 

Downtown Frederick Press
 

 They set the press up on a property in downtown Frederick, MD and began custom pressing apples for the local farmers. As the years passed they added the service of custom boiling  the local farmers apples into apple butter using the farmer's recipes.
 

 

1938 - 1950
 







 

Modern Machinery & Store

 

 McCutcheon's operation remained much the same until the 1950's when they built more modern buildings to house their operations. In the 1950's McCutcheon's produced Apple Cider and Apple Butter under their own label and began selling their products in their retail store attached to the factory and to other vendors around the area. 

 

1950 - 1960
 







 

Family Production
 

To help with the added work, the children of Robert and Helen McCutcheon were enlisted to perform many tasks in the time they had free from school. In the 1960's Robert J. McCutcheon Jr. and his brother William J. McCutcheon began to increase the number of products that McCutcheon's would produce to include preserves such as strawberry, blueberry and peach. 

 

1960 - 1970

 







 

Modern McCutcheon's 

 McCutcheon's is now in the care of the fourth generation of McCutcheon's, the son's and daughters of Robert and William McCutcheon.

 

 

1971 - Present


 







 

Carroll Creek Flood Control
 

 With the coming of the Carroll Creek Flood control Project McCutcheons sold part of our property to the city of Frederick allowing us to begin consolidating our operations.

 

 

1971 - 1993


 







 

Current McCutcheon's Site
