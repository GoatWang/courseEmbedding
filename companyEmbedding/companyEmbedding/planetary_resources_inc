Asteroids will unlock the Solar System’s economy.
The local resources of space will enable economic growth in the same way new resource frontiers have been explored and developed here on Earth.
















We think asteroids are the greatest gifts from the Solar System.
Energetically closer than our own moon, and dense with resources that we rely on here on Earth, they are perfect for utilization as the catalyst to move humanity forward on Earth and in Space.



Why Asteroids?


The low hanging fruit of the Solar System.

Asteroid Composition
The more we learn about asteroids, the more enticing destinations they become!
Asteroids are primordial material left over from the formation of the Solar System. They are scattered throughout it: some pass close to the Sun, and others are found out beyond the orbit of Neptune. A vast majority have been collected by Jupiter’s gravity into a belt between it and Mars – an area known as the Main Belt. As it turns out, astronomers have been discovering thousands of asteroids that do not belong to the Main Belt, but instead pass near Earth’s orbit – more than 11,000 to date, with over a thousand more discovered every year.
Outside of low Earth orbit, many near Earth asteroids are the most accessible destination in the Universe. Many also contain enormous quantities of accessible resources. We have learned a great deal about asteroids over the past few decades from the 50,000 meteorite samples that have been analyzed in laboratories, the modern investments in telescopic study, and from successful government space missions to 433 Eros, 25143 Itokawa, 4 Vesta, and other asteroids. You can learn more about “How we know so much about asteroids” in this blog post.
Types of Asteroids:
There are three general types of asteroids in our Solar System. Planetary Resources is targeting asteroid types that are rich in water (C-type), or rich in precious metals (X-type) as they offer the most value and will positively affect growth of the space economy. Review our list of interesting astroid targets in the Solar System.

C-type asteroids are very dark in color, and may be the most common. They closely follow the elemental composition of the sun, which leads scientists to conclude that C-type asteroids are very primitive objects, formed at the dawn of the solar system. Planetary Resources will mine water from the C-type asteroids.

Photo Credit: Laurence Garvie, Center for Meteorite Studies, ASUX-type asteroids are composed of primarily metal. They appear to be the remnants of large (> 100 km) asteroids that fully separated into a core and mantle. Some of the these large asteroids were pulverized in massive collisions early in the Solar System’s history leaving only the tough metallic cores they have today. They are known for being extremely dense, unlike any metallic ore bodies we find on Earth today. One of Planetary Resources targets is an X-type asteroid, and may have more platinum than has ever been mined on Earth to date.

Photo credit: Laurence Garvie, Center for Meteorite Studies, ASUS-type asteroids are a mixture of rock and metal mixed together. These rocky asteroids dominate the inner portion of the Main Belt and are often found as near-Earth objects. Scientists believe they are the source of the chondrite meteorites, which are the most commonly found meteorite. These are composed of material that was heated to melting but never separated from the rock as happened with similar ore bodies on Earth.

Asteroid Prospecting
Every mine starts with a geologist exploring on horseback.  Our geologists and horses just happen to be robots.
Asteroid mining activities must be preceded by the development of asteroid prospecting capabilities. The ideal prospector craft is capable of rendezvousing with an asteroid, surveying the surface for weeks at a time, and then landing or impacting to conduct in-situ measurements. NASA and the Japanese Space Agency had demonstrated these capabilities, but required multi-hundred-million-dollar budgets and time frames of a decade to do so. Planetary Resources is standing on their shoulders to perform commercial prospecting at costs that are more than an order of magnitude lower.

Asteroid Analysis with Advanced Sensors
Our primary objective during the prospecting phase is to analyze the asteroids composition and characteristics.
We are doing this with our advanced sensors onboard the Arkyd spacecraft that gather data of our asteroid targets.
This gives us valuable data about the composition that allows us to confirm the targets value beyond the data we have collected from Earth based observation.





Arkyd Betas, The Technology Demonstrators
Software programmers release versions and beta-test. Space hardware doesn’t need to be any different. With the small size, and low cost of our spacecraft hardware, Planetary Resources is using space as our test bed. Starting in low-Earth orbit, we are deploying a series of increasingly more capable spacecraft, allowing for research and development, iteration and testing.
Our first spacecraft in the series of technology demonstrators for prospecting and other exciting technologies are the Arkyd 3 and Arkyd 6.

Arkyd 3, On Orbit Since July 2015
Arkyd 3 (A3) deployed into low-Earth orbit in July of 2015 and successfully completed its mission to test our core prospecting capabilities.
Read more about this exciting milestone here.
Arkyd 3R Deploying from the International Space Station in July 2015


Arkyd 6, Launches in 2017
The Arkyd 6, (A6) built at our headquarters in Redmond, WA, is scheduled to launch to test increased capabilities of our Prospecting and Space-based Observation technologies.

Asteroid Resource Property Rights

Historic steps towards the commercialization of space.
In 2015, President Obama signed a historic piece of legislation into law that recognizes the right of U.S. citizens to own asteroid resources they obtain and encourages the commercial exploration and utilization of resources from asteroids.
The U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (H.R. 2262) is a key milestone in our roadmap to access asteroid resources for commercial use in space.
To learn more about this law, and read the full text of H.R 2262, click here for our full press release: “President Obama Signs Bill Recognizing Asteroid Resource Property Rights into Law”.



 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 














Harvesting Water from Asteroids
Water is the fuel, shelter, and sustenance of space.
Every frontier expansion and gold rush in history relied on a local source of energy and a transportation backbone.  Space will be no different.  Before mining precious metals, Planetary Resources intends to produce fuel in space from carbonaceous chondrites rich in water that can be broken down into highly efficient LOX/H2 rocket fuel.  Rocket Fuel is an attractive early resource for several reasons:

A large market for fuel in space already exists.
Fuel will open the interplanetary equivalent of exploration era trade routes.
Fuel enables other resource mining operations in the future.
Mining in space is different than mining on Earth, and in some cases may be more simple.

The actual method used for extracting and refining rocket fuels from asteroids will depend on the specific composition of the target asteroid and will require an up-close investigation with Planetary Resources’ Arkyd prospectors.  However, the mining equipment required may be more simple than you imagine.  In some cases, much of the equipment we need to mine on Earth (drills, excavators, concentrators) may not be required.  Even surface contact with the asteroid may not be necessary due to the unique environment of space. One possible concept for extracting water from an asteroid may be as follows:

Enclose: Fully enclose a small asteroid or position a cold plate in the vicinity of a large asteroid.
Heat: Concentrate and direct freely-available thermal energy from the sun onto the asteroid.  At temperature, water will volatilize similar to what occurs naturally with approaching comets.  The gaseous water will freeze on contact with the cold plate in a largely pre-concentrated form.
Release: Once the desired quantities are captured, release or depart from the asteroid to deliver the fuel to the point of need, in Earth orbit, or elsewhere in the Solar System.


Many of the engineering systems required for such a process have already been demonstrated in space.  But before they can be deployed to mine asteroids, we must first learn which asteroids are rich in water and how that water is locked within the asteroid.  Without advances in this knowledge, the engineering and deployment of water-harvesting spacecraft would be excessively risky.














Mining and Delivery
We’ve been mining asteroids on Earth for centuries.  Planetary Resources is going to the source.
Some of Earth’s richest ore deposits such as Canada’s Sudbury Basin can trace their origins to ancient asteroid impacts.  By going to the source, Planetary Resources can harvest platinum group metals in much higher concentrations than even the richest Earth mines on Earth. A single platinum-rich 500 meter wide asteroid contains about 174 times the yearly world output of platinum, and 1.5 times the known world-reserves of platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum).  This amount is enough to fill a basketball court to four times the height of the rim.  By contrast, all of the platinum group metals mined to date in history would not reach waist-high on that same basketball court.
While platinum group metals are enriched in asteroids to often hundreds of times that of the richest mines on Earth, they still represent just a small fraction of the total mass of an asteroid.  Extraction processes could be chemically or energy intensive, requiring abundant solar energy, fuel, working fluids, and machinery.  An abundant, cheap, local source of fuel and working fluids are a natural building block towards developing space metal mining capabilities and then delivering those resources back to Earth.

Our technology today, enables the vision of tomorrow.
We innovate on cost and purpose creating valuable processes and technology for today’s marketplace as we continue to pursue our mission to utilize valuable resources extracted from near-Earth asteroids.















Our Mission Demands the Best
Our spacecraft are headed into deep space. It’s a challenging environment: outside Earth’s protective magnetosphere where radiation is prevalent, and communicating back to earth is minutes away. This is where our spacecraft must thrive.
That’s why kilo for kilo, we build the most capable commercial space systems ever designed. To prospect the asteroids, we need miniaturized sensors that communicate effectively over long distances on an autonomous, mobile, and resilient platform.
On the roadmap to developing our prospecting technology, our innovations are available to global markets who can gain value from these technologies today.




























Space-Based Observation
Specialized systems to prospect asteroids, and much more.
Asteroid prospecting requires tools that can determine mineralogy, water composition, macroporosity, and other ore body characteristics. Our sensors operate over a wide spectral range beyond traditional visible wavelength sensors to achieve these goals. Combined with Arkyd, our agile small spacecraft platform, these sensors also serve major applications closer to home: Earth Observation and Space Situational Awareness.

 
Arkyd-6, our latest iteration of spacecraft, includes the first-ever commercial mid wavelength infrared sensor for space-based observations. We’ve built two of these spacecraft with launch dates scheduled in 2017.

Arkyd 6














Attitude Determination & Control Systems

Planning for the future
Traditional spacecraft control systems are designed to meet the pointing requirements for a single vehicle with specific mission goals. This narrow scope produces an architecture that is unique and rigid, driving up development costs and effort for the attitude control system of each new vehicle. Planetary Resources is developing a spacecraft control architecture that is both modular and upgradable, right from the beginning.  This investment supports the rapid deployment and evolution of our spacecraft as internal and external demands change.


Vertically Integrated
With spacecraft control, you are only as good as your hardware. And in some cases, the right sensor or actuator for this critical function may not be available or cost-effective. That’s why we have built a new suite of sensors and actuators right here at Planetary Resources.  These systems can measure a spacecraft rotating at a rate slower than the hour hand of a clock while pointing a beam within the width of a dime one mile away. By controlling the design of both the components and the system, we can balance capabilities and risks where they are appropriately taken rather than depend on historical vendor decisions. And when the time is right to upgrade, we control our own path.


A System-level Solution to Reliability
Controlling spacecraft attitude is inherently a system level function. This has driven us to reimagine how the role of ADCS is distributed within a spacecraft. We have moved away from a traditional, centralized approach in which a single compute element is responsible for the ADCS system and have instead adopted the idea of basic, instinctual behaviors. Instincts are a way of commanding and protecting critical spacecraft components locally, using an integrated and distributed network of low-level hardened compute elements. Similar to a person instinctively removing their hand from a hot surface, the ADCS system has built-in instinctual responses that react to protect the system without relying on the central brain.















Low Cost Avionics & Software
How did it come to be that your cell phone wields significantly more computing power than NASA’s most complicated, most expensive robotic explorers?
Interplanetary space is a challenging environment for spacecraft avionics. Not only can the thermal, vacuum, and radiation environments damage electronics, the sheer distance from Earth drives designers to take conservative approaches to new technology adoption.  Solutions today often rely on redundant architectures using expensive, centralized, heritage components specifically designed for operations in deep space. This philosophy limits the design team’s ability to benefit from the tremendous advancements in the microelectronics industry, leaving them consistently behind the technological curve. The Mars Curiosity rover, for instance, is controlled by a redundant system that uses a CPU originally developed almost two decades ago.
At Planetary Resources, we are breaking away from this model. Instead of an architecture that relies on a single, centralized and expensive set of avionics hardware, we take a tiered and modular approach to spacecraft avionics. In our model, a distributed set of commercially-available, low-level hardened elements each handle local control of a specific spacecraft function. This disaggregation of functional responsibility has a number of advantages:

It is easier to accommodate modern components and COTS hardware because we can replace a single component or sub-system without perturbing the rest of the design.
We can rapidly iterate on spacecraft design because the exact form and configuration of the system can be modified late in a design flow.
We can reduce system inter-dependencies as each component has its own independent compute element that coordinates with other parts of the system.
We can decouple hardware and software through virtualization so that each may advance at their own pace.


Even with this change in architecture, the radiation environment of space is still challenging. Instead of making our system completely “hardened”, we make our systems resilient to the effects of radiation by designing the system to allow normal operations to continue despite random reset events on various elements of the architecture.  A modular de-centralized hardware approach allows for a fault to be contained locally at only the component affected.  The ramifications of such an event do not propagate through power, data, and functional interfaces to the rest of the system.












Space Communications
Interplanetary space can be lonely, especially if there is no one to talk to.

“Talking” is a difficult task for any intrepid robotic explorer on its way to near Earth asteroids (NEA), as the distance back to Earth can exceed 2 Astronomical Units (AUs), or nearly 200 million miles. Traditional spacecraft use radio frequency, or RF, communications to solve this problem. While proven and reliable, RF systems require massive and power-intensive hardware that drive the cost of deep-space probes outside of the constraints of commercial budgets. At the same time, very large, sensitive receivers on Earth are necessary to pick up the incredibly faint signals from the spacecraft. NASA’s Deep Space Network, which includes some of the largest radio telescopes on Earth (as large as 70 meters in diameter), was specifically designed to communicate with interplanetary probes in this way. And it does so everyday, providing critical communications for dozens of US government and international spacecraft around the solar system. Unfortunately, this makes for a pretty busy interplanetary network, one that is difficult to rely on for commercial operations in deep space.
Fortunately, Planetary Resources has found a solution to this problem in the form of optical communications. Due to the shorter wavelength of optical communications when compared to RF, lasers allow for information to be communicated through a more tightly controlled beam using a significantly smaller aperture. This narrower focus greatly reduces the power required for a given communications data rate and distance, allowing a small spacecraft to effectively relay scientific and technical data, even when it is on the other side of the Solar System.
Planetary Resources is developing a multi-function main instrument for its Arkyd spacecraft platform, one that integrates remote imaging, optical navigation, and optical communications into a single, resource-efficient tool. The system will take advantage of many of the advancements made in free space optical communications here on Earth, as well as previous work performed for NASA, with MIT as a partner, on miniaturized stabilization for optical communications on nano-satellites.

















High ΔV Small Satellite Propulsion Systems

Sending a spacecraft into deep space is an energetically expensive proposition.


Conventionally, a spacecraft headed out into the Solar System would be placed directly on its outbound trajectory by its own launch vehicle. This launch vehicle alone can be a $100 Million proposition, or more.  We are taking a different path.  Our Arkyd prospecting spacecraft are small enough to hitch a ride into space with larger, primary payloads.  We launch one at a time into an orbit based on the needs of the rocket’s primary payload. This presents a challenge, as a rendezvous with a solar-orbiting asteroid requires departing Earth at a very specific time, at a specific speed, and in a very specific direction. Otherwise, you could miss your rendezvous by thousands, or even millions, of kilometers.
Planetary Resources solves this problem by being able to make its own way to near Earth asteroids directly from the low Earth orbit where it is placed as a secondary payload. Once in orbit, the Arkyd spacecraft uses its onboard propulsion system and an advantage of the Earth’s gravitational influence called the Oberth effect to escape Earth’s gravity well and head towards a future rendezvous with the NEA of interest.
The Arkyd spacecraft also employs two key technologies to enable this scale of propulsive capability on such a small platform. First, the system uses one of a new family of green, non-toxic monopropellants. This allows the spacecraft, as a secondary payload, to be successfully integrated for launch without significant schedule impact or safety risk to the rocket’s primary satellite customer. Second, this propellant is stored and managed within a propulsion system that is directly integrated into the spacecraft’s primary structure. Working with its strategic investor and partner 3D Systems, Planetary Resources is using additive manufacturing techniques to directly integrate the system’s manifold, plenum, and routing geometries directly into structural elements that support the spacecraft’s elements during the rigors of launch. By doing so, a system that conventionally consists of hundreds of parts and countless workmanship-sensitive assembly operations is now simplified down to just a handful of components, resulting in a system that is at once lighter, cheaper, safer, and much easier to build again and again.

Greetings ARKYD backers! When we announced plans for our crowdfunding campaign, “ARKYD: A Space Telescope for Everyone,” the support from the Kickstarter community was (and still is) amazing! Our goal was lofty, and with your support, we raised a record-setting US$1.5 million in funds to support it. Thank you so much for the constant encouragement. You’ve provided us the support to try out a bold new idea with the potential for huge impact both on and off this planet. So far, we have fulfilled the many T-shirt, sticker, and poster Rewards. We’ve provided scores of memberships to The Planetary Society, codes for the video game Planetary Annihilation, and developed an educational rocket science board game in partnership with Xtronaut Enterprises. In addition to these Kickstarter-funded activities, we’ve also progressed on our company roadmap and built and launched two Arkyd-3 test spacecraft (the first didn’t make it very far off the ground!), and our two follow-on Arkyd-6 test satellites are finished and waiting for their next launch into space this summer.  All this leads to the Arkyd 100 Space Telescope capability. When we closed the campaign in June of 2013, we were confident that the tremendous enthusiasm from around the world would translate into continued financial support outside of the Kickstarter community to move our idea forward… but, what we discovered was unfortunate. Aside from all the progress we made in the underlying technology, the follow-on interest from the business and educational sectors to expand the ARKYD campaign into a fully-supported mission did not exist as we had anticipated. We have explored and exhausted a variety of opportunities big and small for the financial backing necessary to complete the project. Due to the lack of necessary follow-on support, we are saddened to announce that we are unable to fulfill the “ARKYD: A Space Telescope for Everyone” campaign.  While we regret we must wind-down the project, we are pleased that we can offer each of our 17,614 backers an immediate and FULL REFUND, with our sincere thanks for your longstanding support. We've never been stronger in pursuing our goal of prospecting and mining asteroids, and you can read a recent update about our progress here.So what happens now? You may request your refund according to the following refund policy and notification of refund: Each ARKYD Kickstarter backer will receive an e-mail with a personalized refund link (do not share this link with anyone).  Refund request submissions must be made to the company by following this personalized refund link. We have used the email you have currently have on file with Kickstarter, so if this is not correct, please reach out to us HERE. Once you receive your personalized refund email, follow the instructions to complete the refund form.  The form must be completed accurately and in its entirety.  The refund form will provide you with options to claim your refund either by check or through PayPal.  Refunds may take up to thirty (30) days to process.  We reserve the right to verify information contained on the refund request form.  Requests that include illegible, missing, or erroneous information may be returned to you for correction, which may cause delay in the issuance of your refund.  We reiterate that you will receive a FULL REFUND, and will not be charged for any transaction fees or pledge rewards you may have already received.  We have you covered. You will have 45 days from Thursday May 26, 2016 to accurately and fully complete and submit to us your refund request form.  We will not honor refund requests following the the deadline of Monday, 11 July 2016.  Alternatively, you may mail your request form to us in hardcopy format to the following address: ATTN: ARKYD Kickstarter Refund, 6742 185TH AVE NE, Redmond, WA 98052.  We are not responsible for lost or undeliverable mail.  If you do not respond to this notification, as a courtesy we will make a reasonable effort to notify you of the refund offer.  Ultimately, requesting a refund is your responsibility and we will make no further attempts to contact you following the deadline. It is with heavy heart that we share this news.  The Kickstarter community is stellar and we continue to be inspired by your passion as we make our way into the Cosmos.  One of the things we enjoy most in building technology to explore space is sharing that journey with others.  You can rest assured we will continue to take you on our journey as we make our way to the asteroids and beyond. Sincerely, Chris Lewicki Your biggest fan & Chief Asteroid Miner, Planetary Resources, Inc.

Totally agree. This was my first Kickstarter contribution, and will be my last.

Hola Planetary Resources!
I totally missed the refund period... Worry not though, I'm not asking for my money back, I only ask that the funds I provided be put to good use on some other noble project or worthy endeavor (like getting a mid afternoon Starbucks on a cold day)! Best wishes and success on all your future endeavors!

Hi All,
If you submitted a payment more than 10 business days ago on PayPal (this ONLY pertains to PayPal, not checks), and have not yet received your payment, it is likely due to one or more of the following issues with your PayPal account:
-Did you provide the proper PayPal email/mobile number for your account? If not, please send us the correct email/mobile number for your PayPal account.
-Does your account have limited access? If so, you will need to contact PayPal to lift these limitations.
-Did you claim your payment within the 30 days that PayPal allows you to claim your payment, before it is returned to Planetary Resources? If you missed the timeframe to claim your payment, please email me and I will resubmit your payment: kickstarter@planetaryresources.com
-Do you have a PayPal account? If not, please create one and send us your PayPal ID so I can resubmit your payment. kickstarter@planetaryresources.com
-Does your country accept PayPal? Check this list, if your country is not on it, we can work with you to get your payment in another way: https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr…
-Is the email you provided for PayPal payment, added to your PayPal account? If not, add your email to your PayPal account, and the payment should then go through.
-Is there any other reason your payment could have been denied or cancelled?
If you think you might be experiencing one of these issues, please first contact PayPal customer service to resolve.
Then, email us so we can resubmit your payment if needed: kickstarter@planetaryresources.com.
As long as you submit your request by July 11th, 2016, we will ensure you get your FULL refund.
Thanks!

@Scott can you email me your information so I can look up your account and see what is happening with your payment? Thanks so much! kickstarter@planetaryresources.com -Caitlin











Kelly Havlik

on July 5, 2016


Good insight, Scott, and yes, I see that their project is still progressing in a different fashion.  1.5MM makes a nice, interest accruing "loan" for them and their only repayment of this loan is based on the original note.  They pocket the interest they've earned for the past three (?) years!  The interest alone from their investment is staggering.  What a nice deal for them.  Kickstarter should prosecute folks like this (or we should).  What they should be refunding to us is our initial outlay plus any interest they earned during the three years (?) that they had our money!
I have invested in several kickstarter projects, most of which had significant delays from what was promised and some of the products were a bit iffy but, in all other cases, I've ALWAYS received the end product.  I had planned to use this "selfie in space" from ARKYD with my daughter as a Christmas card but now she's in college.  Ridiculous and fraudulent!  Should be prosecuted.











Scott Medwid

on July 4, 2016


I sent the refund form in a month ago (via the link) but I have not gotten a check yet or any communication from the company.  
Note: the day you folks announce the refund to your KickStarter backers you announce a big private equity funder is on board with you.  So many of us "believers" learned a lesson.  My question is this; What future idea from an earnest start up is NOT going to get Kickstarted because of this bait and rebate low cost loan scheme of yours?











Darrell Thompson

on June 22, 2016


Apply the money to R&D, we need that more than I need a refund.











marc

on June 22, 2016


Thanks Caitlin, different Browser did the trick. My no sleep till orbit T-shirt is still one of my favorites and I'd happily re-pledge if ARKYD ever tries again. You've been very generous with your refund policy, and your idea was a worthy one.











Jozape

on June 22, 2016


This sure is taking a long time. Should I just try to send a refund request again? I'm not sure how the system on your end works or if it's even functioning properly, so I don't want to get two refunds from you by accident.











Jozape

Thanks!

Its a shame investors have been so short sighted. 
I tried the refund link but Firefox flagged it as an insecure link, so was the help link.
Has anyone else met this probllem?











Michael Psarouthakis

on June 15, 2016


Sorry to hear this news and kudos to you for offering refunds! What I would suggest is that the company explore equity crowdfunding, which just went legal on May 16th, or explore accredited investor crowdfunding like Angel List. I would really like to put my refunded pledge back to work with your company!  Good luck and keep pushing forward!











Lewis Ross-Jones

on June 15, 2016


Well, that's a shame. The first project I ever backed on Kickstarter and it's a damp squib.
I'm not sure I fully understand; you're still planning to develop the Arkyd 100, so why back out of this project?











Jozape

on June 14, 2016


I have to say that this is a very classy act by Planetary Resources. Too bad nobody was as interested as we the backers in funding this! I was so interested that I pledged more money in this KickStarter than any other before and after.
I am not certain that my refund successfully submitted, though. I just filled out the link sent to my e-mail, and after clicking submit, I got a mostly blank page with only a Planetary Resources logo at the top. Is there supposed be a confirmation that my refund was successfully submitted?

Dear PlanetaryResources team, thanks for the offer of a refund! Sad to hear that it did not work out as expected, as a space selfie would be really something...
Is there a way for you to keep my pledge funds for a particular purpose in your company?
Regards and all the best - David











David Sheldon

I pledged the $25 three years ago because 1) that's an amazing deal on a space-selfie, and 2) I believe in what you are trying to accomplish. It saddens me to hear that you weren't able to get the follow-on support that you needed, yet I can understand why investors would be wary. As for me, I won't miss the $25 and won't be requesting a refund, I would rather that this project continues down to the very last penny. Best of luck to you all :)

To follow up on Ken Burwood's thoughts, my pledge was small enough for my budget and my interested in your core business keen enough, that I'm okay with letting you keep my contribution. Is there anyway to indicate that? I assume otherwise you'll have to follow up with anyone who does not request a refund.











Ken Burwood

on June 3, 2016


Sad to hear, it was a great idea. I'm surprised that there wasn't more interest from at least the educational field--the educational potential of the ARKYD project was the entire reason that I backed it, I didn't care about the selfie myself.
I'm still contemplating whether I'll ask for a refund. I don't normally ask for refunds, since the couple projects that have failed have been small teams who tried, so I didn't mind letting it go even if they did offer some refunds.  However, since you're a full-blown business and you've got the funding that you need for your main business, then I might consider it in this case--or more likely, ask if you can simply donate my refund to The Planetary Society.  But, on the same hand, I like the idea of your core business too, so I wouldn't be averse to letting you keep the funding either.
To all of those who are complaining about it being an "interest free loan" and about the 21M  in funding, you are completely incorrect in your assumptions.
You've forgotten that the ARKYD project was a specific SIDE-project for Planetary Resources, that was for educational purposes, and it would in fact require continued support even after the physical satellite itself was completed and launched.  The ARKYD project was going to piggy-back on the R&D from their main business and use one of the resulting satellites, along with all of the necessary resources for managing the satellite and it's educational program after launch (managing usage time for schools, maintenance, personnel, etc).
The ARKYD funding was NOT for the creation of Planetary Resources as a business, nor was it for the research and development of their satellite technology. The satelites were already going to be built for use in their asteroid mining business, completely independently of this project.  Planetary Resources was extremely clear about this when the project was originally underway.
It was that R&D, along with our initial funding, plus the future funding that they had hoped to get from the educational and business sectors that were going to enable them to also do the ARKYD as a sibling project.  The ARKYD project is what has failed to survive, due to lack of needed interest from the business and educational communities.
The 21M in funding that Planetary Resources has received is NOT for the ARKYD project, it's for their main business--two separate things.
This was NOT an interest-free loan for them, since this money was never for the purpose of building their business--it was ONLY for the ARKYD project, and that has sadly failed.  They've in fact eaten a huge chunk of money by giving us full refunds, since they had to pay Kickstarter fees, credit card fees and taxes on all of that money when they collected it.  So yes, their offer of a full refund is in fact very thoughtful, and honest of them, and its much appreciated.

Hi All, a few backers with @gmail.com emails have noted the refund email is going to their "promotions" tab. Just a heads up in case you don't see the email with the unique link to your refund, that it might be in this tab. Thanks! Caitlin











drow

on June 1, 2016


kickstarter has got to be one of the worst ways to secure a loan.  that it has effectively worked out something like that HAS NO BEARING on the motives and intentions of planetary resources.  their original plan didn't pan out, they've had to pivot to survive, and are giving back what they can no longer use the way they hoped to use it.  and since its a full refund, they're apparently eating the spent costs of the secondary rewards they've already sent.  very sad, but far short of duplicitous or underhanded.  my 2cp.

Thanks!

I appreciate that they're honoring the rules and refunding after not being able to deliver.  It's nevertheless disappointing that they won't be delivering.  I am curious about this "extra spectral" business and how it could be new given that Landsat data sets have been "multispectral" since the 1970s.
Hopefully they have an answer for long term calibration and correction of data.  And maybe they will even keep some data open to the public.  USGS/EROS provides some really nice pictures of the Earth.

You've made two young girls very sad today. My goddaughter and her sister were excited to have their pictures in space and be a part of a new space age where everyone could be involved. Thanks for destroying that today.











Cervator

on May 28, 2016


While I am disappointed I can understand what happened, although you could have announced it better rather than with the odd disconnect from the other big news about your CERES project and related investment.
Why not just state it as it (likely) is - the lack of interest prevented you from moving on, but rather than fold entirely you managed the good old "pivot" to salvage / save the company by moving to CERES, and attracted an investment with a negotiated piece somewhere allowing you to offer the refunds? 
If you came right out and said it that way I think more people would understand and be less upset, rather than believe you used the community as a spring board to attract investment money for something else.
As-is this does set a really poor precedent. I wish you the best of luck in getting back to the original mission one day.











Don Reba

on May 28, 2016


For several commenters calling the Kickstarter money an interest-free loan, consider that in offering full refunds, they are eating significant fees from Amazon and Kickstarter, as well as taxes.











Stephen Dahlke

on May 28, 2016


While the refund is appreciated in the least-you-could-do sense, I'm really not convinced that this project has suddenly become unfeasible, considering the $21.5 million bucks you just told me you were given.
Using backers as an interest-free, no-risk loan (even if you have opted to repay it rather than default on it) is an abuse not only of Kickstarter, but also individual trust.
I genuinely believed in what this project set out to do. I was excited. Now, I'm left with nothing but disappointment and regret.
Refunding the money doesn't undo the broken promises of the campaign, nor the general distrust this will instill an any such future projects by yourself or other entities. The next time someone comes along to crowdfund a space mission, they'll be up against the stigma that you've brought to the whole concept.
That's the biggest disappointment; not that you backed out on me and all the rest of the backers, but that you've disgraced the whole idea of spacebound citizen-science.
I had honestly expected better of this campaign and the people behind it.











GEOFFERY R DUGDELL

You guys are not making it easy.  All I'm getting our error messages .  Rip off rip-off rip-off.  I say if anyone knows how to then let's get a class action together to sue these guys out of space and time!  I'm tired of all the excuses.  This is my first and last experience on Kickstarter as  I am so poor I'm just about homeless.  Tired of being ripped off by rich people.  No more!

Planetary Resources, Inc., formerly known as Arkyd Astronautics, is an American company that was formed on 1 January 2009,[3][1] and reorganized and renamed in 2012. Its stated goal is to "expand Earth's natural resource base"[4] by developing and deploying the technologies for asteroid mining.
Although the long-term goal of the company is to mine asteroids, its initial plans call for developing a market for small (30–50 kg) cost-reduced space telescopes for Earth observation and astronomy. These spacecraft would employ a laser-optical system for ground communications,[5] reducing payload bulk and mass compared to conventional RF antennas.[not verified in body] The deployment of such orbital telescopes is envisioned as the first step forward in the company's asteroid mining ambitions. The same telescope satellite capabilities that Planetary Resources hopes to sell to customers can be used to survey and intensively examine near-Earth asteroids.
A test satellite named Arkyd 3 Reflight (A3R) was launched and successfully transported to Earth orbit on 17 April 2015 and was deployed from the International Space Station via the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer on July 16, 2015.[6][7] The "Reflight" descriptor was used because Planetary's first satellite, Arkyd 3, was destroyed on October 28, 2014 after an Antares resupply rocket exploded seconds after launch.[8]

History[edit]
Planetary Resources, Inc was founded as Arkyd Astronautics on 1 January 2009,[3] with Peter Diamandis as co-chairman and director, and Chris Lewicki as president and chief engineer.[1] According to co-founder Eric Andersen, the name "Arkyd Astronautics" was deliberately ambiguous, to help keep the company's asteroid-mining agenda secret.[9]
The company gained media attention in April 2012 with the announcement of a press conference, scheduled for April 24, 2012.[10] The initial press release provided limited information; as of April 20, 2012, only a list of major investors and advisors was known.[11] Included in the list were a number of people notable for their entrepreneurship and interest in space, exploration, and research. Some also had previous involvement in space research. It was speculated that Planetary Resources was "looking for ways to extract raw materials from non-Earth sources," as the means by which it would (as stated in the press release) "add trillions of dollars to the global GDP."[11] From the outset, the dominant assumption was that the company intended to develop asteroid mining operations,[4][11][12][13] with one anonymous source reportedly verifying that claim in advance of the April 24 event.[14] Arkyd Astronautics became a wholly owned subsidiary of Planetary Resources.[9]
In July 2012, Planetary Resources announced an agreement with Virgin Galactic to enable multiple launch opportunities for its series of spacecraft on LauncherOne starting with the Arkyd-100 series of space telescopes.[15][16][17]
By January 2013, Planetary Resources had completed a ground test prototype of the Arkyd-100 and released a limited set of details publicly.[18]
In April 2013, Planetary Resources announced that Bechtel Corporation has joined Planetary Resources group of investors and will be a collaborative partner in helping Planetary Resources achieve its long-term mission of mining asteroids.[19]
In April 2013, the company announced that they planned on launching a CubeSat called "Arkyd-3" (A3) in early 2014, as a testbed manifestation for the Arkyd-100 spacecraft. The purpose of the flight is to test technologies for the first Arkyd-100 spacecraft.[20] In the event, the first A3 was launched in fall 2014 but was destroyed in a launch accident; a second A3 spacecraft—designated A3R—was launched in April 2015 and deployed into orbit in July 2015.[21]
In May 2013, Planetary Resources announced the launch of Kickstarter funding for the ARKYD-100. Their goal was surpassed on 19 June 2013.[22]
In June 2013, Planetary Resources took an undisclosed investment from 3D Systems and intends to make use of its 3D printing technology to manufacture components of the Arkyd spacecraft that Planetary Resources intends to use for finding near-Earth asteroids.[22][23] By mid-2016, the company had grown to 60 employees, but still has no firm date for the launch of its first Arkyd satellite.[2]
In May 2016, the company announced it had secured US$21.1 million in Series A funding, which it said would be used to deploy and operate a constellation of Earth observation satellites, to be known as Ceres, using ten of their Arkyd-100 satellites.[24] These can be used both for surveying asteroids and for Earth observation, and feature an arc-second resolution camera.[25]
In November 2016, Luxembourg invested €25 million in the company in the form of capital and research and development grants. The company announced the investment would be used for the launch of its first asteroid prospecting mission by 2020.[26] Luxembourg had recently adopted draft legislation giving private operators rights to materials mined in space.[27]
Plans[edit]
Planetary Resources aims to develop a robotic asteroid mining industry.[28][29] To achieve this, the company is operating on the basis of a long-term strategic plan.

The first stage will be a survey and analysis, using purpose-built satellites in Earth orbit, to locate the best potential targets among near-Earth asteroids. Several small space telescopes, with various sensing capabilities, are to be launched for this purpose.[28] The company website asserts that their space telescopes will be made available for hire, for private uses. The company also intends to produce satellites for sale. Their first model of space telescope, the Arkyd-100, has been introduced.[31]
Later stages of the strategic plan envision sending survey probes to selected asteroids in order to map, including deep-scanning, and to conduct sample-and-analysis and/or sample-and-return missions. The company has stated that it could take a decade to finish identifying the best candidates for commercial mining.[10]
Ultimately, their intent is to establish fully automated/robotic asteroid-based mining and processing operations, and the capability to transport the resulting products wherever desired. In addition to the extraction of industrial and precious metals for space-based and terrestrial use, the project envisions producing water for an orbital propellant depot.[32][33][34]
Funding for the initial space telescope was not forthcoming. The accompanying Kickstarter campaign was terminated and refunds promised in May 2016.[35]
Arkyd-3 Flight test system[edit]
Planetary Resources packaged a number of the non-optical satellite technologies of the Arkyd-100 —essentially the entire base of the Arkyd-100 satellite model revealed in January 2013,[18] but without the space telescope— into a cost-effective format for early in-space flight testing on a nanosatellite named the Arkyd 3, or A3. The Arkyd-3 testbed satellite was packaged in a 3U CubeSat form-factor of 10×10×30 centimetres (0.33×0.33×0.98 ft). The first attempt to validate and mature the technology[36][37][38][39] met a setback on 28 October 2014, when the first Arkyd-3 test satellite was destroyed during launch in the explosion of the Antares rocket carrying it to the International Space Station (ISS).[40]
A second attempt to launch an Arkyd-3 spacecraft—designated A3R, or Arkyd-3 Reflight— took place on April 14, 2015 with a flight of SpaceX CRS-6 to the ISS from where it was planned to be deployed later.[41] In the event, after spending several months attached to the ISS, A3R was deployed on orbit on 16 July 2015 to begin flight testing. The test flight is expected to have an approximately 90-day duration.[21][42] As of January 2016[update], the company has been completely silent on the progress of any on-orbit testing post deployment from the ISS.[43]
The satellite subsystems being tested on A3R include the avionics, attitude determination and control system (both sensors and actuators), and integrated propulsion system that will enable proximity operations for the Arkyd line of prospectors in the future.[44][45] A3R reentered the atmosphere on 23 December 2015.[43]
Arkyd-6 Flight test system[edit]
A second flight test unit for Planetary Resources—twice the size of A3R with a 6U form factor—is the Arkyd-6 (A6). It is slated to test attitude control, power, and communication systems as well as a photo-display-and-retransmission system. As of July 2015, A6 was planned to launch in late 2015 along with a number of other cubesats.[21][46] This date slipped to an April 2016 launch.[47][needs update] In their May 2016 announcement about securing additional funding, the company described its plans as comprising "an upcoming scheduled launch of the company’s Arkyd 6 spacecraft onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket".[24] As of June 2017 this has yet to appear in the List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches.

Planetary Resources packaged a number of the non-optical satellite technologies of the Arkyd-100 —essentially the entire base of the Arkyd-100 satellite model revealed in January 2013,[18] but without the space telescope— into a cost-effective format for early in-space flight testing on a nanosatellite named the Arkyd 3, or A3. The Arkyd-3 testbed satellite was packaged in a 3U CubeSat form-factor of 10×10×30 centimetres (0.33×0.33×0.98 ft). The first attempt to validate and mature the technology[36][37][38][39] met a setback on 28 October 2014, when the first Arkyd-3 test satellite was destroyed during launch in the explosion of the Antares rocket carrying it to the International Space Station (ISS).[40]
A second attempt to launch an Arkyd-3 spacecraft—designated A3R, or Arkyd-3 Reflight— took place on April 14, 2015 with a flight of SpaceX CRS-6 to the ISS from where it was planned to be deployed later.[41] In the event, after spending several months attached to the ISS, A3R was deployed on orbit on 16 July 2015 to begin flight testing. The test flight is expected to have an approximately 90-day duration.[21][42] As of January 2016[update], the company has been completely silent on the progress of any on-orbit testing post deployment from the ISS.[43]
The satellite subsystems being tested on A3R include the avionics, attitude determination and control system (both sensors and actuators), and integrated propulsion system that will enable proximity operations for the Arkyd line of prospectors in the future.[44][45] A3R reentered the atmosphere on 23 December 2015.[43]
Arkyd-6 Flight test system[edit]
A second flight test unit for Planetary Resources—twice the size of A3R with a 6U form factor—is the Arkyd-6 (A6). It is slated to test attitude control, power, and communication systems as well as a photo-display-and-retransmission system. As of July 2015, A6 was planned to launch in late 2015 along with a number of other cubesats.[21][46] This date slipped to an April 2016 launch.[47][needs update] In their May 2016 announcement about securing additional funding, the company described its plans as comprising "an upcoming scheduled launch of the company’s Arkyd 6 spacecraft onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket".[24] As of June 2017 this has yet to appear in the List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches.

Planetary Resources, Inc., formerly known as Arkyd Astronautics, is an American company that was formed on 1 January 2009,[3][1] and reorganized and renamed in 2012. Its stated goal is to "expand Earth's natural resource base"[4] by developing and deploying the technologies for asteroid mining.
Although the long-term goal of the company is to mine asteroids, its initial plans call for developing a market for small (30–50 kg) cost-reduced space telescopes for Earth observation and astronomy. These spacecraft would employ a laser-optical system for ground communications,[5] reducing payload bulk and mass compared to conventional RF antennas.[not verified in body] The deployment of such orbital telescopes is envisioned as the first step forward in the company's asteroid mining ambitions. The same telescope satellite capabilities that Planetary Resources hopes to sell to customers can be used to survey and intensively examine near-Earth asteroids.
A test satellite named Arkyd 3 Reflight (A3R) was launched and successfully transported to Earth orbit on 17 April 2015 and was deployed from the International Space Station via the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer on July 16, 2015.[6][7] The "Reflight" descriptor was used because Planetary's first satellite, Arkyd 3, was destroyed on October 28, 2014 after an Antares resupply rocket exploded seconds after launch.[8]

History[edit]
Planetary Resources, Inc was founded as Arkyd Astronautics on 1 January 2009,[3] with Peter Diamandis as co-chairman and director, and Chris Lewicki as president and chief engineer.[1] According to co-founder Eric Andersen, the name "Arkyd Astronautics" was deliberately ambiguous, to help keep the company's asteroid-mining agenda secret.[9]
The company gained media attention in April 2012 with the announcement of a press conference, scheduled for April 24, 2012.[10] The initial press release provided limited information; as of April 20, 2012, only a list of major investors and advisors was known.[11] Included in the list were a number of people notable for their entrepreneurship and interest in space, exploration, and research. Some also had previous involvement in space research. It was speculated that Planetary Resources was "looking for ways to extract raw materials from non-Earth sources," as the means by which it would (as stated in the press release) "add trillions of dollars to the global GDP."[11] From the outset, the dominant assumption was that the company intended to develop asteroid mining operations,[4][11][12][13] with one anonymous source reportedly verifying that claim in advance of the April 24 event.[14] Arkyd Astronautics became a wholly owned subsidiary of Planetary Resources.[9]
In July 2012, Planetary Resources announced an agreement with Virgin Galactic to enable multiple launch opportunities for its series of spacecraft on LauncherOne starting with the Arkyd-100 series of space telescopes.[15][16][17]
By January 2013, Planetary Resources had completed a ground test prototype of the Arkyd-100 and released a limited set of details publicly.[18]
In April 2013, Planetary Resources announced that Bechtel Corporation has joined Planetary Resources group of investors and will be a collaborative partner in helping Planetary Resources achieve its long-term mission of mining asteroids.[19]
In April 2013, the company announced that they planned on launching a CubeSat called "Arkyd-3" (A3) in early 2014, as a testbed manifestation for the Arkyd-100 spacecraft. The purpose of the flight is to test technologies for the first Arkyd-100 spacecraft.[20] In the event, the first A3 was launched in fall 2014 but was destroyed in a launch accident; a second A3 spacecraft—designated A3R—was launched in April 2015 and deployed into orbit in July 2015.[21]
In May 2013, Planetary Resources announced the launch of Kickstarter funding for the ARKYD-100. Their goal was surpassed on 19 June 2013.[22]
In June 2013, Planetary Resources took an undisclosed investment from 3D Systems and intends to make use of its 3D printing technology to manufacture components of the Arkyd spacecraft that Planetary Resources intends to use for finding near-Earth asteroids.[22][23] By mid-2016, the company had grown to 60 employees, but still has no firm date for the launch of its first Arkyd satellite.[2]
In May 2016, the company announced it had secured US$21.1 million in Series A funding, which it said would be used to deploy and operate a constellation of Earth observation satellites, to be known as Ceres, using ten of their Arkyd-100 satellites.[24] These can be used both for surveying asteroids and for Earth observation, and feature an arc-second resolution camera.[25]
In November 2016, Luxembourg invested €25 million in the company in the form of capital and research and development grants. The company announced the investment would be used for the launch of its first asteroid prospecting mission by 2020.[26] Luxembourg had recently adopted draft legislation giving private operators rights to materials mined in space.[27]
Plans[edit]
Planetary Resources aims to develop a robotic asteroid mining industry.[28][29] To achieve this, the company is operating on the basis of a long-term strategic plan.

The first stage will be a survey and analysis, using purpose-built satellites in Earth orbit, to locate the best potential targets among near-Earth asteroids. Several small space telescopes, with various sensing capabilities, are to be launched for this purpose.[28] The company website asserts that their space telescopes will be made available for hire, for private uses. The company also intends to produce satellites for sale. Their first model of space telescope, the Arkyd-100, has been introduced.[31]
Later stages of the strategic plan envision sending survey probes to selected asteroids in order to map, including deep-scanning, and to conduct sample-and-analysis and/or sample-and-return missions. The company has stated that it could take a decade to finish identifying the best candidates for commercial mining.[10]
Ultimately, their intent is to establish fully automated/robotic asteroid-based mining and processing operations, and the capability to transport the resulting products wherever desired. In addition to the extraction of industrial and precious metals for space-based and terrestrial use, the project envisions producing water for an orbital propellant depot.[32][33][34]
Funding for the initial space telescope was not forthcoming. The accompanying Kickstarter campaign was terminated and refunds promised in May 2016.[35]
Arkyd-3 Flight test system[edit]
Planetary Resources packaged a number of the non-optical satellite technologies of the Arkyd-100 —essentially the entire base of the Arkyd-100 satellite model revealed in January 2013,[18] but without the space telescope— into a cost-effective format for early in-space flight testing on a nanosatellite named the Arkyd 3, or A3.

The Planetary Resources Announcement for Asteroid Mining

In response to the Planetary Resources, Inc., announcement of their plans to mine near Earth asteroids, PERMANENT's analysis and position is as follows.

Their public announcement should start a new space race.

Make no mistake about it, the Russians and Chinese and other nationalistic political leaders and world space program personnel will be analyzing and talking seriously about this.  Government related people tend to err on the side of caution, which usually means developing their own plans.  After all, it is paranoia and uncertainty about competing powers which drives a lot of military spending, "just in case", by those responsible for their own country's position, who don't want to risk all that entails with being negligent.  Space resources is a potentially very powerful new development, and they've now been given notice.

On the private sector side, the credibility of the investors, businessmen, and technical personnel will further take away "the giggle factor" while adding credibility to asteroid mining, which will draw the attention of a lot of wealthy and powerful private sector people in this world.  It will capture the imagination of many other billionaires, and countless millionaires.  After all, for a fraction of the cost of an island off Dubai, or some other real estate or industrial or mass media project on Earth, they can invest in space real estate and get to the real elite leadership forefront of society.

The Planetary Resources people were asked why they announced today.  After all, they have kept this a secret since 2009.  Why now?

Their stated answer was recruiting the best engineers in the world.  They said the timing was also because they had completed their fundraising stage.

Yet, they said that they want to keep a small and dynamic team, so there are not nearly enough positions for all the people who will apply.  They have approximately 24 engineers today, and seemed to not want to grow a lot more, in order to control costs as well as company culture, focusing on the most knowledgeable and productive individuals.

Furthermore, they could systematically recruit people who have already worked on space probes by simply researching who's who in those previous projects, and veteran space people would find you about them and visit their website without such a high profile announcement, so a buckshot high profile public announcement for recruiting seem a little bit puzzling.

They have expressed interest in reaching out to people outside of the space community, such as people in the Earth mining business.

However, there should be other motivations for all the professional public relations videos which they have so carefully prepared, which goes way beyond recruitment.  You don't need much to recruit space specialists to come to Seattle, and there are already a lot of professionals in the Earth mining and other industries who are interested in space resources, more than can be handled.

A bigger motivation would be creating a market for their products and services, and reaching out to that market, a new space economy.  It is notable that they repeatedly highlighted that they are creating a new market worth billions to trillions of dollars.

There needs to be some advance notice in order to generate this market in advance of their products and services.  A market of this nature will take some time to take root, both psychologically and in the development of plans.

One of the press asked whether they will be selling their data.  Well, that's a small start for some early cash flow.  Other markets they mentioned are platinum group metals for Earth, fuel propellants, and water and supplies to space stations.  (There are actually countless potential products and services, but these are the simplest and most basic needs in high demand and value now.)

They said that they completed their fund-raising, which was probably very targeted since they kept this a secret.  They apparently are not looking for anybody else to buy private stock in this particular company, Planetary Resources, Inc.

They may also be trying to brand as a first high profile venture.

There appeared to be considerable pride and excitement motivating this announcement.

For whatever reasons, they have surely stirred up potential competition and fired the gun to start the space race.

During the announcement, they made clear that this is all robotic, not human.  When somebody asked whether there were any planned human missions, nobody mentioned that bringing back all this water, metal, and various other volatiles and materials would be crucial to building space condos and other real estate in near Earth space on a large scale economically.  Send the robots to asteroids, keep the humans close to Earth.  I thought they missed an exciting announcement there ... unless they had decided to keep that a secret, e.g., the real estate angle.

As they've kept this company a secret for 3 years, it does raise the question of how many others have kept things secret likewise.  This announcement would remove a lot of the need for others to keep asteroid ventures secret, since others won't be a first anymore, and Planetary Resources has jumped the gun to start a new space race.  There will be pressure for other space professionals and powers to respond by showing that they aren't clueless and are doing their jobs in a competitive way.

There was an expression of American nationalism during the news conference.  That can have a variety of reactions around the world ... which overall is good!  This should spur on investment in competitors.

Peter Diamandis has done a great job piecing this one together.  After roughly 20+ years of perseverance and experience (I think I first met him about 25 years ago as a young space resources promoter), Peter has finally put together a sufficiently funded space resources team.  There are few people in this world who have impressed me as much as Peter Diamandis, and he deserves to go down in history as the prime mover in Planetary Resources and firing the gun to start the space race on extraterrestrial real estate.  Our species owes a lot to this individual, Peter Diamandis.

Some people will ask why they chose asteroids instead of the lunar poles, a popular debate.  It is very fortunate that they have chosen asteroids because the lunar poles are already getting a whole lot of attention.  Also, it would have been less interesting to the world if they were going back to the Moon.  We should diversify in space resources between the asteroids and the Moon.

So, what about PERMANENT?

Obviously, this will stir up a whole lot of interest in PERMANENT.  However, what is PERMANENT's position and plans?

As Director, I am more interested in further developing that space race!  Likewise, to respond to messages to date from various people, I am NOT interested in applying for a job at Planetary Resources.  I'm not concerned with my own personal benefits, I am most concerned about making sure that space resources are developed, and don't want us to rely 100% on Planetary Resources.  Indeed, we need a space race and some healthy competition to speed up space resources utilization, if humans are to get off the planet before biotechnology or nanotechnology human extinction threats mature (another section on this website), as covered in my other website www.GAINextinction.com .

Personally, I am most interested in contributing to progress by doing what nobody else is doing and which needs to be done.  Right now, that means consulting to one or more competitors.

PERMANENT is more than 25 years old.  A whole lot of knowledge has been gained in those 25+ years, which can be applied to helping startups around the world.

This is why I chose to work in the US space program soon after graduating from the university, in advanced planning in Washington, D.C.  This is why I learned the Russian language.  This is why I sought experience living and working in Asia starting in 1994.  This is why I have been reading technical reports and building up a library on space resources for 30 years, something you cannot condense into a short time.  This is why I have been getting to know who is who for 30 years.  This is why I chose to run my own businesses as CEO.  There is no substitute for experience.

If you need a consultant, here I am.  

If you want to be a consultant, too, with PERMANENT, then send us your CV and information.  Engineers, artists, programmers, public relations people, lawyers, ... The space economy needs all kinds of people.  Let's get started now.  If you are already a space resources professional, then don't be late and miss opportunities.  If you are a newcomer, it will take some time to get up to speed enough to compete as a good consultant or employee for some space entity.  

For a private or public sector venture leader, it will take time to get up to speed as a viable competitor.  However, this is the future of our lives, so better to start sooner than later, to get in more at the ground level.

PERMANENT has always been about bringing newcomers up to speed, and integrating them into the community.  This remains the PERMANENT mission.

Learn how PRI is planning to prospect and mine asteroids.
Planetary Resources is bringing the natural resources of space within humanity’s economic sphere of influence, propelling us into the 21st century and beyond... today.
Asteroids will play a key role in the development of a space economy and be the main driver in allowing humanity to become a flourishing multi-planetary species. Water from asteroids will fuel the in-space economy and habitation, by creating rocket fuel and consumable water from space, for space.
Rare metals will increase Earth’s GDP when mined from asteroids in our Solar System – the very same objects that brought them to Earth in the first place.
Peter's Role: CO-Chairman/Co-FOUNDER, PLANETARY RESOURCES Inc.: Planetary Resources, Inc.(PRI) is focused on the identification, remote sensing and prospecting of near-Earth approaching asteroids. The company is backed by a group of world-class investors

Bayer AG and Planetary Resources Signs Memorandum of Understanding for the Development of Applications and Products Based on Satellite Images
Jun 3 16
Bayer AG and Planetary Resources have signed a memorandum of understanding for the development of applications and products based on satellite images. Bayer intends to purchase these data from Planetary Resources to create new agricultural products and improve existing ones. The collaboration will be part of the Digital Farming Initiative at Bayer. Using the combined technologies from the two companies, farmers can time their irrigation systems much better to save water, receive planting date recommendations and re-planting advice, and assess their soil's water-holding capacity. Another project is a canopy temperature scout that provides weekly practical insights and scouting support from emergence to harvest by identifying problem areas in the field. Bayer intends to provide farmers all over the world with practical decision-making aids based on the precise evaluation and combination of diverse data such as weather data or topographic maps. Using these individualized recommendations, farmers can optimize their business management and lower costs.
