The Truth About Mattresses | Tuft & Needle

The Truth

Mattress Stores Are Greedy.

Learn the Truth Now










A mattress shouldn’t cost a fortune
Over-priced, over-complicated mattresses have been the standard. Until now.


Unfair markups
Typically, mattresses are marked up 6-12 times by the time they’re sold. That means you’re mostly paying for gimmicks, unfair retail markups, sales commissions, and wholesaler’s profits.

Markup
True Cost


Tuft & Needle



Big Mattress





                Often gimmicky marketing,
                
                unfair retail markups,
                
                sales commissions,
                
                and overwhelming options.
              






                Most mattress companies use the same four ingredients.
                But not us.

Big Mattress thinks “Innovating” means “rearranging outdated materials to charge you more money.” It’s all these same 4 old layers, mixed and matched under different names so you can't compare and cross shop:







01 Latex
The problem with latex is pressure relief. Because the more you  push on it, the more it pushes back. This causes painful pressure  points. Latex is an outdated material that mattress companies just never stopped using.







02 Memory Foam
Memory Foam has no bounce. It's like sleeping in quicksand. And once you’re stuck, you start getting hot.







03 Springs
Why is coiled steel considered comfortable? Spring mattresses are mostly empty space, so you get mostly empty support.







04 Egg Crate Foam
So-called “Egg Crate” layers are a single block of foam cut in half, then disguised as a bonus feature. It’s an easy way for mattress companies to charge you more while selling you less.








T&N Adaptive® Foam. Innovation by us, perfected by you.
The mattress industry hadn’t changed in years, aside from adding new sales tricks and gimmicks. So when we started Tuft & Needle, we worked to innovate something entirely new for the industry. Unparalleled in comfort and support, our proprietary foam was painstakingly perfected through customer feedback. It’s not memory foam. It’s not latex. It’s T&N Adaptive® Foam. And because it adapts to every individual’s body, you’ll always sleep on the ideal firmness for you.

T&N Adaptive® Foam
Our key innovation is T&N Adaptive® Foam. It   offers a gradient of support, so the more pressure you apply,   the more it adapts to support you.










Zillion layer mattresses are a scam







More layers means hot sleeping


Tuft & Needle



We’ve worked hard to reduce our layers down to the   essential two. The performance of your sleep surface is what  matters most because it provides the comfort you feel and the  interaction your body needs. Our innovative foam is what makes   this all possible.


Other Guys



Every mattress layer adds a layer of glue, and every layer of glue reduces airflow. Reduced airflow means hot sleeping, and paying for extra layers you won’t feel.






Cutting costs, direct to you.





We run our supply chain vertically and manufacture our products honestly. We cut out the middlemen to make a great product at a fair price.




Sleep on an honestly crafted mattress at a fair price

Mattress Stores Are Greedy.

Learn the Truth Now










A mattress shouldn’t cost a fortune
Over-priced, over-complicated mattresses have been the standard. Until now.


Unfair markups
Typically, mattresses are marked up 6-12 times by the time they’re sold. That means you’re mostly paying for gimmicks, unfair retail markups, sales commissions, and wholesaler’s profits.

True Cost


Tuft & Needle



Big Mattress





                Often gimmicky marketing,
                
                unfair retail markups,
                
                sales commissions,
                
                and overwhelming options.
              






                Most mattress companies use the same four ingredients.
                But not us.

Big Mattress thinks “Innovating” means “rearranging outdated materials to charge you more money.” It’s all these same 4 old layers, mixed and matched under different names so you can't compare and cross shop:







01 Latex
The problem with latex is pressure relief. Because the more you  push on it, the more it pushes back. This causes painful pressure  points. Latex is an outdated material that mattress companies just never stopped using.







02 Memory Foam
Memory Foam has no bounce. It's like sleeping in quicksand. And once you’re stuck, you start getting hot.







03 Springs
Why is coiled steel considered comfortable? Spring mattresses are mostly empty space, so you get mostly empty support.







04 Egg Crate Foam
So-called “Egg Crate” layers are a single block of foam cut in half, then disguised as a bonus feature. It’s an easy way for mattress companies to charge you more while selling you less.








T&N Adaptive® Foam. Innovation by us, perfected by you.
The mattress industry hadn’t changed in years, aside from adding new sales tricks and gimmicks. So when we started Tuft & Needle, we worked to innovate something entirely new for the industry. Unparalleled in comfort and support, our proprietary foam was painstakingly perfected through customer feedback. It’s not memory foam. It’s not latex. It’s T&N Adaptive® Foam. And because it adapts to every individual’s body, you’ll always sleep on the ideal firmness for you.

T&N Adaptive® Foam
Our key innovation is T&N Adaptive® Foam. It   offers a gradient of support, so the more pressure you apply,   the more it adapts to support you.










Zillion layer mattresses are a scam







More layers means hot sleeping


Tuft & Needle



We’ve worked hard to reduce our layers down to the   essential two. The performance of your sleep surface is what  matters most because it provides the comfort you feel and the  interaction your body needs. Our innovative foam is what makes   this all possible.


Other Guys



Every mattress layer adds a layer of glue, and every layer of glue reduces airflow. Reduced airflow means hot sleeping, and paying for extra layers you won’t feel.






Cutting costs, direct to you.





We run our supply chain vertically and manufacture our products honestly. We cut out the middlemen to make a great product at a fair price.

Price, Size & WeightInside MaterialCover MaterialSafety & Material




Premium polyurethane foam crafted in California, USA.

                      Our entire mattress has earned UL GREENGUARD Gold Certification. GREENGUARD Certified products aid in the creation of healthier indoor environments, and release fewer pollutants that can contribute to health issues including asthma and other respiratory issues. This GREENGUARD label validates that the T&N Mattress is low-emitting and supports healthy indoor environments. UL is a global independent safety science company with more than a century of expertise innovating safety solutions. For more information, check out the GREENGUARD Certification website
                      here.

Our foam is tested and certified by CertiPUR-US® to meet high standards in physical performance, content, indoor emissions and environmental stewardship.
Two-layer blended foam designed by and proprietary to Tuft & Needle. The support foam layer is a high-density poly-foam. The density is about 1.8 lbs/cubic ft.
The comfort foam layer is a very high-density foam that we created to achieve our universally comfortable, cool and responsive properties. The density is about 2.8 lbs/cubic ft.


Our T&N Mattress cover is made with a blend of Polyester and Tactel (nylon). It has a soft feel which is very pleasant to the touch.
Tactel is commonly used in clothing for men, women and children as an alternative to cotton. It is also known to dry 6-8 times faster than cotton, which helps you sleep cooler, longer.
With durability in mind, we've designed a fabric that will last. Our Mattress cover fabric is pilling and tearing resistant.
Our T&N Mattress cover has been tested and certified by OEKO-TEX®. OEKO-TEX® tests for harmful substances in textiles and materials. The more intensive the skin contact of a product and the more sensitive the skin, the stricter the human-ecological requirements that need to be complied with.
We are proud to hold the STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX®: Class I certification on the T&N Mattress cover. While our mattress was not designed for babies and toddlers, the STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX®: Class I certification signifies that all parts of an article meet the OEKO-TEX® requirements for a product used by babies and toddlers up to 3 years of age.

                      For more information about OEKO-TEX® standards, click
                      here.



U.S. law requires that every mattress sold needs to pass two very specific burn tests: an "open flame" test and a "cigarette" test.
In order to pass these two tests, a mattress typically needs to have a component known as a fire barrier that self extinguishes the mattress when on fire.
We've done a lot of research as a team and decided the best solution for our T&N Mattress was a fire sock flame barrier. This component is permanently installed around the foam core of our mattress which is then fully encased within the outer cover. You will not come into contact with the sock unless you unzip and remove the outer cover of your mattress, which we do not recommend.
If you believe it is necessary to remove the cover (for example, to clean it more thoroughly in the case of serious spills or soiling), we recommend that you contact us before doing so.  We may be able to offer tips to avoid potential issues with removing and replacing the cover.  In any event, our mattress cover should never be machine washed.
Our fire barrier doesn't contain any fire retardant chemicals. Instead, it's a tubular knitted fabric (often referred to as a "fire sock"), composed of four inert fibers and is inherently flame retardant.
Our fire barrier has been tested and certified by OEKO-TEX®. OEKO-TEX® tests for harmful substances in textiles and materials. The more intensive the skin contact of a product and the more sensitive the skin, the stricter the human-ecological requirements that need to be complied with.
We are proud to hold the STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX®: Class I certification on the T&N Mattress fire barrier. While our mattress was not designed for babies and toddlers, the STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX®: Class I certification signifies that all parts of an article meet the OEKO-TEX® requirements for a product used by babies and toddlers up to 3 years of age.

                      For more information about OEKO-TEX® standards, click
                      here.

Our fire barrier satisfies both the 1633 (open flame) and 1632 (cigarette) burn test requirements.
We do not use any flame retardant chemicals in the making of our foam.

JT Marino & Daehee Park
Why We Started

Tuft & Needle was inspired after co-founder JT Marino and his wife went shopping for their first big purchase as newlyweds — a mattress. Their unfortunate mattress shopping experience, and purchase of a $3500 overpriced and uncomfortable mattress led to restless nights and buyer’s remorse for JT.
After sharing his painful story with his good friend, Daehee Park, they commiserated on the severity of the problem. They realized most mattress companies were marking up prices by almost 10x. “It became emotional at that point,” Daehee says, “We felt robbed.”
Co-founders JT and Daehee launched Tuft & Needle in 2012 to change the way mattresses were designed and sold. They pioneered the single model, universally comfortable mattress. JT explains, “Our mattress is made with foam engineered by us, conveniently compressed into a small box, and delivered free of charge to our customer’s door.”
With no investors, Marino and Park started with $6000. They have bootstrapped the company and relentlessly focused on making the business as efficient as possible, cutting out the waste and passing on the savings to customers.






We Left Memory Foam In The Past.
Forget about Latex and Springs too.

T&N Adaptive® Foam, engineered by us, is the first of its kind.
The result of a partnership with the world’s leading foam scientists, our unique formula was tested, refined, and perfected at the molecular level.
T&N Adaptive® Foam allows us to deliver both comfort and support in a  single material, whereas other brands are forced to mix and match layers using traditional materials like memory foam and latex. These are then labeled “premium”- a marketing trick used to hide the drawbacks of stacked layers.
Fact: Individual mattress layers compete with each other when stacked. As a result, the specific benefits of each layer are often canceled. We’ve proven performance on the sleep surface is what matters most. With T&N Adaptive® Foam atop our base layer, you’ll secure all the benefits of the “other guys” 3-7 layers in just 2 - the fewest layers of any competitor, and as a result, the most efficiently manufactured. We pass the savings onto you.




 


Affordable and high-quality, with nothing to hide.






Soft Without The Sink: Perfect For Side, Back & Stomach Sleepers.
The Tuft & Needle mattress is soft and comfy while still being bouncy and supportive.


After thousands of reviews, emails and phone calls from our customers, we’ve made over 100 iterations to our mattress. The result is far greater than any focus group could ever produce. Real feedback in real-time has helped us perfect our product.








              T&N Adaptive
              TM
              Foam
            
We’ve engineered a new foam based purely on customer feedback. It captures the best benefits of memory foam and latex while leaving their negative attributes behind.





Supportive Base Layer
Our custom T&N Adaptive® Foam is paired with a high quality support layer that forms the perfect foundation for our mattress.





Ideal Support
Our foam is ideal for sleepers of any size or weight – and this is what makes it unique. The more pressure you put on it, the more it reacts to support you.








No Tricky Tactics Disguised As Features.
Junk science doesn’t keep you cool, common sense does.



Our mattress is designed to draw heat out in four simple ways.







1. Heat Wicking
Heat is drawn into the mattress where gel and graphite work together to disperse heat outward and away from your body.






2. Breathable
With the help of our fabric, air flows through the foam cells to boost the speed of heat transfer through the mattress.






3. No More Quicksand
Our support layer helps hold you closer to the surface to avoid the oven effect caused by sinking in too deeply.






4. Fewer Layers
Other brands use lots-o-layers of random foams containing different cell structures. Together, our 2 layers create uniform breathability.








You Should Only Pay for What Matters.
Fancy wordplay gets tiring, because it “sounds” expensive doesn’t mean it should be.


With Tuft & Needle, price is not a reflection of quality. Consumers are trained to think that high priced goods are always better. But a quality mattress can be honestly and fairly priced. So we designed an incredible mattress, then focused on reasonable pricing by increasing efficiency and cutting out the needless costs that normally are passed on to consumers.






The Truth Is: We’re Cutting Costs, Not Corners.
We run our own supply chain and sell direct to you.













Our Two Layers Are All You Need.
The other guys add layers to make it more expensive, while stripping away benefits.






            Tuft & Needle
            2 Layers





            Everybody Else
            3 - 7 Layers



Every layer of foam or material needs a layer of glue and every layer of glue reduces air-flow. Reduced airflow means hot sleeping and paying for fancy material 7 layers deep that has no impact on your sleep. We’ve worked hard to reduce our layers down to the essential two. The performance of your sleep surface is what matters most because it provides the comfort you feel and the interaction your body needs. Our innovative foam is what makes this all possible.

JT Marino & Daehee Park
Why We Started

Tuft & Needle was inspired after co-founder JT Marino and his wife went shopping for their first big purchase as newlyweds — a mattress. Their unfortunate mattress shopping experience, and purchase of a $3500 overpriced and uncomfortable mattress led to restless nights and buyer’s remorse for JT.
After sharing his painful story with his good friend, Daehee Park, they commiserated on the severity of the problem. They realized most mattress companies were marking up prices by almost 10x. “It became emotional at that point,” Daehee says, “We felt robbed.”
Co-founders JT and Daehee launched Tuft & Needle in 2012 to change the way mattresses were designed and sold. They pioneered the single model, universally comfortable mattress. JT explains, “Our mattress is made with foam engineered by us, conveniently compressed into a small box, and delivered free of charge to our customer’s door.”
With no investors, Marino and Park started with $6000. They have bootstrapped the company and relentlessly focused on making the business as efficient as possible, cutting out the waste and passing on the savings to customers.

Soft Without The Sink: Perfect For Side, Back & Stomach Sleepers.
The Tuft & Needle mattress is soft and comfy while still being bouncy and supportive.


After thousands of reviews, emails and phone calls from our customers, we’ve made over 100 iterations to our mattress. The result is far greater than any focus group could ever produce. Real feedback in real-time has helped us perfect our product.

We’ve engineered a new foam based purely on customer feedback. It captures the best benefits of memory foam and latex while leaving their negative attributes behind.





Supportive Base Layer
Our custom T&N Adaptive® Foam is paired with a high quality support layer that forms the perfect foundation for our mattress.





Ideal Support
Our foam is ideal for sleepers of any size or weight – and this is what makes it unique. The more pressure you put on it, the more it reacts to support you.

Our mattress is designed to draw heat out in four simple ways.







1. Heat Wicking
Heat is drawn into the mattress where gel and graphite work together to disperse heat outward and away from your body.






2. Breathable
With the help of our fabric, air flows through the foam cells to boost the speed of heat transfer through the mattress.






3. No More Quicksand
Our support layer helps hold you closer to the surface to avoid the oven effect caused by sinking in too deeply.






4. Fewer Layers
Other brands use lots-o-layers of random foams containing different cell structures. Together, our 2 layers create uniform breathability.








You Should Only Pay for What Matters.
Fancy wordplay gets tiring, because it “sounds” expensive doesn’t mean it should be.


With Tuft & Needle, price is not a reflection of quality. Consumers are trained to think that high priced goods are always better. But a quality mattress can be honestly and fairly priced. So we designed an incredible mattress, then focused on reasonable pricing by increasing efficiency and cutting out the needless costs that normally are passed on to consumers.






The Truth Is: We’re Cutting Costs, Not Corners.
We run our own supply chain and sell direct to you.













Our Two Layers Are All You Need.
The other guys add layers to make it more expensive, while stripping away benefits.






            Tuft & Needle
            2 Layers





            Everybody Else
            3 - 7 Layers



Every layer of foam or material needs a layer of glue and every layer of glue reduces air-flow. Reduced airflow means hot sleeping and paying for fancy material 7 layers deep that has no impact on your sleep. We’ve worked hard to reduce our layers down to the essential two. The performance of your sleep surface is what matters most because it provides the comfort you feel and the interaction your body needs. Our innovative foam is what makes this all possible.

Casper brings extensive operating experience to NVP having led marketing and commercialization efforts for cardiovascular device, specialty pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies. Based in NVP’s Palo Alto office, Casper focuses on mid to late stage investments in medical devices, specialty pharmaceuticals and healthcare services. Therapeutic products that address a critical unmet medical need, that are “less” traumatic or have a defined path to regulatory approval are of particular interest. His current investments include Intersect ENT ((NASDAQ: XENT), iRhythm Technologies, Misfit Wearables and Simpirica Spine. Casper was previously on the board of Basis (acquired by Intel).
Prior to NVP, Casper was a Partner at U.S. Venture Partners (USVP) in Menlo Park, where he invested in therapeutic companies from clinical development through commercialization. At USVP, Casper served as a Board member for AtheroMed, Ilypsa (acquired by Amgen) and Valeritas. Over a six year period he was actively involved in making and managing investments in more than a dozen companies as a member of the healthcare team. Casper was also a private investor and board member with Innospine, an orthopedic diagnostic company acquired by Kyphon in 2005.
Previously, Casper spent four years as Vice President of Business Development, Sales and Marketing at Aerogen, a specialty pharmaceutical company developing inhaled therapeutics for diabetes and respiratory diseases (public company acquired by Nektar then Novartis). In 1999 he co-founded and venture funded Epicor to develop a market leading epicardial ablation treatment for atrial fibrillation (acquired by St. Jude Medical for over $200M in 2004).
Prior to Epicor, Casper held senior marketing positions at Heartport (acquired by Johnson and Johnson) and Diagnostic Products Corporation (acquired by Siemens). At Heartport, Casper launched an integrated surgical product line to perform minimally invasive cardiovascular surgery. Previously at Diagnostics Products Corporation, he managed a portfolio of oncology, infectious disease and infertility immunoassay tests which doubled to $105M in revenues during his tenure. At these companies, Casper worked closely with the engineering, scientific and clinical teams in product development, coordinated multiple U.S. product launches and had ongoing responsibility for managing international distribution.
Earlier in his career, Casper worked internationally for three years as a strategy consultant for Bain & Company.
Casper holds an M.B.A. from Stanford University Graduate School of Business, an M.S. in biological science from Stanford University and a B.A. in biochemistry from Dartmouth College.
