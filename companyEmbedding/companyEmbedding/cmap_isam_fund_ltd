                            Biography: 
                        

Stanley Fink is a member of the ISAM Systematic Investment Committee and of the ISAM Executive Committee. He stood down as Deputy Chairman of Man Group on 10 July 2008 after an illustrious career with them spanning more than 21 years. When he joined Man it was a medium sized private company which was largely an agricultural commodity trading business, with small operations in futures broking and hedge fund management. By 2007, when Stanley retired as Group Chief Executive, Man had disposed of its agricultural commodity businesses to management, floated its large brokerage business on the New York Stock Exchange, and grown the fund management business to what was believed to be the largest quoted hedge fund manager in the world. As of June 2008 it had a stock market capitalisation of 20 billion dollars and managed alternative assets of approaching 80 billion dollars. Educated at Manchester Grammar School and Trinity Hall Cambridge, where he gained a degree in law, Stanley qualified as a Chartered Accountant in 1982, worked for a year for Mars and then spent three years at Citibank NA as a Vice President. He joined Man in 1987, was appointed to the board later that year, with responsibility for planning, strategy and mergers and acquisitions. He was promoted to Group Finance Director 3 years later and led Man’s IPO on the London Stock Exchange in 1994. In 1996 Stanley took over as Managing Director of Man’s small fund management business which managed just under 1 billion dollars. The business grew rapidly under Stanley’s leadership and became the most profitable part of the Group by 2000. The group demerged its agricultural business in 2000 whereupon Stanley became Group Chief Executive.
Stanley retired as CEO in 2007 after the IPO of Man’s brokerage business onto the New York Stock Exchange. During Stanley’s time as CEO, he received several awards as the leading CEO in the European financial sector and the company received many awards for hedge fund management, as well as accolades for being the fastest growing share in the FTSE with its share price growing by a factor of more than twenty between 1994 and 2008. Stanley is a committed philanthropist, whose passions include education, health and the reduction of Global warming via application of carbon markets and new technology. Stanley joined ISAM in August 2008 as Chief Executive Officer. Stanley is actively involved in fundraising and implementation of business strategy as well as planning and directing the organisation's activities in order to achieve targets. Stanley is also involved with recruiting and developing executive team members. He aims to develop organisational culture and values with all staff, investors, and regulatory bodies. Stanley was elevated to the peerage in January 2011.

                        There are substantial risks and conflicts of interests associated with Managed Futures and commodities accounts, and you should only invest risk capital. The success of an investment is dependent upon the ability of a commodity trading advisor (CTA) to identify profitable investment opportunities and successfully trade. The identification of attractive trading opportunities is difficult, requires skill, and involves a significant degree of uncertainty. CTAs have total trading authority, and the use of a single CTA could mean a lack of diversification and higher risk. The high degree of leverage often obtainable in commodity trading can work against you as well as for you, and can lead to large losses as well as gains. Returns generated from a CTA’s trading, if any, may not adequately compensate you for the business and financial risks you assume. You can lose all or a substantial amount of your investment. If you use notional funding, you may lose more than your initial cash investment. Managed Futures and commodities accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees. It may be necessary for accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits in order to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets. The disclosure document contains a complete description of each fee to be charged to your account by a CTA. CTAs may trade highly illiquid markets, or on foreign markets, and may not be able to close or offset positions immediately upon request. You may have market exposure even after the CTA has a request for closure or liquidation. PAST RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

ISAM strengthens team to meet business growth

Moves & Appointments











In the wake of another strong year of performance, International Standard Asset Management (ISAM), the hedge fund manager led by Stanley Fink and Larry Hite, is bolstering its team with the addition of two high-profile, experienced industry leaders.
Alexander Lowe joins this month as Business Development Director of ISAM, and Riva Waller has been brought in as Chief Operating Officer based in New York. Both formerly worked at Man Group.
Lowe, who was previously CEO of Man Global Strategies (MGS) and Director of Man Investments Ltd from 2006-2009, where he managed a team of 60 people, running over 100 products and investing USD19bn of client commitments into a range of hedge fund strategies globally, will be responsible for expanding the institutional and operational capabilities of the business and driving new product development. He joined Man Group Plc in 2003 as Head of Product Development at MGS, where he was responsible for product design and implementation. Prior to this role, Lowe was Senior Trader at BNP Paribas from 2001-2003 and Senior Salesman at ING Barings from 1998-2001.
In New York, Riva Waller has joined ISAM as Chief Operating Officer following a 16 year career at Man Investments. Another Man Group veteran, Riva initially joined the Mint Investment Management Company joint venture with Man Group in 1993 as a Financial Controller. Working directly with Larry Hite and Alex Greyserman, now principals of ISAM since its strategic alliance with Hite Capital Management was formed in February 2010, she transitioned to Man Investments Ltd in 2001 to develop its managed account capabilities. In 2007 she was named Head of Managers & Managed Accounts and was a senior member of Man´s Product Structuring Finance & Legal leadership team when she moved into the Multi-Manager business in October 2009.
“Alex and Riva bring a tremendous wealth of experience and drive to our business on both sides of the Atlantic," says Stanley Fink (pictured), Chief Executive of ISAM. "Their combined experience of nearly thirty years in running more than 100 managed accounts across equity hedge, managed futures, event driven, relative value, global macro and commodities strategies, means they are each a natural fit in our business. We are delighted to have them on board as ISAM enters the next phase of growth, building out the CTA business, developing our multi-strategy platform of liquid hedge fund strategies and institutionalising our product mix to offer our clients new and greater performance.”
Also joining the New York office’s Institutional Sales team is Brian McHugh, who comes from Aspect Capital where he was responsible for existing distribution relationships with wire houses and private banks in North America. Meanwhile, ISAM Principal, Rod Barker will be leaving the firm to become CEO of a new asset management business being established in partnership with Sir John Beckwith’s Pacific Investments.
