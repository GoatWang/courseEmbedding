How We Invest
CLO Management

Seeks to achieve better absolute performance with less risk, while providing investors with maximum transparency
Invests in larger, liquid, broadly syndicated bank loans
Utilizes a rigorous credit research process with a low ratio of credits per analyst
Supplements bottom-up analysis with a disciplined approach to risk management and portfolio monitoring

CLO Investing

Seeks to achieve attractive absolute returns while minimizing volatility
Evaluates CLO tranches using a combination of rigorous qualitative (portfolio, manager and legal considerations) and quantitative (structural, cash-flow, collateral valuation and pricing/relative value) analysis
Utilizes a proprietary quantitative analytical tool, CLO ViewPointTM, to view and track Acis credit research team’s credit opinion on each individual loan, including ratings downgrade probability and timing, default probability and estimated recovery values












 

Acis Capital Management, Highland Capital’s Structured Product affiliate, was established as a separate SEC registered investment adviser in 2010 to specialize in Collateralized Loan Obligation (“CLO”) management and CLO investing.
A CLO is an issuance of securities (AAA to B) and an equity tranche backed by the cash flows from a diversified pool of senior secured corporate bank loans. CLOs are structured with a re-investment period, allowing the CLO Manger to actively buy and sell assets, subject to asset quality covenants for a period of 3-5 years. The return paid to the equity holders is the difference between the current yield on the underlying assets and the financing cost of the issued notes.
Highland was one of the early pioneers in the CLO market, setting up one of the first non-bank deals in 1996. Highland together with Acis has become one of the largest managers of US CLOs with over $11B under management including a secondary CLO investment portfolio with over $2 billion of assets under management. Members of the Acis team have structured and managed over $32B of CLOs across 40 vehicles, have invested in over $13 billion of CLO paper and have traded over $17 billion of structured credit paper over the last decade, providing investors optimal access to the market.
The integration of the Acis CLO platform and its rigorous investment and risk management processes focused solely on CLOs provides investors with unique investment opportunities.

MUTUAL FUNDSETFsOPEN ENDED FUNDSCLOSED ENDED FUNDSBDCs

Mutual Funds
Highland Capital Management, headquartered in Dallas, TX, is a SEC-registered investment advisor with 17 funds under management. The Firm is one of the most respected and experienced alternative investment managers serving the registered product market. As a manager of managers, we are dedicated to identifying and retaining best in class asset managers to serve as sub-advisers to our funds. One main advantage of open ended mutual funds is that they give investors access to professionally managed, diversified portfolios of equities, bonds and other securities, which would otherwise be difficult to create. Each shareholder participates proportionally in the gain or loss of the fund. Mutual fund units, or shares, are issued and can typically be purchased or redeemed as needed at the fund’s end of day net asset value (NAV) per share.
Each Highland mutual fund portfolio is structured and maintained to match a specific investment objective which is stated in its prospectus. The suite of mutual funds within the Highland complex is designed to represent a comprehensive set of offerings spanning many investment objectives available to construct a diversified investment portfolio. We encourage you to contact an investment professional to assist you in determining which Highland funds are appropriate for your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

Alternative Funds
Alternative investment assets have historically been held by institutional or accredited investors. Highland brings institutional quality strategies and investment managers to the investor in a mutual fund structure. Alternative investments may include long/short, credit oriented products, private equity, technically driven strategies, managed futures, real estate and other hard assets. Read More
Income Funds
Highland’s fixed income funds invest primarily in bonds and other debt instruments. The debt instruments in which the funds invest will depend on their focus. The Highland funds complex includes fixed income strategies that seek to achieve their stated objective by investing in government debt, municipal bonds, investment grade and high yield corporate debt, along with other debt securities including agency, asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities. Read More
Equity Funds
Equity mutual funds are principally categorized according to a specific investment objective. Often times equity mutual funds objectives are described by size (small, medium or large cap). The size references the typical capitalization of each underlying investment. Additionally, equity mutual funds can be categorized by style. The style is described as growth, value or geography. Highland offers equity funds of all styles including growth, value, small cap, large cap, international and domestic. Read More
Asset Allocation Funds
Asset allocation mutual funds provide investors with a portfolio of fixed or variable allocations to major asset classes such as stocks, bonds and cash equivalents. Some funds maintain a fixed allocation proportion to specific asset classes while others actively manage the proportional composition of the portfolio in response to macro-economic conditions and/or changes in investment markets. Read More

EQUITY FUNDS
Equity mutual funds are principally categorized according to a specific investment objective. Often times equity mutual funds objectives are described by size (small, medium or large cap). The size references the typical capitalization of each underlying investment. Additionally, equity mutual funds can be categorized by style. The style is described as growth, value or geography. Highland offers equity funds of all styles including growth, value, small cap, large cap, international and domestic. Click on the links below to learn more about Highland’s Equity funds.

ASSET ALLOCATION FUNDS
Asset allocation mutual funds provide investors with a portfolio of fixed or variable allocations to major asset classes such as stocks, bonds and cash equivalents. Some funds maintain a fixed allocation proportion to specific asset classes while others actively manage the proportional composition of the portfolio in response to macro‐economic conditions and/or changes in investment markets.

EXCHANGE‐TRADED FUNDS – ETFs
Exchange-traded funds are securities that track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund.  An ETF trades like a stock on an exchange so its net asset value (NAV) is not calculated every day like a mutual fund. ETFs experience price changes throughout the day as they are bought and sold.  Highland’s exchange‐traded fund seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the Markit iBoxx Liquid Leveraged Loan Index (the “Underlying Index”).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
