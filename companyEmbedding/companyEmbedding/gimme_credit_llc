You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Intel 07-28 19:22 GMT (Comment) Intel's second quarter revenue surged 9%, or 14% when adjusting for the sale of its security operations...Earnings by Dave Novosel, CFAIntel's second quarter revenue surged 9%, or 14% when adjusting for the sale of its security operations (MacAfee), early in the quarter. Client Computing Group revenue was up an amazing 12%, attributable mostly to an 8% increase in average selling prices. Management pointed to strength in the gaming segment and a strong Core mix. Admittedly, the comp was not so difficult since last year revenue in this segment dropped 2%. Data Center revenue rose 9% while Memory Solutions revenue rocketed 58%. In response to the strong revenue growth, its improved outlook for the PC business and the expectation for an earlier close of the Mobileye transaction, management raised its guidance for full year revenue by $1.3 billion. The revision was notable in that although the PC market is still shrinking, and primary competitor Advance Micro Devices posted excellent results earlier in the week, Intel is still generating impressive growth. Last year's operating income was horrible so the comparisons are not meaningful, but margins were better than the first quarter. Margins are being constrained by the losses in the Memory Solutions segment, or they would be even better. Intel added $6.6 billion of debt in Q2. So even though EBITDA should be significantly higher this year because of much better revenue and improved margins, leverage is likely to climb to 1.4x versus 1.3x at the end of 2016. The debt was likely added in anticipation of the Mobileye acquisition, which is now slated to close in Q3. The remainder will be funded with offshore cash, equivalents, and marketable securities.



Expedia, Inc. 07-28 16:38 GMT (Comment) Second quarter revenue soared 18% at Expedia, with trivago (+63%) and HomeAway (+31%) leading...Earnings by Dave Novosel, CFASecond quarter revenue soared 18% at Expedia, with trivago (+63%) and HomeAway (+31%) leading the way. Core OTA, by far its largest segment, posted a 13% increase in revenue. Egencia, easily the smallest segment, saw an 8% increase in revenue. Revenue was boosted by a 21% increase in room nights stayed, which more than offset the 4% decline in revenue per room night. EBITDA margins declined 30 basis points. Margins in the Core OTA and Egencia segments were relatively flat, but margins were considerably lower in the HomeAway and trivago units. The overall decrease was due mostly to higher marketing expenses. The aggressive marketing spending will likely run through the rest of the year, putting some pressure on margins. But given the explosive topline growth, the spending is certainly worthwhile. As usual, free cash flow was outstanding in Q2, and EXPE is on track to generate more than $800 million this year. We estimate that share repurchases will be a little more than $250 million, while the company has spent $138 million on acquisitions through the first half. EXPE also announced it is making a $350 million minority investment in Traveloka, the leading online travel company in Indonesia.



Philip Morris International 07-28 16:36 GMT (Comment) Tobacco stocks plunged but then partially recovered after the FDA delivered a...Regulatory Development by Carol Levenson, CFATobacco stocks plunged but then partially recovered after the FDA delivered a bombshell to the industry this morning. The FDA said it will pursue lowering nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive levels, in a multi-year plan starting with public dialogue. The first step will be the issuance of an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to seek input on the public health benefits and possible adverse effects of lower nicotine in cigarettes. We envision a full court press by the cigarette industry in opposition as well as difficulty in agreeing upon a scientific definition of addiction-causing levels of nicotine. But clearly companies such as Altria and Philip Morris International are ahead of the game with their advance work with risk reduction products (RRPs) such as the IQOS heat-not-burn system as well as e-cigarettes. As we noted in a recent report, RRPs already represent nearly 10% of PM's revenues. Both companies (but especially Altria) also benefit to some degree from diversification of products sold besides combustible cigarettes. For now PM also benefits from its international base, but eventually if the FDA initiative takes hold here, we imagine it will be adopted abroad as well. We are not here to debate the public health aspects of the initiative. But we don't see cigarette smoking going away or the industry disappearing. Given the likely protracted time until implementation (if any), and the progress thus far in RRPs, we don't see this development as a near-term threat to credit quality for either PM or Altria.

Telefonica 07-28 13:30 GMT (Comment) After posting two consecutive slight declines in organic revenue growth in Q2/Q3 of 2016, Telefonica...Earnings by Dave Novosel, CFAAfter posting two consecutive slight declines in organic revenue growth in Q2/Q3 of 2016, Telefonica has now recorded three straight quarters of organic growth, including 3.1% in the second quarter. Reported revenue rose 1.9%, with mobile data the key driver. Latin America led the way with organic growth of more than 15%, while Brail was up 1.8%, and Spain was down 0.8%.Management raised its guidance for full-year revenue growth to more than 1.5% versus its previous target of stable. It forecast a 100 basis point improvement in margins Operating margins increased by 150 basis points in Q2, attributable to lower salaries, reduced network expenses, and contained content spending.  The increase in revenue and higher margins should result in better EBITDA, While leverage is falling, at 4.0x it is still higher than most of its peers in the telecom space. Potential IPOs of its Argentina and Colombia operations could generate some cash to slash debt further.



Comcast Corporation 07-28 12:13 GMT (Comment) Comcast continues to offer a rare blend of explosive revenue growth, expanding margins,...Earnings by Dave Novosel, CFAComcast continues to offer a rare blend of explosive revenue growth, expanding margins, improving free cash flow, and low leverage. Second quarter revenue soared almost 10%, following a gain of 9% in Q1. On the cable side, revenue was up over 5%, led by a 9% increase in high-speed Internet and a 13% increase in Business Services. Comcast added 175K high-speed Internet subs, but lost 34K video subs. Despite the significant jump in programming expenses, margins fell only 10 basis points, as the company slashed support and service costs by reducing customer calls. On the NBCUniversal side, revenue surged more than 17%. Film revenue rose nearly 60%, reflecting the box office success of the latest Fast and Furious installment. Theme parks increased close to 16% due to higher attendance and more per capita spending. Broadcast TV and Cable Networks each rose 5%, aided by higher retransmission fees and contractual rate increases. Management noted that NBC did very well in the recently concluded upfront negotiations with volume up about 8%. It also said that it was not a case of pulling demand forward. Margins in the NBCUniversal segment improved by 110 basis points, including a huge increase in Film, a substantial increase in Cable, and modest increase in Theme Parks and Broadcast TV. Margins would have increased even more if not for the lower EBITDA in the Headquarters & Other unit. Based on the first half trends, Comcast is set to produce free cash flow in excess of $8 billion, while share repurchases would be just under $5 billion. Spending on acquisitions has totaled $2.7 billion in the first two quarters. The company has added more than $2 billion of debt in 2017, but the better EBITDA should allow leverage to fall to 2.2x by year-end. Extracting acquisition strategy from management on conference calls is always difficult, but we came away with the impression that Comcast really does not see the need for a deal, particularly with respect to wireless.

Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold 07-27 19:32 GMT (Comment) Freeport-McMoRan's (FCX) second quarter adjusted EBITDA was up nicely...Earnings by Evan Mann, CFAFreeport-McMoRan's (FCX) second quarter adjusted EBITDA was up nicely year over year on higher realized copper pricing and was consistent with the consensus forecast.  Overall, however, second quarter copper and gold volumes were 3% and 2% below FCX's April guidance as worker absenteeism hampered mining and milling rates in Indonesia while unit cash costs were in line with guidance.  For the LTM, leverage was 2.9x (2.0x net), improvement from 6.5x and 3.3x (2.4x net) at 2016 year-end, and LTM free cash flow was to $2.2 billion.  Net debt of $10.7 billion was down $1.1 billion year to date and down $9.5 billion from $20 billion at the end of 2015, consistent with the company's stated objective of reducing debt by $5-10 billion by the end of 2017.  The company noted discussions with the Government of Indonesia are active with the government appearing more serious about reaching a near-term resolution and FCX believes an agreement could be reached by the self-imposed October deadline.  We will update our projections and review our rating shortly.



Anheuser-Busch Inbev 07-27 19:00 GMT (Comment) Second quarter revenue rose 5% at AB InBev, aided by the acquisition of SABMiller...Earnings by Dave Novosel, CFASecond quarter revenue rose 5% at AB InBev, aided by the acquisition of SABMiller. Volume was up 1% and price/mix accounted for 4%. As in the first quarter, the primary drivers were Europe and Latin America South, up 24% and 29%,  respectively. South Africa, Western Europe, China, and Argentina were particularly strong. North America was just slightly positive. However, U.S. revenue fell 0.2%, as the company lost roughly 105 basis points of market share. That includes 40 bps for Budweiser and 90 bps for Bud Light, as their market shares continue to erode consistently. Operating margins rose by nearly 200 basis points, reflecting synergies form the SABMiller deal and disciplined cost management. AB InBev achieved synergies of $335 million in the second quarter, and eventually expects to realize synergies of $2.8 billion. North America and Asia Pacific were the two regions with the biggest improvements in margins. The revenue growth and margin expansion should yield significantly higher EBITDA in 2017.  But given the massive increase in debt from the SABMiller deal, leverage is still quite high at 5.6x.



Royal Dutch Shell 07-27 16:32 GMT (Comment) Royal Dutch Shell reported above-consensus earnings for Q2, with higher earnings in its...Earnings by Philip C. Adams, CFARoyal Dutch Shell reported above-consensus earnings for Q2, with higher earnings in its downstream and integrated gas operations, and lower losses from the upstream segment. The headlines are trumpeting strong cash flow in the quarter but by our calculation, excluding $2.3 billion of working capital liquidation in the quarter, Shell's consolidated Free Cash Flow was about $100 million. Shell also received $1.1 billion from the sale of JVs and associates (primarily cash received in the dissolution of the Motive JV with Saudi Refining Inc.) All told, cash increased $4.4 billion in the quarter and nearly $4.9 billion YTD, to just shy of $24 billion. Shell's total debt was $90.3 billion, with net debt of $66.4 billion 25.3% of adjusted capitalization, versus 27.2% at the end of Q1 and 28.1% a year ago. Shell is calling for oil prices to slowly rise, but is also saying "lower forever", calling for peak liquids demand in the early 2030s, about ten years earlier than the rest of the industry. Hence Shell's pivot towards natural gas and renewable (wind) energy, with less investment in oil wells (and declining production, with overall production of 3,495 mboed flat versus a year ago, and down about 7% sequentially.) Other highlights include guidance that Shell will complete its $30 billion asset divestiture target well before the original target of YE2018 ($4 billion currently teed up), with a "normal" program of $5-10 billion of annual disposals thereafter. More in an upcoming full report.

Intel 07-28 19:22 GMT (Comment) Intel's second quarter revenue surged 9%, or 14% when adjusting for the sale of its security operations...Earnings by Dave Novosel, CFAIntel's second quarter revenue surged 9%, or 14% when adjusting for the sale of its security operations (MacAfee), early in the quarter. Client Computing Group revenue was up an amazing 12%, attributable mostly to an 8% increase in average selling prices. Management pointed to strength in the gaming segment and a strong Core mix. Admittedly, the comp was not so difficult since last year revenue in this segment dropped 2%. Data Center revenue rose 9% while Memory Solutions revenue rocketed 58%. In response to the strong revenue growth, its improved outlook for the PC business and the expectation for an earlier close of the Mobileye transaction, management raised its guidance for full year revenue by $1.3 billion. The revision was notable in that although the PC market is still shrinking, and primary competitor Advance Micro Devices posted excellent results earlier in the week, Intel is still generating impressive growth. Last year's operating income was horrible so the comparisons are not meaningful, but margins were better than the first quarter. Margins are being constrained by the losses in the Memory Solutions segment, or they would be even better. Intel added $6.6 billion of debt in Q2. So even though EBITDA should be significantly higher this year because of much better revenue and improved margins, leverage is likely to climb to 1.4x versus 1.3x at the end of 2016. The debt was likely added in anticipation of the Mobileye acquisition, which is now slated to close in Q3. The remainder will be funded with offshore cash, equivalents, and marketable securities.



Expedia, Inc. 07-28 16:38 GMT (Comment) Second quarter revenue soared 18% at Expedia, with trivago (+63%) and HomeAway (+31%) leading...Earnings by Dave Novosel, CFASecond quarter revenue soared 18% at Expedia, with trivago (+63%) and HomeAway (+31%) leading the way. Core OTA, by far its largest segment, posted a 13% increase in revenue. Egencia, easily the smallest segment, saw an 8% increase in revenue. Revenue was boosted by a 21% increase in room nights stayed, which more than offset the 4% decline in revenue per room night. EBITDA margins declined 30 basis points. Margins in the Core OTA and Egencia segments were relatively flat, but margins were considerably lower in the HomeAway and trivago units. The overall decrease was due mostly to higher marketing expenses. The aggressive marketing spending will likely run through the rest of the year, putting some pressure on margins. But given the explosive topline growth, the spending is certainly worthwhile. As usual, free cash flow was outstanding in Q2, and EXPE is on track to generate more than $800 million this year. We estimate that share repurchases will be a little more than $250 million, while the company has spent $138 million on acquisitions through the first half. EXPE also announced it is making a $350 million minority investment in Traveloka, the leading online travel company in Indonesia.



Philip Morris International 07-28 16:36 GMT (Comment) Tobacco stocks plunged but then partially recovered after the FDA delivered a...Regulatory Development by Carol Levenson, CFATobacco stocks plunged but then partially recovered after the FDA delivered a bombshell to the industry this morning. The FDA said it will pursue lowering nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive levels, in a multi-year plan starting with public dialogue. The first step will be the issuance of an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to seek input on the public health benefits and possible adverse effects of lower nicotine in cigarettes. We envision a full court press by the cigarette industry in opposition as well as difficulty in agreeing upon a scientific definition of addiction-causing levels of nicotine. But clearly companies such as Altria and Philip Morris International are ahead of the game with their advance work with risk reduction products (RRPs) such as the IQOS heat-not-burn system as well as e-cigarettes. As we noted in a recent report, RRPs already represent nearly 10% of PM's revenues. Both companies (but especially Altria) also benefit to some degree from diversification of products sold besides combustible cigarettes. For now PM also benefits from its international base, but eventually if the FDA initiative takes hold here, we imagine it will be adopted abroad as well. We are not here to debate the public health aspects of the initiative. But we don't see cigarette smoking going away or the industry disappearing. Given the likely protracted time until implementation (if any), and the progress thus far in RRPs, we don't see this development as a near-term threat to credit quality for either PM or Altria.

Telefonica 07-28 13:30 GMT (Comment) After posting two consecutive slight declines in organic revenue growth in Q2/Q3 of 2016, Telefonica...Earnings by Dave Novosel, CFAAfter posting two consecutive slight declines in organic revenue growth in Q2/Q3 of 2016, Telefonica has now recorded three straight quarters of organic growth, including 3.1% in the second quarter. Reported revenue rose 1.9%, with mobile data the key driver. Latin America led the way with organic growth of more than 15%, while Brail was up 1.8%, and Spain was down 0.8%.Management raised its guidance for full-year revenue growth to more than 1.5% versus its previous target of stable. It forecast a 100 basis point improvement in margins Operating margins increased by 150 basis points in Q2, attributable to lower salaries, reduced network expenses, and contained content spending.  The increase in revenue and higher margins should result in better EBITDA, While leverage is falling, at 4.0x it is still higher than most of its peers in the telecom space. Potential IPOs of its Argentina and Colombia operations could generate some cash to slash debt further.



Comcast Corporation 07-28 12:13 GMT (Comment) Comcast continues to offer a rare blend of explosive revenue growth, expanding margins,...Earnings by Dave Novosel, CFAComcast continues to offer a rare blend of explosive revenue growth, expanding margins, improving free cash flow, and low leverage. Second quarter revenue soared almost 10%, following a gain of 9% in Q1. On the cable side, revenue was up over 5%, led by a 9% increase in high-speed Internet and a 13% increase in Business Services. Comcast added 175K high-speed Internet subs, but lost 34K video subs. Despite the significant jump in programming expenses, margins fell only 10 basis points, as the company slashed support and service costs by reducing customer calls. On the NBCUniversal side, revenue surged more than 17%. Film revenue rose nearly 60%, reflecting the box office success of the latest Fast and Furious installment. Theme parks increased close to 16% due to higher attendance and more per capita spending. Broadcast TV and Cable Networks each rose 5%, aided by higher retransmission fees and contractual rate increases. Management noted that NBC did very well in the recently concluded upfront negotiations with volume up about 8%. It also said that it was not a case of pulling demand forward. Margins in the NBCUniversal segment improved by 110 basis points, including a huge increase in Film, a substantial increase in Cable, and modest increase in Theme Parks and Broadcast TV. Margins would have increased even more if not for the lower EBITDA in the Headquarters & Other unit. Based on the first half trends, Comcast is set to produce free cash flow in excess of $8 billion, while share repurchases would be just under $5 billion. Spending on acquisitions has totaled $2.7 billion in the first two quarters. The company has added more than $2 billion of debt in 2017, but the better EBITDA should allow leverage to fall to 2.2x by year-end. Extracting acquisition strategy from management on conference calls is always difficult, but we came away with the impression that Comcast really does not see the need for a deal, particularly with respect to wireless.

Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold 07-27 19:32 GMT (Comment) Freeport-McMoRan's (FCX) second quarter adjusted EBITDA was up nicely...Earnings by Evan Mann, CFAFreeport-McMoRan's (FCX) second quarter adjusted EBITDA was up nicely year over year on higher realized copper pricing and was consistent with the consensus forecast.  Overall, however, second quarter copper and gold volumes were 3% and 2% below FCX's April guidance as worker absenteeism hampered mining and milling rates in Indonesia while unit cash costs were in line with guidance.  For the LTM, leverage was 2.9x (2.0x net), improvement from 6.5x and 3.3x (2.4x net) at 2016 year-end, and LTM free cash flow was to $2.2 billion.  Net debt of $10.7 billion was down $1.1 billion year to date and down $9.5 billion from $20 billion at the end of 2015, consistent with the company's stated objective of reducing debt by $5-10 billion by the end of 2017.  The company noted discussions with the Government of Indonesia are active with the government appearing more serious about reaching a near-term resolution and FCX believes an agreement could be reached by the self-imposed October deadline.  We will update our projections and review our rating shortly.



Anheuser-Busch Inbev 07-27 19:00 GMT (Comment) Second quarter revenue rose 5% at AB InBev, aided by the acquisition of SABMiller...Earnings by Dave Novosel, CFASecond quarter revenue rose 5% at AB InBev, aided by the acquisition of SABMiller. Volume was up 1% and price/mix accounted for 4%. As in the first quarter, the primary drivers were Europe and Latin America South, up 24% and 29%,  respectively. South Africa, Western Europe, China, and Argentina were particularly strong. North America was just slightly positive. However, U.S. revenue fell 0.2%, as the company lost roughly 105 basis points of market share. That includes 40 bps for Budweiser and 90 bps for Bud Light, as their market shares continue to erode consistently. Operating margins rose by nearly 200 basis points, reflecting synergies form the SABMiller deal and disciplined cost management. AB InBev achieved synergies of $335 million in the second quarter, and eventually expects to realize synergies of $2.8 billion. North America and Asia Pacific were the two regions with the biggest improvements in margins. The revenue growth and margin expansion should yield significantly higher EBITDA in 2017.  But given the massive increase in debt from the SABMiller deal, leverage is still quite high at 5.6x.



Royal Dutch Shell 07-27 16:32 GMT (Comment) Royal Dutch Shell reported above-consensus earnings for Q2, with higher earnings in its...Earnings by Philip C. Adams, CFARoyal Dutch Shell reported above-consensus earnings for Q2, with higher earnings in its downstream and integrated gas operations, and lower losses from the upstream segment. The headlines are trumpeting strong cash flow in the quarter but by our calculation, excluding $2.3 billion of working capital liquidation in the quarter, Shell's consolidated Free Cash Flow was about $100 million. Shell also received $1.1 billion from the sale of JVs and associates (primarily cash received in the dissolution of the Motive JV with Saudi Refining Inc.) All told, cash increased $4.4 billion in the quarter and nearly $4.9 billion YTD, to just shy of $24 billion. Shell's total debt was $90.3 billion, with net debt of $66.4 billion 25.3% of adjusted capitalization, versus 27.2% at the end of Q1 and 28.1% a year ago. Shell is calling for oil prices to slowly rise, but is also saying "lower forever", calling for peak liquids demand in the early 2030s, about ten years earlier than the rest of the industry. Hence Shell's pivot towards natural gas and renewable (wind) energy, with less investment in oil wells (and declining production, with overall production of 3,495 mboed flat versus a year ago, and down about 7% sequentially.) Other highlights include guidance that Shell will complete its $30 billion asset divestiture target well before the original target of YE2018 ($4 billion currently teed up), with a "normal" program of $5-10 billion of annual disposals thereafter. More in an upcoming full report.
