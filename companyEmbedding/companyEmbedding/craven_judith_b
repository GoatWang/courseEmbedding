Judith B. Craven

Served as President of the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast

Dr. Craven earned a B.S. degree in Biology and English from Bowling Green State University, then completed premedical requirements at Texas Southern University before earning a Doctor of Medicine from Baylor College of Medicine and a Master of Public Health from the University of Texas School of Public Health. She also completed the Harvard University Program for Senior Managers in Government at the John F. Kennedy School of Government. Dr. Craven provides a unique viewpoint on Sysco’s Board as a medical doctor and distinguished public health expert. She gained a distinctive understanding of the foodservice industry after serving as Director of Public Health for the City of Houston from 1980 through 1983, which included responsibility for the regulation of all foodservice establishments in the City of Houston, including an emphasis on food safety and food handling. Following this appointment, Dr. Craven served as Dean of the University of Texas School of Allied Health Sciences from 1983 to 1992. She also serves on the Board of Directors of Luby’s, Inc., which operates almost 100 restaurants and provides food services to select hospital and other medical institutions in Texas. Dr. Craven also has a strong commitment to diversity and social responsibility, having led many initiatives to help increase and incorporate diversity in schools, the workplace and the community. Dr. Craven served as Vice President for Multicultural Affairs for the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston from 1987 to 1992, and served as Chair of the Committee on Diversity for the University of Texas Board of Regents for six years. Under Dr. Craven’s leadership as president for six years, The United Way of The Texas Gulf Coast won the first National Award for diversity from the United Way of America. She has also served as a member of the Board of Directors of Compaq Corporation and the Houston Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Dr. Craven has received numerous awards and honors, including the NAACP VIP Award for Community Service, Houston’s Thirty Most Influential Black Women Award and induction into the Texas Women’s Hall of Fame in 1989.

Title: 
               Company: Odx
Job Details
               ODX is the only conference for directors only. ODX, a Financial Times event, puts you in a room full of your peers where everyone is comfortable speaking candidly about the most pressing issues of the day. Our panels are led by winners of the prestigious Outstanding Directors award, sitting CEOs, and experts from Columbia Business School who share practical solutions and create an open forum for dialogue. Without exception, every ODX session is driven by questions from you and all discussions are off-the-record. No one sells, no one lectures, and a small group size fosters interaction. This unique format creates the power of ODX. The ODX conference series is produced by Money-Media - a Financial Times company. Money-Media also publishes the popular corporate governance newsletter Agenda. The content for ODX is produced in partnership with Columbia Business School. ODX is an ISS accredited director education program. Attendance at ODX will increase the Corporate Governance Quotient (CGQ) of your board(s).
