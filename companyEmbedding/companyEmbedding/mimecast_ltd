About Us









Your organization runs on email.
It’s the main way you communicate internally and externally and you rely on it being available all day, every day. It’s a gateway to other critical IT systems and home to a treasure trove of corporate information your employees value.
For all it offers, email needs to be protected and managed or it risks exposing your organization and your data to attack. Your customers and your supply chain are far too valuable to take that chance. It also needs to be effectively archived to meet growing compliance, e-discovery and legal obligations.









Mimecast is making email safer for business.
Mimecast’s security, archiving and continuity cloud services protect business email and deliver comprehensive email risk management in one fully-integrated subscription service.
Mimecast reduces the risk, complexity and cost traditionally associated with protecting email. You no longer have to manage an array of disjointed point solutions from multiple vendors. And you mitigate single vendor exposure if you have moved your primary email server to the cloud with services like Microsoft Office 365.
Our best-of-breed services protect the email of over 24,900 customers and millions of users worldwide against targeted attacks, data leaks, malware and spam. We give employees fast and secure access to sensitive business information, and ensure email keeps running in the event of a primary service outage.

            Mimecast Services for Office 365
        

            Best-in-breed security, archiving and continuity services – designed for the cloud and Office 365
        









 

The lower overhead, predictable costs and simplicity of Office 365 seems attractive. But for all its strengths, Office 365 as a single provider cannot fully replace the additional security protection, data loss avoidance and up-time assurance provided by essential add-ons to on-premises email systems.

Mimecast’s integrated suite of cloud services provides email risk mitigation for Office 365 – bridging the gap between single vendor and best-of-breed. Mimecast products provide defense in depth against targeted threats, strengthen data integrity and provide disaster recovery in the event of a Microsoft infrastructure outage.













Mimecast Services for Office 365 provide:

Mimecast S1 provides comprehensive security coverage with multi-layered, multi-vendor protection, including defense against whaling, spear-phishing and advanced persistent threats
Mimecast A1 gives mailbox level compliant archiving for an independent, verifiable backup of email data that supports legal hold, e-discovery and recovery
Mimecast C1 monitors Office 365 mail flow, provides alerts and gives one click response for uninterrupted employee email access via Outlook for Windows, Mac, mobile apps and a web portal
Integrated service bundles M2 and M2A for improved Office 365 security and cyber resiliency
Faster migration from on-premises systems like Exchange with cloud mailbox archiving and message routing


Other services for Office 365 include:

Email Security Gateway | Mimecast








































































            Email Security Gateway 
        

            Protect the organization with comprehensive, multi-layered email security and content controls
        









 

Mimecast Secure Email Gateway uses sophisticated, multi-layered detection engines and intelligence to protect email data and employees from malware, spam, phishing, and targeted attacks 100% from the cloud.

With over 20,000 customers, Mimecast’s adaptive systems are constantly improving defenses to block both known and unknown threats. Contain spear-phishing attempts by reviewing every URL for threats and make sure spam and malware don’t reach your email system.
The majority of organizations have no solution for preventing data leakage in emails. With Mimecast policies are set centrally so organizations don't risk compliance and policy violations whether in an on-premises, cloud or hybrid email environment.













The Mimecast secure email gateway provides:

Better security and system performance with the ability to stop known and advanced email threats before they reach your network.
A single cloud platform with threat intelligence that updates instantly and extends easily to control sensitive data.
Ultimate administrator visibility and control to rapidly and consistently apply policies across the organization.

 












Gateway Services Provide:
Mimecast Secure Email Gateway excels at protecting your network from known risks and advanced threats, and applying security controls to information flowing into and out of the organization.

Be protected with 99% anti-spam with 0.0001% false positives, 100% anti-malware including zero-hour protection and 100% availability SLA.
Specially handle graymail such as mailing lists and newsletters for easy filing and decluttering inboxes.
Minimize spam disruption and protect infrastructure from DDOS.
Gain flexibility with two modes of operation.

Retention Mode – Enable valuable capabilities and services including Track and Trace, Secure Messaging, Large File Send and Content Control.
Zero Retention - Eliminate legal and privacy concerns about your company's email gateway without being stored beyond delivery.

Improve employee productivity and cut help desk calls with end user self-service to manage blocked and permitted senders.
Support mail validation such as DKIM.












Central Administrative Control for all security policies:
Global and finely-tuned policies are easy to set with Mimecast’s integrated Secure Email Gateway. Our advanced Message Transfer Agent (MTA) tools in the cloud provide a level of control that administrators need.

Easily handle challenges such as flexible inbound routing and traffic-splitting, without adding infrastructure.
Route email using Active Directory group membership or attributes for ultimate flexibility.
Manage email address or domain changes as simple policy settings in a central console so you can change it once and for all.
Get the ability to rewrite addresses inbound and outbound for complex, multi domain environments.

To put the conclusions and observations in context, the following is reorganized, edited and summarized from the full S-1 referenced above.
BusinessMIME is a leading provider of next generation cloud security and risk management services for corporate information and email. Its fully-integrated suite of proprietary cloud services protects customers of all sizes from the significant business and data security risks to which their email system exposes them.
Market opportunityThe growing need of organizations to mitigate the risks of email and data security, continuity and archiving has already established a significant industry beyond the mail server.

Based on recent Gartner reports, combined spending in markets catering to enterprise information and email security, continuity and archiving, which include Secure Email Gateway, Backup and Recovery Software, E-Discovery Software and Data Loss Prevention, was $9.4 billion in 2014 and will grow to $11.6 billion in 2017.
MIME believes there is a considerable need for a comprehensive integrated cloud solution that can address the needs of customers in these markets.
Protects & manages emailMIME protects customers from today's rapidly changing threat landscape where email has become a powerful attack vector and data leak concern.
MIME also mitigates the significant business disruption that email failure or downtime causes. In addition, MIME's archiving services secure, store and manage critical corporate communications and information to address growing compliance and e-discovery requirements and enable customers to use this increasing archive of information to improve employee productivity.
Email is a critical tool for organizations of all sizes. Protecting and managing email has become more complicated due to expanding security and compliance requirements and the rapid increase in both the volume and the importance of the information transmitted via email. Organizations are increasingly at risk from security breaches of sensitive data as sophisticated email-based attacks or data leaks have become more common.
Additionally, organizations are not just using email for communication, they are also increasing their use of email archives as an active repository of vital corporate information needed to meet compliance requirements and support employee productivity. As a result, email represents one of the highest concentrations of business risk that organizations may face.
Traditional approaches to addressing these risks have left customers managing disparate point products from multiple vendors that are often hard to use, costly to manage, difficult to scale, can fail to fully address today's increasing and rapidly changing threats, and limit the use of corporate information to enhance productivity. These approaches also suffer from inefficient over-provisioning because of the need to resource for occasional peak demand.

The resulting infrastructure complexity caused by disparate products and legacy architectures also makes it difficult to move more IT workloads to the cloud, which continues to be an increasing priority of organizations of all sizes.
Proprietary cloud architectureMIME developed its proprietary cloud architecture to offer customers comprehensive email security, continuity and archiving capabilities in a single service that makes it easier for them to protect themselves effectively in a worsening and rapidly changing security and risk environment.
Providing a fully-integrated service also simplifies ongoing management and service deployment. Customers can then decommission the often costly and complex point products and on-premises technology they have traditionally used to tackle these risks. MIME also makes it easier for customers to move more of their IT workloads to the cloud.
Intellectual propertyAs of September 30, 2015, MIME had one patent and 13 patent applications in the United States.
MIME also has one patent issued and five applications pending for examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and four pending Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications, all of which are counterparts of its U.S. applications. The company intends to pursue additional patent protection to the extent that it believes it would be beneficial and cost effective.
MIME has registered "Mimecast" and certain other marks as trademarks in the United States and several other jurisdictions. It also has a number of registered and unregistered trademarks in the United States and certain other jurisdictions, and will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent it believes it would be beneficial and cost effective.
MIME is the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include "mimecast.com," "mimecast.co.uk," "mimecast.co.za," and similar variations.
CompetitionMIME's current and potential future competitors include: Barracuda Networks, Inc. (NYSE:CUDA), Google Postini, Microsoft Exchange Server, Exchange Online Protection, Proofpoint, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFPT) and Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC), in security, MessageOne, in continuity, and Barracuda, HP Autonomy, Microsoft Office 365, Proofpoint and Symantec in archiving.

Other executives include Mimecast Chief Scientist Nathaniel Borenstein, who was amongst the original designers of the MIME protocol for formatting multimedia Internet electronic mail - he sent the world's first e-mail attachment on 11 March 1992.[9]
Technology[edit]
The service uses a massively-parallel grid infrastructure for email storage and processing[10] through geographically dispersed data centers,[11] enabling it to offer a 100% uptime service level agreement on all services.[12] Its Mail Transfer Agent provides intelligent email routing based on server or user mailbox location.[13]
