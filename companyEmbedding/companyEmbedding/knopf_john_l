 Advances in Consumer Research Volume 6, 1979       Pages 174-179 QUESTIONING THE CONCEPT OF INVOLVEMENT DEFINED PRODUCT CLASSES John L. Lastovicka, Temple University ABSTRACT -  Homogeneity of consumer acquisition behavior is examined within a set of  diverse product classes. The degree to which different levels of involvement are related  to levels of acquisition behavior is examined. INTRODUCTION Low involvement theorists (e.g., Krugman, 1965; Ray et al, 1973; and  Robertson, 1976) suggest that much of the complexity inherent in studying consumer  behavior is due to the broad assortment of products acquired and used by consumers.  Accordingly, low involvement theory has categorized product classes and suggested  different types of purchase behavior in each product category. In one category are the so  called "low involvement product classes." Descriptions of typical purchase  behavior for this product category have been different from those as described by the  traditional consumer behavior models. Frequently purchased, commodity-like goods such as toothpaste or canned  peas are examples of what have become referred to as low involvement product classes.  Following Lastovicka and Gardner (1978), a low involvement product class is one in which  most consumers perceive little linkage to their important values and is a product class  where there is little consumer commitment to the brands. Less frequently purchased, and  more brand differentiated product classes, such as automobiles or stereo equipment are  often given examples of high involvement product classes. More direct linkage to personal  values and more commitment to brands have been assumed in these latter product classes. Please note that an involvement defined product classification system is consumer  and not product defined. That is, a particular good's inclusion in the low  involvement group is not determined by any objective characteristics of the good itself -  as in Aspinwall's (1961) "color theory'' product classification system. Rather,  homogeneous consumer perceptions and behaviors are what determine a particular good's  involvement classification. Low involvement theorists have used the involvement concept as the key  variable in explaining differences in behavior across different product classes. In  purchasing brands in low involvement product classes, buyer behavior is assumed to be passive,  re-active instead of active problem solving. Kassarjian (1978a, 1978b) has  suggested that Skinner's (1972) behavioral modification approach may be more than enough  to explain brand choice in low involvement product classes. The cognitively based  traditional models of brand choice behavior are felt to be most appropriate in the high  involvement product classes. THE RESEARCH QUESTION The present study is an attempt to question the notion of an involvement  based product classification scheme. Two criteria were devised to test the classification  system. Criterion One: Generalizability A primary concern is of generalizability. In order for any product  classification system to be useful, products in a like classification must share similar  consumer behavior. Products of different classifications should demonstrate heterogeneity.  The degree of homogeneity within a given involvement classification (e.g., the homogeneity  of behavior with a product in the low involvement classification) is questionable as the  involvement product scheme is consumer defined. Given knowledge of the differences  in individual values, perceptions and behaviors it is likely that same product behavior  may not be similar across individuals. That is, it is possible that products may not be the object of very  similar behavior from individual to individual. If the same product has different meanings  to different consumers, then the power of generalizability has vanished. Only if the same  product is the object of approximately the same behavior across consumers, can  generalizations be made about the product class. One way of increasing the power of generalizability of the involvement  product classification system is to better specify what is being classified. Following  Belk (1975), it is recognized that one way to more clearly specify a stimulus is to  consider the object-in-situation stimulus. Accordingly, products-in-consumption situations  would seem to be a better point of classification than products alone. Criterion Two: Identification In order for involvement classification system to be useful, not only must  there be homogeneity of behavior ac-cross consumers within products-in-situations, but  there must be a basis for believing that involvement is the key explanatory variable for  the assumed differences in behavior. Identification of the key variable in the  classification system is imperative. If involvement is not a key variable, then the  terms high involvement product class and low involvement product class are misnomers. This identification problem severely weakens the power of the involvement  classification system. This is especially true in the case when variables, other than  involvement, can be used to explain phenomena that involvement supposedly explains. For example, Hupfer and Gardner (1971) have measured a great disparity  between automobiles and toothpaste on an involvement scale. But is it primarily  involvement which is responsible for the greater degree of thought and consideration  expected to go into an automobile purchase relative to a toothpaste purchase? An equally  plausible explanation would rely upon learning or familiarity. With more time between  automobile purchase, more consideration should go into such a choice decision since  consumers are more likely to forget much of their prior make and model evaluations since  ,the last choice. Moreover, even if memory decay was minimal, market structure - in terms  of the makes and models of automobiles available - may have changed considerably since the  last purchase. With the toothpaste purchase, less pre-purchase consideration can be  explained by greater reliance on the last purchase experience due to increased recency.  For this automobile-toothpaste example, the distinction between a reliance on prior  learning and re-learning seems as palatable as a distinction based on involvement. This  suggests that at least familiarity, a competing key variable, must be tested against  involvement. RESEARCH DESIGN Sample During Spring 1978, a systematic sample (Sudman, 1976) of 334 operating  household phone numbers was drawn from the Philadelphia Telephone directory. Using a  procedure described by Jolson (1977), the telephone subscribers drawn were phoned and a  request was made to mail a questionnaire. Permission to mail the questionnaire was not  obtained from 76 individuals. From the 258 remaining, 143 useable completed questionnaires  were returned. This 143 represents a 43% response rate from the initial sample of 334 and  a 55% response rate from those mailed the questionnaire. Measurement Low involvement theorists have drawn a sharp contrast in their  descriptions of buyer behavior in low involvement and high involvement product classes.  For high involvement goods the buyer is characterized as an active problem solver and an  information seeker. In contrast, for low involvement products the buyer is seen as a  creature of habitual routine. In Howard and Sheth's (1969) terms, the high involvement  buyer engages in extensive problem solving while the low involvement buyer engages in  routinized response behavior. Behavior for seven different current or possible future purchase decisions  was measured using the extensive problem solving -- routinized problem solving dichotomy.  The Appendix shows how the two types of behavior were operationalized in the mail  questionnaire. Consumer H, in the appendix, was described as engaged in extensive problem  solving while Consumer M was described as a routinized problem solver. Respondents were  asked to indicate to what degree they would be like H or M for each of seven purchases.  The degree of extensive-routinized response behavior was measured on the following  continuum of acquisition behavior: DIAGRAM These responses were coded on a 1-5 scale where "very much like  H" was set to 1 and "very much like M" set to 5. The seven product - in - consumption behavior situations were:  (1) A bottle of wine as a gift for a friend. (2) A bottle of wine to be consumed by myself or family    at home. (3) An automobile for personal use. (4) Toothpaste for my personal use at home. (5) A loaf of bread to be used by myself or family at    home. (6) Lightbulbs for use at home. (7) A high-fidelity stereo sound system for use at home.  Prior research (Hupfer and Gardner, 1971; Lastovicka and Gardner, 1978;  and Belk, 1976) suggest that (1), (3), and (7) are in the high involvement domain while  (2), (4), (5) and (6) are in the low involvement domain. Each respondent's own level of involvement and familiarity for each  of the six product classes represented in (1) - (7) was measured with four additional  questions. Each of these questions consisted of an item using a 1-5 Disagree-Agree scale.  Following Lastovicka and Gardner (1978) involvement is seen as having two components:  normative importance and commitment. Normative importance is based on Rokeach's (1975,  1969) value system and the degree to which a product is linked to important values. It was  measured with:  "I rate this product as being of the highest importance to me    personally."  Commitment is based upon Kiesler's (1971) notion of the bonding or  pledging of an individual to a particular choice object. It was measured with this item:  "If my preferred brand or make and model was not available at the    store or dealership, it would make little difference to me if I had to choose another    brand in this general group of products."  Knowledge about the product class was measured with:  "I think that I could talk about this general group of products for a    long time;"  while remembered personal experience with the product class was measured  with:  "I can remember having purchased something in this general group of    products."  Convergent and divergent validity for the first three items of the four  presented above is presented by Lastovicka and Gardner (1978). Measures were also taken to classify the respondents by sex, marital  status, occupation, age and income. ANALYSIS Generalizability Using a repeated measures two factor mixed analysis of variance model  (Winer, 1971), the criterion of generalizability was tested. The model examined the  influence of individual differences and product-situation combinations on one dependent  measure (the response on the 1-5 extensive problem solving -- routinized problem solving  scale). The intent of using analysis of variance (ANOVA) was twofold. First, it  was used to construct estimates of the relative source contributions in the ANOVA model to  variance in the dependent measure. Of prime concern was the relative contribution, due to  products-situations versus individual differences, on acquisition behavior. Second, ANOVA  was used to assess the significance of a contrast between the three product-situations  assumed in the high involvement realm and the four product-situations assumed in the low  involvement realm. Using ANOVA in the first manner required stipulating the expected mean  squares and the solutions for the estimate of variance components (Winer, 1971; Kirk,  1968). The expected mean squares and the estimates of variance components are shown in  Table 1. Since repeated measures within each product-situation treatment were not  taken, it is impossible to separate the error component, EQUATION,  from a potential interaction component, EQUATION. Seeking a  simple model, the results presented assume that the interaction component,  EQUATION, is zero. TABLE 1 E(MS) AND ESTIMATES OF VARIANCE COMPONENTS FOR ANOVA MODEL TABLE 2 RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF VARIANCE The results in Table 2 suggest that the products - in - situations do  slightly dominate over individual differences in contributing to explained variance. A  reasonable interpretation is that differences in acquisition behavior are due primarily to  differences in products and how they are to be used and, secondly, to differences between  people. Although a large share of the variance, 20.32%, is accounted for by the  product-in-consumption-situation notion, a disturbingly large proportion of the variance,  62.35%, is left unaccounted for. This suggests the presence of an interaction component. Scheffe's multiple comparison test was used to test the difference in mean  levels in acquisition behavior between the three so-called high involvement and the four  low involvement products-in-situations. The mean level for the former group, 2.02, was  significantly lower than the mean for the latter group, 3.10, (p < .05). This suggests  that average claimed acquisition behavior with the group consisting of automobile for  personal use, wine for gift and stereo for personal use can be best described as  "somewhat like" extensive problem solving behavior. For the group consisting of  light bulbs for use at home, bread for use by self or family, toothpaste for personal use,  and wine for family or self consumption, a description of "like both" extensive  and routinized acquisition behavior is appropriate. Figure 1 is a visual aid in analyzing homogeneity. Figure 1 presents, for  each purchase decision, the percentage of the 143 subjects who checked either the 4 or 5  point on the scale (indicating extensive problem solving) versus the mean value of each  purchase decision on the same scale. This reinforces the notion that not only are there  overall differences in acquisition behavior between purchase decisions, but that the  behavior for each type of decision is relatively homogeneous. FIGURE 1 EXTENT OF HOMOGENEITY OF ACQUISITION BEHAVIOR FOR SEVEN  PRODUCTS-SITUATIONS Identification So far, seven different products - in - consumption situations have been  demonstrated to exhibit different types of acquisition behavior. Furthermore, within  products this acquisition behavior is relatively homogeneous ac-cross people. The degree  to which involvement is the key explanatory variable for these behaviors, must still be  tested. The influence of the two components of involvement, the measures of  knowledge and prior experience, as well as a set of demographic measures were used in a  multiple regression model to explain the dependent variable of the 5 point scale measure  of extensive-routinized response behavior. Since the ANOVA suggests that the respondents  were relatively homogeneous in behavior within a product class and heterogeneous across  products, there was some justification to consider the data base as consisting of 858 (6  products-personal-use situations X 143 respondents) independent data cases. That is each  respondent supplied 6 data cases, one for each product - personal use purchase,  into the data matrix used in the multiple regression analysis. The multiple regression  model used was:  X1 = B2X2 +B3X3 + B4X4  +B5X5 + B6X6 + B7X7 + B8X8  + B9X9 + B10X10 + B11X11  + B12X12 + B13X13 + B14X14  + B15X15 + B16X16 + B17X17  + e   (1)   X1 = degree of extensive-routinized problem solving claimed for a given      product for personal use (the higher the value on the 1-5 scale, the more routinized). X2 = degree of knowledge about the same given product (the higher the      value, the more knowledgeable). X3 = perception of the normative importance of the same given product      (the higher the value, the greater the importance). X4 = purchase experience with the same given product (the higher the      value, the greater the experience). X5 = non-commitment to brands in the same given product class (tl~e      higher the value, the less committed) X6 = dummy variable indicating sex (0 = male, 1 = female). X7 = dummy variable for single or never married marital state. X8 = dummy variable for married marital state X9 = dummy variable for divorced or separated marital state. X10 = dummy variable for professional occupation. Xl1 = dummy variable for white collar occupation. X12 = dummy variable for blue collar occupation. X13 = dummy variable for housewife occupation. X14 = dummy variable for student occupation. X15 = dummy variable for retired. X16 = age in years. X17 = income range (1=$5,000 or less,  2=5,000-10,000,  3=10,000-15,000,  4=15,000-20,000,        5=20,000-25,000,  6=25,000 or more)   As a quick review, the variables on the right side of the equation are  expected to be related to the dependent measure as follows:   1. Low Involvement Theory Suggests: a negative relationship between      normative importance and routinized behavior; and a positive relationship between      non-commitment and routinized behavior. 2. Learning and Familiarity Explanations Suggest: a positive      relationship between both knowledge and experience and routinized behavior. 3. Other Explanations of Acquisition Behavior Suggest: a positive      relationship between age and routinized-like behavior (Hempel, 1969); and a negative      relationship between occupational status and routinized-like behavior (Newman and Staelin,      1972). 4. No particular relationships: for sex, marital status, or income      were expected. Since a good deal of acquisition behavior was due to the between people      component in the ANOVA, these additional standard measures of individual differences were      included in an exploratory manner.   Multiple regression analysis was performed on equation (1) for the 680  data cases of the 858 which contained no missing data. The results of this regression  equation are presented in the top half of Table 3. The signs of the beta weights for this  equation are generally as expected, except for the very notable reverse of the sign of the  knowledge weight. The familiarity hypotheses argues that as knowledge increases,  routinized problem solving behavior should increase. The empirical results suggest rather  that as knowledge increases routinized problem solving decreases. Another set of  unexpected results were the significance of the beta weights for the sex, income and  marital state measures. The sex coefficient sign suggests that women are more likely to  engage in routinized problem solving while men are more likely to be more careful shopping  and engage in extensive problem solving. The income beta weight suggests more routinized  behavior for those with higher income. And finally from the net effects of the weights for  the marital dummy variables, one may believe that only the widowed state, the fourth  marital classification, had influence on acquisition behavior. The beta weight for the  retired suggests more routinized behavior for this group. The interpretation about the effects of widowhood suggests that the  effects of the three marital statuses directly modeled in equation (1) - single, married,  divorced or separated - are the same. Using a procedure as shown by Rao and Miller (1971,  p. 145), this was examined by testing the null hypothesis: B7 = B8 = B9. Since the obtained F (3.38 with 2 and 666 df) was less than the critical  value, the null hypothesis stands. Consequently, the only two relevant marital states were  widowed and not widowed. This was modeled with a new dummy variable, X18, representing  widowhood. The independent variables with significant beta weights in equation (1)  were retained and used in a second regression equation of the form: X1 = B2X2 + B3X3 +  B4X4 + B5X5 + B17X17 + B18X18  + e   (2)  The results of this second regression equation are in the lower half of  Table 3. The net effect of the regression results of equation (2) is in general  support of using involvement as a partial identifying key in this behaviorally based  product classification system. First, the direction of relationships between the two  components of involvement, normative importance and commitment, and degree of routinized  problem solving behavior are exactly as expected. The expected direction of relationship  was not, however, obtained with the measure of knowledge. This weakens the power of this  competing explanation. Second, the relative importance of the involvement components as  defined by their contribution to explained variance is high. Table 4 shows that the two  involvement components accounted for 33.10% of the explained variance. Only 10.98% of the  variance is properly explained by familiarity. That is, only experience has the expected  sign and it explains only 10.98%. TABLE 3 RESULTS OF REGRESSION ANALYSES TABLE 4 CONTRIBUTION OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES TO EXPLAINED VARIANCE IN  REGRESSION EQUATION (2) IMPLICATIONS This study suggests that an involvement-based product, really  product-in-consumption situation, classification has more than face validity. Across the  products used in the research, consumers could generally be classified as more or less  active in their acquisition behavior. Further, using correlation-based methods,  involvement was shown to be strongly related to acquisition behavior. The study should also serve as a reminder that consumer acquisition of Low  involvement products is done without, the commonly assumed, meticulous examination of  available brands. Despite the efforts of marketers to differentiate their brands, the lack  of commitment suggests that consumers perceive brands in low involvement classes as near  perfect substitutes. An interesting question arises in considering how consumers arrived at the  stage of less active acquisition behavior with low involvement products. The traditional  consumer behavior models suggest active consumers directly engaging in firsthand extensive  and limited problem solving behavior at earlier points in time. The logic of low  involvement theory offers the alternative explanation of a more passive consumer who at  the point of first purchase is content to rely upon product information that was  indirectly "caught" and not directly sought out. Information could be caught in  several ways. This could include spectator-like observation of the prior purchase  experience of other consumers as well as that information incidentally picked up from  repetitive advertising. Such information "catching" is an alternative to the  more commonly assumed information seeking. This study also calls attention to the need to seriously consider an  involvement product classification system on a segment-by-segment basis. The large  residual variance in the ANOVA reported in the study suggests regularity of behavior, not  so much at total market level, but rather less aggregated level. To the degree that market  segment differences in product involvement can be systematically understood, the  classification system offers more promise. An immediate implication is that no one classification device is a  very satisfactory device for totally accounting for differences in acquisition behavior.  Explained variance is low. If product classification systems are to be of real value they  must be multifaceted. For example, combination of a market structure approach to product  classification (e.g., Aspinwall, 1961) and a behavioral system, similar to what is  examined here would seem to provide a useful point for future research. Since any one  theoretical approach is lacking, the low involvement theorists must be aware of different  explanations of the same phenomena. APPENDIX Two consumers, H and M, live in the same neighborhood in Philadelphia.  Both purchase the same products, but they make up their minds about what to buy in very  different ways. Depending on what is being purchased, you may be like either  Consumer H or Consumer M.  CONSUMER H When going shopping, Consumer H feels that little knowledge can be drawn  from previous shopping. Consumer H feels a lack of knowledge about the different brands or  makes and models that are available in the stores. H is uncertain as to what features  ought to be used in evaluating the different brands. As a result, Consumer H actively looks for information about different  brands as well as ways of evaluating the brands. Very often Consumer H will go out of the  way to get information from trusted friends. Consumer H may also look at advertising for  information. Consumer H actively searches for information about the products on an  extensive basis. H takes the time to learn about the products. Consumer H shops and  compares the different brands.  CONSUMER M Consumer M has the feeling of extensive knowledge when making a purchase.  M knows what the different brands have to offer and, in fact, has fairly strong likes and  dislikes for a few brands. As a result, Consumer M buys with little, if any, real thought. Consumer M  does little searching for information before making a purchase. M typically buys without  having made comparisons between alternative brands. Consumer M feels that past purchasing  experience can be relied upon. REFERENCES Aspinwall, Leo V. Four Marketing theories. Boulder: University of  Colorado, 1961, chapters 3-4. Balk, Russell W.
