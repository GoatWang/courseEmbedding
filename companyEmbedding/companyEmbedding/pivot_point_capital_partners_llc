Pivot Point Capital Partners LLC


                  Pivot Point Capital Partners is a strategic block investment firm that uses a private equity orientation to pubic markets. The firm believes that excellent companies are periodically underpriced due to market over-reactions to current news or misinterpretation of company-specific events. They also believe that the resulting value dislocations are more common and more severe in the small-cap portion of the market. Pivot Point seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation by acquiring positions in small-cap companies at opportunistic valuations. They target companies in which they hold superior insight relative to other investors and play an active role, in a positive relationship with management, to influence portfolio companies to exercise various strategic, operational and financial levers to increase shareholder value.Pivot Point invests across a broad range of industries. The firm seeks to invest in well-positioned companies with defensible competitive advantages and the potential to generate substantial free cash flow. They also look for companies that are led by shareholder-driven management teams that are capable of generating superior performance in all types of market environments.From a financial perspective, Pivot Point targets companies with high returns on invested capital, visible profitability drivers, appropriate debt levels and high earnings growth potential. The firm focuses on a company's cash generation potential, investing in companies that are expected to generate cash flow that is more than sufficient to meet their internal growth requirements.Pivot Point acquires concentrated positions during periods of valuation dislocation where they determine that pricing is at a temporary but substantial discount to intrinsic value. The firm adheres to strict bottom-up diligence criteria focusing on specific market and strategic aspects. Qualitatively, Pivot Point targets companies with management teams that are committed to delivering superior shareholder value and are capable of executing strategies to do so.
