Hidden away off Scenic Hwy you will find Rosaflora Lane with beautiful recently built homes that experience panoramic view of of Escambia Bay. The location, while private, is close to everything - from Scenic Hwy you can reach Downtown Pensacola in minutes and equally close is the airport, malls, Scared Heart Hospital, both Universities and public / private schools. This location is high above the Bay (much well over 20??). There is approximately 60 ft of waterfront with a white sandy beach were you can build your own dock. You could build the house at the level of Scenic Hwy (as several homes have done) that gives dramatic views from high above the Bay or on the lower level that has already been cleared and sodded (where a home was planned) and offers more privacy, intimate views of the Bay and quicker access to the water front. There is water, public sewer / water and gas available. Drive by - enjoy the views and visualize your dream house in this great location. This is a great opportunity to acquire a waterfront lot at an affordable price.
