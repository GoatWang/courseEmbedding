Inclusion Drives Innovation: 4 Pittsburgh Leaders on Inclusion in Tech & Business

Posted on April 14, 2016 by Susanne Mueller 






Too often companies investing heavily in diversity by hiring diversity advocates, come up with mission statements that promise a commitment to diversity, and organize specific events. This is a great first step, but it’s not the last step. How do your plans actually translate into everyday action? How will it change every day routine? Real change often rises from the bottom but in business - the rule is still top down.

Rhiza Capital | Connecting community to local impact investing.

Connecting Community to OpportunityLearn more about investing locally







What


What is Rhiza* Capital?
Rhiza Capital is a joint initiative between Community Futures Sunshine Coast, Sunshine Coast Credit Union and Powell River Community Investment Corporation (PRCIC). These partners are joining forces to raise local capital for investment in ventures that will add economic, social and financial value to our communities. Here is a video introduction to our local, impact investing strategy:

*Rhiza, Greek in origin, refers to a root structure.  Rhiza Capital is intent on growing local economies and healthy communities by connecting root capital to impact ventures.

What is Impact Investing?
Impact investments are investments made into companies, organizations, and funds with the intention to generate social and environmental impact alongside a financial return.
Impact investments can...Impact investments can be made in both emerging and developed markets, and target a range of returns from below market to market rate, depending upon the circumstances. The growing impact investment market provides capital to address the world’s most pressing challenges in sectors such as sustainable agriculture, clean technology, microfinance, and affordable and accessible basic services including housing, healthcare, and education.
What is the market potential of impact investing?
Impact investing has attracted ...Impact investing has attracted increasing interest among investors who are allocating more capital to impact investments year-over-year. What does this mean for the social and environmental good that might be funded by impact investing now and in the future?
Growing Impact Market







How


How is Rhiza Capital Structured?
This collaboration involves interconnected roles being fulfilled by each of the partners. Each is committed to supporting this initiative and building a strong local investment ecosystem.
There are three vehicles to support local investment:
Coastal Venture: Root One {Closed}Rhiza Capital’s Coastal Venture Root One (the “VCC1”), formally incorporated as Sunshine Coast Venture Partners VCC, is a corporation registered for the sole purpose of investing funds in a number of start-up, emerging and expanding eligible small businesses.
VCC1 invests in companies that can offer its investors a 30% fully refundable tax credit. VCC1 is primarily invested in health tech, education tech and social tech companies. See our Where page for the list of VCC1 Companies.
An appropriately investable company is an Eligible Business Corporation (EBC). To whit, an EBC is a business that is resident in BC, primarily employs BC residents (75%+) and falls into one of six sectors: manufacturing, tourism, R&D of tech, digital media, diversification of rural economies, clean tech. Within the Sunshine Coast region, any business that diversifies and strengthens the local economy is a potential Eligible Business Corporation.Coastal Venture: Root Two {Open}Rhiza Capital’s Coastal Venture Root Two (the “VCC2”), is a corporation registered for the sole purpose of investing funds in a number of start-up, emerging and expanding eligible small businesses.  This will be our second portfolio launching early in 2016.  VCC2 will also be comprised of companies that can offer its investors a 30% fully refundable tax credit and is an RRSP eligible investment.Coastal Community Investment Fund {Open}Rhiza Capital’s Coastal Community Investment Fund (the “CIC”) is a for-profit corporation, regulated by the provincial securities laws.
The CIC uses the Private Issuers exemption, limiting its potential investors to 50 or fewer friends, family, close business associates and Accredited Investors.
The key advantage to CIC is that ownership can be multiple or singular, and with various types of share classes, raising as much (or as little) investment capital as it sees fit.
A unique opportunity afforded by the flexible share class structure of CIC is to mitigate risk for investor-shareholders by creating a preferred share class(es) where capital preservation and a preferential dividend can be offered. The other investor-shareholders and/or the sponsor of the fund [Rhiza Capital] take on any excess risk through preferred shares of a more junior class, or vis a vis the common share class.Coast Community Investment Co-op {Open}The Coast Community Investment Co-op was formed to secure capital through the sale of shares in the co-operative, and invest it onward in local social venture.
The Co-op, registered with the provincial government as a for-profit co-operative, identifies, or is approached by, local entrepreneurs with a business opportunity in need of investment.
Members/Shareholders of the Co-op review the business plan and often provide advice about it. They then agree on the best way to assist the business with debt financing (a loan) or equity financing (land, equipment or as co-owners).
Here is a graphic showing our workflow process.
Impact Investing Core Characteristics
The practice of impact investing is defined by the following four core characteristics:
IntentionalityAn investor’s intention to have a positive social or environmental impact through investments is essential to impact investing.
— Global Impact Investing NetworkInvestment with Return ExpectationsImpact investments are expected to generate a financial return on capital or, at minimum, a return of capital.
— Global Impact Investing NetworkRange of Return and Asset ClassesImpact investments target financial returns that range from below market (sometimes called concessionary) to risk-adjusted market rate, and can be made across asset classes, including but not limited to cash equivalents, fixed income, venture capital, and private equity.
— Global Impact Investing NetworkImpact MeasurementA hallmark of impact investing is the commitment of the investor to measure and report the social and environmental performance and progress of underlying investments, ensuring transparency and accountability while informing the practice of impact investing and building the field.
— Global Impact Investing Network

Who is a Social Entrepreneur?
A social entrepreneur is someone who recognizes a social problem and uses entrepreneurial principles to organize, create, and manage a venture to make social change (a social venture).
Whereas traditional entrepreneurs...
Whereas a business entrepreneur typically measures performance in profit and return, a social entrepreneur focuses on creating social capital. Thus, the main aim of social entrepreneurship is to further social and environmental goals. However, whilst social entrepreneurs are most commonly associated with the voluntary and not-for-profit sectors, this need not necessarily be incompatible with making a profit.
— Canadian Social Enterprise Foundation

Change Heroes
ChangeHeroes is a fundraising platform designed to reduce the cost of raising funds for non-profits, access the previously-difficult-to-reach Millennial donor market, and increase the virality of fundraising campaigns. Their model allows a non-profit to white label a campaign using the ChangeHeroes platform, positioning supporters of the non-profit to run individual mini-campaigns that include a personally recorded video and a social media-propogated ask out to 33 friends and family within their close circle of contacts. It hits all the marks of what are recognized as the hallmarks of Millennial giving behaviour. The revenue model includes an initial setup fee per non-profit and a commission on all funds raised.

ChatterHigh
ChatterHigh addresses the the knowledge and communication gap between the post-secondary institutions, trade associations and corporations that need to convey the opportunities available once school-age children (Gr. 6-12) graduate, and the school-age children that need to be informed in order to make effective and empowered choices leading up to graduation. What ChatterHigh has done is built a platform that gamifies the process of researching the options for the future. The revenue model is based on a fee-per-click, charged to the post-secondary institution, when a child clicks on a link to research the answer to a quiz question provided by the same institution.

Cognilab
Cognilab has created an online platform for the development and execution of academic-calibre psychological experimentation. This allows for a significant reduction in costs and execution time, reducing both by 50-90%.  Additional benefits of the system include the ability to make a primary research tool broadly available to undergrad students for the first time, access to remote populations and commercial applications in the arenas of market and political research. Cognilab will own much of the data that is generated using its platform, positioning it to be the single largest repository of date on human cognition…ever. The revenue model is a hybrid of a subscription-based software as a service approach and a per-participant commission for those participants sourced through Cognilab.

Ethelo Decisions
Ethelo Decisions has developed a cloud-based software solution that significantly reduces the cost of stakeholder engagement, while also improving the outcomes, by allowing each participant to variably weigh the value of each variable in the consideration process. Then, Ethelo’s proprietary algorithm calculates both the sum total of all possible variants and the most successful possible outcomes given the participant’s feedback.  The revenue model layers a consultation fee to cover the fixed costs of set up and a software as a service subscription fee for the length of the engagement.

SHM Controls
SHM Controls has developed a technology that allows owners and managers of small to mid-sized apartment buildings to reduce the natural gas costs associated with their boiler-based heating systems by 25-40%. The system utilizes a small control box that is easily installed on any boiler, small wireless sensors throughout the building and a proprietary algorithm to modulate the boiler to achieve maximum efficiency and tenant comfort.  The revenue model is subscription-based software as a service, with no cost of equipment for the client.

ViewsIQ
ViewsIQ has developed advanced digitization technology specific to the work of pathologists and their microscopic analysis of slide-based samples. Largely a software solution, ViewsIQ allows the pathologist to analyze a sample as they would from their own microscope, with the ability to manage magnification, depth of field and focal point, all from their computer at a distance. This allows for potentially lifesaving access to time-sensitive consultations, while also stripping away onerous costs of physical shipping for live samples. The revenue model is split between system sales and the software made available as a subscription service.

Vidigami Media
Vidigami is described as the “home for your school memories”. It provides a single portal where all photos taken by faculty, staff and parents of a given school can be uploaded, and through advanced facial recognition processes, sorted per student. The service is currently targeted towards private and chartered schools, with the revenue model split between a subscription paid by the school and various photo products made available to families.

Wearable Therapeutics
Wearable Therapeutics has developed a therapeutic tool for children with autism. Applying the therapeutic technique known as “deep pressure therapy”, it provides for a significant reduction in physiological stress responses like adrenaline and cortisol production. The product has enjoyed the support of major autism advocates in Canada and the US, academic research papers specific to the impact of the product and the recognition of many Provinces and States as a reimbursable expense for families with children with autism. The revenue model is direct sales.

Kindred Spirit Drums
At Kindred Spirit Drums we are striving to “Create Vitality Through Sound”. Vitality means to be in a state of “Strength, action and energy” which I feel comes with the excitement of playing a Steel Tongue Drum or Handpan. Right now the world is in great need of a resurrection of the unhindered experimentation with music, to return vitality to the people and to help remove the apathy that the modern-world seems to foster in the human psyche.

Social Innovation
Social Innovation is both a destination — the resolution of complex social and environmental challenges — and a journey — devising new approaches that engage all stakeholders, leveraging their competencies and creativity to design novel solutions.
— Tim Broadhead
3 Types of Social Innovators
Disruptive innovatorsDisruptive innovators are inspired by love and motivated by necessity. They challenge the prevailing way of doing things and shake the lethargy off the status quo. They wrestle a big idea to the ground. And yet, even when they prove that the idea works, it does not easily become the new standard. It can be ignored or misunderstood and may even be perceived as a threat to the system. It is not easy to move from the margins to the mainstream. That’s why we need bridging innovators.
— Al EtmanskiBridging innovatorsBridging innovators spot the big ideas surfaced by disruptive innovators. They leverage their connections, reputations and resources to make sure the potential is realized. They translate and interpret the value of a disruptive innovation to the system. Bridging innovators are the necessary link between disruptive innovators and receptive innovators.
— Al EtmanskiReceptive innovatorsReceptive innovators are key to implementing big ideas and spreading solutions far and wide. They have an insider’s knowledge of the key levers to advance an issue within a system. They know the formal and informal channels inside bureaucracy and who the key players are. They are navigators, steering the innovation so that  it may flourish and become the new standard.
— Al Etmanski
