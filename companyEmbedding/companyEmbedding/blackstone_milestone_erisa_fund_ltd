What We Do

Disability Claim Appeals
If your disability claim was denied, or if you received a letter stating
	 that your existing benefits were terminated, ERISA Law Center can help.
	 Do not lose hope in this situation, as in many cases you can file a successful
	 ERISA claim appeal. An appeal gives you the opportunity to overturn the
	 initial decision, and it is a required step under ERISA legal procedure
	 before you can proceed with a lawsuit against your disability insurance company.

Where We Practice



ERISA Attorney
Practicing in Federal Circuit Courts Across the U.S.
Representing disability claimants and life insurance beneficiaries, we
	 at ERISA Law Center handle cases in all U.S. Courts of Appeal. These courts
	 handle cases related to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).
	 ERISA provides legal recourse for employees dealing with denied or terminated
	 disability, health care, life insurance and pension benefits. Depending
	 on where you live and work, or where your employer is based, your case
	 will be heard in an appellate court. This venue and the presiding judge
	 may have more of an impact on your ERISA case than you would think.
ERISA is a federal law and is supposed to be a uniform system of national
	 law. It isn't. While ERISA statutes haven't changed very much
	 since the law was adopted in 1974, courts around the country have interpreted
	 and applied that law differently. Supreme Court decisions on ERISA law
	 are binding everywhere, but decisions by the 12 geographic circuit courts
	 of appeal which have jurisdiction over ERISA cases are controlling only
	 within the jurisdiction of that circuit. In a lot of areas of ERISA law,
	 circuits have adopted different legal standards. Some circuits seem to
	 favor claimants more than others.
What can be drawn from a review of case law from around the country? ERISA
	 law can strongly favor insurance companies and plans. Depending on the
	 factual and legal issues operating in your case, some circuits may offer
	 more favorable treatment than others. What's certain is that it's
	 not as simple as saying one circuit is better than another - it will depend
	 on a number of factors.

Our Lawyer is Experienced in All Circuit Courts

	With the experience of litigating in all circuit courts comes a nuanced
	 perspective about what issues work best where. For instance, the
	Ninth Circuit is not antagonistic to claims of disability based on fibromyalgia and
	 chronic fatigue syndrome. The
	Fourth Circuit has joined that position. The
	Sixth Circuit is very good if you are attacking the credibility of defense doctors. The
	Fifth and
	Tenth Circuits have very clear rules for allowable discovery in the event of
	 a conflict of interest. The
	Seventh Circuit is best if you have "de novo" review. On the other hand, the
	Second Circuit allows insurance companies to introduce new rationales to deny benefits
	 in litigation. The
	Eighth Circuit has rejected arguments that it is improper to demand objective evidence
	 in cases of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.

The law is not the only issue that drives litigation. Insurance companies
	 do pay more for claims based on locale. Generally, cases in urban areas
	 and coastal jurisdictions tend to pay better values when negotiating a
	 settlement than the same claim in Omaha, Kansas City or Indianapolis.
The differences in law from circuit to circuit could be important in your
	 case. There are three primary proper venues for filing an ERISA benefits
	 lawsuit: 1) where you live; 2) where your plan is administered (usually
	 your employer is the officially designated plan administrator and the
	 employer's principal place of business is where the plan is administered);
	 and 3) where some other defendant has its principal place of business
	 (in many circuits a proper defendant in an ERISA benefits claim is the
	 insurance company which insures the claims).
Usually, the best venue to file an ERISA benefits claim is in the district
	 court where you live, which may provide you with a subtle and unspoken
	 "home court advantage" in any number of ways. Since the law
	 varies from circuit to circuit, however, you might better be off suing
	 in California or Nevada, where your employer's plan is administered,
	 rather than in Louisiana or Connecticut, where you live, because Ninth
	 Circuit law - which is the law that controls in Nevada and California
	 - may be more favorable to your case than Fifth Circuit law (which controls
	 Louisiana) or Second Circuit law (which controls Connecticut).
The circuit summaries on this website are not intended to be comprehensive
	 summaries of the law. They are simply our observations about certain important
	 features of ERISA law and practice in these circuits.
If you really want to understand where your case should be brought in the
	 event of litigation, consult an experienced ERISA lawyer at our firm.

California ERISA Attorney
Let Our Results-Driven Lawyer Help
Our mission at ERISA Law Center is to ensure people get the disability
	 benefits they deserve. If your claim was denied or your existing benefits
	 were terminated, we can help. Employee Retirement Income Security Act
	 (ERISA) claims and litigation can be complicated. Make sure you have an
	 experienced California ERISA lawyer there to help you get the benefits
	 and compensation you need.
We can help with the following:

Appealing a claim
Suing over a claim
Disability claim appeals
Life insurance claims
Long-term disability
Litigating a claim

We Are Ready to Fight for You
Our firm is admitted to practice in numerous federal courts, and we have
	 experience assisting hundreds of people across the nation. Each member
	 of our team is devoted to providing the best service possible, treating
	 our clients with courtesy and professionalism. Our ERISA attorney, Robert
	 Rosati, is able to practice in more than 25 federal courts around the
	 country. Through legal knowledge and commitment, our approach puts your
	 case in the hands of trained professionals.
Who We Fight

	There are a small number of insurance companies and self-insured plans
	 that provide the vast majority of ERISA disability benefits claims. It
	 can also be difficult to deal with them without legal experience, as different
	 insurance companies will take different tactics to try to avoid paying
	 benefits. Some companies react to case law and court decisions and trends
	 in the circuit in order to increase their chances of winning. Take a look at the
	list of insurance companies we’ve come up against.


	If you’re ready to discuss your situation,
	contact us at (844) 710-2993 or fill out our online form. We’re available 24/7.

What We Do

Disability Claim Appeals
If your disability claim was denied, or if you received a letter stating
	 that your existing benefits were terminated, ERISA Law Center can help.
	 Do not lose hope in this situation, as in many cases you can file a successful
	 ERISA claim appeal. An appeal gives you the opportunity to overturn the
	 initial decision, and it is a required step under ERISA legal procedure
	 before you can proceed with a lawsuit against your disability insurance company.

Where We Practice



ERISA Attorney
Practicing in Federal Circuit Courts Across the U.S.
Representing disability claimants and life insurance beneficiaries, we
	 at ERISA Law Center handle cases in all U.S. Courts of Appeal. These courts
	 handle cases related to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).
	 ERISA provides legal recourse for employees dealing with denied or terminated
	 disability, health care, life insurance and pension benefits. Depending
	 on where you live and work, or where your employer is based, your case
	 will be heard in an appellate court. This venue and the presiding judge
	 may have more of an impact on your ERISA case than you would think.
ERISA is a federal law and is supposed to be a uniform system of national
	 law. It isn't. While ERISA statutes haven't changed very much
	 since the law was adopted in 1974, courts around the country have interpreted
	 and applied that law differently. Supreme Court decisions on ERISA law
	 are binding everywhere, but decisions by the 12 geographic circuit courts
	 of appeal which have jurisdiction over ERISA cases are controlling only
	 within the jurisdiction of that circuit. In a lot of areas of ERISA law,
	 circuits have adopted different legal standards. Some circuits seem to
	 favor claimants more than others.
What can be drawn from a review of case law from around the country? ERISA
	 law can strongly favor insurance companies and plans. Depending on the
	 factual and legal issues operating in your case, some circuits may offer
	 more favorable treatment than others. What's certain is that it's
	 not as simple as saying one circuit is better than another - it will depend
	 on a number of factors.

Our Lawyer is Experienced in All Circuit Courts

	With the experience of litigating in all circuit courts comes a nuanced
	 perspective about what issues work best where. For instance, the
	Ninth Circuit is not antagonistic to claims of disability based on fibromyalgia and
	 chronic fatigue syndrome. The
	Fourth Circuit has joined that position. The
	Sixth Circuit is very good if you are attacking the credibility of defense doctors. The
	Fifth and
	Tenth Circuits have very clear rules for allowable discovery in the event of
	 a conflict of interest. The
	Seventh Circuit is best if you have "de novo" review. On the other hand, the
	Second Circuit allows insurance companies to introduce new rationales to deny benefits
	 in litigation. The
	Eighth Circuit has rejected arguments that it is improper to demand objective evidence
	 in cases of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.

The law is not the only issue that drives litigation. Insurance companies
	 do pay more for claims based on locale. Generally, cases in urban areas
	 and coastal jurisdictions tend to pay better values when negotiating a
	 settlement than the same claim in Omaha, Kansas City or Indianapolis.
The differences in law from circuit to circuit could be important in your
	 case. There are three primary proper venues for filing an ERISA benefits
	 lawsuit: 1) where you live; 2) where your plan is administered (usually
	 your employer is the officially designated plan administrator and the
	 employer's principal place of business is where the plan is administered);
	 and 3) where some other defendant has its principal place of business
	 (in many circuits a proper defendant in an ERISA benefits claim is the
	 insurance company which insures the claims).
Usually, the best venue to file an ERISA benefits claim is in the district
	 court where you live, which may provide you with a subtle and unspoken
	 "home court advantage" in any number of ways. Since the law
	 varies from circuit to circuit, however, you might better be off suing
	 in California or Nevada, where your employer's plan is administered,
	 rather than in Louisiana or Connecticut, where you live, because Ninth
	 Circuit law - which is the law that controls in Nevada and California
	 - may be more favorable to your case than Fifth Circuit law (which controls
	 Louisiana) or Second Circuit law (which controls Connecticut).
The circuit summaries on this website are not intended to be comprehensive
	 summaries of the law. They are simply our observations about certain important
	 features of ERISA law and practice in these circuits.
If you really want to understand where your case should be brought in the
	 event of litigation, consult an experienced ERISA lawyer at our firm.
