The Board has concluded that Mr. Swoveland is qualified to serve as a Director because, among other things, he brings to the Board extensive corporate management, accounting and finance experience, and oil and gas industry expertise. Additionally, his prior service as a director of another public energy company allows him to provide leadership and knowledge of best practices that benefit the Company and his guidance and understanding of management processes of other oil and gas companies benefits the Company as it continues to grow.
