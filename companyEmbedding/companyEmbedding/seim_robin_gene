what structure does each become? which layer of abdominal muscle is NOT included?(external to internal)1) external abdominal oblique → external spermatic fascia2) internal abdominal abdominal oblique → cremaster muscle/fascia3) transversalis muscle → internal spermatic fasciaNOT INCLUDED: transversus abdominis musclehow many generations of Leydig cells occur in male development? when?2 generations of Leydig cells:1) in utero: development of internal/external male genitalia/reproductive anatomy2) at puberty: increase testosterone, spermatogenesis, secondary sex characteristicswhat is complete androgen insensitivity?complete androgen insensitivity (CAI):* a genetic disorder that is marked by the presence in a phenotypically female individual of the normal X and Y chromosomes of a male, usually normal but undescended testes, and external genitalia that is female or slightly virilized, that results from complete or partial insensitivity to androgens in the body, and that is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait (called also testicular feminization, testicular feminization syndrome)what is the main effect during male development of each of the following hormones:1) TDF2) MIH3) T4) DHT1) TDF (testis determining factor): formation of testes, seminiferous tubules and rete testes2) MIH (mullerian inhibiting hormone): degeneration of paramesonephric ducts3) T (testosterone): development of mesonephric ducts into epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles and ejaculatory ducts4) DHT (dihydrotestosterone): development of penisdevelopmentally speaking, which is higher-maintenance: males or females? why?males, because the development of male internal/external genitalia requires 4 hormones (TDF, MIH, T & DHT), while female development requires only one (estrogen).according to Dr. Bartolomei, what are the 4 parts of the male reproductive system?1) testes2) genital ducts3) accessory glands4) penisfor every spermatogonium, how many spermatozoa are produced via spermatogenesis?4 spermatozoa for every spermatogonium that undergoes spermatogenesiswhat is the genetic makeup of each of the following cells in the stages of spermatogenesis (n = ploidy, d = total copies of chromosome):1) spermatogonium2) 1° spermatocyte3) 2° spermatocyte4) spermatid1) spermatogonium: 2d, 4n2) 1° spermatocyte: 2d, 4n3) 2° spermatocyte: 1d, 2n4) spermatid: 1d, 1nin gametogenesis, which meiotic division is reductional? which is equational?* meiosis 1 = reductional (separation of homologous chromosome)* meiosis 2 = equational (separation of sister chromatids)structure of the testes* each testes contains 250 lobules (pyramidal compartments), which are separated by the septae of the tunica albuginea* each lobule contains 1-4 seminiferous tubules* each seminiferous tubule is U-shaped, and it connects to the rete testis on both endswhich kinds of cells are located inside the seminiferous tubules? the interstitial space? the wall?seminiferous tubules:* inside: spermato-gonia/-cytes/-tids, & Sertoli cells* interstitial space: Leydig cells, blood vessels, macrophages* the wall: fibroblasts, myoid cellswhat is the main function of Leydig cells? how does this affect their histological appearance?Leydig cells: synthesize/secrete testosterone* causes the development/maintenance of male secondary sex characteristics* maintains the seminiferous epithelium* causes them to appear foamywhat are the 2 types of spermatogonia?spermatogonia:* type A: only undergo mitosis to generate new spermatogonia (like stem cells)* type B: are committed to spermatogenesis and only undergo meiosiswhat is the spatial relationship among developing spermatocytes/tids? what is the hypothesized reason for this?spermatocytes and spermatids are attached by cytoplasmic bridges in groups of 4 or 8* hypothesized reason: gene products need to be transfered between spermatids* spermatozoa become separated from these cytoplasmic bridges & residual bodies during maturationwhat is TEX14?TEX14 is a gene product that localizes to the intercellular bridges of developing spermatocyteswhat is the difference between humans and other animals in the pattern of spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules?* other animals: spermatogenesis occurs in waves along the length of the seminiferous tubules* humans: spermatogenesis occurs in a helical pattern (with all of the sperm along the helix developing at the same time and adjacent sperm at different stages of development)in spermatogenesis, what step takes the longest? what impact does this have on the relative abundances of spermatogonia/cytes/tids on histological slides?* longest period = meiosis 1* therefore, most sperm in a slide are 1° spermatocytes (you almost never see a 2° spermatocyte)during spermatogenesis, which direction do spermatocytes move as they mature?* from the basement membrane towards the lumen of the seminiferous tubulewhat part of the developing spermatocyte becomes the acrosome? the flagella? the middle piece?* golgi body → acrosome* centrioles → flagella* mitochondria → middle piecewhat is Kartagener syndrome?Kartanger syndrome:* genetic disorder affecting males and females* absence of dynein, which is required for flagellar motility* causes non-motile spermatozoa (and infertility)* also makes patient vulnerable to multiple respiratory infections (because lack of mucociliary flow in lungs)what are the 4 main functions of Sertoli cells?Sertoli cells:1) support/protect/nourish developing spermatocytes2) phagocytose residual bodies & abnormal germ cells3) secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP), inhibin, and activin 4) produce anti-mullerian hormone (during fetal development)what is androgen-binding protein? where is it highly concentrated?Androgen-binding protein (ABP) is a glycoprotein (beta-globulin) produced by the Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules of the testis that binds specifically to testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and 17-beta-estradiol.* because developing spermatocytes need very high levels of testosterone, ABP is concentrated on the luminal side of the blood-testes barrierwhat is the blood-testis barrier? what is it's main purpose?blood-testis barrier:* a physical barrier to solute diffusion formed by the tight junctions between Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules* divides the testis into a basal compartment and an adlumenal compartment* main purpose: to protect more mature spermatocytes/tids from blood borne-products, including the immune systemwhat two types of cells are contained in the epididymis?1) ciliated cells2) secretory cellswhat is the main function of the epididymis?epididymis: accumulate, store and mature spermatozoahow are spermatozoa propelled through the epididymis, vas deferens and ejaculatory duct?via the contraction of muscles surrounding those tubes (not by the microvilli of cells lining the lumens of those tubes)what processes are involved in the maturation of sperm? where does this occur?sperm maturation occurs in the epididymis and involves:* stabilization of condensed chromatin* changes in plasma membrane surface charge* new surface proteins* acquisition of motilitywhat is the histological appearance of the epididymis?* tube composed of pseudostratified columnar epithelium* actin-containing microvilliwhat are the functions of the epithelial lining of the epididymis?epithelial lining of the epididymis:* resorbs testicular fluid* phagocytoses residual bodies and degenerate spermatozoa* secretes glycoproteins, sialic acid, and glycerylphosphorylcholinewhat is the histological appearance of the vas deferens?vas deferens:* epithelium = same as in epididymis (pseudostratified columnar epithelium with secretory cells)* very thick muscular wall w 3 layers (outer/inner = longitudinal; middle = circular)what is the main function of the seminal vesicle?seminal vesicle secretes:* FRUCTOSE* citrate* prostaglandins* proteinsinto the seminal fluidwhat is the histological appearance of the seminal vesicle?seminal vesicle: folded secretory mucosa surrounded by 2 layers of muscleinside which structure does the ejaculatory duct empty into the urethra?inside the prostate glandwhat is the function of the prostate gland?prostate: secretes a slightly alkaline fluid, milky or white in appearance, that usually constitutes 20-30% of the volume of the semen along with spermatozoa and seminal vesicle fluid; includes* acid phosphatase* citric acid* fibrinolysin* other proteinswhat are the zones of the prostate gland?1) peripheral zone (PZ)2) central zone (CZ)3) transitional zone (TZ)4) anterior fibro-muscular zone (AFMZ)which part of the prostate does most of the secretion?the peripheral zone (PZ)what are the 2 types of corpora in the penis? what is each of their functions?1) 2 x corpora cavernosa: accumulates blood to initiate/maintain erection2) 1 x corpus spongiosum: surrounds the urethrawhat is the retroperitoneum? what structures are located in it?retroperitoneum = the space behind the peritoneum, in front of the posterior abdominal wall/musculature, and below the diaphragm, and it contains:* kidneys, adrenal glands, ureters* bladder* vasculature* esophagus* rectum* parts of: pancreas, duodenum (2nd part) and colon (ascending/descending)* lymphaticswhat anatomical landmark is a useful for identifying the ureter?the bifurcation of the common iliac arteryin renal surgery, which do you ligate first: the renal artery or vein?

A substantial subset of men with this uncommon syndrome have microdeletions in the Yq11 region of the Y chromosome, an area known as the AZF (azoospermia factor) region. Generally speaking, testosterone and LH levels are normal, but due to lack of inhibin, FSH levels are increased.* germ cell aplasia* common causes: involution after environmental exposure (chemo, radiation, hormone therapy, toxins)* accounts for 5-10% of male infertility* no known treatment2 main types of testicular tumors1) germ cell2) non-germ cell tumors (sex cord, stromal)what portion of testicular tumors are of germ-cell origin?95%characteristics of germ cell tumors* constitute 95% of all testicular tumors* generally very aggressive, malignant* highest incidence in men, ages 15-34* more common in white men than African American mencharacteristics of non-germ cell tumors* small percentage of testicular tumors* generally benignwhat are the important types of germ cell testicular tumors?germ cell tumors:* (spermatocytic) seminoma* embryonal carcinoma* yolk sac tumor* choriocarcinoma* teratomawhat are the important types of non-germ cell testicular tumors?non-germ cell tumors:* leydig cell tumors* sertoli cell tumorswhat are 4 risk factors for developing germ cell testicular tumors?* cryptorchidism* prior testicular germ cell tumor* family history* infertilitywhat cytogenetic abnormality is found in nearly ALL germ cell testicular tumors?* isochromosome 12pwhat is a seminoma?seminoma (aka 'classic' or 'typical' seminoma): the most common pure germ cell tumor, composed of relatively uniform cells with: * abundant clear cytoplasm, * well defined cell borders, and * nuclei with one or more prominent nucleoligross morphology of a seminomaseminoma;* usually unilateral* bulky, homogenous* gray/white* lobulated* devoid of hemorrhage/necrosiswhat accounts for 70% of painless testicular masses?seminomawhat is the histological appearance of seminoma? what are the serologic findings?histology: relatively large, uniform cells with: * abundant clear cytoplasm, * well defined cell borders, * large, central nuclei with one or more prominent nucleoli, and* lymphocytic infiltration* sheets of uniform cells* possible granulomasserology:* negative for both HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) and AFP (alpha fetoprotein)what is the prognosis/treatment for seminoma?* prognosis: generally good (especially stages I & II)* Tx for stages:1) radical orchiectomy + radiation2) radical orchiectomy + raditation to surrounding lymph nodes tissue 3) radical orchiectomy + multi-drug chemotherapywhat is an embryonal carcinoma?embryonal carcinoma: a germ cell tumor composed of cells with epithelial appearance and marked cytologic atypia (highly undifferentiated, high grade)* most commonly seen admixed with other germ cell tumors* age of onset: young adults 15-35what is the gross morphology of embryonal carcinoma?embryonal carcinoma* variegated, poorly demarcated* foci of necrosis and hemorrhage* extra testicular involvementwhat are the histological features of embryonal carcinoma? serologic findings?embryonal carcinoma* alveolar/tubular growth pattern* lacks well formed glands* large, anaplastic cells* indistinct cell borders* large, hyperchromatic nuclei w/ prominent nucleoli* frequent mitoses & giant cellsserology* usually positive for both HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) and AFP (alpha fetoprotein)which type of germinal cell testicular tumors has the worst prognosis?embryonal carcinomawhat is a yolk sac tumor?yolk sac tumor: a germ cell tumor characterized by a variety of growth patterns that recapitulate the yolk sac, allantois and extra-embryonic mesenchyme* bimodal distribution: 16-18 months (pure, better prognosis) & 25-35 years (mixed, poor prognosis)gross morphology of yolk sac tumorsyolk sac tumor:* non-symptomatic, rapid testicular enlargement* non-encapsulated* hemorrhagic, yellow-white, myxoid, gelatinouswhat are the histological features of yolk sac tumors? serology?yolk sac tumor:histology:* lace-like, reticular growth* Schiller DuvalBodies* medium-sized, cuboidal or elongated cells* intra-cytoplasmic hyalin globules (AFP + alpha1antitrypsin)serology: * strongly AFP+, HCG-what is a Schiller-Duval body? in what kind of testicular tumor are they found?Schiller-Duval body is a cellular structure seen by microscope in endodermal sinus tumors (yolk sac tumors) which are the most common testicular cancer in children. Schiller-Duval bodies are present in approximately 50% of these tumors, and if found are pathognomonic.* found in yolk sac tumorswhat is the treatment for yolk sac tumors? prognosis?Tx:* infants/children: orchiectomy +/- chemo* adults: orchiectomy + lymph node resection + chemoPrognosis:* children > adultswhat is choriocarcinoma?choriocarcinoma: a germ cell tumor composed of mononucleated cytotrophoblast and multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast* most common age group: young adult males (25-30 years old)gross morphology of choriocarcinomachoriocarcinoma* often small, but very aggressive* no testicular enlargement, usually* hemorrhage, necrosis* causes widespread metastasiswhat is the histology of choriocarcinoma?

the prognosis?* treatment: orchiectomy & follow up* prognosis: kids = good; adults = very malignant (high recurrence & metastasis)what is the definition of 'puberty'?puberty = the physical and biochemical changes associated with activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis that lead to adult reproductive functionwhat are some signs of puberty in both ♂ and ♀?1) maturation of genitalia2) development of 2° sex characteristics3) acceleration of growth4) change in affect(5) menstruation in ♀)describe gonadotropin levels in newborns/babies* gonadotropin levels = high until ~2yrs (because of the HPG axis is now freed from the suppression of maternal estrogen & progesterone)what is the cause of ovarian cysts sometimes observed in female neonates?* high FSH/LH levels experienced before ~2yrs can cause a transient secretion of estrogen & testosterone, which can cause ovarian cysts in neonate ♂'sdescribe the state of the HPG axis during childhoodduring childhood, the HPG axis = quiescent* FSH & LH are at very low levels (hypothalamus exhibits only very low level pulses of GnRH)how do we know that the HPG axis is quiescent during childhood?because children with gonadal dysgenesis have FSH and LH levels similar to normal children AND exogenous GnRH will stimulate FSH/LH secretion in these childrenhow do oocyte count and hormone levels vary in ♀'s over time?how do testosterone levels vary in ♂'s over time?are ♂'s ovaries 100% dormant during childhood?* no, follicles grow at all times during childhood and frequently reach antral stage* however, full follicular development does not occur (and these follicles undergo atresia)when we measure GnRH activity, what do we measure directly? why?LH* can't measure GnRH directly because of its extremely short half life* don't use FSH because its half life is way too long (so levels are very steady and it's not a good proxy)* LH = a happy medium (long enough half life to measure, but short enough to be a good indicator of GnRH levels)in pre-puberty, what hormonal changes occur?pre-puberty: * hypothalamus resumes GnRH pulsality* FSH/LH pulse freq & amplitude increase (LH is only at night, at first)what is menarche? what causes it?menarche = a woman's first menstruation* cause: gonadal secretion of estrogen (stimulated by gonadotropins [LH]) leads to proliferation of the endometrium, which is then shedin males, LH secretion leads to production of testosterone by which type of cells?Leydig cellswhat is the first sign of puberty in males?growth of the testeswhat are the 2 general stages of puberty that occur in both ♂ & ♀?1) adrenarche2) gonadarchewhat is adrenarche? what are the physical signs of adrenarche during puberty?adrenarche = increase in secretion of androgen precursors (DHEA) from the zona reticularis of the adrenal gland* signs: axillary & pubic hairwhat is gonadarche?gonadarche = the activation of sex steroid secretion by the ovary or the testes (leads to the growth of breast tissue in ♀)are adrenarche and gonadarche dependent upon one another? what is the evidence supporting this answer?No! * adrenarche and gonadarche are independently regulated processes* evidence: a) people w/o functional gonads (i.e. Turner's syndrome) experience normal adrenarche; b) people with adrenal insufficiency experience normal gonadarchewhat is thelarche?
