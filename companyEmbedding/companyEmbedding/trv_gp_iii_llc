 ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS 
This prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference into it are part of a registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the SEC) utilizing a shelf registration process. Under this shelf registration process, certain selling stockholders may from time to time sell the shares of common stock described in this prospectus in one or
more offerings.  We have not authorized anyone to give any information or to make any representation other than those contained or incorporated by
reference in this prospectus. You must not rely upon any information or representation not contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus. The selling stockholders are offering to sell, and seeking offers to buy, shares of our common
stock only in jurisdictions where it is lawful to do so. This prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any shares other than the registered shares to which they relate, nor does this prospectus
constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy shares in any jurisdiction to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation in such jurisdiction. You should not assume that the information contained in this
prospectus is accurate on any date subsequent to the date set forth on the front of the document or that any information we have incorporated by reference is correct on any date subsequent to the date of the document incorporated by reference, even
though this prospectus is delivered or shares are sold on a later date.

ABOUT MYOKARDIA 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering a precision medicine approach to discover, develop and commercialize targeted therapies for the
treatment of serious and neglected rare cardiovascular diseases. Our initial focus is on the treatment of heritable cardiomyopathies, a group of rare, genetically-driven forms of heart failure that result from biomechanical defects in cardiac muscle
contraction. We have used our precision medicine platform to generate a robust pipeline of therapeutic programs for the chronic treatment of the two most common forms of heritable cardiomyopathyhypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM, and dilated
cardiomyopathy, or DCM. MYK-461, our lead product candidate for the treatment of HCM, is currently in Phase 2 clinical development. We intend to advance our second product candidate, MYK-491, for the treatment of DCM, into Phase 1 clinical
development by the first half of 2017. Applying our precision development strategy, we have demonstrated clinical proof of mechanism for MYK-461 in both healthy volunteers and in HCM patients; we intend to pursue a similar clinical approach for
MYK-491. In 2016, MYK-461 was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for the treatment of symptomatic, obstructive HCM. 
We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were $11.5 million and $8.4 million for the three
months ended March, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of March 31, 2017 we had an accumulated deficit of $89.4 million. To date, we have not generated any product revenue. We do not expect to receive any revenue from any product candidates that
we develop until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our products or enter into collaborative agreements with third parties. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and
development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. As of March 31, 2017, we had $135.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. 
We were incorporated in Delaware in June 2012. Our principal executive offices are located at 333 Allerton Ave., South San Francisco, California 94080. Our
telephone number is (650) 741-0900 and our e-mail address is info@myokardia.com. Our Internet website address is www.myokardia.com. No portion of our website is incorporated by reference into this prospectus. We do not incorporate the
information on or accessible through our website into this prospectus, and you should not consider any information on, or that can be accessed through, our website as part of this prospectus. Our common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select
Market under the symbol MYOK.  We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of
at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date
on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.  We use various trademarks and trade names in
our business, including without limitation our corporate name and logo. All other trademarks or trade names referred to in this prospectus are the property of their respective owners. Solely for convenience, the trademarks and trade names in this
prospectus may be referred to without the ® and  symbols, but such references should not be construed as any indicator that their respective owners will not assert, to the fullest extent
under applicable law, their rights thereto.

developments and projections relating to our competitors or our industry.  Given these uncertainties, you
should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference herein, regardless of
the time of delivery of this prospectus or any sale of our common stock and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise after the date of prospectus. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.  
USE OF PROCEEDS  We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in this offering. The selling stockholders
will receive all of the proceeds from this offering.  The selling stockholders will pay any underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses incurred
by the selling stockholders for brokerage, accounting, tax or legal services or any other expenses incurred by the selling stockholders in disposing of the shares. We will bear all other costs, fees and expenses incurred in effecting the
registration of the shares covered by this prospectus, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, fees and expenses of our counsel, certain expenses of counsel to the selling stockholders and our independent registered public
accountants.  SELLING STOCKHOLDERS 
On April 20, 2015, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Investors Rights Agreement, as amended by that certain Amendment No. 1 to
Second Amended and Restated Investors Rights Agreement dated April 20, 2015, with the selling stockholders and certain other stockholders (the IRA). This prospectus covers the sale or other disposition by the selling
stockholders of up to the total number of shares of common stock held by the selling stockholders subject to the IRA. The selling stockholders acquired such shares of common stock pursuant to stock purchase agreements entered into from time to time
in connection with the issuance and sale of our common stock and convertible preferred stock prior to our initial public offering, which resulted in all of the outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock being converted into shares of
common stock. Throughout this prospectus, when we refer to the shares of our common stock being registered on behalf of the selling stockholders, we are referring to the shares held by the selling stockholders subject to the IRA, and when we refer
to the selling stockholders in this prospectus, we are referring to the selling stockholders as investors under the IRA.  We are registering the
above-referenced shares to permit each of the selling stockholders to resell or otherwise dispose of the shares in the manner contemplated under Plan of Distribution below. 
Except as otherwise disclosed in the footnotes below, none of the selling stockholders has, or within the past three years has had, any position, office or
other material relationship with us.  The following table sets forth the name of each selling stockholder, the number of shares owned by each of the
respective selling stockholders, the number of shares that may be offered under this prospectus and the number of shares of our common stock owned by the selling stockholders assuming all of the shares covered hereby are sold. The number of shares
in the column Number of Shares Being Offered represents all of the shares that a selling stockholder may offer under this prospectus. The selling stockholders may sell some, all or none of their shares. We do not know how long the
selling stockholders will hold the shares before selling them, and we currently have no agreements, arrangements or understandings with the selling stockholders regarding the sale or other disposition of any of the shares. The shares covered hereby
may be offered from time to time by the selling stockholders.

Beneficial ownership is a term broadly defined by the SEC in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, and includes more than the typical form of stock ownership, that is, stock held in the persons name.
The term also includes what is referred to as indirect ownership, meaning ownership of shares as to which a person has or shares investment power. For purposes of this table, a person or group of persons is deemed to have
beneficial ownership of any shares underlying options and other purchase rights that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of June 30, 2017. 
 


(2)
Assumes that all shares being registered in this prospectus are resold to third parties and that with respect to a particular selling stockholder, such selling stockholder sells all shares of common stock registered
under this prospectus held by such selling stockholder.   


(3)
Consists of (i) 7,687,754 shares of common stock directly owned by Third Rock Ventures II, L.P. (TRV II) (ii) 1,496,598 shares of common stock directly owned by Third Rock Ventures III, L.P.

Table of Contents
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION 
The selling stockholders may sell the shares of common stock from time to time pursuant to underwritten public offerings, negotiated transactions, block
trades or a combination of these methods or through underwriters or dealers, through agents and/or directly to one or more purchasers. The shares of common stock may be distributed from time to time in one or more transactions: 
 


 

 
at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed;   


 

 
at market prices prevailing at the time of sale;   


 

 
at prices related to such prevailing market prices; or   


 

 
at negotiated prices.  The selling stockholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act,
if available, or Section 4(a)(1) under the Securities Act rather than under this prospectus, provided that they meet the criteria and conform to the requirements of those provisions. 
If the selling stockholders effect such transactions by selling shares of common stock to or through underwriters, broker-dealers or agents, such
underwriters, broker-dealers or agents engaged by the selling stockholders may arrange for other broker-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts
as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated. The selling stockholders do not expect these commissions and discounts to exceed what is customary in the types of transactions involved. 
The selling stockholders may, from time to time, pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the shares of common stock owned by them and, if they
default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the shares of common stock from time to time under this prospectus, or under a supplement or amendment to this prospectus under
Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the Securities Act amending, if necessary, the list of selling stockholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling stockholders under this prospectus. 
Each selling stockholder has informed us that it is not a registered broker-dealer and does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly
or indirectly, with any person to distribute the common stock. If we are notified in writing by a selling stockholder that any material arrangement has been entered into with a broker-dealer for the sale of common stock through a block trade,
special offering, exchange distribution or secondary distribution or a purchase by a broker or dealer, we will file a supplement to this prospectus, if required, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act disclosing (i) the name of
each such selling stockholder and of the participating broker-dealer(s), (ii) the number of shares involved, (iii) the price at which such shares of common stock were sold, (iv) the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed
to such broker-dealer(s), where applicable, (v) that such broker-dealer(s) did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus, and (vi) other facts material to the
transaction. In addition, upon being notified in writing by a selling stockholder who is an affiliate that a donee or pledge intends to sell more than 5,000 shares or $50,000 worth of common stock, we will file a supplement to this prospectus
if then required in accordance with applicable securities law.  The selling stockholders also may transfer the shares of common stock in other
circumstances, in which case the transferees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus. 
In connection with the sale of the shares of common stock or interests in shares of common stock, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions
after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common stock in the course of hedging the positions they
assume. The selling stockholders may also sell shares of common stock short after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge
the common stock to broker-dealers that

in turn may sell these securities. The selling stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a
part with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such
broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction).  The selling
stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by
such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. The maximum commission or discount to be received by any member of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or independent broker-dealer will not be greater than eight percent of the initial gross proceeds from the sale of any security being sold. 
We have advised the selling stockholders that they are required to comply with Regulation M promulgated under the Exchange Act during such time as they
may be engaged in a distribution of the shares. The foregoing may affect the marketability of the common stock.  The aggregate proceeds to the selling
stockholders from the sale of the common stock offered by them will be the purchase price of the common stock less discounts or commissions, if any. Each of the selling stockholders reserves the right to accept and, together with their agents from
time to time, to reject, in whole or in part, any proposed purchase of common stock to be made directly or through agents. We will not receive any of the proceeds from this offering. 
We are required to pay all fees and expenses incident to the registration of the shares. We have agreed to indemnify the selling stockholders against certain
losses, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise.  We have agreed with the selling
stockholders to use our commercially reasonable efforts to keep the registration statement of which this prospectus constitutes a part effective for a period of up to one hundred twenty days or, if earlier, until the distribution contemplated in the
registration statement has been completed.  VALIDITY OF THE SECURITIES 
Certain legal matters in connection with this offering will be passed upon for us by Goodwin Procter LLP, San Francisco, California. Additional legal
matters may be passed upon for us, the selling stockholders or any underwriters, dealers or agents, by counsel that we will name in the applicable prospectus supplement.

	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS



	This prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference into it are part of a registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission (the SEC) utilizing a shelf registration process. Under this shelf registration process, certain selling stockholders may from time to time sell the shares of common stock described in this prospectus in one or
	more offerings.


	We have not authorized anyone to give any information or to make any representation other than those contained or incorporated by
	reference in this prospectus. You must not rely upon any information or representation not contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus. The selling stockholders are offering to sell, and seeking offers to buy, shares of our common
	stock only in jurisdictions where it is lawful to do so. This prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any shares other than the registered shares to which they relate, nor does this prospectus
	constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy shares in any jurisdiction to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation in such jurisdiction. You should not assume that the information contained in this
	prospectus is accurate on any date subsequent to the date set forth on the front of the document or that any information we have incorporated by reference is correct on any date subsequent to the date of the document incorporated by reference, even
	though this prospectus is delivered or shares are sold on a later date.

	ABOUT MYOKARDIA



	We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering a precision medicine approach to discover, develop and commercialize targeted therapies for the
	treatment of serious and neglected rare cardiovascular diseases. Our initial focus is on the treatment of heritable cardiomyopathies, a group of rare, genetically-driven forms of heart failure that result from biomechanical defects in cardiac muscle
	contraction. We have used our precision medicine platform to generate a robust pipeline of therapeutic programs for the chronic treatment of the two most common forms of heritable cardiomyopathyhypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM, and dilated
	cardiomyopathy, or DCM. MYK-461, our lead product candidate for the treatment of HCM, is currently in Phase 2 clinical development. We intend to advance our second product candidate, MYK-491, for the treatment of DCM, into Phase 1 clinical
	development by the first half of 2017. Applying our precision development strategy, we have demonstrated clinical proof of mechanism for MYK-461 in both healthy volunteers and in HCM patients; we intend to pursue a similar clinical approach for
	MYK-491. In 2016, MYK-461 was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for the treatment of symptomatic, obstructive HCM.


	We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were $11.5 million and $8.4 million for the three
	months ended March, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of March 31, 2017 we had an accumulated deficit of $89.4 million. To date, we have not generated any product revenue. We do not expect to receive any revenue from any product candidates that
	we develop until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our products or enter into collaborative agreements with third parties. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and
	development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. As of March 31, 2017, we had $135.6 million of cash and cash equivalents.


	We were incorporated in Delaware in June 2012. Our principal executive offices are located at 333 Allerton Ave., South San Francisco, California 94080. Our
	telephone number is (650) 741-0900 and our e-mail address is info@myokardia.com. Our Internet website address is

	www.myokardia.com

	. No portion of our website is incorporated by reference into this prospectus. We do not incorporate the
	information on or accessible through our website into this prospectus, and you should not consider any information on, or that can be accessed through, our website as part of this prospectus. Our common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select
	Market under the symbol MYOK.


	We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We
	will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of
	at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date
	on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.


	We use various trademarks and trade names in
	our business, including without limitation our corporate name and logo. All other trademarks or trade names referred to in this prospectus are the property of their respective owners. Solely for convenience, the trademarks and trade names in this
	prospectus may be referred to without the

	and  symbols, but such references should not be construed as any indicator that their respective owners will not assert, to the fullest extent
	under applicable law, their rights thereto.

	project, target, design, estimate, predict, potential, plan or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements,
	and similar expressions and comparable terminology intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties,
	including those set forth below in the sections entitled Risk Factors in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K we file after the date of this

	SELLING STOCKHOLDERS



	On April 20, 2015, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Investors Rights Agreement, as amended by that certain Amendment No. 1 to
	Second Amended and Restated Investors Rights Agreement dated April 20, 2015, with the selling stockholders and certain other stockholders (the IRA). This prospectus covers the sale or other disposition by the selling
	stockholders of up to the total number of shares of common stock held by the selling stockholders subject to the IRA. The selling stockholders acquired such shares of common stock pursuant to stock purchase agreements entered into from time to time
	in connection with the issuance and sale of our common stock and convertible preferred stock prior to our initial public offering, which resulted in all of the outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock being converted into shares of
	common stock. Throughout this prospectus, when we refer to the shares of our common stock being registered on behalf of the selling stockholders, we are referring to the shares held by the selling stockholders subject to the IRA, and when we refer
	to the selling stockholders in this prospectus, we are referring to the selling stockholders as investors under the IRA.


	We are registering the
	above-referenced shares to permit each of the selling stockholders to resell or otherwise dispose of the shares in the manner contemplated under Plan of Distribution below.


	Except as otherwise disclosed in the footnotes below, none of the selling stockholders has, or within the past three years has had, any position, office or
	other material relationship with us.


	The following table sets forth the name of each selling stockholder, the number of shares owned by each of the
	respective selling stockholders, the number of shares that may be offered under this prospectus and the number of shares of our common stock owned by the selling stockholders assuming all of the shares covered hereby are sold. The number of shares
	in the column Number of Shares Being Offered represents all of the shares that a selling stockholder may offer under this prospectus. The selling stockholders may sell some, all or none of their shares. We do not know how long the
	selling stockholders will hold the shares before selling them, and we currently have no agreements, arrangements or understandings with the selling stockholders regarding the sale or other disposition of any of the shares. The shares covered hereby
	may be offered from time to time by the selling stockholders.

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	The selling stockholders may sell the shares of common stock from time to time pursuant to underwritten public offerings, negotiated transactions, block
	trades or a combination of these methods or through underwriters or dealers, through agents and/or directly to one or more purchasers. The shares of common stock may be distributed from time to time in one or more transactions:


	 




	 


	


	 


	at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed;




	 




	 


	


	 


	at market prices prevailing at the time of sale;




	 




	 


	


	 


	at prices related to such prevailing market prices; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	at negotiated prices.




	The selling stockholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act,
	if available, or Section 4(a)(1) under the Securities Act rather than under this prospectus, provided that they meet the criteria and conform to the requirements of those provisions.


	If the selling stockholders effect such transactions by selling shares of common stock to or through underwriters, broker-dealers or agents, such
	underwriters, broker-dealers or agents engaged by the selling stockholders may arrange for other broker-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the selling stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts
	as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated. The selling stockholders do not expect these commissions and discounts to exceed what is customary in the types of transactions involved.


	The selling stockholders may, from time to time, pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of the shares of common stock owned by them and, if they
	default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell the shares of common stock from time to time under this prospectus, or under a supplement or amendment to this prospectus under
	Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the Securities Act amending, if necessary, the list of selling stockholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as selling stockholders under this prospectus.


	Each selling stockholder has informed us that it is not a registered broker-dealer and does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly
	or indirectly, with any person to distribute the common stock. If we are notified in writing by a selling stockholder that any material arrangement has been entered into with a broker-dealer for the sale of common stock through a block trade,
	special offering, exchange distribution or secondary distribution or a purchase by a broker or dealer, we will file a supplement to this prospectus, if required, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act disclosing (i) the name of
	each such selling stockholder and of the participating broker-dealer(s), (ii) the number of shares involved, (iii) the price at which such shares of common stock were sold, (iv) the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed
	to such broker-dealer(s), where applicable, (v) that such broker-dealer(s) did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus, and (vi) other facts material to the
	transaction. In addition, upon being notified in writing by a selling stockholder who is an affiliate that a donee or pledge intends to sell more than 5,000 shares or $50,000 worth of common stock, we will file a supplement to this prospectus
	if then required in accordance with applicable securities law.


	The selling stockholders also may transfer the shares of common stock in other
	circumstances, in which case the transferees, pledgees or other successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus.


	In connection with the sale of the shares of common stock or interests in shares of common stock, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions
	after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common stock in the course of hedging the positions they
	assume. The selling stockholders may also sell shares of common stock short after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge
	the common stock to broker-dealers that


	 


	6






	Table of Contents



	in turn may sell these securities. The selling stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a
	part with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or the creation of one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such
	broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction).


	The selling
	stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by
	such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. The maximum commission or discount to be received by any member of the
	Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or independent broker-dealer will not be greater than eight percent of the initial gross proceeds from the sale of any security being sold.


	We have advised the selling stockholders that they are required to comply with Regulation M promulgated under the Exchange Act during such time as they
	may be engaged in a distribution of the shares. The foregoing may affect the marketability of the common stock.


	The aggregate proceeds to the selling
	stockholders from the sale of the common stock offered by them will be the purchase price of the common stock less discounts or commissions, if any. Each of the selling stockholders reserves the right to accept and, together with their agents from
	time to time, to reject, in whole or in part, any proposed purchase of common stock to be made directly or through agents. We will not receive any of the proceeds from this offering.


	We are required to pay all fees and expenses incident to the registration of the shares. We have agreed to indemnify the selling stockholders against certain
	losses, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise.


	We have agreed with the selling
	stockholders to use our commercially reasonable efforts to keep the registration statement of which this prospectus constitutes a part effective for a period of up to one hundred twenty days or, if earlier, until the distribution contemplated in the
	registration statement has been completed.








	VALIDITY OF THE SECURITIES



	Certain legal matters in connection with this offering will be passed upon for us by Goodwin Procter LLP, San Francisco, California. Additional legal
	matters may be passed upon for us, the selling stockholders or any underwriters, dealers or agents, by counsel that we will name in the applicable prospectus supplement.








	EXPERTS



	The
	financial statements incorporated in this Prospectus by reference to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 have been so incorporated in reliance on the report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
	registered public accounting firm, given on the authority of said firm as experts in auditing and accounting.
