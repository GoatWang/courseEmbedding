Company Description (as filed with the SEC)
We are a molecular information company focused on fundamentally changing the way
in which patients with cancer are evaluated and treated. We believe an
information-based approach to making clinical treatment decisions based on
comprehensive genomic profiling, or CGP, will become standard of care for
patients with cancer. We derive revenue from selling products that are enabled
by our molecular information platform to physicians and biopharmaceutical
companies. Our platform includes proprietary methods and algorithms for
analyzing specimens across all types of cancer, and for incorporating that
information into clinical care in a concise and user-friendly fashion. Our
products provide genomic information about each patient's individual cancer
obtained from that analysis, enabling physicians to optimize treatments in
clinical practice and biopharmaceutical companies to develop targeted oncology
therapies more effectively.  ... More ...

Foundation Medicine, Inc. Key Developments

Kura Oncology Establishes Collaboration with Foundation Medicine to Support Tipifarnib Development in Hras Mutant Head and Neck Cancer
Jul 13 17
Kura Oncology, Inc. announced it has entered into a collaboration agreement with Foundation Medicine, Inc. to support patient enrollment for Kura’s clinical program for tipifarnib in patients with relapsed and/or refractory HRAS mutant squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Through this collaboration, Foundation Medicine’s SmartTrials Precision Enrollment program will contact physicians treating individuals across the U.S. diagnosed with SCCHN whose tumors harbor HRAS mutations as detected in the course of routine clinical care. The treating physicians will be contacted and informed of Kura’s ongoing Phase 2 study of tipifarnib, including relevant details about the trial, including trial patient characteristics and investigational centers, to assist the physician in evaluating tipifarnib as a potential treatment option.


Guardant Health Files Lanham Act Lawsuit Against Foundation Medicine, Inc. Alleging False Advertising
Jun 22 17
Guardant Health filed a lawsuit against Foundation Medicine, Inc. (FMI), for false advertising and unfair competition. Guardant Health initiated the litigation on June 22, 2017 under the Lanham Act and related California statutes in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint alleges that FMI's advertising harms Guardant Health and patients by misleading oncologists about the accuracy and sensitivity of the Guardant360® assay, Guardant Health's comprehensive liquid biopsy, as well as FMI's own assays. The complaint contends that although FMI routinely promotes its own liquid biopsy as the 'best in class' with 'unparalleled' sensitivity, multiple studies including some presented by FMI at a recent scientific conference contradict these claims. Guardant Health has asked the court to enjoin FMI from continuing to make or disseminate false or misleading statements about the performance of its own assays as well as Guardant360, and to require FMI to retract, remove, and correct these false and misleading advertising claims.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

					Full Description



Foundation Medicine, Inc., incorporated on November 12, 2009, is a molecular information company. The Company sells products that are enabled by its molecular information platform to physicians and biopharmaceutical companies. The Company is engaged in the business of delivering molecular information about cancer to its customers. The Company's platform includes various methods and algorithms for analyzing specimens across various types of cancer, and for incorporating that information into clinical care. Its products provide genomic information about each patient's individual cancer, enabling physicians to optimize treatments in clinical practice and biopharmaceutical companies to develop targeted oncology therapies. Its suite of clinical molecular information products includes FoundationOne, which is used for solid tumors; FoundationOne Heme, which is used for blood-based cancers or hematologic malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, pediatric cancers and advanced sarcoma; FoundationACT (Assay for Circulating Tumor DNA), which is a blood-based (liquid biopsy) assay that evaluates circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA), and FoundationFocus CDxBRCA, which is a companion diagnostic assay to aid in identifying women with ovarian cancer for whom treatment with Rubraca (rucaparib).As of December 31, 2016, FoundationOne assessed 315 biologically relevant cancer genes for all classes of genomic alterations with sensitivity and specificity. The Company's FoundationICE is an online interactive cancer explorer and allows physicians to access the genomic information identified by its products along with information about the reported genomic alterations, associated therapies and clinical trials. FoundationICE presents genomic information in an interface that links directly into publicly available databases, such as PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov, to provide additional information relevant to a patient's identified genomic alterations. The Company's FoundationCORE is its knowledgebase that includes genomic data, medical and scientific literature, clinical trial information, and a small but growing amount of clinical outcome information. FoundationCORE powers FoundationICE, enabling oncologists and pathologists in clinical practice to utilize this aggregated data set to collaborate and share treatment choices, response rates and other clinical information in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant manner.
