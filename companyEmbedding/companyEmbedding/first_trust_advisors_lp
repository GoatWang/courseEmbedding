Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) Downgraded to Strong Sell at Zacks Investment Research


					Posted by Chloe McGuire on Jul 22nd, 2017 // No Comments




Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “strong sell” rating in a report released on Tuesday, July 11th. 
According to Zacks, “Avon has lagged the broader industry in the last six months, largely due to its dismal surprise history. The company has posted lower-than-expected bottom-line results for three straight quarters now, with a loss in the last quarter. Avon continues to face lower Active Representatives, though it is on track to improve the same. Estimates have been going down ahead of the second quarter release. The company remains prone to stiff competition, and other macroeconomic hurdles. Further, management expects the second quarter to remain troubled. However, we remain impressed with Avon’s progress with its Transformation Plan, which started its second year, this quarter. The company is on track to generate targeted savings of $230 million in 2017. Also, it is confident of achieving its long-term goals of low-double digit operating margin growth, Active Representatives growth of 1–2% and constant-dollar revenue growth in the mid-single digits.”

Factoid of the Day


Monday, July 24, 2017






The majority of first-time home buyers in the U.S. no longer plunk down 20% for a down payment. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported that more than 70% of noncash, first-time home buyers made down payments of less than 20% over the past five years, according to MarketWatch and NerdWallet. The NAR puts the typical down payment for 60% of first-time home buyers at 6% or less. Ironically, NAR research found that just 13% of adults 34 and younger realize they can purchase a house with a down payment of 5% or less.

Exchange-Traded Funds

                Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) provide an efficient and simple way to invest in worldwide markets. ETFs offer investors the opportunity to buy and sell an entire basket of securities with a single transaction throughout the trading day. ETFs combine the characteristics of a mutual fund with the convenience and trading flexibility of stocks. ETFs offer investors the potential advantages of low operating costs and improved tax efficiency over traditional, actively-managed mutual funds.

As a result of several factors which may include changing interest rates, refundings, and sales or defaults on the underlying securities, there is no guarantee that distributions will either remain at current levels or increase over time. Estimated current return is determined by dividing a Trusts estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price per unit. Estimated long-term return is a measure of the estimated return over the estimated life of a Trust. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long-term return reflects maturities, estimated principal prepayments, Trust charges and expenses, and discounts and premiums of securities in a Trust. Returns and prices will fluctuate. Consult a prospectus for a more complete description of the estimated net income, estimated current return and estimated long-term return calculations.





This product information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any state to any person to whom it is not lawful to make such an offer.  Sales of any of these securities must include prospectus delivery and the services of a retail broker/dealer duly licensed in the appropriate states.

   Existing Home Sales Declined 1.8% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Home Sales • Housing


 Implications:  Existing home sales took a breather in June, giving up ground as median prices reached a new record high for the second consecutive month.  Sales of previously-owned homes fell 1.8% in June to a 5.52 million annual rate, but are still up 0.7% from a year ago.  Going forward, it is important to remember that home sales are volatile from month to month, but we expect the general upward trend of the past several years to keep going.  That being said, tight supply and rising prices remain headwinds.  Inventories have now fallen on a year-over-year basis for 25 consecutive months and are down 7.1% from a year ago.  Inventories are now the lowest for any June since at least the late 1990s.  This has also affected the months' supply of existing homes – how long it would take to sell the current inventory at the most recent sales pace – which was 4.3 months in June, down from 4.6 months a year ago.  According to the NAR, anything less than 5.0 months is considered tight supply, a benchmark which hasn't been exceeded since November 2015.  The good news is that demand for existing homes in June was so strong that 54% of listings were on the market for less than a month.  Higher demand and a shift in the "mix" of homes sold toward more expensive properties has also driven up median prices, which have now risen for 64 consecutive months on a year-over-year basis, and reached a new record high in June.  The strongest growth in sales over the past year is heavily skewed towards the most expensive homes, signaling that supply constraints may be disproportionately hitting the lower end of the market.  Tough regulations on land use raise the fixed costs of housing, tilting development toward higher-end homes.  The NAR suggests that strong demand could also be pushing some properties into higher brackets as multiple offers boost final sales prices.  Although some analysts may be concerned about the impact of higher mortgage rates, it's important to recognize that rates are still low by historical standards, incomes are growing, and the appetite for homeownership is eventually going to move higher again.

   Moderate Growth for Q2






Since the start of the economic recovery in mid-2009, real GDP has grown at an average annual rate of 2.1%.  The second quarter of this year doesn't look much different.  Our calculations suggest real GDP grew at a 2.5% annual rate in Q2, exactly the same as the consensus forecast.
That's an acceleration from the 1.4% pace in Q1 and we expect better growth ahead. But consistently better growth is going to take more than lots of talk from Washington, DC.  Instead, it's going to take some concrete steps, like less regulation, lower tax rates, less spending, and a more free-market approach to health care.        
Here's how we get to 2.5% for Q2.
Consumption:  Automakers reported car and light truck sales dropped at a 12.3% annual rate in Q2.  "Real" (inflation-adjusted) retail sales outside the auto sector grew at a 1.2% rate, but growth in services was strong, in part due to a rebound in (seasonally-adjusted) utility output after unusually mild weather in January and February.  Our models suggest  real personal consumption of goods and services, combined, grew at a 2.9% annual rate in Q2, contributing 2.0 points to the real GDP growth rate (2.9 times the consumption share of GDP, which is 69%, equals 2.0).
Business Investment:  After clicking on all cylinders in Q1, business investment grew more modestly in Q2.  Investment in business equipment and intellectual property both grew at about a 4% rate, but commercial construction fell at about a 7% pace.  Combined, it looks like they grew at a 1.7% rate, which should add 0.2 points to the real GDP growth.  (1.7 times the 13% business investment share of GDP equals 0.2).
Home Building:  While boosting utilities in Q2, the return to more normal weather patterns dampened home construction.  Home building looks like it grew in Q2, but at a 2.5% annualized pace rather than the 12.9% pace in Q1.  The trend is somewhere between the two and we expect continued growth in this sector even if mortgage rates rise, as more jobs and faster wage growth will lead to more demand for housing.  In the meantime, a 2.5% growth rate will add 0.1 points to the real GDP growth rate.  (2.5 times the home building share of GDP, which is 4%, equals 0.1).
Government:  Both military spending and public construction projects look close to trend in Q2.  On net, we're estimating that real government purchases were up at a 1.4% annual rate in Q2, which would add 0.2 points to the real GDP growth rate.  (1.4 times the government purchase share of GDP, which is 17%, equals 0.2).
Trade:  At this point, we only have trade data through May.  Based on what we've seen so far, it looks like net exports should subtract 0.3 points from the real GDP growth rate in Q2.   
Inventories:  We have even less information on inventories than we do on trade, but what we have so far suggests companies are stocking shelves and showrooms at a slightly faster pace in Q2 than they were in Q1, which should add 0.3 points to the real GDP growth rate.
Keep in mind that there are reports on durable goods as well as international trade and inventories the day before the GDP release and those figures could change our forecast as well.  But, for the time being, you can put it all together, and get an estimate of 2.5% for Q2.  
No one should be excited or dismayed by this report.  It is the epitome of the Plow Horse pace of growth we've had for the past eight years.   Hopefully, Washington will now get its act together and make this one of the last Plow Horse reports we have to see.

   Housing Starts Increased 8.3% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Home Starts • Housing


 Implications:  After falling for three consecutive months, housing starts rebounded strongly in June, beating the consensus to post their largest monthly gain of the year.  Even though both single-family and multi-unit starts were responsible for the gain in June's headline number, in the past year single-family starts are up 10.3% while multi-unit starts are down 12.9%.  The "mix" of construction has been generally shifting toward single-family building and this is a good sign for the overall economy.  When the housing recovery started, multi-family construction led the way. But the share of all housing starts that are multi-family appears to have peaked in 2015, when 35.7% of all starts were multi-family, the largest since the mid-1980s, when the last wave of Baby Boomers was growing up and moving to cities. In June, the multi-family share of starts was 30.1%.  The shift toward single-family is a positive sign for the economy because, on average, each single-family home contributes to GDP about twice the amount of a multi-family unit.  Based on population growth and "scrappage," housing starts should eventually rise to about 1.5 million units per year. In other words, much of the recovery in home building is still ahead of us.  Another bright spot in today's report was that housing completions rose 5.2% in June and are now up 8.1% in the past year.  Further, building permits for new structures posted their biggest one month jump since 2015 in June.  Expect housing starts to continue to gain steam in the months ahead as more unfinished projects are completed and builders move onto new ones.  In other recent housing news, the NAHB index, which measures sentiment among home builders fell to a still elevated 64 in July from 67 in June.  Expect further strength in the housing sector in the year ahead as more jobs, faster wage growth, and, for at least the time being, optimism about more market-friendly policies from the Trump Administration, continue to encourage both prospective home buyers and builders.  On the factory front, the Empire State index, a measure of manufacturing sentiment in New York, fell to a still healthy 9.8 in July from 19.8 in June. Finally, on inflation, import prices fell 0.2% in June but are up 1.5% from a year ago.  Export prices also fell 0.2% in June, but have increased 0.6% in the past year.  Both figures are a stark contrast to the negative direction of prices in the year ending in June 2016.

   Hey Government: It's Time to Get Serious!



Posted Under: Government • Monday Morning Outlook • Spending • Taxes


At eight years, the current economic recovery is the third longest on record.  Personal income, consumer spending, household assets, and net worth, are all at record highs.  Stock markets are at record highs.  Corporate profits are within striking distance of their all-time highs.  Federal tax receipts are at record highs.  
So, how is it possible that the federal budget, along with some state and local budgets, still look like they're in the middle of a nasty recession?
The answer: Government fiscal management is completely out of control.  Politicians find time to fret about Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods and won't stop bashing banks, but they've lost their ability to deal with their own fiscal reality.
The federal government is projected to run a nearly $700 billion deficit this year, and long-term forecasts suggest trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see.  Illinois and the City of Chicago are running chronic deficits, while New Jersey and New York are fiscal basket cases.
This makes the politicians of the 1990s look downright responsible.  In 1999, after a 10-year recovery, these entities were all running surpluses. But even if this recovery lasts 12 years, deficits will persist.  And what happens if there's another recession?
Politicians have claimed intellectual support for their fiscal irresponsibility from John Maynard Keynes.  He believed in deficit-spending to help cure the problems of weak consumer spending in a recession.  As a result, the Panic of 2008 gave cover to grow government, and they did so in spectacular fashion.  But that "emergency" spending then morphed into permanent overspending and chronic deficits.
Tax rates are higher today than in 1999, and the economy is bigger, but governments have consistently outspent the ability of taxpayers to fund it.
Even Keynes thought the government should roll back spending and get budget deficits under control in better economic times.  But politicians are long past seeking his intellectual support.  They love to lecture business-people about greedy human nature, yet can't turn that analysis on themselves.
Businesses and entrepreneurs create new things and build wealth.  Politicians redistribute that wealth.  And while some of what government does can help the economy, like providing defense or supporting property rights, the U.S. government has expanded well beyond that point.  Politicians have never been this reckless or fiscally irresponsible.
Whenever we say this, people ask; "what would you cut from the budget?"  And then, if you are actually brave enough to answer, you get attacked for "not caring." 
This needs to stop.  Illinois is in a death spiral.  Tax rate increases will chase more productive people out of the state, while ratcheting spending higher.  And just like Detroit and Puerto Rico, the state will go bankrupt.
The U.S. government is on this path, but, because it has the ability to fund itself with the best debt in the world, a true fiscal day of reckoning is still 15-20 years away.
Government spending needs to be peeled back everywhere.  It's no longer a case of picking and choosing.  And until that happens, the fiscal irresponsibility of the government is the number one threat to not only America, but the world.
No matter what politicians tell us, any pain caused by private sector greed will pale in comparison to the mayhem that collapsing governments can create.  Just look at Venezuela or Greece!  It's time to reset America's fiscal reality.  And if that means debt ceiling brinksmanship, shutting down the government, or moving to a simple majority on spending decisions, so be it.  It's time to get serious!

   Industrial Production Rose 0.4% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Industrial Production - Cap Utilization


 Implications:  Industrial production rose for the fifth consecutive month in June, beating consensus expectations and signaling an uptick in activity across the board.  The headline measure for industrial activity rose 0.4% in June and is now up 2% from a year ago.  Manufacturing, which excludes mining and utilities, bounced back in June, rising 0.2%.  This gain was primarily due to a 0.7% jump in the volatile auto sector, though "core" industrial production, which is manufacturing excluding autos, rose 0.1% as well.  Manufacturing has begun to accelerate recently, up at a 3.2% annual rate in the past three months versus a gain of 1.2% in the past year.  And this isn't just due to auto production either, both "core" and auto manufacturing are showing similar accelerating patterns in the past three months versus their year ago measures.  Another major contribution to today's headline number came from mining which jumped 1.6% in June, and is now up at an 18.4% annual rate in the past three months versus 9.9% in the past year.  Further, oil and gas-well drilling posted its thirteenth consecutive gain in June, jumping 6.9%, and is now up a massive 115% at an annual rate in the past three months.  Based on other commodity prices, we think oil prices are below "fair value" range, but with oil companies profitable at current prices mining should stay in recovery after the problems of the past two years.

   Retail Sales Declined 0.2% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Retail Sales


 Implications:   Retail sales were soft again in June, but don't take that as a sign consumer spending is rolling over or the economy as a whole is getting weaker.  Total retail sales slipped 0.2% in June and half of the drop in overall sales was due to lower gas prices. This normal volatility causes retail sales to drop three or four months during a year, even in a growing economy.  "Core" sales, which exclude autos, building materials, and gas, were also down 0.2%.  In spite of the weak month, for the second quarter as a whole, core sales were up at a healthy 3% annual rate versus the first quarter, consistent with our forecast that "real" (inflation-adjusted) consumer spending on goods and services combined, rose at about a 3% annual rate as well.  This is not a sign of a dying consumer.  Even with the 0.2% decline in total retail sales in June, they're still up 2.8% from a year ago, which is outstripping the 1.6% increase in the consumer price index.  Note that one area of continuing strength is among non-brick and mortar retailers, where sales rose 0.4% in June, are up 9.2% from a year ago, and now make up 10.9% of sales, the largest portion on record.  Expect a rebound in retail sales in the months ahead.  The fundamental trends that drive growth in consumer spending continue to look good.  These include healthy job growth, wage growth, and very low consumer financial obligations relative to historical norms. Although household debt is at a record high, household debts are the lowest relative to household assets since the peak of the internet boom almost 20 year ago.  In other news this morning, business inventories increased 0.3% in May.  Plugging this into our forecast, suggests real GDP grew at a 2.5% annual rate in the second quarter, a little faster than the 2.1% average since the economic recovery started in mid-2009.

   The Consumer Price Index was Unchanged in June



Posted Under: CPI • Data Watch • Inflation


 Implications:  Consumer prices were unchanged in June and have been tame over recent months, but cries that a lull in inflation should give the Fed pause are overblown.  Consumer prices are up 1.6% in the past year, compared to a 1.0% increase in the twelve months ending June 2016 and a 0.1% increase for the period ending June 2015.  In other words, inflation is still in a rising trend.  Energy prices fell 1.6% in June, while food prices were flat.  Strip out the typically volatile food and energy components, and "core" CPI rose 0.1% in June and is up 1.7% in the past year.  Medical care and rent costs led "core" prices higher in June, rising 0.4% and 0.3% respectively, more than offsetting declining prices for autos.  We expect rents to accelerate in the year ahead as supply constraints get tighter in the housing market.  Meanwhile, energy prices should stop falling and rebound a bit.  Combined, these forces should push the CPI back above 2% around the end of the year.  The best news in today's report is that real average hourly earnings rose 0.2% in June.  These earnings are up 0.8% over the past year, up at a 1.3% annual rate over the past six months, and a 1.9% annual rate over the past three.  This acceleration signals that a loose monetary policy has led to a tighter labor market.  Because the Fed believes in the Phillips Curve, the trend of accelerating price and wage gains should have Fed officials focusing more on the potential for inflation to rise faster than desired as the jobless rate continues to fall below their long-term target.  That's why we expect the Fed to stick to their plan of starting to unwind the balance sheet while also raising rates one more time in 2017.

 Implications:  Services sector prices pushed the producer price index higher by 0.1% in June, and prices are up a healthy 2.0% in the past year.  Within the service sector, prices for final demand services less trade, transportation, and warehousing (in other words services like healthcare, lodging, and banking) led the index higher, rising 0.3% in June.  Goods prices also ticked higher in June, with food prices rising 0.6%, offsetting a 0.5% decline in energy prices.  Take out the volatile food and energy sectors, and you are left with "core" prices, which rose 0.1% in June (following a 0.4% rise in April and a 0.3% increase in May), and have risen 1.9% in the past twelve months.  With both headline and "core" producer prices hovering around the Fed's 2% inflation target (and both measures easily above 2% when looking at the annualized rate over the past three and six month periods) there should be little doubt that balance sheet unwinding and further rate hikes are warranted.  A look further back in the pipeline at prices for intermediate demand suggests inflation pressures are continuing.  While intermediate processed goods prices declined 0.2% in June, they are up 3.8% in the past year and have increased in eight of the last ten months.  Meanwhile prices for intermediate unprocessed goods rose 1.5% in June and are up 6.5% over the last twelve months.  The Fed will keep these prices, which give a hint to the direction final demand prices will follow in future months, in mind as they plan the path for monetary policy.  News out this morning on the Fed's other key area of focus, employment, showed that initial jobless claims fell 3,000 last week to 247,000.  Meanwhile continuing claims declined 20,000 to 1.95 million.  It's early, but taking these together suggests healthy job creation continues in July.

CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) Upgraded by Zacks Investment Research to “Hold”

					Posted by Mitch Edgeman on Jul 23rd, 2017 // No Comments 




Zacks Investment Research upgraded shares of CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) from a sell rating to a hold rating in a report released on Tuesday, July 11th. Zacks Investment Research currently has $38.00 target price on the technology company’s stock. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
