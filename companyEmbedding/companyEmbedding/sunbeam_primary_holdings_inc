Section 2.8 of the Merger Agreement and solely in its capacity
as the sole holder of membership interests in the General Partner

Partnership (the “ General Partner ”), Sunbeam
Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “

such capacity, the “ Unitholders’ Representative
”, and collectively with the Parent Parties, Seller, the
General Partner, the Partnership and Sunbeam Primary, the “
parties ”), and this Amendment amends that certain

WHEREAS, in accordance with
Section 11.4 of the Merger Agreement, the parties wish to
amend the Merger Agreement as specified herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

1. Amendments to
Section 1.1(a) of the Merger Agreement .

(a) Section 1.1(a) of the
Merger Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the definition of
“Parent Series D Preferred Stock Consideration Value”
and inserting the following definition in lieu thereof:

“ “ Parent Series D
Preferred Stock Consideration Value ” means
(i) 19.99% of the number of outstanding shares of Parent
Common Stock as of the open of business of Parent on the Closing
Date (which number of outstanding shares, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall exclude the Stock Consideration), multiplied by
(ii) the Applicable Share Price.”

(b) Section 1.1(a) of the
Merger Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the definition of
“Specified Approval” and inserting the following
definition in lieu thereof:

“ “ Specified
Approval ” means the required written approval of the
State of New Jersey Department of Health to the transfer of
ownership in the Specified Entity.”



(c) Section 1.1(a) of the
Merger Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the definition of
“Stock Consideration” and inserting the following
definition in lieu thereof:

“ “ Stock
Consideration ” means the aggregate number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole number of
shares) equal to the quotient of (i) the Stock Consideration
Value divided by (ii) the Applicable Share Price;
provided , however , that, if such number of shares
of Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration would
exceed 19.99% of the number of outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock as of the open of business of Parent on the Closing Date
(which number of outstanding shares, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall exclude the Stock Consideration), then:

(A) the Stock Consideration shall be
both:

(1) an aggregate number (which may
include a fraction) of shares of Parent Series D Preferred Stock
equal to the quotient of (x) the Parent Series D Preferred
Stock Consideration Value, divided by (y) the Parent Series D
Preferred Stock Liquidation Value; and

(2) an aggregate number (which may
include a fraction) of shares of Parent Series E Preferred Stock
equal to the quotient of (x) the Parent Series E Stock
Consideration Value, divided by (y) the Parent Series E
Preferred Stock Liquidation Value; and

(B) the initial Conversion Price (as
defined in the Parent Series D Articles of Amendment and the Parent
Series E Articles of Amendment, as applicable) for each share of
Parent Series D Preferred Stock and Parent Series E Preferred Sock
shall be the Applicable Share Price.”

2. Amendment of Exhibit F of the
Merger Agreement . Exhibit F of the Merger Agreement is hereby
amended and restated in its entirety as set forth in Annex I
hereto.

3. Effectiveness and
Ratification . All of the provisions of this Amendment shall be

Agreement or in any other agreements, documents or instruments

5. Entire Agreement . The
Merger Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, and the Ancillary
Agreements (including the Exhibits and the Schedules hereto and
thereto), together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes
the entire agreement among the Parties and supersedes any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or among the
Parties, written or oral, to the extent they related in any way to

About SUNBEAM PRODUCTS, INC.


   Home is where Newell Brands (formerly Newell Rubbermaid) is. The go-to company for men, women, and children makes housewares (Rubbermaid plastic products, Calphalon cookware), home furnishings (Levolor blinds), juvenile products (Graco), hair products (Goody), and office items (DYMO and Sharpie). Newell Brands sells its items to mass retailers (Target) and home and office supply stores (Staples). As a result of a more than $15 billion acquisition of consumer products giant Jarden in mid-2016, Newell Brands inherited popular products such as Bicycle Playing Cards, Mr. Coffee, Coleman, Jostens, Oster, Rawlins, Sunbeam, and Yankee Candle.
  
Operations

   Newell Brands operates its business through five core business segments: Home Solutions, Writing, Tools, Commercial Products, and Baby & Parenting. In 2016 it agreed to sell its Tools business to Stanley Black & Decker for nearly $2 billion. Brands involved in the sale--expected to close by the end of 2016--include Irwin, Lenox. and Hilmor.
  

   The Home Solutions segment, which brings in nearly 30% of total sales, makes and distributes a wide range of consumer products - tubs, bins, containers, and other storage tools - under multiple brand names. It primarily targets the female head of household. Its indoor/outdoor organization items and food and home storage products are primarily sold under the Rubbermaid, Roughneck, and TakeAlongs names.
  

   Newell Brands' Writing business, which generates 30% of revenue, makes writing instruments for use in business and at home. It markets its products directly to mass merchants, warehouse clubs, grocery/drug stores, office superstores, office supply stores, contract stationers, and travel retail and other retailers.
  

   The Tools segment makes up 15% of sales, and includes hand tools and power tool accessories, industrial bandsaw blades, cutting tools for pipes and HVAC systems, and industrial labeling solutions. Commercial Products brings in another 15% of sales, and covers cleaning and refuse products, hygiene systems, material handling solutions, and medical and computer carts.
  

   Newell Brands' Baby & Parenting segment, the smallest with just over 10% of sales, makes infant and juvenile products (such as swings, highchairs, car seats, strollers and play yards) sold under the Graco, Baby Jogger, Aprica, and Teutonia names.
  
Geographic Reach

   Newell Brands boasts a global operation. The company operates in more than 100 countries in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region. About 70% of the company's business comes from the US, while Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region generates just over 10% of sales. Latin America and the Asia Pacific region split nearly 15% of revenue, while Canada brings in the remainder of total sales.
  
Sales and Marketing

   The office products maker sells its products in more than 100 countries through large mass merchandisers, such as discount stores, home centers, warehouse clubs, office superstores, commercial distributors, and e-commerce companies.
  

   Newell Brands relies on the largest retailer in the world to help it peddle its products. Sales to Wal-Mart and its subsidiaries, which include Sam's Club, have slipped a bit in recent years. In 2015, however, the behemoth retailer generated 11% of consolidated net sales.
  
Financial Performance

   Revenue grew 3% from $5.73 billion in 2014 to $5.92 billion in 2015, thanks to growth in three of its segments: Baby & Parenting (13%), Home Solutions (8%), and Writing (3%). These segments in 2015 were aided by growth from North America and the Asia/Pacific region.
  

   Despite the higher sales, net income dipped 7% from $379 million in 2014 to $350 million in 2015, mostly because the company spent more on SG&A expenses related to increased advertising and project renewal related costs.
  
Strategy

   Newell Brands has been making strategic cuts to dispose of under-performing brand and business lines. In 2014, the company discontinued its Endicia and Culinary electrics and retail businesses, which were part of its Writing division. Also in 2014, in effort to simplify its operations in the EMEA region, it closed a manufacturing and a distribution center, exited certain markets and product lines (including its baby and parenting products in nearly 20 EMEA countries), and ended its direct sales channels in more than 50 of the 120 countries in the region.
  

   In 2016 the company agreed to sell its Tools business to Stanley Black & Decker for nearly $2 billion. Brands involved in the sale include Irwin, Lenox. and Hilmor. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2016.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   The company has been pursuing strategic acquisitions to expand its product lines and significantly add to its revenue stream. In a sweeping move for the consumer goods industry, Newell Brands purchased Jarden for around $15 billion in mid-2016. The mega-deal gave the company access to popular brands such as Sunbeam and Oster appliances, Coleman outdoor gear, First Alert home safety products, Ball canning jars, Diamond matches and plastic cutlery (In 2017, the company agreed to sell its Diamond products business.), Loew-Cornell art supplies, K2 snowboards, and Bee and Bicycle brand playing cards. It estimates that the combined company will earn $16 billion in revenue.
  

   Newell Brands made another important deal in late 2015, when it purchased Elmer's Brands for $600 million. Through the purchase, the company inherited popular brands Elmer's, Krazy Glue, and X-Acto and significantly enhanced its Writing segment.
  

   In late 2014, Newell Brands acquired Ignite Holdings' Contigo and Avex beverage container brands, with the purchase aimed at transforming the company into a larger, faster growing, more global, and more profitable company. That year it also acquired Baby Jogger Holdings to expand its line of activity strollers and accessories.
  

   Previously in 2014, Newell Brands leaped into the durable beverage container market (think travel mugs and reusable water bottles) when it purchased Ignite Holdings, maker of the Contigo and Avex brands, for about $125 million. Later the same year it paid $83 million to strengthen the group with the purchase of bubba brands, maker of the 52-ounce Bubba Mug and 128-ounce Bubba Jug, from Zone Holdings.
