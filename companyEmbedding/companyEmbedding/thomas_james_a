Home Our Team James T. Thomas





James T. Thomas
Vice President of International Sales and Business
 James T. Thomas is the Vice President of International Sales and Business Development for Topps Products, Inc. In this capacity, he is responsible for strategic planning, sales, and operations in 41 countries and growing. Although fairly new to the Topps Products’ team, joining in January 2015, James has known the company’s coatings and repair materials, and seen them in action, since 2002.

Prior to joining the team at Topps Products Inc., James served honorably for twenty years in the United States Navy, ultimately retiring voluntarily with the rank of Commander to join the firm and guide its expansion. James held positions of significant responsibility, including matters of finance, supply and logistics, interfacing closely with senior U.S. and allied officials, shaping financial management and policy, affecting shipboard operations, facilities management, supportability, and material resources.

James’ twenty-year career took him all over the world, both ashore and afloat.  However, it was his ashore tours which expanded his expertise of logistics and facility management positions with regional responsibilities in Yokosuka, Japan; Norfolk, Virginia; Baghdad, Iraq; the Pentagon; Stuttgart, Germany and Kampala, Uganda.

James earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Mississippi. He is also a MBA graduate of the University of Kansas, with a concentration in Petroleum Management and International Business. He is a graduate of the Stanford University Executive Program in Strategy and Organization and currently is in his third year of Oklahoma State University’s Executive PhD Program in Business, with a focus on Business Analytics/Operations Research, Leadership, and Workforce Motivation.

He speaks business-level Japanese and German, and is conversant in Spanish and French. He is extensively familiar with the business protocol of many regions, specifically East Asia, Western Europe, and East Africa.

James does not mind the hard work associated with problem solving; it provides him enjoyment, whether going on roofs or working with others to overcome challenges. His facilities management experience allowed him to compare and observe various coatings used on different facilities around the world to maintain high value structures.  His vision is to bring quality, independently tested, verified coatings and repair materials to the market, giving facility owners/managers more options, to securely waterproof/leak-proof their buildings and reduce their maintenance costs, all the while adding that important component of saving energy.

Product details Thomas James


Thomas James

Samuel Drummond

A half-length portrait, very slightly to right, in a dark coat and white neckcloth, painted in about 1830. With short white hair, the sitter looks out of the picture space to meet the gaze of the viewer. For many years in the early part of the 19th century James held the position of Master Smith in the Royal Dockyard at Woolwich. The dockyard was founded in 1512, followed by a ropeyard half a mile away in 1610, it was particularly important during the 16th and 17th centuries. But its value gradually declined owing to limited space, facilities and the silting of the Thames. By 1800 it was restricted to shipbuilding; fitting vessels built at Deptford or merchant yards; and refitting small ships from the Nore. In 1839 a steam factory was established at Woolwich. The ropeyard closed 1835 and the yard in 1869.Samuel Drummond

American Estates: Thomas James Rusticated Rhodesian (2012)




Product Number: 004-009-5943


          A very modern reinterpretation of the old Rhodesian, this Thomas James briar sports a bowl of saucer-like proportions, followed up by a complementing shank that's both compact of length, and which forgoes the more traditional round cross-section in favor of a broad lenticular shape. As unorthodox as it all is, the resulting design strikes a pretty good balance, both aesthetically and in practical terms - that is, it makes for one very fine sitter.

- Eric N. Squires
