Business is Booming in Downtown Billings, MT

                    I recently listed a two-story downtown loft in the historic Oliver Building in Billings. We don't have a lot of properties like that in this small city, but that's a situation that looks likely to change. 

If you're at all au fait with real estate you will know that listing agents use a comparative market analysis (CMA) tool to determine the asking price of a properly. So when I came to list Unit 307 at 2702 Montana Ave, Billings, I really struggled to find comparable homes.

Well with determination, frustration and some divine inspiration I settled on an asking price of $289,000 for the 1,700 sq ft unit. So far we've attracted a good bit of interest. But more surprisingly we've seen similar homes his the market in recent weeks. Looking at those home in comparison to my listing, I'm happy to say my price per square foot is highly competitive and we should be getting an offer soon.

So to return to my original statement, it does look as if things are beginning to come alive in the downtown residential property market. It would be great to see the city come to life outside of business hours. I'm sure it will be a busy, vibrant place for people who don't want the ubiquitous suburban rancher. 

Please check out my listing and let me know if this kind of lifestyle would suit you. We will also be listing similar properties in the future, and if you're into something bigger, please let me know as we are also looking at selling former commercial sites for residential use.

Say goodbye to cumbersome and expensive annual mulching applications—and to those messy red chips strewn all around the lawn and walkways! Our revolutionary new EasyMulch® is an environmentally-friendly, insect-resistant, pest-resistant, fungus-resistant, and mold-resistant alternative to traditional wood chips and bark shavings.  FIND OUT MORE
