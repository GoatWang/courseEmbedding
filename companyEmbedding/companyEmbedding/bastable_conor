 Career History



Managing Member

                                    2008 - Current                


Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP


                  Davidson Kempner Capital Management (DKCM) invests client assets using a variety of arbitrage and other event-driven strategies, including “risk” arbitrage transactions and investments in financially distressed companies. The firm's primary investment strategies include distressed investing; mergers and acquisitions (or “risk”) arbitrage; long/short equities; and convertible and volatility arbitrage.DKCM's distressed investments strategy involves investing in securities or other financial instruments of stressed or distressed companies undergoing liquidation, restructuring, refinancing pressures or substantial litigation. As these opportunities are identified, they are subjected to rigorous, fundamental, bottom up analysis. This analysis evaluates legal, financial, regulatory, litigation and timing issues. The firm's merger arbitrage strategy involves investing in securities with an announced hard catalyst and a clearly defined risk/return trade profile. These catalysts include announced merger or takeover offers (friendly and unsolicited), tender offers, auctions, exchange offers, spin-offs, re-capitalizations and legal/regulatory events. DKCM analyzes the business conditions of the company and processes the surrounding the event to determine how the anticipated outcome of the event may affect the trading prices of the company’s securities. DKCM then seeks to purchase these securities at a discount to what they believe their value will be following the event.DKCM's long/short equities strategy involves investing in: long positions that they  believe areundervalued by the market relative to their intrinsic or fundamental value and trade at a discount to such value and short positions they believe are fundamentally overvalued by the market and trade at a premium to fair value.DCKM's convertible and volatility arbitrage strategy encompasses traditional convertible bond arbitrage, as well as opportunistic relative value volatility trades.
