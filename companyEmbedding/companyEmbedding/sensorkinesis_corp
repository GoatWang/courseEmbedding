July 20, 2016/in News /by teamskcLONDON, UK – July 12, 2016 – In a recent interview with HealthPad, a UK-based medical information dissemination and resource company, Nobel Laureate Dr. Roger Kornberg discussed the concern in the rise of illness and death due to Antimicrobial Resistance and how new biosensor technology can potentially be a step-change in eradicating this threat.

Slowing the steep rise of antimicrobial resistance

Currently 700,000 people die each year from Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) and this could rise to 10 milion by 2050
AMR could make routine surgeries and childbirth as dangerous and lethal as in the pre-antibiotic era killing millions and costing trillions worldwide
Doctors inappropriately prescribing antibiotics for minor aliments shorten the useful life of antibiotics threatening modern medicine as there is an antibiotic pipeline deficiency
90% of GPs feel pressured by patients to prescribe antibiotics
70% of GPs are unsure whether sore throat and respiratory infections are viral or bacterial resulting in 50% of sore throats receiving antibiotics
Clinical diagnosis leads to 50% of patients with a sore throat being prescribed antibiotics without having Group A Streptococcal infection
30% of patients with pharyngitis will not be treated but will be infected with Group A Streptococci
24% of doctors say they lack easy-to-use diagnostic tools
10m prescriptions for antibiotics are handed out in England each year to patients who do not need them
A Nobel Laureate has developed a new technology to provide rapid, accurate, cost-effective diagnosis of bacterial sore throat resulting in informed prescribing and reducing unnecessary antibiotic usage

Should we listen when a professor of medicine and a Nobel Laureate says that the technology already exists to develop a cheap hand held device, which can rapidly and accurately diagnose a bacterial sore throat?
Without such a device to determine whether minor ailments require antibiotics, doctors will continue to prescribe them, and thereby contribute to the steep rise in Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). In 2016 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the UK government’s NHS watchdog, reported that as many as 10m prescriptions for antibiotics are handed out in England every year to patients who do not need them. According to a 2016 report on AMR, by 2050 a staggering, “10m people will die from AMR each year . . . . The world needs rapid diagnostics to improve our use of antibiotics,” says the report.

The SKC Biosensor Breakthrough
Sensor-Kinesis’ advanced biosensor technology platform is allowing physicians, health-care organizations and public-safety institutions the ability to detect and quantify the presence of pathogens and disease growth, faster, more accurately and at a lower cost than has ever been possible. The SKC biosensor technology provides rapid analysis of biological materials in order to detect potential disease causing cells and pathogens at a lower development stage than current detection modalities allow. By targeting biomarkers that are specific to known pathogens or cellular disease states, SKC has been able to create a medical technology platform that is able to effectively identify viral agents such as E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria, as well the early stage development of certain cancers.
The SKC biosensor technology not only identifies the presence and quantitative amount of pathogens and cancer-indicating biomarkers in an isolated sample, it delivers the results in seconds or minutes compared to current detection methods. In addition the SKC biosensor technology can operate in a compact one-piece system that is portable and safe. Use of the systems are simple and since all sampling, measurement and analysis is done in a digital environment, results can be instantly shared via highly secured network connections with disease databases, medical and healthcare providers as well as first-responders in the event of a public health issue.
Of high value is the ability of the SKC biosensor technology to provide all this at a cost point that can put this advanced ability in the hands of individual doctors, smaller health care institutions, food and air quality agencies as well as on the ground health providers in remote and isolated locations.
As a result, the SKC biosensor is providing a quantum evolution in new the fight against disease and illness.

Over 500,000 deaths occur each year in the U.S. because of cancer

Every 24 hours the human body produces over one million cancer cells

Our immune system fights these cancer cells and wins the battle almost every day

That both the science and medical community agrees that if cancer cells could be detected before they had a chance to grow to critical mass, that current treatment modalities could be almost 100% effective, every time

A technology that can provide this detection capability has already been developed

The company that developed this technology is a U.S.-based organization that has completely re-shaped the way disease and pathogen detection is done

Sensor-Kinesis is that company.

Sensor-Kinesis
Sensor-Kinesis Corp. is a Los-Angeles based hi-tech company that is developing a revolutionary biosensor chip technology that is capable of detecting and analyzing the presence of pathogens in the human body as well as in the environment (food, water, air) within seconds or minutes, instead of days or weeks,  in order to provide earliest-stage warning of potential disease threats.
Need: IDG was asked to provide ongoing support in helping to develop the company’s brand and message to reflect not only its position in the medical technology arena, but also to the potential end beneficiary of its product.
Solution: We started with a logo design and the development of a style guide that would reflect a contemporary high-technology company feel while using a color pallet associated with the patient care and healing. The stylized “O” was developed to represent the company’s core technology of being able to pull in and contain pathogen samples for disease detection analysis. From there, we created a variety of communication tools including a corporate website, printed and digital brochures as well as video and event services for the company’s growing communication needs.
Creative Services Include: Website Design, Logo Design, Corporate Brochure, Photography, Video, Live Event Services.


“IDG consistently provides us end product that always exceeds our expectations in quality and feel. Most importantly, they have been instrumental in helping us convey who we are to our strategic partners as well as the marketplace.”
Frank AdellCEO and Co-Founder
” I can say with no hyperbole that I have been at trade shows that were not this professionally managed! From the large “picture” need to smallest detail, nothing is overlooked efforts. I am continuously thankful for  the effort.”
(Regarding IDG’s Event Management Services for the company’s Annual Shareholder meeting.)
Ian WelsfordChief Regulatory Officer
“IDG’s work is exemplary. Every tool they have provided us is targeted to speak directly to our various audiences while at the same time maintaining a consistency of look and style that integrates into building a cohesive brand.”
Ric GalaherVice-President of Corporate Relations
