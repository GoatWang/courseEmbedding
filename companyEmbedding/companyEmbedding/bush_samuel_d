George H.W. Bush Genealogy


 George H.W. Bush became the 41st president of the U.S. after serving as Ronald Reagan's vice president for eight years. George H.W. Bush's family history includes a link to French protestants greatly persecuted in the Middle Ages called Huguenots through ancestors of his grandmother, Lucretia Wear Walker. Through Lucretia, George H.W. Bush's family tree extends a branch to Gabriel and Marie Hersent Maupin, who came to America with other French Huguenots fleeing persecution in 1700. 
 George H.W. Bush was born on June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts to Prescott Sheldon Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush. Prescott, who was born in Columbus, Ohio, became a U.S. Senator for Connecticut from 1952 through 1963, having moved his family to Greenwich soon after George was born. Prescott was also a Wall Street banker after politics and resided in New York City until his death. 
 George H.W. Bush's genealogy includes his marriage to Barbara Pierce in 1945 in Westchester County, New York. Together, they had six children, including future president George W. Bush. George H.W. Bush moved his growing family to Texas to start an oil company and was a millionaire by the age of 40, which led to his involvement in politics, holding several prominent positions before becoming president in 1990. 
 George H.W. Bush Family Tree 

 Bush Family History 
 George H.W. Bush's family history boasts entrepreneurs, industrialists and politicians. 
George's grandfather, Samuel Prescott Bush, was a railroad executive and then the president of Buckeye Steel Castings Company in Ohio. Buckeye was first run by Frank Rockefeller, John D. Rockefeller's brother, until he retired in 1908 and turned it over to Bush. Samuel Bush was also the first president of the Ohio Manufacturers Association and co-founder of both the Columbus Academy and the Scioto Country Club. An athletic man, Samuel Bush played on one of the first college football teams. 
 George H.W. Bush's family genealogy can also include the accomplishments of his father, Prescott Bush, who was also a successful businessman. Prescott became vice president of A. Harriman & Co., which is the oldest and largest private banking firm in the U.S., in 1924 before becoming a partner when the company merged with the merchant bank Brown Bros & Co. in 1931. Prescott's move to Greenwich, Connecticut, came after he joined the United States Rubber Company managing the foreign division in 1925. The U.S. Rubber Company was one of the original industrial stocks chosen by Charles Dow for the Dow Industrial Average (later the Dow-Jones) in 1896.
 George H.W. Bush's family history also includes his own accomplishments, which include being the youngest aviator in the US Navy, having enlisted in lieu of attending college after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. In the Navy, George was assigned to Torpedo Squadron that was later based on the USS San Jacinto, famous for being victorious in the largest air battle of World War II, the Battle of the Philippine Sea. George flew 58 combat missions and received three Air Medals, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Presidential Unit Citation that was bestowed on the San Jacinto squadron. 
 George H.W. Bush family tree was continued when he met and married Barbara Pierce Bush, who was born in Flushing but raised in Rye, New York. Her segment of the Bush family tree includes her father, Marvin Pierce, who was the president of McCall Corporation, the publisher of women's magazines McCalls and Redbook. Also, Barbara's ancestor, Thomas Pierce, was the relative of the 14th president, Franklin Pierce. Her great-great-grandfather, James Pierce, Jr., was also a relative to Franklin Pierce. Barbara developed a love of reading from her youth, and she began the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy while First Lady, although she continued her work in this area after the White House.
 George H.W. Bush family genealogy also includes his political achievements, beginning with his election to the House of Representatives for Texas. He was then appointed the Ambassador for the United Nations by President Nixon. George H.W. Bush also chaired the Republican National Committee, followed by the appointment as Chief of the Liaison Office to the People's Republic of China. For almost a year following that appointment, he was the Director of Central Intelligence. It was just four years later that he would join President Ronald Reagan in the White House for eight years as vice president. Then, he became the 41st president for a single term. 
 George H.W. Bush was president when the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union collapsed. He is also remembered for his military strikes in the Persian Gulf during Desert Storm. He also enjoyed a record-high approval rating until the economy began to crumble, and forced to raise taxes, he left office less popular and after a single term. However, he was popular for promoting NASA and the completion of the Space Station Freedom. He also appointed Justices Clarence Thomas and David Souter to the Supreme Court. In 1993, the George H.W. Bush family genealogy can amend his name to read "Sir George H.W. Bush", after receiving honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II. He is the third U.S. president to receive this honor, including Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhower.

Often referred to by his initials, JFK, John F. Kennedy served as the 35th President of the United States from 1961-1963, when he was so infamously assassinated during a political trip to Texas. At the age of 43, he is the youngest president to have been elected to office. During his tenure, President Kennedy oversaw several key events, including the Cuban Missile Crisis, Bay of Pigs invasion, the Space Race, and the African American Civil Rights Movement.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions
Close ×




About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
