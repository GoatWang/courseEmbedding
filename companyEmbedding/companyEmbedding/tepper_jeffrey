AT&T #StudyFest
I was the Copywriter on the AT&T #StudyFest livestream. The Social Studio was created at BBDO-Organic in order to reposition AT&T as an entertainment brand as opposed to being strictly telecommunications. Our mission is to create a series of campaigns and posts to do just that.#StudyFest was an opportunity to reach college students studying for finals, and give them a helping hand. For 3 days, we streamed a guided study session, complete with occasional breaks designed to entertain students in need of decompression. Influencers specializing in music, fitness, magic, and comedy entertained those tuning in.Overview8 influencers performed acts in the StudyFest Facebook Lives, and made posts on their own platforms to drive tune-inInfluencers were: Jibrizy Magic, Brodie Smith, Daniel Fernandez, Katie Austin, Masego, Jon Dorenbos, Matt Stonie and VanJess.ResultsTotal Video Views: 6MTotal Snapchat Reach: 4.1MTotal FB+IG Engagements: 6MSnapchat filter conversion rate: 6.08% 20% view rate on Facebook Live98% positive sentiment overall4.8 point lift in people agreeing that AT&T is an entertainment company (Facebook Nielsen Brand Study)

PEZ
I have always wanted to do a traditional advertising campaign with print, outdoor, and TV spots. PEZ has been one of my favorite brands for as long as I can remember. Collectible dispensers and stackable candy pieces make PEZ the most fun you can have with candy.My work eventually caught the attention of PEZ Candy, Inc.'s marketing team. After meeting with them, and touring their extraordinary visitor center, I became an official PEZ Candy Content Creator.

Captain Morgan
I made a ton of animated GIFs promoting the launch of Captain Morgan Cannon Blast. Below are some of the ones that went live. Unfortunately, some are so amazing and hilarious that they will never go live, so I can't post them up here. If you want to see them, I'd love to show you. They are in the password-protected Captain Morgan section of my website. So please get in touch and I will give you the password to get them in front of your Hungry Eyes ASAP!!!

Small Billboards for Big Causes
During my time at BBH, I participated in the Barn program. The brief was to make something famous with a budget of $1000. While major brands have the budget to spend millions on large Times Square billboards, many non-profits and charitable organizations do not. The idea was to place miniature-scale billboards in cities across the world, all featuring headlines calling attention to important global issues such as animal cruelty, children's issues, human trafficking, global warming, and more.  (Link to ADWEEK article)

Writing LG Electronics Newsletter Articles
While at Publicis, I wrote a bunch of articles for the monthly LG Electronics newsletters. These are articles sent out to existing LG customers as part of a CRM campaign. It was great! I got to write about scary movies (which I love), and do a great deal of research on a few other topics. I am a research nerd, and I love learning about new things so that I could eventually write about them and pretend I'm some sort of expert. Notice the beautiful art direction by my occasional partner, Andrea Sabbatini (please check him out at www.AndreaSabbatini.us).






Top 10 Horror Film Themes
For the October LG newsletter, I had originally written about my top 10 favorite horror movies that flew a bit under the radar. Unfortunately, mentioning specific movies wouldn't fly past legal, so I wrote about my top 10 favorite horror movie clichés. The original scary movie article is down towards the bottom if you want to check it out. My opinions on scary movies are great, and you'll probably agree, or not, you're welcome to debate me. Please debate me, I'm so lonely.






Fun facts about oysters
I love oysters, but I knew nothing about them before this. I did a whole bunch of unnecessary research, and could have written much more on the subject. So please, ask me about my oysters!






Organizing your fridge
I wrote this article about organizing your refrigerator. If you saw my fridge, you would know two things: 1. I am not an authority on organization. 2. I do NOT listen to my own advice.






Top 10 Lesser-Known Horror Films
One of the hardest things you can ask a movie nerd to do is narrow down a list of his or her top ten. While these might not be my favorite scary movies of all time, they are my favorite ones that perhaps flew a bit under the radar or seem to have been forgotten. My poor heart was broken when the legal department informed us that we could not mention specific movies, let alone write an entire article about them. So whether you agree or disagree with my list, let me know. We'll chat, grab some coffee, you know, no big whup.






Black Friday
While I traditionally lock myself indoors with obscene amounts of Chinese food and ice cream on Black Friday, I wrote an article based on the strategies I would use if I ever had to step into the madness. These tips seemed like acceptable ways to deal with the holiday chaos. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. Keep in mind, it was way darker, and way funnier before being edited down by my CD.






Zostrix
During one of my freelance stints, I was asked to make a series of animated GIFs for a medicated cream called Zostrix. This product's key ingredient is Capsaicin, which is derived from peppers. Similarly, I built the template for the animations used on the Sinus Buster website. Sinus Buster also uses Capsaicin. So imagine squirting hot chilli pepper into your nostrils. It might really do the trick!

A campaign to help with WWF's mission to preserve endangered animals. Through a partnership with The GAP, rare articles of clothing featuring animal print will be available for a limited time in participating stores.

Meet the father of Microsoft SharePoint: Jeff Teper
At Microsoft, a number of products are associated closely with the managers who run the teams behind them. SharePoint is no exception. But its "father," Corporate Vice President of Microsoft's Office Business Platform Jeff Teper, isn't a household name (at least outside of Redmond).

At Microsoft, a number of products are associated closely with the managers who run the teams behind them. (Exhibit A: Dave Cutler, the prevailing mastermind behind Windows NT and more recently, Windows Azure.)

SharePoint is no exception. But its "father," Corporate Vice President of Microsoft's Office Business Platform Jeff Teper, isn't a household name (at least outside of Redmond).

That doesn't mean Teper hasn't left his stamp on past, current and future iterations of SharePoint, Microsoft's all-in-one collaboration and communication server. Far from it. Teper is just more of a behind-the-scenes, yet intensely competitive, guy who runs a team of several thousand.

Teper joined Microsoft in 1992. Before he ended up spearheading SharePoint, Teper was a General Manager with MSN. He has a master's degree in business administration from Harvard Business School and a bachelor's degree in information systems and finance from New York University. He's attuned to business matters and dev matters, both, his team members said.

SharePoint 2010, due out in mid-2010 alongside Office 2010, didn't materialize out of nowhere. Teper and a handful of other Microsoft execs helped birth Microsoft's fastest growing server product back in 1996/1997.



"Teper saw a trend from customers. He was in our competitive team," recalled Tom Rizzo, a director of marketing in the SharePoint group. "People had lots of documents and file shares. Search, documents, Office and the Web were all coming together. They (Teper and his colleagues) told (Chairman) Bill (Gates) and (CEO) Steve (Ballmer) that we needed to invest in this category."

Bringing the idea for SharePoint to Gates and Ballmer resulted in two different takes from two different high-level Microsoft managers, Teper reminisced. He said Gates asked a lot of questions about the long-term architecture (SQL Server, .Net, etc.) behind what evolved into SharePoint. Gates also asked a lot of usability questions, Teper said. Ballmer, on the other hand, used his classic "I don't get this" line of questioning to bring SharePoint's charter into focus.

"Ballmer said we need to make it simple, simple, simple," Teper said. "He wanted to keep the message very simple."



So how did all this talk about simplicity yield a product that even Teper himself acknowledges is quite ambitious and complex? (He called it this week the "ultimate Swiss Army Knife.")

"We may have oversold how simple SharePoint was to deploy," Teper acknowledged. But over the last three years, and this year in particular, there's been a lot of focus from the team around improving SharePoint's documentation, guidance and training, he said.

Throughout the past decade, "our (SharePoint) vision has been consistent, though the scope has grown," Teper said. "Even though it had a lot of different names, we already were talking about things like social networking. Back in 2001, we had the idea of giving everyone their own Web site. We did that before FaceBook or MySpace were launched."

'A great success born from a great failure'

SharePoint, even at the outset, was a complex integration project. Microsoft's first pass at it was codenamed "Tahoe" and built on top of the Exchange data store. Tahoe incorporated several technologies Microsoft obtained during several strategic acquisitions: It bought Vermeer and Interse (the technology which provided the underpinnings for Site Server and Commerce Server). The resulting product launched in 2001.

"Site Server is an example of a great success born from a great failure," Teper quipped when I asked him about the origins of SharePoint. "It was a bad user experience. The business model wasn't great," Teper admitted.

Microsoft ended up splitting the original integrated Site Server product into several independent ones, including Microsoft BizTalk integration server and Commerce Server (which were under Satya Nadella, now one of the kingpings of Microsoft's search and advertising efforts), and Teper and his core group of six people or so, who began work on the next version of SharePoint, which became known as SharePoint Server 2003.

With SharePoint 2003, Microsoft replaced the Exchange data store with a SQL one. Microsoft also purchased NCompass Labs during this period, and integrated its web-content-management technology with SharePoint. In 2007, Microsoft morphed SharePoint yet again, this time developing and realigning it to be more of an intranet and Internet focused tool. Microsoft launched the SharePoint Server 2007 release shortly before it made yet another related acquisition: enterprise search vendor FAST Search & Transfer. The upgrade process between the 2003 and 2007 versions was anything but smooth, the Softies acknowledged this week.

While Microsoft's SharePoint competitors include some of the biggest enterprise vendors, including IBM, Google and Oracle, "we're our own toughest critics," Teper said. He recalled when Gates used to send the SharePoint managers frequent and regular e-mails, saying Salesforce or FaceBook or some other competitor has this feature and wanted to know when was Microsoft going to have it.

(While Microsoft's current Chief Software Architect has given the team "lots of feedback," especially around what it's doing with Ozzie's baby, Groove, he isn't anywhere near as micromanaging as Gates, it seems. "Ozzie is more narrowly but deeply focused than (Gates) on software plus services," Teper said. Ozzie is especially focused on giving the team feedback and help around SharePoint's alignment with Azure, he said.)



The Office culture permeates

Teper cut his management teeth under Kurt Delbene, Senior Vice President of the Office Business Productivity Group, and Steven Sinofsky, former head of Office engineering who is now the President of the Windows client business.

"The reason SharePoint was successful was we used the Office development approach," said Teper. "We use a collaborative development approach to build a collaborative product. And how we organize the team, what we look for, how we work -- it's all very Office-like," he said.

But there are places where SharePoint is different from Office, too. Teper noted that not many of the current Office team remember when Microsoft was an underdog trailing Lotus 123. In the SharePoint realm, Microsoft hasn't and still doesn't have a monopoly position. Teper formerly reported to Richard Case, who ran the OS/2 Compete team for Microsoft. He was a competitive guy and so is Teper, Teper said. It's that spirit of "feistiness and aggressiveness" that really marks the SharePoint team, he said.

Another differentiator between SharePoint and Office -- not to mention a number of other Microsoft teams -- is the fact that SharePoint needs to satisfy multiple masters, Teper said. Whereas a number of products at Microsoft are aimed at a single group -- developers or consumers or IT pros -- SharePoint is targeted at all three groups equally, he said.

Going forward, expect the tam to focus on three "big leap" things, Teper said: Its developer story; making it easier for customers to use SharePoint as an Internet (and not just Intranet) platform; and ramping up dramatically its synergies and offerings around SharePoint Online.

Tomorrow, I'll have more on some of the people who are leading some of the tens of teams behind SharePoint. Note: I got sidetracked and didn't get this last piece out yet about the team. But it's coming soon!

Meet the father of Microsoft SharePoint: Jeff Teper
At Microsoft, a number of products are associated closely with the managers who run the teams behind them. SharePoint is no exception. But its "father," Corporate Vice President of Microsoft's Office Business Platform Jeff Teper, isn't a household name (at least outside of Redmond).

At Microsoft, a number of products are associated closely with the managers who run the teams behind them. (Exhibit A: Dave Cutler, the prevailing mastermind behind Windows NT and more recently, Windows Azure.)

SharePoint is no exception. But its "father," Corporate Vice President of Microsoft's Office Business Platform Jeff Teper, isn't a household name (at least outside of Redmond).

That doesn't mean Teper hasn't left his stamp on past, current and future iterations of SharePoint, Microsoft's all-in-one collaboration and communication server. Far from it. Teper is just more of a behind-the-scenes, yet intensely competitive, guy who runs a team of several thousand.

Teper joined Microsoft in 1992. Before he ended up spearheading SharePoint, Teper was a General Manager with MSN. He has a master's degree in business administration from Harvard Business School and a bachelor's degree in information systems and finance from New York University. He's attuned to business matters and dev matters, both, his team members said.

SharePoint 2010, due out in mid-2010 alongside Office 2010, didn't materialize out of nowhere. Teper and a handful of other Microsoft execs helped birth Microsoft's fastest growing server product back in 1996/1997.



"Teper saw a trend from customers. He was in our competitive team," recalled Tom Rizzo, a director of marketing in the SharePoint group. "People had lots of documents and file shares. Search, documents, Office and the Web were all coming together. They (Teper and his colleagues) told (Chairman) Bill (Gates) and (CEO) Steve (Ballmer) that we needed to invest in this category."

Bringing the idea for SharePoint to Gates and Ballmer resulted in two different takes from two different high-level Microsoft managers, Teper reminisced. He said Gates asked a lot of questions about the long-term architecture (SQL Server, .Net, etc.) behind what evolved into SharePoint. Gates also asked a lot of usability questions, Teper said. Ballmer, on the other hand, used his classic "I don't get this" line of questioning to bring SharePoint's charter into focus.

"Ballmer said we need to make it simple, simple, simple," Teper said. "He wanted to keep the message very simple."



So how did all this talk about simplicity yield a product that even Teper himself acknowledges is quite ambitious and complex? (He called it this week the "ultimate Swiss Army Knife.")

"We may have oversold how simple SharePoint was to deploy," Teper acknowledged. But over the last three years, and this year in particular, there's been a lot of focus from the team around improving SharePoint's documentation, guidance and training, he said.

Throughout the past decade, "our (SharePoint) vision has been consistent, though the scope has grown," Teper said. "Even though it had a lot of different names, we already were talking about things like social networking. Back in 2001, we had the idea of giving everyone their own Web site. We did that before FaceBook or MySpace were launched."
