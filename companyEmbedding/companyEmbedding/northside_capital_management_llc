 Strategy - Northside Capital Management

















































CLIENT LOGIN 



















Strategy

Comprehensive top-down macroeconomic assessment
Bottom-up investment analysis
Wary of consensus thinking
Emphasis on attractive (cheap) relative valuation
Seek opportunities in areas that are early in process of capital formation
Tax efficiency
Tactical tilts and rebalancing
Broad diversification of sources of risk and drivers of return

Benefits to you:

Insightful, integrated, forward-looking, global investment structure
Hands-on monitoring, risk control, and mid-course adjustments
Northside’s strategy lends to a higher level of trust between us


It is axiomatic that growing assets requires the assumption of some level of risk. For most Northside clients, the thought of having to go out and build the family’s wealth a second time is decidedly distressing. This is why we begin with an emphasis on capital preservation. One cannot seek high returns without taking elevated levels of risk, and by risk we do not mean mere volatility — we mean risk of permanent loss. Avoiding such loss is foremost in our minds. Northside’s client investment structures feature broadly diversified strategies with asymmetric expected return distributions and a low reliance on market direction for success. We look for substantial but temporary distortions in pricing relationships, e.g. non-agency residential mortgage backed securities in 2011, or economic activity where the appetite for capital dwarfs the current supply, e.g. U.S. domestic energy production in 2012. There are ways to play offense in all environments, but we never lose sight of the vital importance of defense.
