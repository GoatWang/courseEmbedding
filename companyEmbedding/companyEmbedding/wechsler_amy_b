Before relocating to New York, she worked with preeminent Los Angeles plastic surgeon Dr. Grant Stevens, helping to plan and provide a variety of nonsurgical cosmetic techniques. During this time she gained experience with a full spectrum of leading-edge dermatologic procedures, and her exceptional aptitude for the work made her a sought-after trainer.Skin CancerBoth benign and malignant lesions, including cysts, moles, lipomas, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, are carefully excised. Laboratory tests are conducted to diagnose or rule out malignancy, and any appropriate follow-up treatment and care are promptly ordered. Special attention is paid to creating the best possible cosmetic closure at the site of excision.DermatologyWhile at Payne Whitney Clinic, Dr. Wechsler often observed the effects of psychological factors on patients’ outward appearance and dermatologic health. Realizing that this powerful connection was largely unaddressed, she completed a residency in dermatology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center. Her training reinforced her conviction that treating skin without addressing psychological factors brings limited success, and she began to develop a breakthrough approach drawing on both medical disciplines.Acne TreatmentIsolaz is a painless, dual-pronged acne treatment that combines vacuum and light therapy to purify pores, using a breakthrough technology called Photopneumatics. During a gentle survey of affected skin, the Isolaz vacuum removes impurities while a light beam kills acne-causing bacteria and inhibits oil production, helping to prevent future breakouts. Visible results occur within 24-48 hours, including reduced redness, restored skin color and flattening of blemishes.CystEczemaWe treat a full roster of conditions affecting children and teens, including birthmarks, acne, warts, molluscum, moles and eczema. A comprehensive slate of highly effective treatment options is available, from lasers to lotions and myriad other therapies. We’ll review every possible regimen with you to determine the best approach before designing an individualized treatment plan.LesionsThis versatile, deep-healing laser therapy dramatically resurfaces skin from within, making it an effective choice for a wide range of goals, from healing unsightly scars to maximizing youthful beauty. Fraxel addresses imperfections such as large pores, uneven texture, wrinkles, acne and surgical scars, age spots, hyperpigmentation and precancerous lesions by eliminating damaged skin and stimulating your skin’s natural healing process, catalyzing the growth of younger skin.Chemical PeelsFrom "lunchtime" salicylic acid peels to deeper, more dramatic treatments, our chemical peels remove dull outer layers and generate new, undamaged skin with stunning results. Typically performed in a series, these treatments can correct a variety of problems - lines and wrinkles, sun damage and acne - and can be applied to the face, back or chest.Skin CareAs an expert on skin health, Dr. Wechsler serves as an advisor for Chanel Skin Care. In a series of informative videos for Chanel, she discusses topics such as the mind-beauty connection, UVA and UVB sun damage, skincare mistakes and dermatology treatments.MicrodermabrasionThis state-of-the-art technique improves upon conventional microdermabrasion by using diamond-tipped wands to gently abrade the skin, performing intensive exfoliation. The skin’s outermost layer is removed, prompting the growth of healthy new skin. After the treatment, you can opt for an application of Chanel Hydra Beauty Sérum, which seals in the skin-rejuvenating benefits for deep hydration and an even more polished, longer-lasting finish.Plastic SurgeonsBotoxEveryday stress and overuse force fine lines into deeper ones over time, but Botox relieves this process and offers your skin a respite. A quick and safe procedure, Botox eases frown lines, crow’s feet, furrows in the brow, lip lines and other wrinkles by relaxing key muscle fibers for months at a time, leaving you with a younger appearance. Botox injections can also be used to block nerve impulses that cause excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) in the underarms, scalp, hands and feet.Plastic SurgeryDoctor 90210 as well as a variety of major news media. She is a member of the American Academy of Physician Assistants, the Academy of Plastic Surgery Physician Assistants, the Society of Dermatology Physician Assistants and the California Academy of Physician Assistants.Face LiftAt a fraction of the cost and time of a facelift, our dermal fillers achieve many of the same results, for months or even years at a time. Fillers such as Restylane L, Juvederm XC, Voluma and Sculptra support faltering skin to restore volume, smooth away lines and reduce the appearance of scarring. Most treatments create a healthier appearance in just 30 minutes.Body ContouringThe treatment is performed by Laura Pietrzak, MSHS, PA-C, a leading expert in aesthetics and body contouring. Laura has helped countless patients achieve the look they want by eliminating bulges at the hips, belly, arms, back, male chest, thighs and elsewhere. She has more experience in CoolSculpting than any other medical professional in the world, and her treatment protocols for CoolSculpting have become the industry standard.General PractitionersWartsPsychiatristsPsychiatryOur practice is built on the unique philosophy of Dr. Amy Wechsler, a physician with a diverse background combining dermatology and psychiatry. We treat a full range of skin conditions with care and expertise, using advanced treatment modalities and state-of-the-art technology.Send to PhoneDR Amy B Wechsler MD PC3 E 69th St, New York, NY 10021(212) 396-2500Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailDR Amy B Wechsler MD PC3 E 69th St, New York, NY 10021(212) 396-2500Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
