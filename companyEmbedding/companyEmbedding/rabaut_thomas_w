February  27, 2008    BLOOMFIELD, Conn., Feb. 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kaman Corp.
(Nasdaq: KAMN) today announced that Thomas Rabaut has been named to the
company's Board of Directors, effective March 1, 2008.
    Mr. Rabaut, 59, recently retired as President of BAE Systems Land &
Armaments of Arlington, Virginia, a $3.7 billion global leader in the design,

    A graduate of the United States Military Academy, West Point (BS), and the
Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration (MBA), Mr. Rabaut started
his industrial career with FMC Corporation in 1977, following his military
service.  At FMC, he held a variety of operational leadership positions,
becoming VP and General Manager of the FMC Defense Systems Group in 1993.  The
business was renamed United Defense LP in 1994 and was acquired by the Carlyle
Group in 1997, at which time he became President and CEO.  In 2005, United
Defense LP was purchased by BAE Systems plc, and he was appointed as the first
president of the BAE Systems Land and Armaments Group, a position he held
until his retirement.  Mr. Rabaut currently serves as a board member of CYTEC
Industries, Inc. and Burdeshaw and Associates; and as a senior advisor with
the Carlyle Group.
    Neal J. Keating, Kaman President and CEO, said: "Tom Rabaut brings
extensive global experience and strong operating skills to Kaman Corporation.
I am very pleased to welcome him to our board, and look forward to working
with him as the company builds on the accomplishments of recent years."
    Kaman Corp., headquartered in Bloomfield, Conn., conducts business in the
aerospace and industrial distribution markets.

			Mr. Rabaut, age 68, currently serves as an Operating Executive for The Carlyle Group and has held that position since 2007. In that capacity, he has fulfilled a number of executive roles, including current Chairman of SIGNODE Industries and Walbro LLC, and past Chairman of Veyance Technologies and ARINC Industries, Inc. He also serves on the board of KAMAN Corporation and is Chairman of the Board of Saab Defence and Security LLC. Mr. Rabaut also served on the board of CYTEC Industries Inc. until it was acquired by the SOLVAY Group. Prior to joining Carlyle as an Operating Executive, Mr. Rabaut served as President of Land and Armaments Group BAE Systems from 2005 to 2007. From 1994 to 2005, he was the President and CEO of United Defense Industries, Inc., or United Defense. It was a global leader in the design, development and production of military systems, including combat vehicles, naval guns, missile launching systems, and the upgrade and repair of U. S. Navy ships. It was one of Carlyle's most successful investments and was acquired by BAE Systems in 2005. Prior to his tenure at United Defense, Mr. Rabaut served 17 years in primarily general management positions in FMC Corporation. This included business activities in a variety of industries including Power Transmission, Petroleum Equipment and defense.
 
Mr. Rabaut is a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and the Harvard Graduate School of Business, is a qualified U.S. Army Ranger and served overseas in the U.S. Army as a Military Intelligence Officer from 1971-1975. Mr. Rabaut currently serves on the Council of Trustees of the Association of the U. S. Army and on the board of the Washington, DC Chapter of the Posse Foundation.
 
Our Board concluded that Mr. Rabaut should serve as a director given his extensive senior executive leadership experience across a variety of relevant industries and his current role as an operating executive with Carlyle. Mr. Rabaut's professional and board experience provides additional perspective about governance, strategy, risk management and succession planning.
