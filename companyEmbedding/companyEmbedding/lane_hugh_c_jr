Hugh C. Lane
HUGH C. LANE JR., President/CEO of Bank of South Carolina Corporation, is a 61-
year-old, fourth generation banker and a native of Charleston, South Carolina.
Mr. Lane was graduated from the Choate School in Wallingford, Connecticut, and,
in 1970, earned a BA in Economics from the University of Pennsylvania. Upon
graduation, he entered the U.S. Navy with the rank of Ensign. After receiving an

business and community leaders who shared his antipathy for interstate banking,
and organized The Bank of South Carolina. In addition to his responsibilities at
The Bank of South Carolina, Mr. Lane has served as a member of the Advisory
Committee for the ACE Basin National Estuarine Research Reserve System and is

PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

 Hugh C. Lane | Legacy of Leadership Profile 



















Hugh C. Lane
(1914-2005)
For 38 years, Hugh C. Lane was the driving force behind the growth of the Citizens and Southern National Bank of South Carolina, years that spanned the upheaval of the New Deal, a half-dozen recessions, and C&S's pioneering of the computer in banking in South Carolina.    
Lane went to work for C&S in Charleston in 1937 and by 1944 had been named president. At the time, C&S had branches in Charleston, Columbia, and Spartanburg and deposits of $63.9 million. When he retired in 1974, C&S had 73 branches in 24 cities and deposits of $600 million.    
Hugh Comer Lane was born March 5, 1914, in Savannah, Georgia, the son of Mills B. and Mary Comer Lane. He graduated from the Asheville School in 1932 and the University of North Carolina in 1935.
His father was a founder and first president of Citizens & Southern Bank of Georgia, which was created in 1928 by the merger of Citizens Bank of Savannah and the Southern Bank of Georgia.
Both his father and grandfather were bankers. In 1847, his grandfather, Remer Y. Lane, established a bank in Valdosta, Georgia, and Mills Lane went to work for his father in 1881.
Later, he moved to Savannah with the intention of starting his own bank, but accepted a job as vice president of the Citizens Bank of Georgia. In 1891, he became both a director and vice president, and in 1901 was named president of the bank. Shortly afterward, Mills Lane and his associates bought the Southern Bank of Georgia, and Citizens & Southern Bank was created. After considerable growth, the bank opened branches in Charleston, Columbia, and Spartanburg.
Hugh Lane began his banking career with Albany Exchange National Bank in Albany, Georgia. His older brother, Mills B. Lane, Jr., was already on the executive ladder in the Georgia C&S Bank, so Hugh Lane moved to Charleston in 1937 to become assistant to Angus E. Bird, then president of C&S in Charleston.    
In 1940, Lane helped persuade his father and the management of C&S Holding Company to create separate banks for Georgia and South Carolina, primarily to give customers in South Carolina a local bank. In 1944, he became president of the C&S National Bank of South Carolina.
Under Lane's leadership, C&S was a pioneer in the formation of a separate installment loan department, and he worked to expand its services statewide. In 1956, C&S merged with Growers Bank and Trust in Inman, and the next year it opened its first office in Greenville, thus providing the bank with offices in the state's four major cities.
In 1960, Lane was elected chairman of C&S. The bank continued to grow, and offices were opened in 10 other South Carolina cities and towns. The bank installed computers during that time.
The increased speed and efficiency of computer banking allowed C&S to drop all service charges on personal checking accounts with a $100 minimum balance, which was a first in the state.
In 1969, the C&S Corporation of South Carolina was formed as the bank holding company, and Lane moved up to chairman of the C&S Corporation, the position he held until his retirement in 1974.
Prior to his retirement, Lane served as chairman of the board of several C&S affiliates, including the C&S Corporation, the C&S Realty Corporation, the C&S Computer Services Corporation, and the C&S Housing Corporation. He was chairman of the Carolina National Mortgage Investment Corporation, Inc., and president of the South Carolina Bankers Association.
Lane is a past director of The Citadel Development Foundation and a member and past president of the St. Andrews Society and the Navy League. He is a member and former director of the Coastal Carolina Council, Boy Scouts of America.
He was a director of the Business Development Corporation of South Carolina and served on the South Carolina Insurance Commission for six years, was chairman of the South Carolina State Housing Authority, and is a former trustee of South Carolina State College, Converse College, and the South Carolina Foundation of Independent Colleges.
He was a founder of the Trident United Way and a past president. He also served on the boards of Roper Hospital, Ashley Hall School, the Charleston Museum, and the Historic Charleston Foundation. In 1955, the Greater Charleston Chamber of Commerce named him its Man of the Year.
He received honorary doctoral degrees from the University of South Carolina, The Citadel, and the Medical University of South Carolina.
In 1982, the Hugh C. Lane Chair of Economic Theory was established at the University of South Carolina College of Business Administration. The chair was endowed by the foundations of Daniel International of Greenville, Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company and C&S Bank of Columbia, and Johnson, Lane, Smith & Company of Savannah.
For his long life of community service and achievements, Lane received the Charleston Exchange Club's 1995 Golden Book of Deeds award. The award is the club's highest honor and has been given only 16 times in the past 36 years.
Lane married Beverly Glover in 1946, and they are the parents of four children: Hugh C. Lane, Jr., Beverly Lane Jost, Kathleen Lane Schenck, and Charles G. Lane.
Lane entered the South Carolina Business Hall of Fame in 1985.
