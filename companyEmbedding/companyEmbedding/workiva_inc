History[edit]
Workiva was founded as Webfilings in 2008 by three technology entrepreneurs who'd created and run Engineering Animation Inc. (EAI), a 3D computer animation company, also based in Ames—Workiva COO, Martin Vanderploeg, a former engineering professor at Iowa State University (ISU); Jeff Trom, COO; and Matthew M. Rizai, CEO. They sold EAI to EDS/UGS PLM,[3] and it is now a division of Siemens, the German technology multinational.
WebFilings changed its name to Workiva in June 2014 and went public in December 2014 (NYSE: WK).[4][5]
Its customers include Amgen, Colgate Palmolive, Chevron and Google. The company has been recognized as an innovator in its field. A May 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant analysis of the ten leading financial corporate performance management software firms, ranked Workiva in the “Leader” quadrant along with three others: SAP SE, Oracle and BlackLine.[1] In Deloitte's 2015 Technology Fast 500 survey of fastest growing technology companies in America, Workiva ranked fiftieth among all software companies.[6] In February 2017, it won the Business Intelligence Group's BIG Innovation Award.
Applications[edit]
Workiva first SaaS product was SEC reporting software designed to enable corporations to automate their SEC filings by using a proprietary system of document tags and linking.[1] The platform also enabled companies to file electronically directly with the SEC, using the business mark-up language XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language), required by the SEC.[7] A Workiva customer was the first company to file Inline XBRL with the SEC.[8]
The company has since expanded to include other corporate financial and compliance reporting functions, including:

Sarbanes-Oxley reporting and Recovery and Resolution Plans (RRP) - WDesk integrates documentation required for financial statements, risk assessment and forecasts required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act into a single view.[9]

SEC Filing - including EDGAR HTML conversion and xBRL mapping, creating and filing documentation for IPOs, S-1s, 10Ks, 10-Qs, 20-Fs, as well as the reports needed to meet Investor Relations, Mutual Fund reporting regulations.

CAFR and State and Local Reporting - used by municipal securities issuers or agents for preparing documentation for Continuing Disclosures to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and documentation required of state and local education departments to meet mandated guidelines.

Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - WDesk supports most global reporting frameworks that track CSR including Global Responsibility Index, the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices.

Internal Reporting - these tasks include compiling management reports, risk assessments, board reports, among others.[1]

Operations[edit]
The company is headquartered in Ames, Iowa and has domestic offices in Denver and Boulder, CO; Missoula and Bozeman, MT; Chicago, IL; Columbus, GA; Dallas, TX; Miami, FL; New York, NY; Scottsdale, AZ; Seattle, WA; and international offices in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Sault Ste.

History[edit]
Workiva was founded as Webfilings in 2008 by three technology entrepreneurs who'd created and run Engineering Animation Inc. (EAI), a 3D computer animation company, also based in Ames—Workiva COO, Martin Vanderploeg, a former engineering professor at Iowa State University (ISU); Jeff Trom, COO; and Matthew M. Rizai, CEO. They sold EAI to EDS/UGS PLM,[3] and it is now a division of Siemens, the German technology multinational.
WebFilings changed its name to Workiva in June 2014 and went public in December 2014 (NYSE: WK).[4][5]
Its customers include Amgen, Colgate Palmolive, Chevron and Google. The company has been recognized as an innovator in its field. A May 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant analysis of the ten leading financial corporate performance management software firms, ranked Workiva in the “Leader” quadrant along with three others: SAP SE, Oracle and BlackLine.[1] In Deloitte's 2015 Technology Fast 500 survey of fastest growing technology companies in America, Workiva ranked fiftieth among all software companies.[6] In February 2017, it won the Business Intelligence Group's BIG Innovation Award.
Applications[edit]
Workiva first SaaS product was SEC reporting software designed to enable corporations to automate their SEC filings by using a proprietary system of document tags and linking.[1] The platform also enabled companies to file electronically directly with the SEC, using the business mark-up language XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language), required by the SEC.[7] A Workiva customer was the first company to file Inline XBRL with the SEC.[8]
The company has since expanded to include other corporate financial and compliance reporting functions, including:

Sarbanes-Oxley reporting and Recovery and Resolution Plans (RRP) - WDesk integrates documentation required for financial statements, risk assessment and forecasts required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act into a single view.[9]

SEC Filing - including EDGAR HTML conversion and xBRL mapping, creating and filing documentation for IPOs, S-1s, 10Ks, 10-Qs, 20-Fs, as well as the reports needed to meet Investor Relations, Mutual Fund reporting regulations.

CAFR and State and Local Reporting - used by municipal securities issuers or agents for preparing documentation for Continuing Disclosures to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and documentation required of state and local education departments to meet mandated guidelines.

Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - WDesk supports most global reporting frameworks that track CSR including Global Responsibility Index, the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices.

Internal Reporting - these tasks include compiling management reports, risk assessments, board reports, among others.[1]

Operations[edit]
The company is headquartered in Ames, Iowa and has domestic offices in Denver and Boulder, CO; Missoula and Bozeman, MT; Chicago, IL; Columbus, GA; Dallas, TX; Miami, FL; New York, NY; Scottsdale, AZ; Seattle, WA; and international offices in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Sault Ste.

History[edit]
Workiva was founded as Webfilings in 2008 by three technology entrepreneurs who'd created and run Engineering Animation Inc. (EAI), a 3D computer animation company, also based in Ames—Workiva COO, Martin Vanderploeg, a former engineering professor at Iowa State University (ISU); Jeff Trom, COO; and Matthew M. Rizai, CEO. They sold EAI to EDS/UGS PLM,[3] and it is now a division of Siemens, the German technology multinational.
WebFilings changed its name to Workiva in June 2014 and went public in December 2014 (NYSE: WK).[4][5]
Its customers include Amgen, Colgate Palmolive, Chevron and Google. The company has been recognized as an innovator in its field. A May 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant analysis of the ten leading financial corporate performance management software firms, ranked Workiva in the “Leader” quadrant along with three others: SAP SE, Oracle and BlackLine.[1] In Deloitte's 2015 Technology Fast 500 survey of fastest growing technology companies in America, Workiva ranked fiftieth among all software companies.[6] In February 2017, it won the Business Intelligence Group's BIG Innovation Award.
Applications[edit]
Workiva first SaaS product was SEC reporting software designed to enable corporations to automate their SEC filings by using a proprietary system of document tags and linking.[1] The platform also enabled companies to file electronically directly with the SEC, using the business mark-up language XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language), required by the SEC.[7] A Workiva customer was the first company to file Inline XBRL with the SEC.[8]
The company has since expanded to include other corporate financial and compliance reporting functions, including:

Sarbanes-Oxley reporting and Recovery and Resolution Plans (RRP) - WDesk integrates documentation required for financial statements, risk assessment and forecasts required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act into a single view.[9]

SEC Filing - including EDGAR HTML conversion and xBRL mapping, creating and filing documentation for IPOs, S-1s, 10Ks, 10-Qs, 20-Fs, as well as the reports needed to meet Investor Relations, Mutual Fund reporting regulations.

CAFR and State and Local Reporting - used by municipal securities issuers or agents for preparing documentation for Continuing Disclosures to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and documentation required of state and local education departments to meet mandated guidelines.

Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - WDesk supports most global reporting frameworks that track CSR including Global Responsibility Index, the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices.

Internal Reporting - these tasks include compiling management reports, risk assessments, board reports, among others.[1]

Operations[edit]
The company is headquartered in Ames, Iowa and has domestic offices in Denver and Boulder, CO; Missoula and Bozeman, MT; Chicago, IL; Columbus, GA; Dallas, TX; Miami, FL; New York, NY; Scottsdale, AZ; Seattle, WA; and international offices in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, London, U.K., and Amsterdam, NL.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

History[edit]
Workiva was founded as Webfilings in 2008 by three technology entrepreneurs who'd created and run Engineering Animation Inc. (EAI), a 3D computer animation company, also based in Ames—Workiva COO, Martin Vanderploeg, a former engineering professor at Iowa State University (ISU); Jeff Trom, COO; and Matthew M. Rizai, CEO. They sold EAI to EDS/UGS PLM,[3] and it is now a division of Siemens, the German technology multinational.
WebFilings changed its name to Workiva in June 2014 and went public in December 2014 (NYSE: WK).[4][5]
Its customers include Amgen, Colgate Palmolive, Chevron and Google. The company has been recognized as an innovator in its field. A May 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant analysis of the ten leading financial corporate performance management software firms, ranked Workiva in the “Leader” quadrant along with three others: SAP SE, Oracle and BlackLine.[1] In Deloitte's 2015 Technology Fast 500 survey of fastest growing technology companies in America, Workiva ranked fiftieth among all software companies.[6] In February 2017, it won the Business Intelligence Group's BIG Innovation Award.
Applications[edit]
Workiva first SaaS product was SEC reporting software designed to enable corporations to automate their SEC filings by using a proprietary system of document tags and linking.[1] The platform also enabled companies to file electronically directly with the SEC, using the business mark-up language XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language), required by the SEC.[7] A Workiva customer was the first company to file Inline XBRL with the SEC.[8]
The company has since expanded to include other corporate financial and compliance reporting functions, including:

Sarbanes-Oxley reporting and Recovery and Resolution Plans (RRP) - WDesk integrates documentation required for financial statements, risk assessment and forecasts required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act into a single view.[9]

SEC Filing - including EDGAR HTML conversion and xBRL mapping, creating and filing documentation for IPOs, S-1s, 10Ks, 10-Qs, 20-Fs, as well as the reports needed to meet Investor Relations, Mutual Fund reporting regulations.

CAFR and State and Local Reporting - used by municipal securities issuers or agents for preparing documentation for Continuing Disclosures to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and documentation required of state and local education departments to meet mandated guidelines.

Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - WDesk supports most global reporting frameworks that track CSR including Global Responsibility Index, the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices.

Internal Reporting - these tasks include compiling management reports, risk assessments, board reports, among others.[1]

Operations[edit]
The company is headquartered in Ames, Iowa and has domestic offices in Denver and Boulder, CO; Missoula and Bozeman, MT; Chicago, IL; Columbus, GA; Dallas, TX; Miami, FL; New York, NY; Scottsdale, AZ; Seattle, WA; and international offices in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, London, U.K., and Amsterdam, NL.
Related Information[edit]
