With innovative build techniques and eye-popping body shapes, Dean has always stood out in the world of musical instruments. This innovation can easily be traced back to the founder of the company, Dean Zalinsky. A true original, he founded Dean on the idea that your instrument should not only sound the best, it should look the best as well. Nearly 40 years later, Dean continues to craft some of the most impressive instruments on the planet. 

Since the beginning, Dean has been a company that puts the artist first, which is why so many fantastic performers have played Dean instruments throughout the years. Legendary guitarists like Dimebag Darrel, Dave Mustaine, and Michael Schenker, as well as up and comers like Ashley Purdy, Laura Wilde, and Jacky Vincent, have all hit the stage with Dean instruments during their careers, inspiring legions of fans to do the same. 

So what kind of Dean are you looking for? Not only does this versatile company make acoustic and electric guitars and basses, they also make mandolins, banjos, resonators, and more! Having an idea of the type of instrument you want as well as your needs will go a long way in determining your perfect instrument. For example, are you a burgeoning bassist or guitarist who is finally looking to own their first instrument? If so, you should definitely have a look at options such as the Edge 09 Bass and Amp Pack or the Vendetta Guitar & Amp Pack. Sets such as these give you everything you need to practice your chops and prepare for the big stage. Maybe you're looking to really make a statement on stage, then have a look at the Custom Zone Electric Guitar or Custom Zone 4-String Bass Guitar. The Custom Zone instruments are highlighted by absolutely outrageous finishes that will stand out anywhere. And most importantly, they sound just as good as they look! 

And that's only scratching the surface. Dean offers such a diverse number of instruments, that you'll love exploring the catalogue and finding new favorites. Once you do, you'll be ready strum any song you want in no time.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Buy on eBay Today!Find Great ProductsLow Prices, New, and Usedwww.ebay.comHealth & BeautyGet The Latest GadgetsFind The Latest DesignersStyles For Your HomeBaby ItemsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. Law Offices of D Michael Tomkins Inc PSMOVED8420 Dayton Ave NSeattle, WA 98103(206) 547-10005.8 milesAttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection2. Gallagher, Michael D1201 3rd AveSeattle, WA 98101(206) 583-88880.1 milesAttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection3. Michael D Broaddus Atty1201 3rd Ave Ste 4800Seattle, WA 98101(206) 359-86940.1 milesAttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. Handler, Michael D999 3rd Ave Ste 1900Seattle, WA 98104(206) 808-78390.2 milesInsurance AttorneysAttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection5. Williams, Michael D, MD904 7th AveSeattle, WA 98104(206) 860-45030.3 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection6. Dr. Michael D Ingraham, MD1100 9th AveSeattle, WA 98101(206) 223-66000.4 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection7. Kuntz Michael D1111 3rd Ave Ste 3400Seattle, WA 98101(206) 447-89590.1 milesAttorneysCriminal Law AttorneysWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection8. Michael D Norman Attorney1422 Bellevue AveSeattle, WA 98122(206) 621-18710.6 milesAttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection9. Daudt Michael D700 5th Ave Ste 5600Seattle, WA 98104(206) 667-02350.8 milesAttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection10. Kamitsuka, Michael D, Md - Neonatology Dept Of Swedish500 17th AveSeattle, WA 98122(206) 526-26001.2 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection11. Law Offices Of Michael D Sheehan911 1st Ave NSeattle, WA 98109(206) 282-50091.7 milesGeneral Practice AttorneysAttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection12. Weiss, Michael D, MD1959 NE Pacific St # Bb667Seattle, WA 98195(206) 598-42953.3 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection13. Schuffler, Michael D, MD1959 NE Pacific StSeattle, WA 98195(206) 543-59823.3 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection14. McMullan, D Michael4800 Sand Point Way NESeattle, WA 98105(206) 987-21344.7 milesPhysicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection15. D.
