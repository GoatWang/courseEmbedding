Tortoise provides customized, sophisticated investment management and financial advice. Customized means that portfolios are managed with an understanding of each client’s complete financial circumstances. Sophisticated means that we go well beyond the traditional stock-bond-cash allocation and consider a variety of asset classes and strategies. Tortoise emphasizes risk management and a conservative, long-term approach.

Tortoise prides itself on an exceptionally high level of service and responsiveness to its clients. You are important to us. We are available for you.

Your adviser must be worthy of your complete trust. We have structured our business to put your interests first in every aspect of our relationship: we are your fiduciary; we are independent; we are fee-only.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This data is provided for information only and is not intended for trading purposes. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. After the initial public offering, shares are sold on the open market through a stock exchange. As with any other stock, total return and market value will fluctuate so that an investment, when sold, may be worth more or less than its original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only. Due to market volatility, current performance may be lower or higher than the figures shown. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value. Leverage creates risks that may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market value.

13F Filings
The Security, Class, and CUSIP columns in the table below are shown exactly as filed by the investor.
        We do our best to track continuity of investments through acquisitions, and this will be reflected in
        the table as changes in names and cusips.
In addition to descriptive data, performance of the investment
        is shown over time. To calculate quarterly performance, we first calculate cost basis of the shares purchased during the quarter, then use
            that to calculate gross profit. Quarterly return is Gross Profit / Starting Portfolio value.
Note that cost basis is calculated and stored in thousands, so small quarterly changes in shares frequently
            result in a cost basis of zero.
