Bio 
Mohamed (Hasan) Awad grew up in Cairo, Egypt where his professional career included multiple posts in sales, marketing, human resource management, ethics and, corporate social responsibility across a few industries. He's happy to call Eugene home and be a member of the Management department at Lundquist since 2014.The confluence of business, society, and agency fuels most of his research in management. Capitalism, as the predominant socio-economic model globally, is embodied in corporations, financial institutions and global policies and enacted in our daily lives. Capitalist systems are argued to have improved the lives of millions at the cost of environmental damage, severe inequality and crushing cycles of booms and busts. Awad's research is about how we, as individual agents and collectively, can manage, control and change capitalism and its underlying structures of exploitation, appropriation, externalities, overconsumption, and patriarchy, while nurturing the more beneficial efficiencies and technological innovations.Awad's research interests are in social movements, sustainability, culture and institutional logics, business ethics, and food systems.

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Mohamed Awad has the following 7 areas of expertise,  1 specialty and 1 board certification.                     Family Medicine
    A family practitioner is a doctor who specializes in caring for people of all ages, at all stages of life. Rather than focusing on the treatment of one disease or patient population, family practitioners are often the doctors that people see for their everyday ailments, like cold and flu or respiratory infections, and health screenings. When necessary, family practitioners will provide referrals for conditions that require the expertise of another specialist.


    The doctors may also provide physicals, inoculations, prenatal care, treat chronic diseases, like diabetes and asthma, and provide advice on disease prevention.
