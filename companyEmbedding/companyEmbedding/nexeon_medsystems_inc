R&D Special Focus: Bioelectronics
June 30, 2017 - by Laura Panjwani of R&D Magazine
Non-invasive bioelectronic devices offer the potential to reduce surgery risk and recovery time. However, electronics can also be used internally, and have the potential to replace or reduce the number of pharmaceutical interventions required. They can be helpful in areas where pharmaceutical interventions are not effective enough. One area showing promise is deep brain stimulation, a practice used to treat neurological disorders like Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor. To learn more about this, R&D Magazine spoke with Will Rosellini, a retired professional minor-league pitcher whose interest in the nervous system led him to get six graduate degrees and start Nexeon MedSystems, a bioelectronics company.

From Baseball to Bioelectronics: Pro Pitcher Turned CEO Scientist Explains Deep Brain Stimulation Tech
June 15, 2017 by Laura Panjwani of R&D Magazine
"Right now there has been almost 135,000 patients implanted with a [deep brain stimulation] device, but not ours. It is a very safe, well-tolerated procedure. Patients regain almost the level of function they had before their disease. The challenge now is— how do we make the procedure easier for the neurologist to maintain the patient in the therapeutic window? The question really is not will it work, the question it is how do we make it better so we can get more patients implanted."

Alternative Paths to Public Markets: Nexeon's Form 10 IPO & Capital Consciousness
May 30, 2017 by Javier Hasse of BenZingA
...Rosellini explained how Nexeon was going to enter the public markets through an alternative mechanism that does not involve the same steps as most IPOs in the U.S.
Following the steps of companies like Intel Corporation, which raised only $5 million when it went public, Nexeon will try to be “really capital-conscious and prove out the business at each stage,” the CEO said. “That way, we will be able to look at our investors and tell them we thought about them, as opposed to raising a ton of VC [venture capital] money at crazy valuations, not wanting to go public, continuing to try to drive and grow and get market share, but never getting to profitability.”

Nexeon CEO on the Brain Chip Targeting Parkinson's, Lou Gehrig's Disease, and Other "Cyborg" Technologies
May 29, 2017 by Javier Hasse of BenZingA
Nexeon is currently producing a deep brain stimulation device, expected to launch in Europe in the first quarter of 2018. The company’s first commercial product basically consists of an implant, similar to a pacemaker, which connects via Bluetooth to an Apple Inc. iPad clinical programmer. This allows users to turn the device on and off, steer the current to the places that need it, and even record local field potentials, “which tell them what the brain is doing, and when it is being stimulated or it’s going into a tremor state,” Rosellini explained.
Nexeon’s product will initially target Parkinson’s disease-affected brains. However, the company is also conducting preclinical studies in dysphasia from ALS, "Lou Gehrig’s disease," and recently completed a mouse study for overactive bladder and asthma, with positive results.
“We expect to move into other markets with the device once we launch a successful DBS product,” Rosellini added.

Nexeon MedSystems is a bioelectronics company developing active medical devices for the treatment of chronic medical conditions.  Medtech companies have never had a better opportunity to be the connective tissue that binds the healthcare delivery system to the patient. As hospitals and clinicians seek to deliver more health services in the home instead of the hospital, medtech companies can be key to bridging distance, time, and boundaries between clinicians and patients.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.
