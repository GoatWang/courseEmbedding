Early life[edit]
Wheaton was born July 29, 1972, in Burbank, California, to Debra Nordean "Debbie" (née O'Connor), an actress, and Richard William Wheaton, Jr., a medical specialist.[3][4][5] He has a brother, Jeremy, and a sister, Amy.[6] Both appeared uncredited in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "When the Bough Breaks".[7] Amy also appeared alongside Wil in the 1987 film The Curse.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Early work[edit]
Wheaton made his acting debut in the television film A Long Way Home (1981), and his first cinema role was as Martin Brisby in the animated film The Secret of NIMH (1982), the movie adaptation of Robert C. O'Brien's book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (1971). He had a minor role in The Last Starfighter (1984) as Louis's friend, but it was cut. He first gained widespread attention for playing Gordie Lachance in Stand by Me (1986), the film adaptation of Stephen King's novella The Body which was originally published in 1982's Different Seasons".[2][8]
Star Trek[edit]
From 1987 to 1991, he played Wesley Crusher in the first four seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation. This became a recurring role later in the series. A vocal group of Trekkies disliked his Star Trek character and, by extension, Wheaton himself during TNG's first run. Wheaton commented about his critics in an interview for WebTalk Radio:

Later, I determined that the people who were really, really cruel – like the Usenet weenies – really are a statistically insignificant number of people. And I know, just over the years from people who've e-mailed me at my web site and people who I've talked to since I started going to Star Trek conventions again in the last five years, that there are so many more people who really enjoyed everything about the show, including my performance, including the character.[9]

Wheaton's notoriety among Star Trek fandom is covered in a number of web comics. For example, ArcaneTimes (March 25, 2005) offers a sympathetic position;[10] Something Positive presents a range of opinions on the storyline Mike's Kid;[11] and Abstruse Goose tries to distinguish between the character and the actor.[12]
Post-Star Trek[edit]




Wil Wheaton in 2001



Wheaton played Joey Trotta in the action film Toy Soldiers (1991). After leaving Star Trek, he moved to Topeka, Kansas, to work for NewTek, where he helped to develop the Video Toaster 4000 doing product testing and quality control[13][14] and later used his public profile to serve as a technology evangelist for the product.[15] Wheaton said this was a period of growth in his life, and living away from Los Angeles helped him deal with anger problems.
Afterward, he returned to Los Angeles, attended acting school for five years, and then re-entered the acting world.[16][17] In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wheaton appeared in several independent films, including the award-winning The Good Things (2001), in which he portrays a frustrated Kansas tollbooth worker; it was selected Best Short Film at the 2002 Deauville Film Festival.[2][18] For his performance in Jane White Is Sick & Twisted (2002) he received the Best Actor award at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival.[19]
Voice work[edit]




Wheaton at W00tstock 2.4 in San Diego, July 2010


Wheaton has worked as a voice actor in animation, video games and audiobooks, beginning with the role of young Martin Brisby in The Secret of NIMH at age 10. His most noteworthy credits include the roles of Aqualad in the cartoons Teen Titans and Teen Titans Go!, the voice of radio journalist Richard Burns in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Kyle in the Nickelodeon cartoon, Kyle + Rosemary as well as himself and various other characters on both Family Guy and Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy. Wheaton also featured as the second Blue Beetle, Ted Kord, on Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Dr. Peter Meechum in Generator Rex, Mike Morningstar / Darkstar in Ben 10: Alien Force, Ben 10: Ultimate Alien & Ben 10: Omniverse". Additonally Wheaton took upon the Anime roles of Yakumo in Kurokami: The Animation, Menma in Naruto, Hans in Slayers Evolution-R, Aaron Terzieff in Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. He also appeared as himself in a skit on nerdcore rapper MC Frontalot's 2008 album Final Boss attempting to be a rapper, whose rhymes only involved shellfish. Wheaton later collaborated with Frontalot on "Your Friend Wil", a track from the 2010 album Zero Day on the subject of Wheaton's law, which states "don't be a dick"[20][21][non-primary source needed] (the phrase was in use before Wheaton's blog post).[22] Wheaton and Frontalot have both appeared at the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX).[2]
Wheaton has also narrated a number of bestselling audiobooks, mostly in the science-fiction and fantasy category, including Ready Player One by Ernest Cline (Wheaton also exists in the novel's universe, described as being joint President, along with Cory Doctorow, of the virtual world Oasis, which is the setting for much of the book), "Armada" also by Cline, Redshirts by John Scalzi, and books 6–10 of the Chronicles of Amber series by Roger Zelazny.
Television and web[edit]
Wheaton was a contestant on a 2001 episode of The Weakest Link featuring Star Trek actors attempting to win money for charity. He has made guest appearances on the November 23, 2007 episode of the TV series Numb3rs, and the October 22, 2008 episode of the series Criminal Minds, and appeared in Internet presentations, including a cameo in a comedy sketch ("Lock Out") for LoadingReadyRun[23] (and a reprise of the same the following year, in CommodoreHustle 4), and the May 30, 2008 episode of the Internet series Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show. From 2009-2011, Wheaton appeared in seasons 3, 4, and 5 of the web series The Guild as Fawkes, the leader for a rival guild known as Axis of Anarchy.[24] Wheaton credits his roles in Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show and The Guild for reigniting his career by encouraging him to seek out roles as the "Villain You Love To Hate" stock character.[25] He also appears in seasons 2, 3, and 4 of the TV series Leverage, as rival computer hacker Colin "Chaos" Mason, antagonist to Leverage team hacker Alec Hardison. He makes regular appearances in many web productions for Geek & Sundry, including hosting TableTop, a board game based show,[26] and Titansgrave, a roleplaying game based show.[27]
He appeared as a fictionalized version of himself in several episodes of the sitcom The Big Bang Theory, starting in season 3, episode 5: "The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary" (2009). On the show, Wheaton behaves in comically petty and manipulative ways towards main character Sheldon Cooper, who regards him as an archenemy until the season 5 episode "The Russian Rocket Reaction", when they make amends and become friends. Wheaton appears in 12 episodes in a recurring, guest-starring role on Eureka, playing Dr. Isaac Parrish, the head of the Non-Lethal Weapons Lab at Global Dynamics and a thorn in Fargo's side.[28] Wheaton also voices the character of the former scoutmaster and current sous-chef Earl Harlan in the popular dark, surreal-comedy podcast Welcome to Night Vale.
Wheaton appears as Alexander Rook in the Syfy TV series Dark Matter, based on the eponymous comic book. The TV series premiered on June 12, 2015.[29]
Hosting[edit]
From September 2006 to September 2007, Wheaton hosted a Revision3 syndicated video podcast called InDigital along with Jessica Corbin and veteran host Hahn Choi. He hosted a NASA video on the Mars Curiosity rover which landed on Monday August 6, 2012.[30] He has also hosted "2nd Watch," interviews with cast members and producers of the science-fiction series Falling Skies that appears on-line after each episode.[31]  On April 3, 2014, Wheaton announced on his blog that his new show called The Wil Wheaton Project would premiere on the SyFy network at 10pm on May 27 for an initial projected run of twelve episodes.[32][33] However, on August 29, Wheaton blogged that SyFy canceled the show after only one season.[34]
Other ventures[edit]
Games[edit]
In 2003, Wheaton mentioned his love for the game of poker on his blog. The following year, he began writing more extensively about his poker-playing experiences, including stories about playing Texas hold 'em tournaments locally and in Las Vegas. Eventually, he worked up to regular play, including a run at the 2005 World Poker Tour Championships. On June 23, 2005, Wheaton accepted an invitation to join Team PokerStars.[35] He went on to play in that year's World Series of Poker and was the guest speaker for the 2005 BARGE Banquet. In June 2007, he announced he would no longer be on Team Pokerstars due to changes in the U.S. legal system that would cause poker sites to have to focus on European and Asian markets[36] and held a farewell Pokerstars tournament on June 5, 2007, which he titled So Long and Thanks for All the Chips.[37]
Wheaton is a Dungeons & Dragons player,[38] and played during the PAX 2010 event using the 4th edition rules. Wheaton, along with webcartoonists Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik of Penny Arcade, and Scott Kurtz of PvP, played in front of a live audience. The game was hosted and recorded by Wizards of the Coast with Chris Perkins as the dungeonmaster.[39] Wheaton also played D&D 4th edition at the PAX 2011 event using the 4th edition rules, and used the D&D Next play test rules at PAX Prime 2012. Wheaton also hosts the web series TableTop, where he explains how to play various card, board and dice games, then plays a round with celebrity guests.[40] Wheaton also starred in the Kickstarter-funded game There Came an Echo by Iridium Studios.[41] In Dungeons and Dragons Online, he became the dungeon master of the Temple of Elemental Evil quests.[42]
Nintendo of America announced on Twitter that Wheaton would be voicing Abraham Lincoln in Code Name: STEAM.[43]
Wheaton announced in February, 2015, that he was chosen to provide voiceover talent for the upcoming strategy role-playing video game Firefly Online, a game based on Joss Whedon's Firefly sci-fi franchise.[44]
Wheaton has spoken out against misogyny in video game culture,[45][46] and wrote a profile of Anita Sarkeesian for the 2015 Time 100.[47]
Wheaton also does the voice narration on the Secret Hitler companion app for the Secret Hitler social deduction game.[48]
Comic book[edit]
A fictionalized version of Wheaton was included in the comic book PS 238, in which he harbors the power of telekinesis. Wheaton's debut comic book The Guild: Fawkes, which he wrote alongside Felicia Day, was released on May 23, 2012.[49]
Audiobooks[edit]
Wheaton has recorded several of his non-self-published books as downloadable audiobooks. These include Just a Geek, Dancing Barefoot, The Happiest Days of Our Lives, and his Criminal Minds diary from Sunken Treasure. He also released excerpts of Memories of The Future: Vol 1 as free podcasts. He has also narrated several audiobooks by other authors, including Ready Player One and Armada by Ernest Cline;[50][51] Masters of Doom by David Kushner;[52] Homeland by Cory Doctorow;[citation needed] Fuzzy Nation, The Android's Dream, Agent to the Stars, Redshirts and Lock In, all by John Scalzi;[53][54][55][56] Peter and Max: A Fables Novel by Bill Willingham;[57] "Byways", part of METAtropolis: Cascadia by Tobias Buckell;[58] "What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Hypothetical Questions" by Randall Munroe;[59] and Boneshaker by Cherie Priest.[60] Similarly, Wheaton has provided the voice-over for the digital gamebook, Trial of the Clone.[61]
Live shows[edit]
Wheaton has performed improvisational and sketch comedy at the ACME Comedy Theater in Hollywood.[62] He has a traveling sketch comedy/improv troupe called "EarnestBorg9" that performs science fiction-related comedy at conventions.[63] Wheaton is one of the three headline acts of the w00tstock shows, appearing in nearly all of them when his filming schedule has allowed.[citation needed] He has also guest starred in one of the Welcome to Night Vale live stage shows, playing the role of a radio station intern named after himself, the character meeting a prompt demise as is the podcast's tradition for interns.[citation needed] He also plays a character in the podcast, Earl Harlan, a friend of the main character. He was originally a 20-something regular guy, when he was dragged away to the "Eternal Scout" ceremony and disappeared. He then returned as a 53 year old with a son, and was the sous chef of Night Vale's top restaurant.[citation needed]
Writing[edit]
Wheaton runs his own blog, Wil Wheaton Dot Net. Between 2001 and late 2004, he operated a message board, known as "The Soapbox" or "Paracosm," as part of the blog site. Two collections of writings taken from postings to the message board have been published, titled Boxer Shorts (ISBN 1-932461-00-0) and Boxer Shorts Redux (ISBN 1-932461-03-5). He contributes regularly to the Los Angeles-based Metroblogging site. In June 2005, he became that month's featured Tech writer for the SuicideGirls Newswire.[64] He had a monthly column, entitled "Wil Save," in the Dungeons & Dragons-based magazine Dungeon, until May 2005. From January 2005 to October 2006, he wrote a column for The A.V. Club about early video games, called "Games of Our Lives." On December 12, 2008, he returned to his role as Geek in Review editor,[clarification needed] with his editorials being published every second Wednesday of the month.

In early 2003, he founded the independent publishing company Monolith Press and released a memoir entitled Dancing Barefoot. Monolith Press was "founded on the idea that publication should not be limited by opportunity."[65] Most of the entries are extended versions of his blog entries. Dancing Barefoot sold out three printings in four months. In winter 2003, Wheaton signed to publisher Tim O'Reilly with a three-book contract. O'Reilly acquired Dancing Barefoot, and published his extended memoirs, Just a Geek, in summer of 2004. He has since written about his bitterness regarding how the book was marketed, believing it was pitched as a Star Trek book when he intended it as more of a personal memoir.[66] Subsequently, in 2007, his next book, The Happiest Days of Our Lives was again published by Monolith Press.
With the release of Sunken Treasure: Wil Wheaton's Hot Cocoa Box Sampler in February 2009, instead of using traditional publishing, Wheaton decided to self-publish using Lulu Publishing, releasing paperback and digital copies, something he has continued to do with all his publications since. As a chapbook, Sunken Treasure contains several small extracts of various different projects, including two short stories from Ficlets, an ACME comedy sketch, William's Tell and a Criminal Minds production diary. The production diary was later released as an audiobook. Later that same year, Wheaton released Memories of the Future: Volume 1, a humorous critique, as well as an account of Wheaton's own experiences with, and memories of, the first thirteen episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Closing up 2009, Wheaton published a special edition of The Happiest Days of Our Lives, which also included an afterword by his son, Ryan. The Happiest Days of Our Lives and Sunken Treasure were also released on a Creative Commons license.
Politics[edit]
Wheaton described himself as a liberal in 2005.[67] In September 2006, he criticized George W. Bush's plan to suspend habeas corpus and to use torture: "Shame on President Bush. Shame on his Republican allies in Congress, and shame on the spineless, cowardly Democrats who did not stand up to them."[68] In a column that he wrote for Salon.com in 2005, The Real War on Christmas, Wheaton attacked conservative commentators like Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity for influencing the political views of his parents, with whom Wheaton found himself unable to have political discussions during family get-togethers on holidays like Christmas.[67] Wheaton's parents were very offended by the article, and he posted a lengthy apology on his site and an interview in which his parents clarified their political views.[69]
Wheaton is a supporter of Electronic Frontier Foundation and has been involved with the organization since 2002.[70]
On August 24, 2007, Wheaton gave the keynote for the yearly Penny Arcade Expo, which was subsequently made available online.[71] He stepped in following a public battle between the formerly-scheduled keynote debate participants, noted anti-games activist Jack Thompson and Hal Halpin, the president of the Entertainment Consumers Association (ECA). Much of Wheaton's address focused on the debate over violence in video games. He also gave the keynote at PAX East 2010 in Boston, Massachusetts.
He supported Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential Election[72] and opposed Proposition 8, calling it "nothing but hate and discrimination".[73]
In September 2015, Wheaton announced that he was supporting Bernie Sanders' bid to be the 2016 Democratic Party presidential candidate nominee.[74] He subsequently campaigned for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.[75]
Personal life[edit]
Wheaton was roommates with Chris Hardwick at UCLA.[16][76] They met at a showing of Arachnophobia in Burbank, California.[16]
Wheaton married Anne Prince on November 7, 1999,[77] and lives in Arcadia, California, with her and her two sons from a previous relationship.[78] When one son was 18, he asked Wheaton to legally adopt him, which he did.[1][79]
Wheaton is an aficionado of computers, the internet, and technology in general. He says he is drawn to alternatives like Linux because he is left-handed, though he ceased using Linux when he switched to Windows 2000.[78] Since at least 2003, his operating system of choice has been OS X, though he still runs Linux (Debian) in a virtual machine.[80] He also enjoys brewing his own beer at home,[81] and he collaborated with Fark creator Drew Curtis and Stone Brewing Co. CEO Greg Koch to create a geek-themed stout beer called Stone Farking Wheaton w00tstout.[82]
Wheaton is also a major longtime fan of the Los Angeles Kings ice hockey team and can often be found at the Staples Center at both regular season and playoff games.[83] Wheaton is also a "die-hard" fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and has gone to many games at Dodger Stadium.[84] Wheaton is also a fan of English football club Arsenal.[85]
Wheaton lives with generalized anxiety disorder and chronic depression. He supports mental health nonprofit organizations in raising awareness for these conditions.[86]

Early life[edit]
Wheaton was born July 29, 1972, in Burbank, California, to Debra Nordean "Debbie" (née O'Connor), an actress, and Richard William Wheaton, Jr., a medical specialist.[3][4][5] He has a brother, Jeremy, and a sister, Amy.[6] Both appeared uncredited in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "When the Bough Breaks".[7] Amy also appeared alongside Wil in the 1987 film The Curse.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Early work[edit]
Wheaton made his acting debut in the television film A Long Way Home (1981), and his first cinema role was as Martin Brisby in the animated film The Secret of NIMH (1982), the movie adaptation of Robert C. O'Brien's book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (1971). He had a minor role in The Last Starfighter (1984) as Louis's friend, but it was cut. He first gained widespread attention for playing Gordie Lachance in Stand by Me (1986), the film adaptation of Stephen King's novella The Body which was originally published in 1982's Different Seasons".[2][8]
Star Trek[edit]
From 1987 to 1991, he played Wesley Crusher in the first four seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation. This became a recurring role later in the series. A vocal group of Trekkies disliked his Star Trek character and, by extension, Wheaton himself during TNG's first run. Wheaton commented about his critics in an interview for WebTalk Radio:

Later, I determined that the people who were really, really cruel – like the Usenet weenies – really are a statistically insignificant number of people. And I know, just over the years from people who've e-mailed me at my web site and people who I've talked to since I started going to Star Trek conventions again in the last five years, that there are so many more people who really enjoyed everything about the show, including my performance, including the character.[9]

Wheaton's notoriety among Star Trek fandom is covered in a number of web comics. For example, ArcaneTimes (March 25, 2005) offers a sympathetic position;[10] Something Positive presents a range of opinions on the storyline Mike's Kid;[11] and Abstruse Goose tries to distinguish between the character and the actor.[12]
Post-Star Trek[edit]




Wil Wheaton in 2001



Wheaton played Joey Trotta in the action film Toy Soldiers (1991). After leaving Star Trek, he moved to Topeka, Kansas, to work for NewTek, where he helped to develop the Video Toaster 4000 doing product testing and quality control[13][14] and later used his public profile to serve as a technology evangelist for the product.[15] Wheaton said this was a period of growth in his life, and living away from Los Angeles helped him deal with anger problems.
Afterward, he returned to Los Angeles, attended acting school for five years, and then re-entered the acting world.[16][17] In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wheaton appeared in several independent films, including the award-winning The Good Things (2001), in which he portrays a frustrated Kansas tollbooth worker; it was selected Best Short Film at the 2002 Deauville Film Festival.[2][18] For his performance in Jane White Is Sick & Twisted (2002) he received the Best Actor award at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival.[19]
Voice work[edit]




Wheaton at W00tstock 2.4 in San Diego, July 2010


Wheaton has worked as a voice actor in animation, video games and audiobooks, beginning with the role of young Martin Brisby in The Secret of NIMH at age 10. His most noteworthy credits include the roles of Aqualad in the cartoons Teen Titans and Teen Titans Go!, the voice of radio journalist Richard Burns in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Kyle in the Nickelodeon cartoon, Kyle + Rosemary as well as himself and various other characters on both Family Guy and Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy. Wheaton also featured as the second Blue Beetle, Ted Kord, on Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Dr. Peter Meechum in Generator Rex, Mike Morningstar / Darkstar in Ben 10: Alien Force, Ben 10: Ultimate Alien & Ben 10: Omniverse". Additonally Wheaton took upon the Anime roles of Yakumo in Kurokami: The Animation, Menma in Naruto, Hans in Slayers Evolution-R, Aaron Terzieff in Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. He also appeared as himself in a skit on nerdcore rapper MC Frontalot's 2008 album Final Boss attempting to be a rapper, whose rhymes only involved shellfish. Wheaton later collaborated with Frontalot on "Your Friend Wil", a track from the 2010 album Zero Day on the subject of Wheaton's law, which states "don't be a dick"[20][21][non-primary source needed] (the phrase was in use before Wheaton's blog post).[22] Wheaton and Frontalot have both appeared at the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX).[2]
Wheaton has also narrated a number of bestselling audiobooks, mostly in the science-fiction and fantasy category, including Ready Player One by Ernest Cline (Wheaton also exists in the novel's universe, described as being joint President, along with Cory Doctorow, of the virtual world Oasis, which is the setting for much of the book), "Armada" also by Cline, Redshirts by John Scalzi, and books 6–10 of the Chronicles of Amber series by Roger Zelazny.
Television and web[edit]
Wheaton was a contestant on a 2001 episode of The Weakest Link featuring Star Trek actors attempting to win money for charity. He has made guest appearances on the November 23, 2007 episode of the TV series Numb3rs, and the October 22, 2008 episode of the series Criminal Minds, and appeared in Internet presentations, including a cameo in a comedy sketch ("Lock Out") for LoadingReadyRun[23] (and a reprise of the same the following year, in CommodoreHustle 4), and the May 30, 2008 episode of the Internet series Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show. From 2009-2011, Wheaton appeared in seasons 3, 4, and 5 of the web series The Guild as Fawkes, the leader for a rival guild known as Axis of Anarchy.[24] Wheaton credits his roles in Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show and The Guild for reigniting his career by encouraging him to seek out roles as the "Villain You Love To Hate" stock character.[25] He also appears in seasons 2, 3, and 4 of the TV series Leverage, as rival computer hacker Colin "Chaos" Mason, antagonist to Leverage team hacker Alec Hardison. He makes regular appearances in many web productions for Geek & Sundry, including hosting TableTop, a board game based show,[26] and Titansgrave, a roleplaying game based show.[27]
He appeared as a fictionalized version of himself in several episodes of the sitcom The Big Bang Theory, starting in season 3, episode 5: "The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary" (2009). On the show, Wheaton behaves in comically petty and manipulative ways towards main character Sheldon Cooper, who regards him as an archenemy until the season 5 episode "The Russian Rocket Reaction", when they make amends and become friends. Wheaton appears in 12 episodes in a recurring, guest-starring role on Eureka, playing Dr. Isaac Parrish, the head of the Non-Lethal Weapons Lab at Global Dynamics and a thorn in Fargo's side.[28] Wheaton also voices the character of the former scoutmaster and current sous-chef Earl Harlan in the popular dark, surreal-comedy podcast Welcome to Night Vale.
Wheaton appears as Alexander Rook in the Syfy TV series Dark Matter, based on the eponymous comic book. The TV series premiered on June 12, 2015.[29]
Hosting[edit]
From September 2006 to September 2007, Wheaton hosted a Revision3 syndicated video podcast called InDigital along with Jessica Corbin and veteran host Hahn Choi. He hosted a NASA video on the Mars Curiosity rover which landed on Monday August 6, 2012.[30] He has also hosted "2nd Watch," interviews with cast members and producers of the science-fiction series Falling Skies that appears on-line after each episode.[31]  On April 3, 2014, Wheaton announced on his blog that his new show called The Wil Wheaton Project would premiere on the SyFy network at 10pm on May 27 for an initial projected run of twelve episodes.[32][33] However, on August 29, Wheaton blogged that SyFy canceled the show after only one season.[34]
Other ventures[edit]
Games[edit]
In 2003, Wheaton mentioned his love for the game of poker on his blog. The following year, he began writing more extensively about his poker-playing experiences, including stories about playing Texas hold 'em tournaments locally and in Las Vegas. Eventually, he worked up to regular play, including a run at the 2005 World Poker Tour Championships. On June 23, 2005, Wheaton accepted an invitation to join Team PokerStars.[35] He went on to play in that year's World Series of Poker and was the guest speaker for the 2005 BARGE Banquet. In June 2007, he announced he would no longer be on Team Pokerstars due to changes in the U.S. legal system that would cause poker sites to have to focus on European and Asian markets[36] and held a farewell Pokerstars tournament on June 5, 2007, which he titled So Long and Thanks for All the Chips.[37]
Wheaton is a Dungeons & Dragons player,[38] and played during the PAX 2010 event using the 4th edition rules. Wheaton, along with webcartoonists Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik of Penny Arcade, and Scott Kurtz of PvP, played in front of a live audience. The game was hosted and recorded by Wizards of the Coast with Chris Perkins as the dungeonmaster.[39] Wheaton also played D&D 4th edition at the PAX 2011 event using the 4th edition rules, and used the D&D Next play test rules at PAX Prime 2012. Wheaton also hosts the web series TableTop, where he explains how to play various card, board and dice games, then plays a round with celebrity guests.[40] Wheaton also starred in the Kickstarter-funded game There Came an Echo by Iridium Studios.[41] In Dungeons and Dragons Online, he became the dungeon master of the Temple of Elemental Evil quests.[42]
Nintendo of America announced on Twitter that Wheaton would be voicing Abraham Lincoln in Code Name: STEAM.[43]
Wheaton announced in February, 2015, that he was chosen to provide voiceover talent for the upcoming strategy role-playing video game Firefly Online, a game based on Joss Whedon's Firefly sci-fi franchise.[44]
Wheaton has spoken out against misogyny in video game culture,[45][46] and wrote a profile of Anita Sarkeesian for the 2015 Time 100.[47]
Wheaton also does the voice narration on the Secret Hitler companion app for the Secret Hitler social deduction game.[48]
Comic book[edit]
A fictionalized version of Wheaton was included in the comic book PS 238, in which he harbors the power of telekinesis. Wheaton's debut comic book The Guild: Fawkes, which he wrote alongside Felicia Day, was released on May 23, 2012.[49]
Audiobooks[edit]
Wheaton has recorded several of his non-self-published books as downloadable audiobooks. These include Just a Geek, Dancing Barefoot, The Happiest Days of Our Lives, and his Criminal Minds diary from Sunken Treasure. He also released excerpts of Memories of The Future: Vol 1 as free podcasts. He has also narrated several audiobooks by other authors, including Ready Player One and Armada by Ernest Cline;[50][51] Masters of Doom by David Kushner;[52] Homeland by Cory Doctorow;[citation needed] Fuzzy Nation, The Android's Dream, Agent to the Stars, Redshirts and Lock In, all by John Scalzi;[53][54][55][56] Peter and Max: A Fables Novel by Bill Willingham;[57] "Byways", part of METAtropolis: Cascadia by Tobias Buckell;[58] "What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Hypothetical Questions" by Randall Munroe;[59] and Boneshaker by Cherie Priest.[60] Similarly, Wheaton has provided the voice-over for the digital gamebook, Trial of the Clone.[61]
Live shows[edit]
Wheaton has performed improvisational and sketch comedy at the ACME Comedy Theater in Hollywood.[62] He has a traveling sketch comedy/improv troupe called "EarnestBorg9" that performs science fiction-related comedy at conventions.[63] Wheaton is one of the three headline acts of the w00tstock shows, appearing in nearly all of them when his filming schedule has allowed.[citation needed] He has also guest starred in one of the Welcome to Night Vale live stage shows, playing the role of a radio station intern named after himself, the character meeting a prompt demise as is the podcast's tradition for interns.[citation needed] He also plays a character in the podcast, Earl Harlan, a friend of the main character. He was originally a 20-something regular guy, when he was dragged away to the "Eternal Scout" ceremony and disappeared. He then returned as a 53 year old with a son, and was the sous chef of Night Vale's top restaurant.[citation needed]
Writing[edit]
Wheaton runs his own blog, Wil Wheaton Dot Net. Between 2001 and late 2004, he operated a message board, known as "The Soapbox" or "Paracosm," as part of the blog site. Two collections of writings taken from postings to the message board have been published, titled Boxer Shorts (ISBN 1-932461-00-0) and Boxer Shorts Redux (ISBN 1-932461-03-5). He contributes regularly to the Los Angeles-based Metroblogging site. In June 2005, he became that month's featured Tech writer for the SuicideGirls Newswire.[64] He had a monthly column, entitled "Wil Save," in the Dungeons & Dragons-based magazine Dungeon, until May 2005. From January 2005 to October 2006, he wrote a column for The A.V. Club about early video games, called "Games of Our Lives." On December 12, 2008, he returned to his role as Geek in Review editor,[clarification needed] with his editorials being published every second Wednesday of the month.




Wil Wheaton (left) meets Tim O'Reilly at the 2003 booksigning of Dancing Barefoot at Powell's in Portland, Oregon.


In early 2003, he founded the independent publishing company Monolith Press and released a memoir entitled Dancing Barefoot. Monolith Press was "founded on the idea that publication should not be limited by opportunity."[65] Most of the entries are extended versions of his blog entries. Dancing Barefoot sold out three printings in four months. In winter 2003, Wheaton signed to publisher Tim O'Reilly with a three-book contract. O'Reilly acquired Dancing Barefoot, and published his extended memoirs, Just a Geek, in summer of 2004. He has since written about his bitterness regarding how the book was marketed, believing it was pitched as a Star Trek book when he intended it as more of a personal memoir.[66] Subsequently, in 2007, his next book, The Happiest Days of Our Lives was again published by Monolith Press.
With the release of Sunken Treasure: Wil Wheaton's Hot Cocoa Box Sampler in February 2009, instead of using traditional publishing, Wheaton decided to self-publish using Lulu Publishing, releasing paperback and digital copies, something he has continued to do with all his publications since. As a chapbook, Sunken Treasure contains several small extracts of various different projects, including two short stories from Ficlets, an ACME comedy sketch, William's Tell and a Criminal Minds production diary. The production diary was later released as an audiobook. Later that same year, Wheaton released Memories of the Future: Volume 1, a humorous critique, as well as an account of Wheaton's own experiences with, and memories of, the first thirteen episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Closing up 2009, Wheaton published a special edition of The Happiest Days of Our Lives, which also included an afterword by his son, Ryan. The Happiest Days of Our Lives and Sunken Treasure were also released on a Creative Commons license.
Politics[edit]
Wheaton described himself as a liberal in 2005.[67] In September 2006, he criticized George W. Bush's plan to suspend habeas corpus and to use torture: "Shame on President Bush. Shame on his Republican allies in Congress, and shame on the spineless, cowardly Democrats who did not stand up to them."[68] In a column that he wrote for Salon.com in 2005, The Real War on Christmas, Wheaton attacked conservative commentators like Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity for influencing the political views of his parents, with whom Wheaton found himself unable to have political discussions during family get-togethers on holidays like Christmas.[67] Wheaton's parents were very offended by the article, and he posted a lengthy apology on his site and an interview in which his parents clarified their political views.[69]
Wheaton is a supporter of Electronic Frontier Foundation and has been involved with the organization since 2002.[70]
On August 24, 2007, Wheaton gave the keynote for the yearly Penny Arcade Expo, which was subsequently made available online.[71] He stepped in following a public battle between the formerly-scheduled keynote debate participants, noted anti-games activist Jack Thompson and Hal Halpin, the president of the Entertainment Consumers Association (ECA). Much of Wheaton's address focused on the debate over violence in video games. He also gave the keynote at PAX East 2010 in Boston, Massachusetts.
He supported Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential Election[72] and opposed Proposition 8, calling it "nothing but hate and discrimination".[73]
In September 2015, Wheaton announced that he was supporting Bernie Sanders' bid to be the 2016 Democratic Party presidential candidate nominee.[74] He subsequently campaigned for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.[75]
Personal life[edit]
Wheaton was roommates with Chris Hardwick at UCLA.[16][76] They met at a showing of Arachnophobia in Burbank, California.[16]
Wheaton married Anne Prince on November 7, 1999,[77] and lives in Arcadia, California, with her and her two sons from a previous relationship.[78] When one son was 18, he asked Wheaton to legally adopt him, which he did.[1][79]
Wheaton is an aficionado of computers, the internet, and technology in general. He says he is drawn to alternatives like Linux because he is left-handed, though he ceased using Linux when he switched to Windows 2000.[78] Since at least 2003, his operating system of choice has been OS X, though he still runs Linux (Debian) in a virtual machine.[80] He also enjoys brewing his own beer at home,[81] and he collaborated with Fark creator Drew Curtis and Stone Brewing Co. CEO Greg Koch to create a geek-themed stout beer called Stone Farking Wheaton w00tstout.[82]
Wheaton is also a major longtime fan of the Los Angeles Kings ice hockey team and can often be found at the Staples Center at both regular season and playoff games.[83] Wheaton is also a "die-hard" fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and has gone to many games at Dodger Stadium.[84] Wheaton is also a fan of English football club Arsenal.[85]
Wheaton lives with generalized anxiety disorder and chronic depression. He supports mental health nonprofit organizations in raising awareness for these conditions.[86]

Young Artist Awards: 1989 & 1987
Melbourne Underground Film Festival: Best Actor (2002)

Trivia[edit]

Early life[edit]
Wheaton was born July 29, 1972, in Burbank, California, to Debra Nordean "Debbie" (née O'Connor), an actress, and Richard William Wheaton, Jr., a medical specialist.[3][4][5] He has a brother, Jeremy, and a sister, Amy.[6] Both appeared uncredited in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "When the Bough Breaks".[7] Amy also appeared alongside Wil in the 1987 film The Curse.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Early work[edit]
Wheaton made his acting debut in the television film A Long Way Home (1981), and his first cinema role was as Martin Brisby in the animated film The Secret of NIMH (1982), the movie adaptation of Robert C. O'Brien's book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (1971). He had a minor role in The Last Starfighter (1984) as Louis's friend, but it was cut. He first gained widespread attention for playing Gordie Lachance in Stand by Me (1986), the film adaptation of Stephen King's novella The Body which was originally published in 1982's Different Seasons".[2][8]
Star Trek[edit]
From 1987 to 1991, he played Wesley Crusher in the first four seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation. This became a recurring role later in the series. A vocal group of Trekkies disliked his Star Trek character and, by extension, Wheaton himself during TNG's first run. Wheaton commented about his critics in an interview for WebTalk Radio:

Later, I determined that the people who were really, really cruel – like the Usenet weenies – really are a statistically insignificant number of people. And I know, just over the years from people who've e-mailed me at my web site and people who I've talked to since I started going to Star Trek conventions again in the last five years, that there are so many more people who really enjoyed everything about the show, including my performance, including the character.[9]

Wheaton's notoriety among Star Trek fandom is covered in a number of web comics. For example, ArcaneTimes (March 25, 2005) offers a sympathetic position;[10] Something Positive presents a range of opinions on the storyline Mike's Kid;[11] and Abstruse Goose tries to distinguish between the character and the actor.[12]
Post-Star Trek[edit]




Wil Wheaton in 2001



Wheaton played Joey Trotta in the action film Toy Soldiers (1991). After leaving Star Trek, he moved to Topeka, Kansas, to work for NewTek, where he helped to develop the Video Toaster 4000 doing product testing and quality control[13][14] and later used his public profile to serve as a technology evangelist for the product.[15] Wheaton said this was a period of growth in his life, and living away from Los Angeles helped him deal with anger problems.
Afterward, he returned to Los Angeles, attended acting school for five years, and then re-entered the acting world.[16][17] In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wheaton appeared in several independent films, including the award-winning The Good Things (2001), in which he portrays a frustrated Kansas tollbooth worker; it was selected Best Short Film at the 2002 Deauville Film Festival.[2][18] For his performance in Jane White Is Sick & Twisted (2002) he received the Best Actor award at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival.[19]
Voice work[edit]




Wheaton at W00tstock 2.4 in San Diego, July 2010


Wheaton has worked as a voice actor in animation, video games and audiobooks, beginning with the role of young Martin Brisby in The Secret of NIMH at age 10. His most noteworthy credits include the roles of Aqualad in the cartoons Teen Titans and Teen Titans Go!, the voice of radio journalist Richard Burns in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Kyle in the Nickelodeon cartoon, Kyle + Rosemary as well as himself and various other characters on both Family Guy and Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy. Wheaton also featured as the second Blue Beetle, Ted Kord, on Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Dr. Peter Meechum in Generator Rex, Mike Morningstar / Darkstar in Ben 10: Alien Force, Ben 10: Ultimate Alien & Ben 10: Omniverse". Additonally Wheaton took upon the Anime roles of Yakumo in Kurokami: The Animation, Menma in Naruto, Hans in Slayers Evolution-R, Aaron Terzieff in Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. He also appeared as himself in a skit on nerdcore rapper MC Frontalot's 2008 album Final Boss attempting to be a rapper, whose rhymes only involved shellfish. Wheaton later collaborated with Frontalot on "Your Friend Wil", a track from the 2010 album Zero Day on the subject of Wheaton's law, which states "don't be a dick"[20][21][non-primary source needed] (the phrase was in use before Wheaton's blog post).[22] Wheaton and Frontalot have both appeared at the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX).[2]
Wheaton has also narrated a number of bestselling audiobooks, mostly in the science-fiction and fantasy category, including Ready Player One by Ernest Cline (Wheaton also exists in the novel's universe, described as being joint President, along with Cory Doctorow, of the virtual world Oasis, which is the setting for much of the book), "Armada" also by Cline, Redshirts by John Scalzi, and books 6–10 of the Chronicles of Amber series by Roger Zelazny.
Television and web[edit]
Wheaton was a contestant on a 2001 episode of The Weakest Link featuring Star Trek actors attempting to win money for charity. He has made guest appearances on the November 23, 2007 episode of the TV series Numb3rs, and the October 22, 2008 episode of the series Criminal Minds, and appeared in Internet presentations, including a cameo in a comedy sketch ("Lock Out") for LoadingReadyRun[23] (and a reprise of the same the following year, in CommodoreHustle 4), and the May 30, 2008 episode of the Internet series Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show. From 2009-2011, Wheaton appeared in seasons 3, 4, and 5 of the web series The Guild as Fawkes, the leader for a rival guild known as Axis of Anarchy.[24] Wheaton credits his roles in Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show and The Guild for reigniting his career by encouraging him to seek out roles as the "Villain You Love To Hate" stock character.[25] He also appears in seasons 2, 3, and 4 of the TV series Leverage, as rival computer hacker Colin "Chaos" Mason, antagonist to Leverage team hacker Alec Hardison. He makes regular appearances in many web productions for Geek & Sundry, including hosting TableTop, a board game based show,[26] and Titansgrave, a roleplaying game based show.[27]
He appeared as a fictionalized version of himself in several episodes of the sitcom The Big Bang Theory, starting in season 3, episode 5: "The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary" (2009). On the show, Wheaton behaves in comically petty and manipulative ways towards main character Sheldon Cooper, who regards him as an archenemy until the season 5 episode "The Russian Rocket Reaction", when they make amends and become friends. Wheaton appears in 12 episodes in a recurring, guest-starring role on Eureka, playing Dr. Isaac Parrish, the head of the Non-Lethal Weapons Lab at Global Dynamics and a thorn in Fargo's side.[28] Wheaton also voices the character of the former scoutmaster and current sous-chef Earl Harlan in the popular dark, surreal-comedy podcast Welcome to Night Vale.
Wheaton appears as Alexander Rook in the Syfy TV series Dark Matter, based on the eponymous comic book. The TV series premiered on June 12, 2015.[29]
Hosting[edit]
From September 2006 to September 2007, Wheaton hosted a Revision3 syndicated video podcast called InDigital along with Jessica Corbin and veteran host Hahn Choi. He hosted a NASA video on the Mars Curiosity rover which landed on Monday August 6, 2012.[30] He has also hosted "2nd Watch," interviews with cast members and producers of the science-fiction series Falling Skies that appears on-line after each episode.[31]  On April 3, 2014, Wheaton announced on his blog that his new show called The Wil Wheaton Project would premiere on the SyFy network at 10pm on May 27 for an initial projected run of twelve episodes.[32][33] However, on August 29, Wheaton blogged that SyFy canceled the show after only one season.[34]
Other ventures[edit]
Games[edit]
In 2003, Wheaton mentioned his love for the game of poker on his blog. The following year, he began writing more extensively about his poker-playing experiences, including stories about playing Texas hold 'em tournaments locally and in Las Vegas. Eventually, he worked up to regular play, including a run at the 2005 World Poker Tour Championships. On June 23, 2005, Wheaton accepted an invitation to join Team PokerStars.[35] He went on to play in that year's World Series of Poker and was the guest speaker for the 2005 BARGE Banquet. In June 2007, he announced he would no longer be on Team Pokerstars due to changes in the U.S. legal system that would cause poker sites to have to focus on European and Asian markets[36] and held a farewell Pokerstars tournament on June 5, 2007, which he titled So Long and Thanks for All the Chips.[37]
Wheaton is a Dungeons & Dragons player,[38] and played during the PAX 2010 event using the 4th edition rules. Wheaton, along with webcartoonists Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik of Penny Arcade, and Scott Kurtz of PvP, played in front of a live audience. The game was hosted and recorded by Wizards of the Coast with Chris Perkins as the dungeonmaster.[39] Wheaton also played D&D 4th edition at the PAX 2011 event using the 4th edition rules, and used the D&D Next play test rules at PAX Prime 2012. Wheaton also hosts the web series TableTop, where he explains how to play various card, board and dice games, then plays a round with celebrity guests.[40] Wheaton also starred in the Kickstarter-funded game There Came an Echo by Iridium Studios.[41] In Dungeons and Dragons Online, he became the dungeon master of the Temple of Elemental Evil quests.[42]
Nintendo of America announced on Twitter that Wheaton would be voicing Abraham Lincoln in Code Name: STEAM.[43]
Wheaton announced in February, 2015, that he was chosen to provide voiceover talent for the upcoming strategy role-playing video game Firefly Online, a game based on Joss Whedon's Firefly sci-fi franchise.[44]
Wheaton has spoken out against misogyny in video game culture,[45][46] and wrote a profile of Anita Sarkeesian for the 2015 Time 100.[47]
Wheaton also does the voice narration on the Secret Hitler companion app for the Secret Hitler social deduction game.[48]
Comic book[edit]
A fictionalized version of Wheaton was included in the comic book PS 238, in which he harbors the power of telekinesis. Wheaton's debut comic book The Guild: Fawkes, which he wrote alongside Felicia Day, was released on May 23, 2012.[49]
Audiobooks[edit]
Wheaton has recorded several of his non-self-published books as downloadable audiobooks. These include Just a Geek, Dancing Barefoot, The Happiest Days of Our Lives, and his Criminal Minds diary from Sunken Treasure. He also released excerpts of Memories of The Future: Vol 1 as free podcasts. He has also narrated several audiobooks by other authors, including Ready Player One and Armada by Ernest Cline;[50][51] Masters of Doom by David Kushner;[52] Homeland by Cory Doctorow;[citation needed] Fuzzy Nation, The Android's Dream, Agent to the Stars, Redshirts and Lock In, all by John Scalzi;[53][54][55][56] Peter and Max: A Fables Novel by Bill Willingham;[57] "Byways", part of METAtropolis: Cascadia by Tobias Buckell;[58] "What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Hypothetical Questions" by Randall Munroe;[59] and Boneshaker by Cherie Priest.[60] Similarly, Wheaton has provided the voice-over for the digital gamebook, Trial of the Clone.[61]
Live shows[edit]
Wheaton has performed improvisational and sketch comedy at the ACME Comedy Theater in Hollywood.[62] He has a traveling sketch comedy/improv troupe called "EarnestBorg9" that performs science fiction-related comedy at conventions.[63] Wheaton is one of the three headline acts of the w00tstock shows, appearing in nearly all of them when his filming schedule has allowed.[citation needed] He has also guest starred in one of the Welcome to Night Vale live stage shows, playing the role of a radio station intern named after himself, the character meeting a prompt demise as is the podcast's tradition for interns.[citation needed] He also plays a character in the podcast, Earl Harlan, a friend of the main character. He was originally a 20-something regular guy, when he was dragged away to the "Eternal Scout" ceremony and disappeared. He then returned as a 53 year old with a son, and was the sous chef of Night Vale's top restaurant.[citation needed]
Writing[edit]
Wheaton runs his own blog, Wil Wheaton Dot Net. Between 2001 and late 2004, he operated a message board, known as "The Soapbox" or "Paracosm," as part of the blog site. Two collections of writings taken from postings to the message board have been published, titled Boxer Shorts (ISBN 1-932461-00-0) and Boxer Shorts Redux (ISBN 1-932461-03-5). He contributes regularly to the Los Angeles-based Metroblogging site. In June 2005, he became that month's featured Tech writer for the SuicideGirls Newswire.[64] He had a monthly column, entitled "Wil Save," in the Dungeons & Dragons-based magazine Dungeon, until May 2005. From January 2005 to October 2006, he wrote a column for The A.V. Club about early video games, called "Games of Our Lives." On December 12, 2008, he returned to his role as Geek in Review editor,[clarification needed] with his editorials being published every second Wednesday of the month.

In early 2003, he founded the independent publishing company Monolith Press and released a memoir entitled Dancing Barefoot. Monolith Press was "founded on the idea that publication should not be limited by opportunity."[65] Most of the entries are extended versions of his blog entries. Dancing Barefoot sold out three printings in four months. In winter 2003, Wheaton signed to publisher Tim O'Reilly with a three-book contract. O'Reilly acquired Dancing Barefoot, and published his extended memoirs, Just a Geek, in summer of 2004. He has since written about his bitterness regarding how the book was marketed, believing it was pitched as a Star Trek book when he intended it as more of a personal memoir.[66] Subsequently, in 2007, his next book, The Happiest Days of Our Lives was again published by Monolith Press.
With the release of Sunken Treasure: Wil Wheaton's Hot Cocoa Box Sampler in February 2009, instead of using traditional publishing, Wheaton decided to self-publish using Lulu Publishing, releasing paperback and digital copies, something he has continued to do with all his publications since. As a chapbook, Sunken Treasure contains several small extracts of various different projects, including two short stories from Ficlets, an ACME comedy sketch, William's Tell and a Criminal Minds production diary. The production diary was later released as an audiobook. Later that same year, Wheaton released Memories of the Future: Volume 1, a humorous critique, as well as an account of Wheaton's own experiences with, and memories of, the first thirteen episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Closing up 2009, Wheaton published a special edition of The Happiest Days of Our Lives, which also included an afterword by his son, Ryan. The Happiest Days of Our Lives and Sunken Treasure were also released on a Creative Commons license.
Politics[edit]
Wheaton described himself as a liberal in 2005.[67] In September 2006, he criticized George W. Bush's plan to suspend habeas corpus and to use torture: "Shame on President Bush. Shame on his Republican allies in Congress, and shame on the spineless, cowardly Democrats who did not stand up to them."[68] In a column that he wrote for Salon.com in 2005, The Real War on Christmas, Wheaton attacked conservative commentators like Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity for influencing the political views of his parents, with whom Wheaton found himself unable to have political discussions during family get-togethers on holidays like Christmas.[67] Wheaton's parents were very offended by the article, and he posted a lengthy apology on his site and an interview in which his parents clarified their political views.[69]
Wheaton is a supporter of Electronic Frontier Foundation and has been involved with the organization since 2002.[70]
On August 24, 2007, Wheaton gave the keynote for the yearly Penny Arcade Expo, which was subsequently made available online.[71] He stepped in following a public battle between the formerly-scheduled keynote debate participants, noted anti-games activist Jack Thompson and Hal Halpin, the president of the Entertainment Consumers Association (ECA). Much of Wheaton's address focused on the debate over violence in video games. He also gave the keynote at PAX East 2010 in Boston, Massachusetts.
He supported Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential Election[72] and opposed Proposition 8, calling it "nothing but hate and discrimination".[73]
In September 2015, Wheaton announced that he was supporting Bernie Sanders' bid to be the 2016 Democratic Party presidential candidate nominee.[74] He subsequently campaigned for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.[75]
Personal life[edit]
Wheaton was roommates with Chris Hardwick at UCLA.[16][76] They met at a showing of Arachnophobia in Burbank, California.[16]
Wheaton married Anne Prince on November 7, 1999,[77] and lives in Arcadia, California, with her and her two sons from a previous relationship.[78] When one son was 18, he asked Wheaton to legally adopt him, which he did.[1][79]
Wheaton is an aficionado of computers, the internet, and technology in general. He says he is drawn to alternatives like Linux because he is left-handed, though he ceased using Linux when he switched to Windows 2000.[78] Since at least 2003, his operating system of choice has been OS X, though he still runs Linux (Debian) in a virtual machine.[80] He also enjoys brewing his own beer at home,[81] and he collaborated with Fark creator Drew Curtis and Stone Brewing Co. CEO Greg Koch to create a geek-themed stout beer called Stone Farking Wheaton w00tstout.[82]
Wheaton is also a major longtime fan of the Los Angeles Kings ice hockey team and can often be found at the Staples Center at both regular season and playoff games.[83] Wheaton is also a "die-hard" fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and has gone to many games at Dodger Stadium.[84] Wheaton is also a fan of English football club Arsenal.[85]
Wheaton lives with generalized anxiety disorder and chronic depression. He supports mental health nonprofit organizations in raising awareness for these conditions.[86]

O'Brien's book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (1971). He had a minor role in The Last Starfighter (1984) as Louis's friend, but it was cut. He first gained widespread attention for playing Gordie Lachance in Stand by Me (1986), the film adaptation of Stephen King's novella The Body which was originally published in 1982's Different Seasons".[2][8]
Star Trek[edit]
From 1987 to 1991, he played Wesley Crusher in the first four seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation. This became a recurring role later in the series. A vocal group of Trekkies disliked his Star Trek character and, by extension, Wheaton himself during TNG's first run. Wheaton commented about his critics in an interview for WebTalk Radio:

Later, I determined that the people who were really, really cruel – like the Usenet weenies – really are a statistically insignificant number of people. And I know, just over the years from people who've e-mailed me at my web site and people who I've talked to since I started going to Star Trek conventions again in the last five years, that there are so many more people who really enjoyed everything about the show, including my performance, including the character.[9]

Wheaton's notoriety among Star Trek fandom is covered in a number of web comics. For example, ArcaneTimes (March 25, 2005) offers a sympathetic position;[10] Something Positive presents a range of opinions on the storyline Mike's Kid;[11] and Abstruse Goose tries to distinguish between the character and the actor.[12]
Post-Star Trek[edit]




Wil Wheaton in 2001



Wheaton played Joey Trotta in the action film Toy Soldiers (1991). After leaving Star Trek, he moved to Topeka, Kansas, to work for NewTek, where he helped to develop the Video Toaster 4000 doing product testing and quality control[13][14] and later used his public profile to serve as a technology evangelist for the product.[15] Wheaton said this was a period of growth in his life, and living away from Los Angeles helped him deal with anger problems.
Afterward, he returned to Los Angeles, attended acting school for five years, and then re-entered the acting world.[16][17] In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wheaton appeared in several independent films, including the award-winning The Good Things (2001), in which he portrays a frustrated Kansas tollbooth worker; it was selected Best Short Film at the 2002 Deauville Film Festival.[2][18] For his performance in Jane White Is Sick & Twisted (2002) he received the Best Actor award at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival.[19]
Voice work[edit]




Wheaton at W00tstock 2.4 in San Diego, July 2010


Wheaton has worked as a voice actor in animation, video games and audiobooks, beginning with the role of young Martin Brisby in The Secret of NIMH at age 10. His most noteworthy credits include the roles of Aqualad in the cartoons Teen Titans and Teen Titans Go!, the voice of radio journalist Richard Burns in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Kyle in the Nickelodeon cartoon, Kyle + Rosemary as well as himself and various other characters on both Family Guy and Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy. Wheaton also featured as the second Blue Beetle, Ted Kord, on Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Dr. Peter Meechum in Generator Rex, Mike Morningstar / Darkstar in Ben 10: Alien Force, Ben 10: Ultimate Alien & Ben 10: Omniverse". Additonally Wheaton took upon the Anime roles of Yakumo in Kurokami: The Animation, Menma in Naruto, Hans in Slayers Evolution-R, Aaron Terzieff in Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. He also appeared as himself in a skit on nerdcore rapper MC Frontalot's 2008 album Final Boss attempting to be a rapper, whose rhymes only involved shellfish. Wheaton later collaborated with Frontalot on "Your Friend Wil", a track from the 2010 album Zero Day on the subject of Wheaton's law, which states "don't be a dick"[20][21][non-primary source needed] (the phrase was in use before Wheaton's blog post).[22] Wheaton and Frontalot have both appeared at the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX).[2]
Wheaton has also narrated a number of bestselling audiobooks, mostly in the science-fiction and fantasy category, including Ready Player One by Ernest Cline (Wheaton also exists in the novel's universe, described as being joint President, along with Cory Doctorow, of the virtual world Oasis, which is the setting for much of the book), "Armada" also by Cline, Redshirts by John Scalzi, and books 6–10 of the Chronicles of Amber series by Roger Zelazny.
Television and web[edit]
Wheaton was a contestant on a 2001 episode of The Weakest Link featuring Star Trek actors attempting to win money for charity. He has made guest appearances on the November 23, 2007 episode of the TV series Numb3rs, and the October 22, 2008 episode of the series Criminal Minds, and appeared in Internet presentations, including a cameo in a comedy sketch ("Lock Out") for LoadingReadyRun[23] (and a reprise of the same the following year, in CommodoreHustle 4), and the May 30, 2008 episode of the Internet series Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show. From 2009-2011, Wheaton appeared in seasons 3, 4, and 5 of the web series The Guild as Fawkes, the leader for a rival guild known as Axis of Anarchy.[24] Wheaton credits his roles in Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show and The Guild for reigniting his career by encouraging him to seek out roles as the "Villain You Love To Hate" stock character.[25] He also appears in seasons 2, 3, and 4 of the TV series Leverage, as rival computer hacker Colin "Chaos" Mason, antagonist to Leverage team hacker Alec Hardison. He makes regular appearances in many web productions for Geek & Sundry, including hosting TableTop, a board game based show,[26] and Titansgrave, a roleplaying game based show.[27]
He appeared as a fictionalized version of himself in several episodes of the sitcom The Big Bang Theory, starting in season 3, episode 5: "The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary" (2009). On the show, Wheaton behaves in comically petty and manipulative ways towards main character Sheldon Cooper, who regards him as an archenemy until the season 5 episode "The Russian Rocket Reaction", when they make amends and become friends. Wheaton appears in 12 episodes in a recurring, guest-starring role on Eureka, playing Dr. Isaac Parrish, the head of the Non-Lethal Weapons Lab at Global Dynamics and a thorn in Fargo's side.[28] Wheaton also voices the character of the former scoutmaster and current sous-chef Earl Harlan in the popular dark, surreal-comedy podcast Welcome to Night Vale.
Wheaton appears as Alexander Rook in the Syfy TV series Dark Matter, based on the eponymous comic book. The TV series premiered on June 12, 2015.[29]
Hosting[edit]
From September 2006 to September 2007, Wheaton hosted a Revision3 syndicated video podcast called InDigital along with Jessica Corbin and veteran host Hahn Choi. He hosted a NASA video on the Mars Curiosity rover which landed on Monday August 6, 2012.[30] He has also hosted "2nd Watch," interviews with cast members and producers of the science-fiction series Falling Skies that appears on-line after each episode.[31]  On April 3, 2014, Wheaton announced on his blog that his new show called The Wil Wheaton Project would premiere on the SyFy network at 10pm on May 27 for an initial projected run of twelve episodes.[32][33] However, on August 29, Wheaton blogged that SyFy canceled the show after only one season.[34]
Other ventures[edit]
Games[edit]
In 2003, Wheaton mentioned his love for the game of poker on his blog. The following year, he began writing more extensively about his poker-playing experiences, including stories about playing Texas hold 'em tournaments locally and in Las Vegas. Eventually, he worked up to regular play, including a run at the 2005 World Poker Tour Championships. On June 23, 2005, Wheaton accepted an invitation to join Team PokerStars.[35] He went on to play in that year's World Series of Poker and was the guest speaker for the 2005 BARGE Banquet. In June 2007, he announced he would no longer be on Team Pokerstars due to changes in the U.S. legal system that would cause poker sites to have to focus on European and Asian markets[36] and held a farewell Pokerstars tournament on June 5, 2007, which he titled So Long and Thanks for All the Chips.[37]
Wheaton is a Dungeons & Dragons player,[38] and played during the PAX 2010 event using the 4th edition rules. Wheaton, along with webcartoonists Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik of Penny Arcade, and Scott Kurtz of PvP, played in front of a live audience. The game was hosted and recorded by Wizards of the Coast with Chris Perkins as the dungeonmaster.[39] Wheaton also played D&D 4th edition at the PAX 2011 event using the 4th edition rules, and used the D&D Next play test rules at PAX Prime 2012. Wheaton also hosts the web series TableTop, where he explains how to play various card, board and dice games, then plays a round with celebrity guests.[40] Wheaton also starred in the Kickstarter-funded game There Came an Echo by Iridium Studios.[41] In Dungeons and Dragons Online, he became the dungeon master of the Temple of Elemental Evil quests.[42]
Nintendo of America announced on Twitter that Wheaton would be voicing Abraham Lincoln in Code Name: STEAM.[43]
Wheaton announced in February, 2015, that he was chosen to provide voiceover talent for the upcoming strategy role-playing video game Firefly Online, a game based on Joss Whedon's Firefly sci-fi franchise.[44]
Wheaton has spoken out against misogyny in video game culture,[45][46] and wrote a profile of Anita Sarkeesian for the 2015 Time 100.[47]
Wheaton also does the voice narration on the Secret Hitler companion app for the Secret Hitler social deduction game.[48]
Comic book[edit]
A fictionalized version of Wheaton was included in the comic book PS 238, in which he harbors the power of telekinesis. Wheaton's debut comic book The Guild: Fawkes, which he wrote alongside Felicia Day, was released on May 23, 2012.[49]
Audiobooks[edit]
Wheaton has recorded several of his non-self-published books as downloadable audiobooks. These include Just a Geek, Dancing Barefoot, The Happiest Days of Our Lives, and his Criminal Minds diary from Sunken Treasure. He also released excerpts of Memories of The Future: Vol 1 as free podcasts. He has also narrated several audiobooks by other authors, including Ready Player One and Armada by Ernest Cline;[50][51] Masters of Doom by David Kushner;[52] Homeland by Cory Doctorow;[citation needed] Fuzzy Nation, The Android's Dream, Agent to the Stars, Redshirts and Lock In, all by John Scalzi;[53][54][55][56] Peter and Max: A Fables Novel by Bill Willingham;[57] "Byways", part of METAtropolis: Cascadia by Tobias Buckell;[58] "What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Hypothetical Questions" by Randall Munroe;[59] and Boneshaker by Cherie Priest.[60] Similarly, Wheaton has provided the voice-over for the digital gamebook, Trial of the Clone.[61]
Live shows[edit]
Wheaton has performed improvisational and sketch comedy at the ACME Comedy Theater in Hollywood.[62] He has a traveling sketch comedy/improv troupe called "EarnestBorg9" that performs science fiction-related comedy at conventions.[63] Wheaton is one of the three headline acts of the w00tstock shows, appearing in nearly all of them when his filming schedule has allowed.[citation needed] He has also guest starred in one of the Welcome to Night Vale live stage shows, playing the role of a radio station intern named after himself, the character meeting a prompt demise as is the podcast's tradition for interns.[citation needed] He also plays a character in the podcast, Earl Harlan, a friend of the main character. He was originally a 20-something regular guy, when he was dragged away to the "Eternal Scout" ceremony and disappeared. He then returned as a 53 year old with a son, and was the sous chef of Night Vale's top restaurant.[citation needed]
Writing[edit]
Wheaton runs his own blog, Wil Wheaton Dot Net. Between 2001 and late 2004, he operated a message board, known as "The Soapbox" or "Paracosm," as part of the blog site. Two collections of writings taken from postings to the message board have been published, titled Boxer Shorts (ISBN 1-932461-00-0) and Boxer Shorts Redux (ISBN 1-932461-03-5). He contributes regularly to the Los Angeles-based Metroblogging site. In June 2005, he became that month's featured Tech writer for the SuicideGirls Newswire.[64] He had a monthly column, entitled "Wil Save," in the Dungeons & Dragons-based magazine Dungeon, until May 2005. From January 2005 to October 2006, he wrote a column for The A.V. Club about early video games, called "Games of Our Lives." On December 12, 2008, he returned to his role as Geek in Review editor,[clarification needed] with his editorials being published every second Wednesday of the month.

In early 2003, he founded the independent publishing company Monolith Press and released a memoir entitled Dancing Barefoot. Monolith Press was "founded on the idea that publication should not be limited by opportunity."[65] Most of the entries are extended versions of his blog entries. Dancing Barefoot sold out three printings in four months. In winter 2003, Wheaton signed to publisher Tim O'Reilly with a three-book contract. O'Reilly acquired Dancing Barefoot, and published his extended memoirs, Just a Geek, in summer of 2004. He has since written about his bitterness regarding how the book was marketed, believing it was pitched as a Star Trek book when he intended it as more of a personal memoir.[66] Subsequently, in 2007, his next book, The Happiest Days of Our Lives was again published by Monolith Press.
With the release of Sunken Treasure: Wil Wheaton's Hot Cocoa Box Sampler in February 2009, instead of using traditional publishing, Wheaton decided to self-publish using Lulu Publishing, releasing paperback and digital copies, something he has continued to do with all his publications since. As a chapbook, Sunken Treasure contains several small extracts of various different projects, including two short stories from Ficlets, an ACME comedy sketch, William's Tell and a Criminal Minds production diary. The production diary was later released as an audiobook. Later that same year, Wheaton released Memories of the Future: Volume 1, a humorous critique, as well as an account of Wheaton's own experiences with, and memories of, the first thirteen episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Closing up 2009, Wheaton published a special edition of The Happiest Days of Our Lives, which also included an afterword by his son, Ryan. The Happiest Days of Our Lives and Sunken Treasure were also released on a Creative Commons license.
Politics[edit]
Wheaton described himself as a liberal in 2005.[67] In September 2006, he criticized George W. Bush's plan to suspend habeas corpus and to use torture: "Shame on President Bush. Shame on his Republican allies in Congress, and shame on the spineless, cowardly Democrats who did not stand up to them."[68] In a column that he wrote for Salon.com in 2005, The Real War on Christmas, Wheaton attacked conservative commentators like Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity for influencing the political views of his parents, with whom Wheaton found himself unable to have political discussions during family get-togethers on holidays like Christmas.[67] Wheaton's parents were very offended by the article, and he posted a lengthy apology on his site and an interview in which his parents clarified their political views.[69]
Wheaton is a supporter of Electronic Frontier Foundation and has been involved with the organization since 2002.[70]
On August 24, 2007, Wheaton gave the keynote for the yearly Penny Arcade Expo, which was subsequently made available online.[71] He stepped in following a public battle between the formerly-scheduled keynote debate participants, noted anti-games activist Jack Thompson and Hal Halpin, the president of the Entertainment Consumers Association (ECA). Much of Wheaton's address focused on the debate over violence in video games. He also gave the keynote at PAX East 2010 in Boston, Massachusetts.
He supported Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential Election[72] and opposed Proposition 8, calling it "nothing but hate and discrimination".[73]
In September 2015, Wheaton announced that he was supporting Bernie Sanders' bid to be the 2016 Democratic Party presidential candidate nominee.[74] He subsequently campaigned for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.[75]
Personal life[edit]
Wheaton was roommates with Chris Hardwick at UCLA.[16][76] They met at a showing of Arachnophobia in Burbank, California.[16]
Wheaton married Anne Prince on November 7, 1999,[77] and lives in Arcadia, California, with her and her two sons from a previous relationship.[78] When one son was 18, he asked Wheaton to legally adopt him, which he did.[1][79]
Wheaton is an aficionado of computers, the internet, and technology in general. He says he is drawn to alternatives like Linux because he is left-handed, though he ceased using Linux when he switched to Windows 2000.[78] Since at least 2003, his operating system of choice has been OS X, though he still runs Linux (Debian) in a virtual machine.[80] He also enjoys brewing his own beer at home,[81] and he collaborated with Fark creator Drew Curtis and Stone Brewing Co. CEO Greg Koch to create a geek-themed stout beer called Stone Farking Wheaton w00tstout.[82]
Wheaton is also a major longtime fan of the Los Angeles Kings ice hockey team and can often be found at the Staples Center at both regular season and playoff games.[83] Wheaton is also a "die-hard" fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and has gone to many games at Dodger Stadium.[84] Wheaton is also a fan of English football club Arsenal.[85]
Wheaton lives with generalized anxiety disorder and chronic depression. He supports mental health nonprofit organizations in raising awareness for these conditions.[86]

Early life[edit]
Wheaton was born July 29, 1972, in Burbank, California, to Debra Nordean "Debbie" (née O'Connor), an actress, and Richard William Wheaton, Jr., a medical specialist.[3][4][5] He has a brother, Jeremy, and a sister, Amy.[6] Both appeared uncredited in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "When the Bough Breaks".[7] Amy also appeared alongside Wil in the 1987 film The Curse.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Early work[edit]
Wheaton made his acting debut in the television film A Long Way Home (1981), and his first cinema role was as Martin Brisby in the animated film The Secret of NIMH (1982), the movie adaptation of Robert C. O'Brien's book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (1971). He had a minor role in The Last Starfighter (1984) as Louis's friend, but it was cut. He first gained widespread attention for playing Gordie Lachance in Stand by Me (1986), the film adaptation of Stephen King's novella The Body which was originally published in 1982's Different Seasons".[2][8]
Star Trek[edit]
From 1987 to 1991, he played Wesley Crusher in the first four seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation. This became a recurring role later in the series. A vocal group of Trekkies disliked his Star Trek character and, by extension, Wheaton himself during TNG's first run. Wheaton commented about his critics in an interview for WebTalk Radio:

Later, I determined that the people who were really, really cruel – like the Usenet weenies – really are a statistically insignificant number of people. And I know, just over the years from people who've e-mailed me at my web site and people who I've talked to since I started going to Star Trek conventions again in the last five years, that there are so many more people who really enjoyed everything about the show, including my performance, including the character.[9]

Wheaton's notoriety among Star Trek fandom is covered in a number of web comics. For example, ArcaneTimes (March 25, 2005) offers a sympathetic position;[10] Something Positive presents a range of opinions on the storyline Mike's Kid;[11] and Abstruse Goose tries to distinguish between the character and the actor.[12]
Post-Star Trek[edit]




Wil Wheaton in 2001



Wheaton played Joey Trotta in the action film Toy Soldiers (1991). After leaving Star Trek, he moved to Topeka, Kansas, to work for NewTek, where he helped to develop the Video Toaster 4000 doing product testing and quality control[13][14] and later used his public profile to serve as a technology evangelist for the product.[15] Wheaton said this was a period of growth in his life, and living away from Los Angeles helped him deal with anger problems.
Afterward, he returned to Los Angeles, attended acting school for five years, and then re-entered the acting world.[16][17] In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wheaton appeared in several independent films, including the award-winning The Good Things (2001), in which he portrays a frustrated Kansas tollbooth worker; it was selected Best Short Film at the 2002 Deauville Film Festival.[2][18] For his performance in Jane White Is Sick & Twisted (2002) he received the Best Actor award at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival.[19]
Voice work[edit]




Wheaton at W00tstock 2.4 in San Diego, July 2010


Wheaton has worked as a voice actor in animation, video games and audiobooks, beginning with the role of young Martin Brisby in The Secret of NIMH at age 10. His most noteworthy credits include the roles of Aqualad in the cartoons Teen Titans and Teen Titans Go!, the voice of radio journalist Richard Burns in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Kyle in the Nickelodeon cartoon, Kyle + Rosemary as well as himself and various other characters on both Family Guy and Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy. Wheaton also featured as the second Blue Beetle, Ted Kord, on Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Dr. Peter Meechum in Generator Rex, Mike Morningstar / Darkstar in Ben 10: Alien Force, Ben 10: Ultimate Alien & Ben 10: Omniverse". Additonally Wheaton took upon the Anime roles of Yakumo in Kurokami: The Animation, Menma in Naruto, Hans in Slayers Evolution-R, Aaron Terzieff in Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. He also appeared as himself in a skit on nerdcore rapper MC Frontalot's 2008 album Final Boss attempting to be a rapper, whose rhymes only involved shellfish. Wheaton later collaborated with Frontalot on "Your Friend Wil", a track from the 2010 album Zero Day on the subject of Wheaton's law, which states "don't be a dick"[20][21][non-primary source needed] (the phrase was in use before Wheaton's blog post).[22] Wheaton and Frontalot have both appeared at the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX).[2]
Wheaton has also narrated a number of bestselling audiobooks, mostly in the science-fiction and fantasy category, including Ready Player One by Ernest Cline (Wheaton also exists in the novel's universe, described as being joint President, along with Cory Doctorow, of the virtual world Oasis, which is the setting for much of the book), "Armada" also by Cline, Redshirts by John Scalzi, and books 6–10 of the Chronicles of Amber series by Roger Zelazny.
Television and web[edit]
Wheaton was a contestant on a 2001 episode of The Weakest Link featuring Star Trek actors attempting to win money for charity. He has made guest appearances on the November 23, 2007 episode of the TV series Numb3rs, and the October 22, 2008 episode of the series Criminal Minds, and appeared in Internet presentations, including a cameo in a comedy sketch ("Lock Out") for LoadingReadyRun[23] (and a reprise of the same the following year, in CommodoreHustle 4), and the May 30, 2008 episode of the Internet series Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show. From 2009-2011, Wheaton appeared in seasons 3, 4, and 5 of the web series The Guild as Fawkes, the leader for a rival guild known as Axis of Anarchy.[24] Wheaton credits his roles in Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show and The Guild for reigniting his career by encouraging him to seek out roles as the "Villain You Love To Hate" stock character.[25] He also appears in seasons 2, 3, and 4 of the TV series Leverage, as rival computer hacker Colin "Chaos" Mason, antagonist to Leverage team hacker Alec Hardison. He makes regular appearances in many web productions for Geek & Sundry, including hosting TableTop, a board game based show,[26] and Titansgrave, a roleplaying game based show.[27]
He appeared as a fictionalized version of himself in several episodes of the sitcom The Big Bang Theory, starting in season 3, episode 5: "The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary" (2009). On the show, Wheaton behaves in comically petty and manipulative ways towards main character Sheldon Cooper, who regards him as an archenemy until the season 5 episode "The Russian Rocket Reaction", when they make amends and become friends. Wheaton appears in 12 episodes in a recurring, guest-starring role on Eureka, playing Dr. Isaac Parrish, the head of the Non-Lethal Weapons Lab at Global Dynamics and a thorn in Fargo's side.[28] Wheaton also voices the character of the former scoutmaster and current sous-chef Earl Harlan in the popular dark, surreal-comedy podcast Welcome to Night Vale.
Wheaton appears as Alexander Rook in the Syfy TV series Dark Matter, based on the eponymous comic book. The TV series premiered on June 12, 2015.[29]
Hosting[edit]
From September 2006 to September 2007, Wheaton hosted a Revision3 syndicated video podcast called InDigital along with Jessica Corbin and veteran host Hahn Choi. He hosted a NASA video on the Mars Curiosity rover which landed on Monday August 6, 2012.[30] He has also hosted "2nd Watch," interviews with cast members and producers of the science-fiction series Falling Skies that appears on-line after each episode.[31]  On April 3, 2014, Wheaton announced on his blog that his new show called The Wil Wheaton Project would premiere on the SyFy network at 10pm on May 27 for an initial projected run of twelve episodes.[32][33] However, on August 29, Wheaton blogged that SyFy canceled the show after only one season.[34]
Other ventures[edit]
Games[edit]
In 2003, Wheaton mentioned his love for the game of poker on his blog. The following year, he began writing more extensively about his poker-playing experiences, including stories about playing Texas hold 'em tournaments locally and in Las Vegas. Eventually, he worked up to regular play, including a run at the 2005 World Poker Tour Championships. On June 23, 2005, Wheaton accepted an invitation to join Team PokerStars.[35] He went on to play in that year's World Series of Poker and was the guest speaker for the 2005 BARGE Banquet. In June 2007, he announced he would no longer be on Team Pokerstars due to changes in the U.S. legal system that would cause poker sites to have to focus on European and Asian markets[36] and held a farewell Pokerstars tournament on June 5, 2007, which he titled So Long and Thanks for All the Chips.[37]
Wheaton is a Dungeons & Dragons player,[38] and played during the PAX 2010 event using the 4th edition rules. Wheaton, along with webcartoonists Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik of Penny Arcade, and Scott Kurtz of PvP, played in front of a live audience. The game was hosted and recorded by Wizards of the Coast with Chris Perkins as the dungeonmaster.[39] Wheaton also played D&D 4th edition at the PAX 2011 event using the 4th edition rules, and used the D&D Next play test rules at PAX Prime 2012. Wheaton also hosts the web series TableTop, where he explains how to play various card, board and dice games, then plays a round with celebrity guests.[40] Wheaton also starred in the Kickstarter-funded game There Came an Echo by Iridium Studios.[41] In Dungeons and Dragons Online, he became the dungeon master of the Temple of Elemental Evil quests.[42]
Nintendo of America announced on Twitter that Wheaton would be voicing Abraham Lincoln in Code Name: STEAM.[43]
Wheaton announced in February, 2015, that he was chosen to provide voiceover talent for the upcoming strategy role-playing video game Firefly Online, a game based on Joss Whedon's Firefly sci-fi franchise.[44]
Wheaton has spoken out against misogyny in video game culture,[45][46] and wrote a profile of Anita Sarkeesian for the 2015 Time 100.[47]
Wheaton also does the voice narration on the Secret Hitler companion app for the Secret Hitler social deduction game.[48]
Comic book[edit]
A fictionalized version of Wheaton was included in the comic book PS 238, in which he harbors the power of telekinesis. Wheaton's debut comic book The Guild: Fawkes, which he wrote alongside Felicia Day, was released on May 23, 2012.[49]
Audiobooks[edit]
Wheaton has recorded several of his non-self-published books as downloadable audiobooks. These include Just a Geek, Dancing Barefoot, The Happiest Days of Our Lives, and his Criminal Minds diary from Sunken Treasure. He also released excerpts of Memories of The Future: Vol 1 as free podcasts. He has also narrated several audiobooks by other authors, including Ready Player One and Armada by Ernest Cline;[50][51] Masters of Doom by David Kushner;[52] Homeland by Cory Doctorow;[citation needed] Fuzzy Nation, The Android's Dream, Agent to the Stars, Redshirts and Lock In, all by John Scalzi;[53][54][55][56] Peter and Max: A Fables Novel by Bill Willingham;[57] "Byways", part of METAtropolis: Cascadia by Tobias Buckell;[58] "What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Hypothetical Questions" by Randall Munroe;[59] and Boneshaker by Cherie Priest.[60] Similarly, Wheaton has provided the voice-over for the digital gamebook, Trial of the Clone.[61]
Live shows[edit]
Wheaton has performed improvisational and sketch comedy at the ACME Comedy Theater in Hollywood.[62] He has a traveling sketch comedy/improv troupe called "EarnestBorg9" that performs science fiction-related comedy at conventions.[63] Wheaton is one of the three headline acts of the w00tstock shows, appearing in nearly all of them when his filming schedule has allowed.[citation needed] He has also guest starred in one of the Welcome to Night Vale live stage shows, playing the role of a radio station intern named after himself, the character meeting a prompt demise as is the podcast's tradition for interns.[citation needed] He also plays a character in the podcast, Earl Harlan, a friend of the main character. He was originally a 20-something regular guy, when he was dragged away to the "Eternal Scout" ceremony and disappeared. He then returned as a 53 year old with a son, and was the sous chef of Night Vale's top restaurant.[citation needed]
Writing[edit]
Wheaton runs his own blog, Wil Wheaton Dot Net. Between 2001 and late 2004, he operated a message board, known as "The Soapbox" or "Paracosm," as part of the blog site. Two collections of writings taken from postings to the message board have been published, titled Boxer Shorts (ISBN 1-932461-00-0) and Boxer Shorts Redux (ISBN 1-932461-03-5). He contributes regularly to the Los Angeles-based Metroblogging site. In June 2005, he became that month's featured Tech writer for the SuicideGirls Newswire.[64] He had a monthly column, entitled "Wil Save," in the Dungeons & Dragons-based magazine Dungeon, until May 2005. From January 2005 to October 2006, he wrote a column for The A.V. Club about early video games, called "Games of Our Lives." On December 12, 2008, he returned to his role as Geek in Review editor,[clarification needed] with his editorials being published every second Wednesday of the month.

In early 2003, he founded the independent publishing company Monolith Press and released a memoir entitled Dancing Barefoot. Monolith Press was "founded on the idea that publication should not be limited by opportunity."[65] Most of the entries are extended versions of his blog entries. Dancing Barefoot sold out three printings in four months. In winter 2003, Wheaton signed to publisher Tim O'Reilly with a three-book contract. O'Reilly acquired Dancing Barefoot, and published his extended memoirs, Just a Geek, in summer of 2004. He has since written about his bitterness regarding how the book was marketed, believing it was pitched as a Star Trek book when he intended it as more of a personal memoir.[66] Subsequently, in 2007, his next book, The Happiest Days of Our Lives was again published by Monolith Press.
With the release of Sunken Treasure: Wil Wheaton's Hot Cocoa Box Sampler in February 2009, instead of using traditional publishing, Wheaton decided to self-publish using Lulu Publishing, releasing paperback and digital copies, something he has continued to do with all his publications since. As a chapbook, Sunken Treasure contains several small extracts of various different projects, including two short stories from Ficlets, an ACME comedy sketch, William's Tell and a Criminal Minds production diary. The production diary was later released as an audiobook. Later that same year, Wheaton released Memories of the Future: Volume 1, a humorous critique, as well as an account of Wheaton's own experiences with, and memories of, the first thirteen episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Closing up 2009, Wheaton published a special edition of The Happiest Days of Our Lives, which also included an afterword by his son, Ryan. The Happiest Days of Our Lives and Sunken Treasure were also released on a Creative Commons license.
Politics[edit]
Wheaton described himself as a liberal in 2005.[67] In September 2006, he criticized George W. Bush's plan to suspend habeas corpus and to use torture: "Shame on President Bush. Shame on his Republican allies in Congress, and shame on the spineless, cowardly Democrats who did not stand up to them."[68] In a column that he wrote for Salon.com in 2005, The Real War on Christmas, Wheaton attacked conservative commentators like Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity for influencing the political views of his parents, with whom Wheaton found himself unable to have political discussions during family get-togethers on holidays like Christmas.[67] Wheaton's parents were very offended by the article, and he posted a lengthy apology on his site and an interview in which his parents clarified their political views.[69]
Wheaton is a supporter of Electronic Frontier Foundation and has been involved with the organization since 2002.[70]
On August 24, 2007, Wheaton gave the keynote for the yearly Penny Arcade Expo, which was subsequently made available online.[71] He stepped in following a public battle between the formerly-scheduled keynote debate participants, noted anti-games activist Jack Thompson and Hal Halpin, the president of the Entertainment Consumers Association (ECA). Much of Wheaton's address focused on the debate over violence in video games. He also gave the keynote at PAX East 2010 in Boston, Massachusetts.
He supported Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential Election[72] and opposed Proposition 8, calling it "nothing but hate and discrimination".[73]
In September 2015, Wheaton announced that he was supporting Bernie Sanders' bid to be the 2016 Democratic Party presidential candidate nominee.[74] He subsequently campaigned for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.[75]
Personal life[edit]
Wheaton was roommates with Chris Hardwick at UCLA.[16][76] They met at a showing of Arachnophobia in Burbank, California.[16]
Wheaton married Anne Prince on November 7, 1999,[77] and lives in Arcadia, California, with her and her two sons from a previous relationship.[78] When one son was 18, he asked Wheaton to legally adopt him, which he did.[1][79]
Wheaton is an aficionado of computers, the internet, and technology in general. He says he is drawn to alternatives like Linux because he is left-handed, though he ceased using Linux when he switched to Windows 2000.[78] Since at least 2003, his operating system of choice has been OS X, though he still runs Linux (Debian) in a virtual machine.[80] He also enjoys brewing his own beer at home,[81] and he collaborated with Fark creator Drew Curtis and Stone Brewing Co. CEO Greg Koch to create a geek-themed stout beer called Stone Farking Wheaton w00tstout.[82]
Wheaton is also a major longtime fan of the Los Angeles Kings ice hockey team and can often be found at the Staples Center at both regular season and playoff games.[83] Wheaton is also a "die-hard" fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and has gone to many games at Dodger Stadium.[84] Wheaton is also a fan of English football club Arsenal.[85]
Wheaton lives with generalized anxiety disorder and chronic depression. He supports mental health nonprofit organizations in raising awareness for these conditions.[86]
Honors[edit]

Young Artist Awards: 1989 & 1987

Trivia[edit]

Early life[edit]
Wheaton was born July 29, 1972, in Burbank, California, to Debra Nordean "Debbie" (née O'Connor), an actress, and Richard William Wheaton, Jr., a medical specialist.[3][4][5] He has a brother, Jeremy, and a sister, Amy.[6] Both appeared uncredited in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "When the Bough Breaks".[7] Amy also appeared alongside Wil in the 1987 film The Curse.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Early work[edit]
Wheaton made his acting debut in the television film A Long Way Home (1981), and his first cinema role was as Martin Brisby in the animated film The Secret of NIMH (1982), the movie adaptation of Robert C. O'Brien's book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (1971). He had a minor role in The Last Starfighter (1984) as Louis's friend, but it was cut. He first gained widespread attention for playing Gordie Lachance in Stand by Me (1986), the film adaptation of Stephen King's novella The Body which was originally published in 1982's Different Seasons".[2][8]
Star Trek[edit]
From 1987 to 1991, he played Wesley Crusher in the first four seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation. This became a recurring role later in the series. A vocal group of Trekkies disliked his Star Trek character and, by extension, Wheaton himself during TNG's first run. Wheaton commented about his critics in an interview for WebTalk Radio:

Later, I determined that the people who were really, really cruel – like the Usenet weenies – really are a statistically insignificant number of people. And I know, just over the years from people who've e-mailed me at my web site and people who I've talked to since I started going to Star Trek conventions again in the last five years, that there are so many more people who really enjoyed everything about the show, including my performance, including the character.[9]

Wheaton's notoriety among Star Trek fandom is covered in a number of web comics. For example, ArcaneTimes (March 25, 2005) offers a sympathetic position;[10] Something Positive presents a range of opinions on the storyline Mike's Kid;[11] and Abstruse Goose tries to distinguish between the character and the actor.[12]
Post-Star Trek[edit]




Wil Wheaton in 2001



Wheaton played Joey Trotta in the action film Toy Soldiers (1991). After leaving Star Trek, he moved to Topeka, Kansas, to work for NewTek, where he helped to develop the Video Toaster 4000 doing product testing and quality control[13][14] and later used his public profile to serve as a technology evangelist for the product.[15] Wheaton said this was a period of growth in his life, and living away from Los Angeles helped him deal with anger problems.
Afterward, he returned to Los Angeles, attended acting school for five years, and then re-entered the acting world.[16][17] In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wheaton appeared in several independent films, including the award-winning The Good Things (2001), in which he portrays a frustrated Kansas tollbooth worker; it was selected Best Short Film at the 2002 Deauville Film Festival.[2][18] For his performance in Jane White Is Sick & Twisted (2002) he received the Best Actor award at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival.[19]
Voice work[edit]




Wheaton at W00tstock 2.4 in San Diego, July 2010


Wheaton has worked as a voice actor in animation, video games and audiobooks, beginning with the role of young Martin Brisby in The Secret of NIMH at age 10. His most noteworthy credits include the roles of Aqualad in the cartoons Teen Titans and Teen Titans Go!, the voice of radio journalist Richard Burns in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Kyle in the Nickelodeon cartoon, Kyle + Rosemary as well as himself and various other characters on both Family Guy and Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy. Wheaton also featured as the second Blue Beetle, Ted Kord, on Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Dr. Peter Meechum in Generator Rex, Mike Morningstar / Darkstar in Ben 10: Alien Force, Ben 10: Ultimate Alien & Ben 10: Omniverse". Additonally Wheaton took upon the Anime roles of Yakumo in Kurokami: The Animation, Menma in Naruto, Hans in Slayers Evolution-R, Aaron Terzieff in Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. He also appeared as himself in a skit on nerdcore rapper MC Frontalot's 2008 album Final Boss attempting to be a rapper, whose rhymes only involved shellfish. Wheaton later collaborated with Frontalot on "Your Friend Wil", a track from the 2010 album Zero Day on the subject of Wheaton's law, which states "don't be a dick"[20][21][non-primary source needed] (the phrase was in use before Wheaton's blog post).[22] Wheaton and Frontalot have both appeared at the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX).[2]
Wheaton has also narrated a number of bestselling audiobooks, mostly in the science-fiction and fantasy category, including Ready Player One by Ernest Cline (Wheaton also exists in the novel's universe, described as being joint President, along with Cory Doctorow, of the virtual world Oasis, which is the setting for much of the book), "Armada" also by Cline, Redshirts by John Scalzi, and books 6–10 of the Chronicles of Amber series by Roger Zelazny.
Television and web[edit]
Wheaton was a contestant on a 2001 episode of The Weakest Link featuring Star Trek actors attempting to win money for charity. He has made guest appearances on the November 23, 2007 episode of the TV series Numb3rs, and the October 22, 2008 episode of the series Criminal Minds, and appeared in Internet presentations, including a cameo in a comedy sketch ("Lock Out") for LoadingReadyRun[23] (and a reprise of the same the following year, in CommodoreHustle 4), and the May 30, 2008 episode of the Internet series Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show. From 2009-2011, Wheaton appeared in seasons 3, 4, and 5 of the web series The Guild as Fawkes, the leader for a rival guild known as Axis of Anarchy.[24] Wheaton credits his roles in Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show and The Guild for reigniting his career by encouraging him to seek out roles as the "Villain You Love To Hate" stock character.[25] He also appears in seasons 2, 3, and 4 of the TV series Leverage, as rival computer hacker Colin "Chaos" Mason, antagonist to Leverage team hacker Alec Hardison. He makes regular appearances in many web productions for Geek & Sundry, including hosting TableTop, a board game based show,[26] and Titansgrave, a roleplaying game based show.[27]
He appeared as a fictionalized version of himself in several episodes of the sitcom The Big Bang Theory, starting in season 3, episode 5: "The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary" (2009). On the show, Wheaton behaves in comically petty and manipulative ways towards main character Sheldon Cooper, who regards him as an archenemy until the season 5 episode "The Russian Rocket Reaction", when they make amends and become friends. Wheaton appears in 12 episodes in a recurring, guest-starring role on Eureka, playing Dr. Isaac Parrish, the head of the Non-Lethal Weapons Lab at Global Dynamics and a thorn in Fargo's side.[28] Wheaton also voices the character of the former scoutmaster and current sous-chef Earl Harlan in the popular dark, surreal-comedy podcast Welcome to Night Vale.
Wheaton appears as Alexander Rook in the Syfy TV series Dark Matter, based on the eponymous comic book. The TV series premiered on June 12, 2015.[29]
Hosting[edit]
From September 2006 to September 2007, Wheaton hosted a Revision3 syndicated video podcast called InDigital along with Jessica Corbin and veteran host Hahn Choi. He hosted a NASA video on the Mars Curiosity rover which landed on Monday August 6, 2012.[30] He has also hosted "2nd Watch," interviews with cast members and producers of the science-fiction series Falling Skies that appears on-line after each episode.[31]  On April 3, 2014, Wheaton announced on his blog that his new show called The Wil Wheaton Project would premiere on the SyFy network at 10pm on May 27 for an initial projected run of twelve episodes.[32][33] However, on August 29, Wheaton blogged that SyFy canceled the show after only one season.[34]
Other ventures[edit]
Games[edit]
In 2003, Wheaton mentioned his love for the game of poker on his blog. The following year, he began writing more extensively about his poker-playing experiences, including stories about playing Texas hold 'em tournaments locally and in Las Vegas. Eventually, he worked up to regular play, including a run at the 2005 World Poker Tour Championships. On June 23, 2005, Wheaton accepted an invitation to join Team PokerStars.[35] He went on to play in that year's World Series of Poker and was the guest speaker for the 2005 BARGE Banquet. In June 2007, he announced he would no longer be on Team Pokerstars due to changes in the U.S. legal system that would cause poker sites to have to focus on European and Asian markets[36] and held a farewell Pokerstars tournament on June 5, 2007, which he titled So Long and Thanks for All the Chips.[37]
Wheaton is a Dungeons & Dragons player,[38] and played during the PAX 2010 event using the 4th edition rules. Wheaton, along with webcartoonists Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik of Penny Arcade, and Scott Kurtz of PvP, played in front of a live audience. The game was hosted and recorded by Wizards of the Coast with Chris Perkins as the dungeonmaster.[39] Wheaton also played D&D 4th edition at the PAX 2011 event using the 4th edition rules, and used the D&D Next play test rules at PAX Prime 2012. Wheaton also hosts the web series TableTop, where he explains how to play various card, board and dice games, then plays a round with celebrity guests.[40] Wheaton also starred in the Kickstarter-funded game There Came an Echo by Iridium Studios.[41] In Dungeons and Dragons Online, he became the dungeon master of the Temple of Elemental Evil quests.[42]
Nintendo of America announced on Twitter that Wheaton would be voicing Abraham Lincoln in Code Name: STEAM.[43]
Wheaton announced in February, 2015, that he was chosen to provide voiceover talent for the upcoming strategy role-playing video game Firefly Online, a game based on Joss Whedon's Firefly sci-fi franchise.[44]
Wheaton has spoken out against misogyny in video game culture,[45][46] and wrote a profile of Anita Sarkeesian for the 2015 Time 100.[47]
Wheaton also does the voice narration on the Secret Hitler companion app for the Secret Hitler social deduction game.[48]
Comic book[edit]
A fictionalized version of Wheaton was included in the comic book PS 238, in which he harbors the power of telekinesis. Wheaton's debut comic book The Guild: Fawkes, which he wrote alongside Felicia Day, was released on May 23, 2012.[49]
Audiobooks[edit]
Wheaton has recorded several of his non-self-published books as downloadable audiobooks. These include Just a Geek, Dancing Barefoot, The Happiest Days of Our Lives, and his Criminal Minds diary from Sunken Treasure. He also released excerpts of Memories of The Future: Vol 1 as free podcasts. He has also narrated several audiobooks by other authors, including Ready Player One and Armada by Ernest Cline;[50][51] Masters of Doom by David Kushner;[52] Homeland by Cory Doctorow;[citation needed] Fuzzy Nation, The Android's Dream, Agent to the Stars, Redshirts and Lock In, all by John Scalzi;[53][54][55][56] Peter and Max: A Fables Novel by Bill Willingham;[57] "Byways", part of METAtropolis: Cascadia by Tobias Buckell;[58] "What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Hypothetical Questions" by Randall Munroe;[59] and Boneshaker by Cherie Priest.[60] Similarly, Wheaton has provided the voice-over for the digital gamebook, Trial of the Clone.[61]
Live shows[edit]
Wheaton has performed improvisational and sketch comedy at the ACME Comedy Theater in Hollywood.[62] He has a traveling sketch comedy/improv troupe called "EarnestBorg9" that performs science fiction-related comedy at conventions.[63] Wheaton is one of the three headline acts of the w00tstock shows, appearing in nearly all of them when his filming schedule has allowed.[citation needed] He has also guest starred in one of the Welcome to Night Vale live stage shows, playing the role of a radio station intern named after himself, the character meeting a prompt demise as is the podcast's tradition for interns.[citation needed] He also plays a character in the podcast, Earl Harlan, a friend of the main character. He was originally a 20-something regular guy, when he was dragged away to the "Eternal Scout" ceremony and disappeared. He then returned as a 53 year old with a son, and was the sous chef of Night Vale's top restaurant.[citation needed]
Writing[edit]
Wheaton runs his own blog, Wil Wheaton Dot Net. Between 2001 and late 2004, he operated a message board, known as "The Soapbox" or "Paracosm," as part of the blog site. Two collections of writings taken from postings to the message board have been published, titled Boxer Shorts (ISBN 1-932461-00-0) and Boxer Shorts Redux (ISBN 1-932461-03-5). He contributes regularly to the Los Angeles-based Metroblogging site. In June 2005, he became that month's featured Tech writer for the SuicideGirls Newswire.[64] He had a monthly column, entitled "Wil Save," in the Dungeons & Dragons-based magazine Dungeon, until May 2005. From January 2005 to October 2006, he wrote a column for The A.V. Club about early video games, called "Games of Our Lives." On December 12, 2008, he returned to his role as Geek in Review editor,[clarification needed] with his editorials being published every second Wednesday of the month.

In early 2003, he founded the independent publishing company Monolith Press and released a memoir entitled Dancing Barefoot. Monolith Press was "founded on the idea that publication should not be limited by opportunity."[65] Most of the entries are extended versions of his blog entries. Dancing Barefoot sold out three printings in four months. In winter 2003, Wheaton signed to publisher Tim O'Reilly with a three-book contract. O'Reilly acquired Dancing Barefoot, and published his extended memoirs, Just a Geek, in summer of 2004. He has since written about his bitterness regarding how the book was marketed, believing it was pitched as a Star Trek book when he intended it as more of a personal memoir.[66] Subsequently, in 2007, his next book, The Happiest Days of Our Lives was again published by Monolith Press.
With the release of Sunken Treasure: Wil Wheaton's Hot Cocoa Box Sampler in February 2009, instead of using traditional publishing, Wheaton decided to self-publish using Lulu Publishing, releasing paperback and digital copies, something he has continued to do with all his publications since. As a chapbook, Sunken Treasure contains several small extracts of various different projects, including two short stories from Ficlets, an ACME comedy sketch, William's Tell and a Criminal Minds production diary. The production diary was later released as an audiobook. Later that same year, Wheaton released Memories of the Future: Volume 1, a humorous critique, as well as an account of Wheaton's own experiences with, and memories of, the first thirteen episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Closing up 2009, Wheaton published a special edition of The Happiest Days of Our Lives, which also included an afterword by his son, Ryan. The Happiest Days of Our Lives and Sunken Treasure were also released on a Creative Commons license.
Politics[edit]
Wheaton described himself as a liberal in 2005.[67] In September 2006, he criticized George W. Bush's plan to suspend habeas corpus and to use torture: "Shame on President Bush. Shame on his Republican allies in Congress, and shame on the spineless, cowardly Democrats who did not stand up to them."[68] In a column that he wrote for Salon.com in 2005, The Real War on Christmas, Wheaton attacked conservative commentators like Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity for influencing the political views of his parents, with whom Wheaton found himself unable to have political discussions during family get-togethers on holidays like Christmas.[67] Wheaton's parents were very offended by the article, and he posted a lengthy apology on his site and an interview in which his parents clarified their political views.[69]
Wheaton is a supporter of Electronic Frontier Foundation and has been involved with the organization since 2002.[70]
On August 24, 2007, Wheaton gave the keynote for the yearly Penny Arcade Expo, which was subsequently made available online.[71] He stepped in following a public battle between the formerly-scheduled keynote debate participants, noted anti-games activist Jack Thompson and Hal Halpin, the president of the Entertainment Consumers Association (ECA). Much of Wheaton's address focused on the debate over violence in video games. He also gave the keynote at PAX East 2010 in Boston, Massachusetts.
He supported Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential Election[72] and opposed Proposition 8, calling it "nothing but hate and discrimination".[73]
In September 2015, Wheaton announced that he was supporting Bernie Sanders' bid to be the 2016 Democratic Party presidential candidate nominee.[74] He subsequently campaigned for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.[75]
Personal life[edit]
Wheaton was roommates with Chris Hardwick at UCLA.[16][76] They met at a showing of Arachnophobia in Burbank, California.[16]
Wheaton married Anne Prince on November 7, 1999,[77] and lives in Arcadia, California, with her and her two sons from a previous relationship.[78] When one son was 18, he asked Wheaton to legally adopt him, which he did.[1][79]
Wheaton is an aficionado of computers, the internet, and technology in general. He says he is drawn to alternatives like Linux because he is left-handed, though he ceased using Linux when he switched to Windows 2000.[78] Since at least 2003, his operating system of choice has been OS X, though he still runs Linux (Debian) in a virtual machine.[80] He also enjoys brewing his own beer at home,[81] and he collaborated with Fark creator Drew Curtis and Stone Brewing Co. CEO Greg Koch to create a geek-themed stout beer called Stone Farking Wheaton w00tstout.[82]
Wheaton is also a major longtime fan of the Los Angeles Kings ice hockey team and can often be found at the Staples Center at both regular season and playoff games.[83] Wheaton is also a "die-hard" fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and has gone to many games at Dodger Stadium.[84] Wheaton is also a fan of English football club Arsenal.[85]
Wheaton lives with generalized anxiety disorder and chronic depression. He supports mental health nonprofit organizations in raising awareness for these conditions.[86]

Early life[edit]
Wheaton was born July 29, 1972, in Burbank, California, to Debra Nordean "Debbie" (née O'Connor), an actress, and Richard William Wheaton, Jr., a medical specialist.[3][4][5] He has a brother, Jeremy, and a sister, Amy.[6] Both appeared uncredited in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "When the Bough Breaks".[7] Amy also appeared alongside Wil in the 1987 film The Curse.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Early work[edit]
Wheaton made his acting debut in the television film A Long Way Home (1981), and his first cinema role was as Martin Brisby in the animated film The Secret of NIMH (1982), the movie adaptation of Robert C. O'Brien's book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (1971). He had a minor role in The Last Starfighter (1984) as Louis's friend, but it was cut. He first gained widespread attention for playing Gordie Lachance in Stand by Me (1986), the film adaptation of Stephen King's novella The Body which was originally published in 1982's Different Seasons".[2][8]
Star Trek[edit]
From 1987 to 1991, he played Wesley Crusher in the first four seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation. This became a recurring role later in the series. A vocal group of Trekkies disliked his Star Trek character and, by extension, Wheaton himself during TNG's first run. Wheaton commented about his critics in an interview for WebTalk Radio:

Later, I determined that the people who were really, really cruel – like the Usenet weenies – really are a statistically insignificant number of people. And I know, just over the years from people who've e-mailed me at my web site and people who I've talked to since I started going to Star Trek conventions again in the last five years, that there are so many more people who really enjoyed everything about the show, including my performance, including the character.[9]

Wheaton's notoriety among Star Trek fandom is covered in a number of web comics. For example, ArcaneTimes (March 25, 2005) offers a sympathetic position;[10] Something Positive presents a range of opinions on the storyline Mike's Kid;[11] and Abstruse Goose tries to distinguish between the character and the actor.[12]
Post-Star Trek[edit]




Wil Wheaton in 2001



Wheaton played Joey Trotta in the action film Toy Soldiers (1991). After leaving Star Trek, he moved to Topeka, Kansas, to work for NewTek, where he helped to develop the Video Toaster 4000 doing product testing and quality control[13][14] and later used his public profile to serve as a technology evangelist for the product.[15] Wheaton said this was a period of growth in his life, and living away from Los Angeles helped him deal with anger problems.
Afterward, he returned to Los Angeles, attended acting school for five years, and then re-entered the acting world.[16][17] In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wheaton appeared in several independent films, including the award-winning The Good Things (2001), in which he portrays a frustrated Kansas tollbooth worker; it was selected Best Short Film at the 2002 Deauville Film Festival.[2][18] For his performance in Jane White Is Sick & Twisted (2002) he received the Best Actor award at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival.[19]
Voice work[edit]




Wheaton at W00tstock 2.4 in San Diego, July 2010


Wheaton has worked as a voice actor in animation, video games and audiobooks, beginning with the role of young Martin Brisby in The Secret of NIMH at age 10. His most noteworthy credits include the roles of Aqualad in the cartoons Teen Titans and Teen Titans Go!, the voice of radio journalist Richard Burns in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Kyle in the Nickelodeon cartoon, Kyle + Rosemary as well as himself and various other characters on both Family Guy and Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy. Wheaton also featured as the second Blue Beetle, Ted Kord, on Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Dr. Peter Meechum in Generator Rex, Mike Morningstar / Darkstar in Ben 10: Alien Force, Ben 10: Ultimate Alien & Ben 10: Omniverse". Additonally Wheaton took upon the Anime roles of Yakumo in Kurokami: The Animation, Menma in Naruto, Hans in Slayers Evolution-R, Aaron Terzieff in Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. He also appeared as himself in a skit on nerdcore rapper MC Frontalot's 2008 album Final Boss attempting to be a rapper, whose rhymes only involved shellfish. Wheaton later collaborated with Frontalot on "Your Friend Wil", a track from the 2010 album Zero Day on the subject of Wheaton's law, which states "don't be a dick"[20][21][non-primary source needed] (the phrase was in use before Wheaton's blog post).[22] Wheaton and Frontalot have both appeared at the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX).[2]
Wheaton has also narrated a number of bestselling audiobooks, mostly in the science-fiction and fantasy category, including Ready Player One by Ernest Cline (Wheaton also exists in the novel's universe, described as being joint President, along with Cory Doctorow, of the virtual world Oasis, which is the setting for much of the book), "Armada" also by Cline, Redshirts by John Scalzi, and books 6–10 of the Chronicles of Amber series by Roger Zelazny.
Television and web[edit]
Wheaton was a contestant on a 2001 episode of The Weakest Link featuring Star Trek actors attempting to win money for charity. He has made guest appearances on the November 23, 2007 episode of the TV series Numb3rs, and the October 22, 2008 episode of the series Criminal Minds, and appeared in Internet presentations, including a cameo in a comedy sketch ("Lock Out") for LoadingReadyRun[23] (and a reprise of the same the following year, in CommodoreHustle 4), and the May 30, 2008 episode of the Internet series Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show. From 2009-2011, Wheaton appeared in seasons 3, 4, and 5 of the web series The Guild as Fawkes, the leader for a rival guild known as Axis of Anarchy.[24] Wheaton credits his roles in Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show and The Guild for reigniting his career by encouraging him to seek out roles as the "Villain You Love To Hate" stock character.[25] He also appears in seasons 2, 3, and 4 of the TV series Leverage, as rival computer hacker Colin "Chaos" Mason, antagonist to Leverage team hacker Alec Hardison. He makes regular appearances in many web productions for Geek & Sundry, including hosting TableTop, a board game based show,[26] and Titansgrave, a roleplaying game based show.[27]
He appeared as a fictionalized version of himself in several episodes of the sitcom The Big Bang Theory, starting in season 3, episode 5: "The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary" (2009). On the show, Wheaton behaves in comically petty and manipulative ways towards main character Sheldon Cooper, who regards him as an archenemy until the season 5 episode "The Russian Rocket Reaction", when they make amends and become friends. Wheaton appears in 12 episodes in a recurring, guest-starring role on Eureka, playing Dr. Isaac Parrish, the head of the Non-Lethal Weapons Lab at Global Dynamics and a thorn in Fargo's side.[28] Wheaton also voices the character of the former scoutmaster and current sous-chef Earl Harlan in the popular dark, surreal-comedy podcast Welcome to Night Vale.
Wheaton appears as Alexander Rook in the Syfy TV series Dark Matter, based on the eponymous comic book. The TV series premiered on June 12, 2015.[29]
Hosting[edit]
From September 2006 to September 2007, Wheaton hosted a Revision3 syndicated video podcast called InDigital along with Jessica Corbin and veteran host Hahn Choi. He hosted a NASA video on the Mars Curiosity rover which landed on Monday August 6, 2012.[30] He has also hosted "2nd Watch," interviews with cast members and producers of the science-fiction series Falling Skies that appears on-line after each episode.[31]  On April 3, 2014, Wheaton announced on his blog that his new show called The Wil Wheaton Project would premiere on the SyFy network at 10pm on May 27 for an initial projected run of twelve episodes.[32][33] However, on August 29, Wheaton blogged that SyFy canceled the show after only one season.[34]
Other ventures[edit]
Games[edit]
In 2003, Wheaton mentioned his love for the game of poker on his blog. The following year, he began writing more extensively about his poker-playing experiences, including stories about playing Texas hold 'em tournaments locally and in Las Vegas. Eventually, he worked up to regular play, including a run at the 2005 World Poker Tour Championships. On June 23, 2005, Wheaton accepted an invitation to join Team PokerStars.[35] He went on to play in that year's World Series of Poker and was the guest speaker for the 2005 BARGE Banquet. In June 2007, he announced he would no longer be on Team Pokerstars due to changes in the U.S. legal system that would cause poker sites to have to focus on European and Asian markets[36] and held a farewell Pokerstars tournament on June 5, 2007, which he titled So Long and Thanks for All the Chips.[37]
Wheaton is a Dungeons & Dragons player,[38] and played during the PAX 2010 event using the 4th edition rules. Wheaton, along with webcartoonists Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik of Penny Arcade, and Scott Kurtz of PvP, played in front of a live audience. The game was hosted and recorded by Wizards of the Coast with Chris Perkins as the dungeonmaster.[39] Wheaton also played D&D 4th edition at the PAX 2011 event using the 4th edition rules, and used the D&D Next play test rules at PAX Prime 2012. Wheaton also hosts the web series TableTop, where he explains how to play various card, board and dice games, then plays a round with celebrity guests.[40] Wheaton also starred in the Kickstarter-funded game There Came an Echo by Iridium Studios.[41] In Dungeons and Dragons Online, he became the dungeon master of the Temple of Elemental Evil quests.[42]
Nintendo of America announced on Twitter that Wheaton would be voicing Abraham Lincoln in Code Name: STEAM.[43]
Wheaton announced in February, 2015, that he was chosen to provide voiceover talent for the upcoming strategy role-playing video game Firefly Online, a game based on Joss Whedon's Firefly sci-fi franchise.[44]
Wheaton has spoken out against misogyny in video game culture,[45][46] and wrote a profile of Anita Sarkeesian for the 2015 Time 100.[47]
Wheaton also does the voice narration on the Secret Hitler companion app for the Secret Hitler social deduction game.[48]
Comic book[edit]
A fictionalized version of Wheaton was included in the comic book PS 238, in which he harbors the power of telekinesis. Wheaton's debut comic book The Guild: Fawkes, which he wrote alongside Felicia Day, was released on May 23, 2012.[49]
Audiobooks[edit]
Wheaton has recorded several of his non-self-published books as downloadable audiobooks. These include Just a Geek, Dancing Barefoot, The Happiest Days of Our Lives, and his Criminal Minds diary from Sunken Treasure. He also released excerpts of Memories of The Future: Vol 1 as free podcasts. He has also narrated several audiobooks by other authors, including Ready Player One and Armada by Ernest Cline;[50][51] Masters of Doom by David Kushner;[52] Homeland by Cory Doctorow;[citation needed] Fuzzy Nation, The Android's Dream, Agent to the Stars, Redshirts and Lock In, all by John Scalzi;[53][54][55][56] Peter and Max: A Fables Novel by Bill Willingham;[57] "Byways", part of METAtropolis: Cascadia by Tobias Buckell;[58] "What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Hypothetical Questions" by Randall Munroe;[59] and Boneshaker by Cherie Priest.[60] Similarly, Wheaton has provided the voice-over for the digital gamebook, Trial of the Clone.[61]
Live shows[edit]
Wheaton has performed improvisational and sketch comedy at the ACME Comedy Theater in Hollywood.[62] He has a traveling sketch comedy/improv troupe called "EarnestBorg9" that performs science fiction-related comedy at conventions.[63] Wheaton is one of the three headline acts of the w00tstock shows, appearing in nearly all of them when his filming schedule has allowed.[citation needed] He has also guest starred in one of the Welcome to Night Vale live stage shows, playing the role of a radio station intern named after himself, the character meeting a prompt demise as is the podcast's tradition for interns.[citation needed] He also plays a character in the podcast, Earl Harlan, a friend of the main character. He was originally a 20-something regular guy, when he was dragged away to the "Eternal Scout" ceremony and disappeared. He then returned as a 53 year old with a son, and was the sous chef of Night Vale's top restaurant.[citation needed]
Writing[edit]
Wheaton runs his own blog, Wil Wheaton Dot Net. Between 2001 and late 2004, he operated a message board, known as "The Soapbox" or "Paracosm," as part of the blog site. Two collections of writings taken from postings to the message board have been published, titled Boxer Shorts (ISBN 1-932461-00-0) and Boxer Shorts Redux (ISBN 1-932461-03-5). He contributes regularly to the Los Angeles-based Metroblogging site. In June 2005, he became that month's featured Tech writer for the SuicideGirls Newswire.[64] He had a monthly column, entitled "Wil Save," in the Dungeons & Dragons-based magazine Dungeon, until May 2005. From January 2005 to October 2006, he wrote a column for The A.V. Club about early video games, called "Games of Our Lives." On December 12, 2008, he returned to his role as Geek in Review editor,[clarification needed] with his editorials being published every second Wednesday of the month.

In early 2003, he founded the independent publishing company Monolith Press and released a memoir entitled Dancing Barefoot. Monolith Press was "founded on the idea that publication should not be limited by opportunity."[65] Most of the entries are extended versions of his blog entries. Dancing Barefoot sold out three printings in four months. In winter 2003, Wheaton signed to publisher Tim O'Reilly with a three-book contract. O'Reilly acquired Dancing Barefoot, and published his extended memoirs, Just a Geek, in summer of 2004. He has since written about his bitterness regarding how the book was marketed, believing it was pitched as a Star Trek book when he intended it as more of a personal memoir.[66] Subsequently, in 2007, his next book, The Happiest Days of Our Lives was again published by Monolith Press.
With the release of Sunken Treasure: Wil Wheaton's Hot Cocoa Box Sampler in February 2009, instead of using traditional publishing, Wheaton decided to self-publish using Lulu Publishing, releasing paperback and digital copies, something he has continued to do with all his publications since. As a chapbook, Sunken Treasure contains several small extracts of various different projects, including two short stories from Ficlets, an ACME comedy sketch, William's Tell and a Criminal Minds production diary. The production diary was later released as an audiobook. Later that same year, Wheaton released Memories of the Future: Volume 1, a humorous critique, as well as an account of Wheaton's own experiences with, and memories of, the first thirteen episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Closing up 2009, Wheaton published a special edition of The Happiest Days of Our Lives, which also included an afterword by his son, Ryan. The Happiest Days of Our Lives and Sunken Treasure were also released on a Creative Commons license.
Politics[edit]
Wheaton described himself as a liberal in 2005.[67] In September 2006, he criticized George W. Bush's plan to suspend habeas corpus and to use torture: "Shame on President Bush. Shame on his Republican allies in Congress, and shame on the spineless, cowardly Democrats who did not stand up to them."[68] In a column that he wrote for Salon.com in 2005, The Real War on Christmas, Wheaton attacked conservative commentators like Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity for influencing the political views of his parents, with whom Wheaton found himself unable to have political discussions during family get-togethers on holidays like Christmas.[67] Wheaton's parents were very offended by the article, and he posted a lengthy apology on his site and an interview in which his parents clarified their political views.[69]
Wheaton is a supporter of Electronic Frontier Foundation and has been involved with the organization since 2002.[70]
On August 24, 2007, Wheaton gave the keynote for the yearly Penny Arcade Expo, which was subsequently made available online.[71] He stepped in following a public battle between the formerly-scheduled keynote debate participants, noted anti-games activist Jack Thompson and Hal Halpin, the president of the Entertainment Consumers Association (ECA). Much of Wheaton's address focused on the debate over violence in video games. He also gave the keynote at PAX East 2010 in Boston, Massachusetts.
He supported Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential Election[72] and opposed Proposition 8, calling it "nothing but hate and discrimination".[73]
In September 2015, Wheaton announced that he was supporting Bernie Sanders' bid to be the 2016 Democratic Party presidential candidate nominee.[74] He subsequently campaigned for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.[75]
Personal life[edit]
Wheaton was roommates with Chris Hardwick at UCLA.[16][76] They met at a showing of Arachnophobia in Burbank, California.[16]
Wheaton married Anne Prince on November 7, 1999,[77] and lives in Arcadia, California, with her and her two sons from a previous relationship.[78] When one son was 18, he asked Wheaton to legally adopt him, which he did.[1][79]
Wheaton is an aficionado of computers, the internet, and technology in general. He says he is drawn to alternatives like Linux because he is left-handed, though he ceased using Linux when he switched to Windows 2000.[78] Since at least 2003, his operating system of choice has been OS X, though he still runs Linux (Debian) in a virtual machine.[80] He also enjoys brewing his own beer at home,[81] and he collaborated with Fark creator Drew Curtis and Stone Brewing Co. CEO Greg Koch to create a geek-themed stout beer called Stone Farking Wheaton w00tstout.[82]
Wheaton is also a major longtime fan of the Los Angeles Kings ice hockey team and can often be found at the Staples Center at both regular season and playoff games.[83] Wheaton is also a "die-hard" fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and has gone to many games at Dodger Stadium.[84] Wheaton is also a fan of English football club Arsenal.[85]
Wheaton lives with generalized anxiety disorder and chronic depression. He supports mental health nonprofit organizations in raising awareness for these conditions.[86]

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

At Wheaton, we have tremendous respect for those individuals that seek answers, they that dedicate their lives to science. It is this respect and admiration that has motivated us and inspired us to manufacture and supply laboratories with essential equipment for 125 years.  With this respect and admiration in mind, Wheaton offers an extensive selection of products for use in laboratory settings either for educational or commercial settings.
Instruments
Wheaton has a variety of products for those labs seeking to stock their labs with the appropriate instruments.  There are an assortment of bioreactors and incubators. We have magnetic stirrers and overhead stirrers.  We also have bar code scanners for specimen tracking and inventory purposes. There are also a number of various pumps and dispensing accessories for general laboratory use.
Bioreactors and Incubators
Bioreactors are available in a variety of sizes ranging between 250 milliliters to 45 liters. Within our line we have a cell optimizer system, mini-pilot plant, and a spinner type of bioreactor. They are modular, turnkey and easy to use cell cultivation devices.
Whether you need to perform a temperature dependent study or observe and record cell cultivation, our selection of incubators will provide you with the place to perform your work. Our incubators come in a few different sizes to fit the space you have to work with. Our incubators also come with the CO2 option or standard type.  They have configurable shelving options and have flush mount floors as well as caster tracks for easy use with the roller culture apparatus.
Magnetic Stirrers
Our line of magnetic stirrers are designed for general mixing use and cell culture studies. They are smooth ramping and low heat dissipating units that would be ideal for use in an incubator or sensitive cultures. We also have different sizes available to help your lab's space needs. Additionally, our line of magnetic stirrers comes with the ability to position a maximum of up to 4 bottles.
Barcode Scanners
Wheaton offers solutions for maintaining sample integrity. Our cryogenics line offers freestanding Wheaton CryoElite Vials. In addition to these vials you may be interested in the optional 2D Data Matrix Bar Code Inserts that allow an immediate coding of the sample that provide added integrity to your sample. The bar codes are guaranteed never to duplicate. With these products in mind, a line of scanning devices have been made that can scan 1D linear bar codes as well as the 2D matrix bar codes.  There are also open bottomed storage solutions for these vials and scanners that can scan and read the individual bar code of each vial stored within the storage box known as Wheaton’s KeepIT boxes.
Pumps
We have Peristaltic Pumps and dispensing accessories for performing cell culture, media transfer, harvesting, environmental sampling, common laboratory liquid usage, packaging, and other various types of container filling.
More Laboratory Equipment
Supplementary to our line of instruments is our product line of equipment used in common, day-to-day purposes such as glassware and closures for different glass containers from vials to flasks.  We have filters and stoppers, pipettes and staining ware. Whether your laboratory requires products for lyophilization or cryogenics, our supply of lab products will be able to fill your needs.
Other Miscellaneous products
We carry an assortment of vacuum filtration products. We have a variety of different filter sizes, support styles and flask/bottle connections with plenty of parts for replacement as need be.
When you need to transfer liquids with highly measured precision we carry many different types of pipettes and pipette accessories. We carry manual as well as electronic pipettes, multi-channel pipettors, re-usable syringes, and more. Each one has its own serial number and passes performance and quality control assessments and receives an individual certificate for passing our quality control test.
Wheaton, a Name to Trust
At Wheaton, we have the quality and  reputation that your lab should seek. Our company has touched the timeline and left its own mark on it. During World War II Wheaton produced the only serum bottles used during the war. Back in 1970, Wheaton formed an instrument group to begin producing hand cappers, magnetic stirrers, and suspension culture flasks.  At our centennial celebration, President Ford delivered our keynote address.  In 1990, we began introducing computerized bioreactors and microprocessor controlled dispensers. We have a long standing presence in this field. With this standing and the positive reviews from long-term clients you should feel at peace, knowing that Wheaton is a reliable manufacturer and supplier for your laboratory’s product needs.

They came to my house and gave me a free inspection. Within a few weeks my glass door was done and it was delivered.

I called other shops that wanted very high delivery prices and contracted out their delivery work which affected the hours available for delivery.The Stogsdill Law FirmMarry M. ratedAnyone facing divorce would be wise to retain the Stogsdill Law Firm.

Here are some of the more common dentists people seek out to improve their oral health:General Dentist
These dentists generally serve as the primary provider of dental care. If you need your teeth cleaned, crowns and bridges placed or any number of cosmetic procedures, book an appointment with a general dentist. Though not as common, these dentists will also provide more specialized services, including some forms of oral surgery - chief among them root canals and restorative care - fitting patients with a mouthguard and counseling people on how to stop smoking and what constitutes proper nutrition.Endodontist
To become an endodontist means undergoing an additional two years of training beyond dental school. As a result, these specialized dentists perform more specific procedures beyond general teeth cleaning and repair work. While a dentist may perform a handful of root canal treatments in a week, an endodontist may end up working on 20 or more in the same timespan. Your average endodontist also repairs teeth damaged by trauma and performs endodontic retreatments, which is repeat root canal procedure. Their added training also means that the endodontist is much more adept at utilizing complex dental equipment - especially ultrasonic instruments or microscopes. Most of that equipment is used to improve the health of teeth that are affected by disease and even congenital deformities.Pediatric Dentist
Proper oral care starts when you're young, and that's why pediatric dentists are so important. These dentists treat people under the age of 13, though there are exceptions based on a child's unique dental background. Pediatric dentists face unique challenges, because they must treat newly teething babies and children losing their primary teeth.Though cleanings are an integral part of their job, pediatric dentists are mostly concerned with planning ahead. That means working to ensure the child has straight teeth and correcting an improper bite. However, they also help address more child-specific conditions of thumb sucking and an over-reliance on pacifiers. As a result, pediatric dentists usually require an additional two-year residency working with infants and children.Oral Pathologist
Pathology refers to the study of disease, specifically as it presents in tissue. Oral pathologists, then, are responsible for studying the diseases that affect the tissue of the mouth and other surrounding muscle groups. These experts are considered to be true specialists, having focused their work on very niche areas of both dentistry and pathology. Though oral pathology is rather specialized, it's a vital component of the oral health industry. By analyzing tissue taken from biopsies, oral pathologists can help diagnose and eventually treat a number of oral diseases, including leukoplakia, cementoma and squamous cell carcinoma, among others.Periodontist
Similar to the endodontist, periodontists receive several additional years of training beyond dental school. However, whereas endodontists study advanced treatments, periodontists generally have a very specific field of interest. Your average periodontist focuses less on cleanings and more on diagnosing and treating gingivitis, periodontitis, which is an untreated form of the aforementioned ailment, and other periodontal diseases. Periodontists treat patients with more complicated oral care backgrounds, those people who require root planing - where dentists clean any infected surfaces - and root debridement, or the removal of dead tissue. Periodontists are especially concerned with proper gum health, including painful recession and teeth alignment.Cosmetic Dentist
Most of the aforementioned dentists are concerned with the health and well-being of a patient's teeth. While that is important to cosmetic dentists, they specialize in a number of different treatments meant to enhance the look or aesthetic of your teeth. To begin the average appointment, cosmetic dentists will examine your teeth for any imperfections or irregularities, and then suggest ways to make your teeth more white or properly aligned. The most popular such treatments are bleaching - where special chemicals are used to whiten your teeth - placing veneers or caps to alter the appearance of teeth, and bonding, where dentists fill unappealing gaps with structural replacement material.Orthodontist
Orthodontists are responsible for treating most dental irregularities, which includes everything from misaligned jaws - like an under or overbite - to overcrowding teeth and even certain cosmetic issues. Following dental school, the would-be orthodontist then has another three years of schooling, most of which is clinical experience in an orthodontic residency program. To properly diagnose and treat most dentofacial issues, the orthodontist relies on a collection of corrective gear. That includes braces, retainers and various facemask configurations. Though orthodontists work with people of all ages, the bulk of patients are young children and teens.Prosthodontist
Similar to the field of orthodontics, the average prosthodontist receives an additional three years of training following dental school. And though prosthodontics is something of a cosmetic field like orthodontics, it's primarily concerned with replacing missing teeth. Prosthodontists have a number of teeth-replacing procedures to implement, including filling veneers, onlays and inlays, bridges, crowns and complete or partial dentures. Beyond their work in implant dentistry, these experts treat a number of other mouth-related ailments, namely snoring, post-cancer jaw reconstruction, traumatic injuries and pain related to lock jaw and other temporomandibular joint disorders.Oral and Maxillofacial Radiologist
Similar to endodontists, these specialists - one of nine such unique fields recognized by the American Dental Association - utilize machinery to treat and diagnose patients. Specifically, these dentists make use of radiographic imaging to treat those diseases and ailments that impact the teeth, mouth and the maxillofacial region, which consists of the face and jaw. While X-rays are a popular option, OMRs also rely on plain and computed tomography, MRIs, ultrasounds and other forms of digital imaging. OMRs are among the first adaptors of new technology, using innovations in the field of imaging to find increasingly effective ways at understanding the impact of oral disease and what that means to patients.Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon
Your primary dentist may refer you to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon if you experience facial pain, or if he or she suspects you have some variety of oral cancer. OMSs are also your primary source when planning most oral surgeries, like tooth extractions, cyst repairs and removals, and dental implants. However, an OMS can also treat a number of other ailments and diseases related to the maxillofacial region. For instance, malformations in your facial bones can cause sleep apnea, and an OMS can perform corrective surgery that removes or shapes bone. Many of these experts are also involved with more cosmetic procedures, performing or assisting with facial implants and rhinoplasty, in which the nose bone is modified.Dental Public Health Clinics
These clinics are available in most cities across the U.S., and they're meant to offer affordable health care to many low-income families and individuals. Though it differs depending on the specific clinic, the average clinic offers only the most essential oral care services, including X-rays, teeth cleaning, basic root canals and repairs, and tooth extractions. The fees an individual pays depend on a number of different factors, and most clinics have a sliding-fee that is determined equally by income and family size.Most Common Oral Care IssuesThere are several different kinds of dentists, each one with his or her own specialty. However, there are a core group of ailments all dentists treat. Conditions include:Tooth Decay: When your teeth fall out or begin to disintegrate in your mouth, improper brushing is often to blame. Certain infections also cause tooth loss or decay. One of the most affective ways to prevent tooth decay is with regular brushing and flossing right at home.Bad Breath: As your teeth fall out or you don't brush properly, your gums and teeth begin to break down and cause foul odors. Other causes of bad breath include gum disease and oral infections. As with tooth decay, brushing and flossing are vital, as is regular tongue scraping and the use of mouthwash.Teeth Sensitivity: Some people are born with teeth that are naturally sensitive to cold. A lack of brushing can also comprise your teeth's natural protection. The best method to help protect otherwise sensitive teeth is to use specialized toothpaste geared toward people with worn or damaged teeth.Dry Mouth: Certain medications will cause your salivary glands to stop producing spit. This in turn can harm the structure of your teeth and gums. There are several at-home measures you can take to combat dry mouth. These include regular hydration, chewing sugar-free gum, which also hydrates your mouth, and avoiding mouthwash with alcohol in it, which dries out your entire mouth.Teeth Grinding: For many people, grinding their teeth - also known as bruxism - is a subconscious behavior, usually the result of stress. It can eventually damage your teeth. The only way to treat your grinding habit is to meet with an endodontist, who will fit you with with a bite plate to mitigate the damage to your teeth.Mouth Sores: Also called canker sores, these painful bumps are the result of irritation to the soft tissue of your mouth. These sores can make brushing almost impossible. There are a number of different causes for sores, including anemia or a vitamin B-12 deficiency. As a result, your primary physician will have to examine the bump, find its root cause and then help develop a specific treatment plan, including the use of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation or antimicrobial mouthwash.Discoloration: Yellow teeth are the result of a number of bad habits, mainly smoking, drinking too much coffee and improper nutrition. Proper brushing can usually prevent discolored teeth before they happen. However, if your teeth become worse, many dentists will treat with a whitening procedure.A Guide for Dental Care BasicsProper oral care begins at home. The following are a few preventative measures you can take to keep your teeth and gums healthy. They just may reduce your time spent in your dentist's chair.Remember Your Angles
When brushing your teeth, always place the brush at a 45-degree angle. That way, you're able to hit every surface of each tooth.Don't Forget the Tongue
Within your mouth, your tongue is the largest source of bacteria. Be sure to brush it front to back and don't forget the sides.Floss Everyday
Brushing alone isn't enough to keep your mouth healthy, and that's why flossing is so important. Each time you floss, be sure to have at least 18 inches of floss available, which is what you should go through if you use proper technique. For optimal control, hold the floss between your thumbs and forefingers.Watch What You Eat
Sugar, alcohol and coffee all contain phosphorus. While some can prove beneficial, too much of this chemical can eat away at your teeth and gums.Keep in Mind the Mouthwash
Though not a requirement, mouthwash can be helpful if used to supplement proper brushing and flossing. Most mouthwash brands contain chlorine dioxide, a chemical that targets the majority of oral bacterial strains. However, don't overuse mouthwash, as it can cause a number of ailments.How to Choose The Right DentistProper oral care is an integral component of your greater well-being, which highlights why having the right dentist is of the utmost importance. Consider the following as you make an effort to find a dentist who will fit your unique medical history:Find a Recommendation
It's important to use a dentist whom you feel comfortable with. Because that's difficult to achieve by simply choosing names out of a phone book, you should always seek out a recommendation. Whether it's a friend, family member or co-worker, this individual can offer intimate details about a dentist's demeanor, operating style and approach to patient care. Be sure to always ask plenty of questions.Vet Your Dentist
Once you get a recommendation from a friend, don't simply book your first cleaning right away. Instead, meet with any prospective dentists to conduct a series of pretreatment interview. During this session, you can ask them about what treatments they perform most often, procedures they're not as familiar with, what accreditation they have or any organizations they belong to and how their offices handles insurance and payments. Just be aware that booking this time can be difficult based on a dentist's schedule.Consider Accessibility and Other Factors
Perhaps you've met a dentist with whom you feel comfortable. Not only that, but this dentist's payment options are suitable for your finances. However, don't be so quick to make a final decision, as other factors may influence your choice. Is the dentist's office nearby, or do you have to drive out of your way? Is the office open at a time that will fit the rest of your schedule? How much flexibility will the dentist's staff offer in booking appointments? Though seemingly trivial, these factors are nonetheless important.Check With Your State Board
One of the last things you should do before coming to a decision is to check with your state's dental board. Dentists must abide by different rules and regulations depending on where they practice, and the state board can outline what requirements your candidate must meet. These organizations can also offer information about any discrepancies in the dentist's background and if he or she has faced any disciplinary actions.Picking the Right Dental InsuranceAs with other forms of health care, insurance is a great way to both reduce associated costs and ensure you and your dependents receive the best care possible. However, you don't want to simply buy the first such plan you see. Here are some factors to consider when shopping for dental insurance:Pick Your Plan
There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all dental insurance plan. Instead, most people purchase three main varieties, usually through their employers. An indemnity or fee-for-service plan is just as it sounds and means you'll have to pay for annual deductibles and co-insurance payments out of pocket. A preferred provider organization is less costly, and you choose from a network of dentists. However, PPOs have some limitations and accompanying deductibles. Similarly, a dental health maintenance organization plan limits you to just a few choices of dentists, and one doctor handles all of your oral care needs. However, these HMO are usually much less costly.Examine the Networks
As noted, PPO plans and dental HMOs work with only a select number of doctors. While that usually means fewer costs compared to other insurance plans or payment options, it also means you don't have quite as much say in the dentist who can treat you. That doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, especially if you know who is in the network. Before purchasing the plan, you'll receive a list of dentists in each network. Do research on each doctor - just as you would when picking a dentist otherwise. From there, you can then pick a plan with doctors who meet your standards and requirements.Consider Your Coverage
Sometimes, it's not just the doctor that you want to consider. For many people, even the plans with the best doctors are deemed a bad choice. The reason? The coverage is less-than-stellar. When picking a plan, you need to look at just how much you'll pay for each and every service. For instance, some plans won't cover your fillings or X-rays, while others may charge more or less for a crown or tooth extraction. Knowing just what you'll be responsible for is important, as you don't want to be caught off-guard by unforeseen charges. Depending on your employer, a human resources specialist can walk you through specific coverage options.Make Your Plan Work for You
It's a sad fact that the dentist you want most might not be covered by the plan you've purchased. However, that doesn't mean that you have to look for dental services elsewhere. If you're truly comfortable with a dentist and you feel he or she can be an ally in your ongoing oral care regimen, then consider signing a plan to just keep that dentist available. That means potentially deal with costs and other insurance-related factors that you might have wanted to. If need be, you might be able to work with the dentist's office to address some of the plan-specific concerns.
