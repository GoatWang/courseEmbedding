Oak Forest Apartments scored a value rating of 2 out of 5, which makes the property an average housing option in the area.Contract rent for a studio unit at this housing program is $687 USD, which makes it a well priced option in Macon County.

Getting AroundThis Section 8 housing program is located in the city of Franklin, North Carolina. About 25% of the community is made up of people over 65 years of age, which represents a fairly high elderly population (in comparison to other communities across the United State).  There is a chance that services for the elderly are already in place throughout the community.Overall, the community has a large population that gets around via car. In fact, approximately 91% of people in the area drive to work.Most people have two cars. In moving to the area, you should expect to own and maintain a vehicle in order to get around and/or commute to work.  If you do not own a vehicle or are not able to operate one, this area would probably be difficult for relocation.

Apartments for rent in Texas
Interested in moving to Texas where everything's bigger? Texas has a variety of apartments (big and small) for rent in Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio and many other great cities.

Austin, Texas is home to big music with more music venues per capita than any other city across the nation. Along 6th Street, you'll find Austin apartments near bars, clubs, art galleries and cafes where live music is regularly featured in every genre you can imagine. Austin also hosts popular music festivals, such as South by Southwest (SXSW), Austin City Limits Music Festival and many others.

There's more to enjoy in Austin than music, though. With more than 250 parks, preserves and greenbelts in Austin, you'll have easy access to greenspace for walks, picnics, tennis matches and more. The University of Texas at Austin adds a feeling of livelihood and a youthful spirit that many Texas apartment dwellers find very appealing.

If you're more interested in living close to beaches, head southwest to Houston, where you'll find Texas apartments within an hour's drive to beaches such as Galveston Beach. Houston is also home to the Johnson Space Center, The University of Houston and a great museum district.

You'll also find great apartments in Dallas, Texas. In this city of more than a million residents, there are plenty of options for work and play. Whether you're looking for a night on the town, a variety of restaurant options or something fun for your kids to do, you can find all these things and more near Dallas apartments.

If you rent an apartment in San Antonio, you'll see that this city has a lot to offer, including the Paseo del Rio (the San Antonio River Walk), numerous theme parks and charming neighborhoods that not only attract visitors, but keep long-time residents in the area. And it's perhaps most known for its Tejano culture, the historic Alamo and the 16-time NBA Champions, the San Antonio Spurs. San Antonio also boasts a cost of living that's significantly lower than the national average. As a result, San Antonio apartments are available across a wide range of price points.

From the inexpensive to the luxurious, you can find just the right apartment for your taste and budget in Texas cities like Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio, as well as in smaller cities throughout the state. Find your next apartment in Texas on ApartmentGuide.com, where you can search by apartment features, community features, price range and more.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
