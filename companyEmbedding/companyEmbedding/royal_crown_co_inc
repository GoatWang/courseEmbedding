History[edit]




Claud A. Hatcher, the inventor of R.C. Cola


In 1901, the Cole-Hampton-Hatcher Grocery Store was established in Columbus, Georgia. In 1903, the Hatcher family took sole ownership and the name was changed to the Hatcher Grocery Store. The grocery store was located at what was 22 West 10th Street. Today's address (after house number changes) is 15 West 10th Street. At that same time, the popularity of bottled soft drinks rose rapidly, and grocery store owners wished to maximize their profit.[2] As a grocery wholesaler, Claud A. Hatcher purchased a large volume of Coca-Cola syrup from the local company salesman, Columbus Roberts. Hatcher felt that Hatcher Grocery Co. deserved a special reduced price for the syrup since it purchased such large volumes. Roberts would not budge on the cost, and a bitter conflict between the two erupted. Hatcher told Roberts he would win the battle by never purchasing any more Coca-Cola, and Hatcher determined to develop his own soft drink formula. He started developing products in the basement of the store with a recipe for ginger ale.[3]
The first product in the Royal Crown line was Royal Crown Ginger Ale in 1905,[4] followed by Royal Crown Strawberry, and Royal Crown Root Beer. The company was renamed Chero-Cola in 1910, and in 1925 renamed Nehi Corporation after its colored and flavored drinks. In 1934, Chero-Cola was reformulated by Rufus Kamm, a chemist, and re-released as Royal Crown Cola.
In the 1950s, Royal Crown Cola and moon pies were a popular "working man's lunch" in the American South.[5] In 1954, Royal Crown was the first company to sell soft drinks in a can, and later the first company to sell a soft drink in an aluminum can.[6]
In 1958, the company introduced the first diet cola, Diet Rite, and in 1980, a caffeine-free cola, RC 100. In the mid-1990s, RC released Royal Crown Draft Cola, billed as a "premium" cola using pure cane sugar as a sweetener, rather than high fructose corn syrup. Offered only in 12-ounce bottles, sales were disappointing, due largely to the inability of the RC bottling network to get distribution for the product in single-drink channels, and it was quickly discontinued with the exceptions of Australia, New Zealand and France. It is now available only in New Zealand, parts of Australia, Thailand and Tajikistan.[7] The company also released Cherry RC, a cherry-flavored version of the RC soft drink, to compete with Cherry Coke and Pepsi Wild Cherry.

In October 2000, Royal Crown was acquired by Cadbury (then Cadbury Schweppes) through its acquisition of Snapple. Royal Crown operations were subsequently folded into Dr Pepper/Seven Up, a former subsidiary of Cadbury. In 2001, all international RC-branded businesses were sold to Cott Beverages of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, and are operated as Royal Crown Cola International, which handles RC Cola products outside the United States. In the US, distribution is handled by Dr Pepper Snapple Group.[8]
RC Cola was introduced to Latvia in June 2010,[9] and the United Kingdom in May 2011, and sold at Asda supermarkets and other retailers.[10] It is bottled in the country by Cott Beverages. It is available in Estonia where it is distributed by A. Le Coq.[11] In Australia, it is marketed by Australian Pure Fruits.[12]
RC Cola is bottled in Cyprus by Kean Soft Drinks Limited, and in the Philippines by ARC Bottlers. Jaz Cola, along with RC Cola was sold by Cosmos Bottling in 1996 until 2001 when San Miguel Corporation acquired Cosmos and sold its brands to the Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc., but it terminated the license to produce RC Cola, along with Sunkist and Jolt Cola.[citation needed] However, some of the former Cosmos top brass, in partnership with the Zest-O chairman, reintroduced RC Cola and gained ownership from RC Cola International as Asiawide Refreshments Corporation. Today, RC Cola is the third top-selling cola brand in the Philippines[citation needed], and is the second largest cola brand in Israel, after Coca-Cola, but ahead of Pepsi.[13]

A sign in Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania


The RC Cola brand has been marketed through many campaigns. In the 1930s, Alex Osborn, with BBDO, made an ad campaign, including the following slogan: "The season's best."
The 1940s saw a magazine advertising campaign with actress Lizabeth Scott as the face, next to the slogan "RC tastes best, says Lizabeth Scott".
In 1966, Royal Crown Cola collaborated with Jim Henson on an ad campaign for Royal Crown Cola which featured two birds called Sour Bird (performed by Jim Henson) and Nutty Bird (performed by Jim Henson and assisted by Frank Oz) to promote the drinks. Nutty Bird would promote Royal Crown Cola by touting the benefits.[18] The puppet for Nutty Bird was designed by Jim Henson and built by Don Sahlin. Sour Bird appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show with the Rock and Roll Monster.
Nancy Sinatra was featured in two Royal Crown Cola commercials in her one-hour TV special, Movin' With Nancy, which featured various singers and David Winters choreography[19] in December 1967. She sang, "It's a mad, mad, mad Cola... RC the one with the mad, mad taste!...RC!"[20] The company was the official sponsor of New York Mets on and off at times during the 1960s, 70s and 80s. A television commercial in the New York area featured Tom Seaver, New York Mets pitcher, and his wife, Nancy, dancing on top of a dugout at Shea Stadium and singing the tune from the Sinatra campaign. In the mid 1970s, Royal Crown ran the "Me & My RC" advertisements.[21] Others featured people in scenic outdoor locations. The jingle, sung by Louise Mandrell, went, "Me and my RC / Me and my RC /'Cause what's good enough / For other folks / Ain't good enough for me." RC was introduced to Israel in 1995 with the slogan "RC: Just like in America!" During the Cola Wars of the 1980s, RC used the 'Decide for yourself' campaign and would remind people 'There's more to your life than Coke and Pepsi." The Philippines released advertisements using rising stars.They also painted their "suki" stores with slogans like "RC ng (insert municipality/city)".
Andretti Autosport driver Marco Andretti had RC Cola as primary sponsor during the 2012 and 2013 IndyCar Series.

History[edit]




Claud A. Hatcher, the inventor of R.C. Cola


In 1901, the Cole-Hampton-Hatcher Grocery Store was established in Columbus, Georgia. In 1903, the Hatcher family took sole ownership and the name was changed to the Hatcher Grocery Store. The grocery store was located at what was 22 West 10th Street. Today's address (after house number changes) is 15 West 10th Street. At that same time, the popularity of bottled soft drinks rose rapidly, and grocery store owners wished to maximize their profit.[2] As a grocery wholesaler, Claud A. Hatcher purchased a large volume of Coca-Cola syrup from the local company salesman, Columbus Roberts. Hatcher felt that Hatcher Grocery Co. deserved a special reduced price for the syrup since it purchased such large volumes. Roberts would not budge on the cost, and a bitter conflict between the two erupted. Hatcher told Roberts he would win the battle by never purchasing any more Coca-Cola, and Hatcher determined to develop his own soft drink formula. He started developing products in the basement of the store with a recipe for ginger ale.[3]
The first product in the Royal Crown line was Royal Crown Ginger Ale in 1905,[4] followed by Royal Crown Strawberry, and Royal Crown Root Beer. The company was renamed Chero-Cola in 1910, and in 1925 renamed Nehi Corporation after its colored and flavored drinks. In 1934, Chero-Cola was reformulated by Rufus Kamm, a chemist, and re-released as Royal Crown Cola.
In the 1950s, Royal Crown Cola and moon pies were a popular "working man's lunch" in the American South.[5] In 1954, Royal Crown was the first company to sell soft drinks in a can, and later the first company to sell a soft drink in an aluminum can.[6]
In 1958, the company introduced the first diet cola, Diet Rite, and in 1980, a caffeine-free cola, RC 100. In the mid-1990s, RC released Royal Crown Draft Cola, billed as a "premium" cola using pure cane sugar as a sweetener, rather than high fructose corn syrup. Offered only in 12-ounce bottles, sales were disappointing, due largely to the inability of the RC bottling network to get distribution for the product in single-drink channels, and it was quickly discontinued with the exceptions of Australia, New Zealand and France. It is now available only in New Zealand, parts of Australia, Thailand and Tajikistan.[7] The company also released Cherry RC, a cherry-flavored version of the RC soft drink, to compete with Cherry Coke and Pepsi Wild Cherry.

In October 2000, Royal Crown was acquired by Cadbury (then Cadbury Schweppes) through its acquisition of Snapple. Royal Crown operations were subsequently folded into Dr Pepper/Seven Up, a former subsidiary of Cadbury. In 2001, all international RC-branded businesses were sold to Cott Beverages of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, and are operated as Royal Crown Cola International, which handles RC Cola products outside the United States. In the US, distribution is handled by Dr Pepper Snapple Group.[8]
RC Cola was introduced to Latvia in June 2010,[9] and the United Kingdom in May 2011, and sold at Asda supermarkets and other retailers.[10] It is bottled in the country by Cott Beverages. It is available in Estonia where it is distributed by A. Le Coq.[11] In Australia, it is marketed by Australian Pure Fruits.[12]
RC Cola is bottled in Cyprus by Kean Soft Drinks Limited, and in the Philippines by ARC Bottlers. Jaz Cola, along with RC Cola was sold by Cosmos Bottling in 1996 until 2001 when San Miguel Corporation acquired Cosmos and sold its brands to the Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc., but it terminated the license to produce RC Cola, along with Sunkist and Jolt Cola.[citation needed] However, some of the former Cosmos top brass, in partnership with the Zest-O chairman, reintroduced RC Cola and gained ownership from RC Cola International as Asiawide Refreshments Corporation. Today, RC Cola is the third top-selling cola brand in the Philippines[citation needed], and is the second largest cola brand in Israel, after Coca-Cola, but ahead of Pepsi.[13]

A sign in Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania


The RC Cola brand has been marketed through many campaigns. In the 1930s, Alex Osborn, with BBDO, made an ad campaign, including the following slogan: "The season's best."
The 1940s saw a magazine advertising campaign with actress Lizabeth Scott as the face, next to the slogan "RC tastes best, says Lizabeth Scott".
In 1966, Royal Crown Cola collaborated with Jim Henson on an ad campaign for Royal Crown Cola which featured two birds called Sour Bird (performed by Jim Henson) and Nutty Bird (performed by Jim Henson and assisted by Frank Oz) to promote the drinks. Nutty Bird would promote Royal Crown Cola by touting the benefits.[18] The puppet for Nutty Bird was designed by Jim Henson and built by Don Sahlin. Sour Bird appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show with the Rock and Roll Monster.
Nancy Sinatra was featured in two Royal Crown Cola commercials in her one-hour TV special, Movin' With Nancy, which featured various singers and David Winters choreography[19] in December 1967. She sang, "It's a mad, mad, mad Cola... RC the one with the mad, mad taste!...RC!"[20] The company was the official sponsor of New York Mets on and off at times during the 1960s, 70s and 80s. A television commercial in the New York area featured Tom Seaver, New York Mets pitcher, and his wife, Nancy, dancing on top of a dugout at Shea Stadium and singing the tune from the Sinatra campaign. In the mid 1970s, Royal Crown ran the "Me & My RC" advertisements.[21] Others featured people in scenic outdoor locations. The jingle, sung by Louise Mandrell, went, "Me and my RC / Me and my RC /'Cause what's good enough / For other folks / Ain't good enough for me." RC was introduced to Israel in 1995 with the slogan "RC: Just like in America!" During the Cola Wars of the 1980s, RC used the 'Decide for yourself' campaign and would remind people 'There's more to your life than Coke and Pepsi." The Philippines released advertisements using rising stars.They also painted their "suki" stores with slogans like "RC ng (insert municipality/city)".
Andretti Autosport driver Marco Andretti had RC Cola as primary sponsor during the 2012 and 2013 IndyCar Series.

History[edit]




Claud A. Hatcher, the inventor of R.C. Cola


In 1901, the Cole-Hampton-Hatcher Grocery Store was established in Columbus, Georgia. In 1903, the Hatcher family took sole ownership and the name was changed to the Hatcher Grocery Store. The grocery store was located at what was 22 West 10th Street. Today's address (after house number changes) is 15 West 10th Street. At that same time, the popularity of bottled soft drinks rose rapidly, and grocery store owners wished to maximize their profit.[2] As a grocery wholesaler, Claud A. Hatcher purchased a large volume of Coca-Cola syrup from the local company salesman, Columbus Roberts. Hatcher felt that Hatcher Grocery Co. deserved a special reduced price for the syrup since it purchased such large volumes. Roberts would not budge on the cost, and a bitter conflict between the two erupted. Hatcher told Roberts he would win the battle by never purchasing any more Coca-Cola, and Hatcher determined to develop his own soft drink formula. He started developing products in the basement of the store with a recipe for ginger ale.[3]
The first product in the Royal Crown line was Royal Crown Ginger Ale in 1905,[4] followed by Royal Crown Strawberry, and Royal Crown Root Beer. The company was renamed Chero-Cola in 1910, and in 1925 renamed Nehi Corporation after its colored and flavored drinks. In 1934, Chero-Cola was reformulated by Rufus Kamm, a chemist, and re-released as Royal Crown Cola.
In the 1950s, Royal Crown Cola and moon pies were a popular "working man's lunch" in the American South.[5] In 1954, Royal Crown was the first company to sell soft drinks in a can, and later the first company to sell a soft drink in an aluminum can.[6]
In 1958, the company introduced the first diet cola, Diet Rite, and in 1980, a caffeine-free cola, RC 100. In the mid-1990s, RC released Royal Crown Draft Cola, billed as a "premium" cola using pure cane sugar as a sweetener, rather than high fructose corn syrup. Offered only in 12-ounce bottles, sales were disappointing, due largely to the inability of the RC bottling network to get distribution for the product in single-drink channels, and it was quickly discontinued with the exceptions of Australia, New Zealand and France. It is now available only in New Zealand, parts of Australia, Thailand and Tajikistan.[7] The company also released Cherry RC, a cherry-flavored version of the RC soft drink, to compete with Cherry Coke and Pepsi Wild Cherry.

In October 2000, Royal Crown was acquired by Cadbury (then Cadbury Schweppes) through its acquisition of Snapple. Royal Crown operations were subsequently folded into Dr Pepper/Seven Up, a former subsidiary of Cadbury. In 2001, all international RC-branded businesses were sold to Cott Beverages of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, and are operated as Royal Crown Cola International, which handles RC Cola products outside the United States. In the US, distribution is handled by Dr Pepper Snapple Group.[8]
RC Cola was introduced to Latvia in June 2010,[9] and the United Kingdom in May 2011, and sold at Asda supermarkets and other retailers.[10] It is bottled in the country by Cott Beverages. It is available in Estonia where it is distributed by A. Le Coq.[11] In Australia, it is marketed by Australian Pure Fruits.[12]
RC Cola is bottled in Cyprus by Kean Soft Drinks Limited, and in the Philippines by ARC Bottlers. Jaz Cola, along with RC Cola was sold by Cosmos Bottling in 1996 until 2001 when San Miguel Corporation acquired Cosmos and sold its brands to the Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc., but it terminated the license to produce RC Cola, along with Sunkist and Jolt Cola.[citation needed] However, some of the former Cosmos top brass, in partnership with the Zest-O chairman, reintroduced RC Cola and gained ownership from RC Cola International as Asiawide Refreshments Corporation. Today, RC Cola is the third top-selling cola brand in the Philippines[citation needed], and is the second largest cola brand in Israel, after Coca-Cola, but ahead of Pepsi.[13]

A sign in Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania


The RC Cola brand has been marketed through many campaigns. In the 1930s, Alex Osborn, with BBDO, made an ad campaign, including the following slogan: "The season's best."
The 1940s saw a magazine advertising campaign with actress Lizabeth Scott as the face, next to the slogan "RC tastes best, says Lizabeth Scott".
In 1966, Royal Crown Cola collaborated with Jim Henson on an ad campaign for Royal Crown Cola which featured two birds called Sour Bird (performed by Jim Henson) and Nutty Bird (performed by Jim Henson and assisted by Frank Oz) to promote the drinks. Nutty Bird would promote Royal Crown Cola by touting the benefits.[18] The puppet for Nutty Bird was designed by Jim Henson and built by Don Sahlin. Sour Bird appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show with the Rock and Roll Monster.
Nancy Sinatra was featured in two Royal Crown Cola commercials in her one-hour TV special, Movin' With Nancy, which featured various singers and David Winters choreography[19] in December 1967. She sang, "It's a mad, mad, mad Cola... RC the one with the mad, mad taste!...RC!"[20] The company was the official sponsor of New York Mets on and off at times during the 1960s, 70s and 80s. A television commercial in the New York area featured Tom Seaver, New York Mets pitcher, and his wife, Nancy, dancing on top of a dugout at Shea Stadium and singing the tune from the Sinatra campaign. In the mid 1970s, Royal Crown ran the "Me & My RC" advertisements.[21] Others featured people in scenic outdoor locations. The jingle, sung by Louise Mandrell, went, "Me and my RC / Me and my RC /'Cause what's good enough / For other folks / Ain't good enough for me." RC was introduced to Israel in 1995 with the slogan "RC: Just like in America!" During the Cola Wars of the 1980s, RC used the 'Decide for yourself' campaign and would remind people 'There's more to your life than Coke and Pepsi." The Philippines released advertisements using rising stars.They also painted their "suki" stores with slogans like "RC ng (insert municipality/city)".
Andretti Autosport driver Marco Andretti had RC Cola as primary sponsor during the 2012 and 2013 IndyCar Series.

About RC Cola International
RC Cola is not just an American icon; one of the original American colas, it's also a legend with a history spanning over 100 years.










Royal Crown Cola was born from the efforts of a young pharmacist in Columbus, Georgia, USA in 1905. After a disagreement with a local soda bottler, Claud A. Hatcher began creating his own soft drinks. Never in his wildest dreams could he have imagined that his experiments would become an American icon affectionately nicknamed RC Cola. 
Unveiling  a series of industry firsts - the first aluminum cans, 16oz bottlers, low-calorie and caffeine-free diet sodas - Royal Crown Cola maintained the same spirit of innovation established by its founder over a century ago and grew so successful it became a part of American popular culture featured in magazines, movies, and television shows. 
Today, that same mindset personifies individuality and can be seen by looking no further than Royal Crown Cola International's family of distinctive products. From the crisp satisfying taste of RC Cola...to the fresh and fruity burst of RCQ's many diverse flavors...to our calorie defying yet delicious diet colas...we continue to build on our history of success by offering a wide array of products, reflecting the individuals who drink them.

Our History

1905
A young pharmacist, Claud A. Hatcher, begins creating his own soft drinks in the basement of his family's grocery store in Columbus, Georgia, USA. Originally called "Union Bottling Works," the first line of beverages is named Royal Crown Ginger Ale.


1910
Union Bottling Works relocates to a bigger facility and introduces the cherry-flavored cola creation, Chero-Cola, & soon ranked as the company's greatest-selling product. 


1912
Chero-Cola's popularity leads to Union Bottling Works changing its name to Chero-Cola Company, expanding the enterprise to manufacture a line of syrups and flavor concentrates to sell to franchised bottlers. 


1924
A new, fruit-flavored beverage named Melo is introduced. After a salesman refers to a soft drink bottle as being "knee-high," Melo's name changes to Nehi, a brand name that becomes familiar to generations of consumers.


1925
Chero-Cola stands as a thriving business, with 315 plants located primarily in 14 southern states in the USA. Of these, 310 are bottling Chero-Cola and 263 plants are franchised for the company's fruit flavor products selling under the Nehi name.


1928
Additional plants are added, bringing the total to 463. The Nehi line becomes so successful, the company changes its name for the second time to Nehi Corporation and is listed on the New York Curb Exchange.


1933
President of the Nehi Corporation and the company's guiding light from its formation, Claud A. Hatcher dies suddenly on December 31st, leaving behind a legacy that would continue to endure well into the next century.


1934
Mr. Hatcher is succeeded as president by H.R. Mott who tasks chief chemist Rufas Kamm with the development of a new cola drink. The product is to be called Royal Crown Cola, named after Hatcher's original ginger ale. 


1940
Nehi stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with the company's products available in 47 of the 48 United States. 


1941
"Best By Taste Test" publicity campaign begins, using blind taste tests more than three decades before other soft drink manufacturers. National newspaper advertising is in wide use, with simultaneous ads in some 600 daily newspapers.


1946
Celebrities like Bing Crosby, Joan Crawford, Shirley Temple, Lucille Ball, and Ronald Reagan enhance advertising for Nehi. Color advertisements appear in the "Saturday Evening Post" and "Good Housekeeping." 


1959
RC Cola earns its distinction as the company's mainstay product when Nehi, Inc. becomes Royal Crown Cola Company. 


1962
The soft drink industry's first sugar-free diet beverage, a product the Los Angeles times selects as the "Leading New Product of the 1960s," Diet Rite Cola hits retail shelves nationwide and creates thousands of new jobs.


1976
Royal Crown Cola Company purchased fast-food franchiser Arby's, and two years later became Royal Crown Cola Companies Inc.


1984
The soft drink division becomes part of the DWG Corporation, which introduces Cherry RC, Diet RC Cola, and an eight-flavor line of Diet Rite.


1993
Triarc Companies, Inc. acquired Royal Crown Cola Company.


2000

Marketing Support






World-class brands need world-class marketing strategies
When you have world-class brands, you need world-class marketing strategies to support them. By joining the Royal Crown Cola International family, our bottlers and distributors enjoy ongoing support in key marketing areas such as advertising, sales promotion, point-of-sale (P.O.S.) materials, merchandising, and sales staff training. These are just some of the many ways RCCI promotes a successful operation for our bottlers and distributors.

Branding
In a highly competitive marketplace, strong brand identification is critical to building bigger brand share. To help our network of bottlers and distributors fully maximize the earning power of our brands, RCCI works closely with local and global advertising agencies to develop ad campaigns and media strategies (television, radio, P.O.S. materials, billboards, etc.) appropriate to our bottlers' locations and budgets. By providing complete marketing materials to our customers worldwide, RCCI is able to create a strong, graphically consistent presence in every market.
Package Design
Making sure consumers quickly and clearly recognize a brand product ultimately comes down to one thing – packaging. RCCI creates some of the most distinctive labels in the industry – with a design that fits well into contemporary package design. In addition to innovative graphics, RCCI is leader in packaging design. We were also the first major international brand to sell soft drinks in 12-oz. cans, 16-oz. returnable bottles, and the first to develop a generic returnable bottle. 
Merchandising
RCCI trains its bottlers and distributors in merchandising functions that create visually appealing beverage shelves, coolers, and vending machines. Our team assists in the development of pricing, product rotation, back-stock control, display building, and proper P.O.S. procedures. 
Sales Support
RCCI has developed intensive sales training programs, providing in-depth training materials for both novice and experienced sales people to help your sales managers properly train and educate your support staff.

History of Royal Crown Company, Inc.








A distant third in the $50-billion soft drink industry, Royal Crown Company, Inc. produces and sells concentrates used in the production of soft drinks that are sold domestically and internationally to independent, licensed bottlers. Royal Crown's leading brand, RC Cola, ranked as the third-largest national brand of cola behind Pepsi and Coca-Cola and stood as the only national brand cola alternative available to non-Coca-Cola and non-Pepsi-Cola bottlers. The company's other brands included Diet RC Cola, Diet Rite Cola, Nehi, Nehi Lockjaw, Upper 10, and Kick. Royal Crown was a wholly owned subsidiary of RC/Arby's Corporation, which, in turn, was owned by Triarc Companies, Inc.

Origins

Royal Crown was born from the efforts of Claud Adkin Hatcher, a turn-of-the-century pharmacist residing in Columbus, Ohio, who co-owned a grocery wholesale business. Established in 1901, the Cole-Hatcher-Hampton Grocery Company was started by Hatcher, his father, and two other partners, but by 1903 the Hatchers had bought out their partners and abbreviated the name of their business to Hatcher Grocery Company. By the time of the name change, Claud Hatcher was spending more and more of his time in the basement of the family business; driven downstairs by a combination of anger and a need for self-sufficiency. For the first time--and not the last time--Hatcher's way of doing business collided headlong with the business philosophy of a Georgia-based company named Coca-Cola. The friction between Hatcher and a Coca-Cola representative sparked the creation of Royal Crown and marked the beginning of Royal Crown's century-long struggle to capture market share from Coca-Cola, the reigning leader of the soft drink industry.
The sparks began to fly when a Coca-Cola bottler named Columbus Roberts refused to yield to Hatcher's demands. As a grocery wholesaler, Hatcher purchased a large volume of Coca-Cola from Roberts, and because of this Hatcher believed Hatcher Grocery Co. should receive a discount, or a commission, or in some way should be compensated for the amount of Coca-Cola it purchased. Roberts disagreed, and a heated dispute erupted. Hatcher declared he had purchased his last case of soft drinks from Roberts and vowed to produce and bottle his own beverages under his own labels. Following through on his promise, Hatcher retreated to Hatcher Grocery Co.'s basement and began experimenting with different formulas. While his father remained upstairs, Hatcher, the 27-year-old graduate pharmacist, worked downstairs creating the foundation of the new family business.
The first soft drink Hatcher created was named Royal Crown Ginger Ale, and its success opened the Hatchers' eyes to the opportunities available in the soft drink market. In 1905, father and son made their commitment to the soft drink market official by reorganizing Hatcher Grocery Co. as Union Bottling Works and concentrating wholly on producing Royal Crown Ginger Ale. In the months to follow, business was brisk. The Hatchers enjoyed enough success to move to larger production facilities in 1907, but, as they quickly realized, the greatest profits to be made were in the cola market, led by the burgeoning giant Coca-Cola. Hatcher wanted a share of the lucrative cola market, and shortly after Union Bottling Works relocated to its grander facility, he introduced his own cherry-flavored cola creation, dubbed Chero-Cola. By 1911 Chero-Cola ranked as the company's greatest-selling product, the first in a long line of product introductions that would eclipse the popularity of its predecessor. The popularity of Chero-Cola led to another event in Royal Crown's history--a name change to reflect the success of its greatest selling product. In 1912 Union Bottling Works changed its name to Chero-Cola Company, an enterprise reorganized to manufacture a line of syrups to be sold to franchised bottlers.
Hatcher's first clash with Coca-Cola pitted him against an emissary of the fast-growing, Atlanta-based soft drink producer. Hatcher's introduction of Chero-Cola, and its flowering success, swept away all subsidiary layers shielding direct confrontation with Coca-Cola and pitted Hatcher against Coca-Cola's senior executives. The ensuing struggle was a battle Coca-Cola was intent on winning. When Hatcher filed to register Chero-Cola as a trademark in 1914, Coca-Cola quickly responded, demanding that the word "cola" be removed from all advertising. This first clash touched off a 30-year legal dispute between Hatcher's business and Coca-Cola, a feud over the rights to the word "cola" that would not be concluded until World War II was near its end. As this exhaustive debate was being argued in the courts, Hatcher had to contend with more pressing problems: his company's first major crisis. As one of the first "cola wars" raged on, hostilities in Europe gave way to the United States' entry into World War I, the prosecution of which portended the collapse of the entire soft drink industry in America.

World War I and Legal Troubles

In 1918 the U.S. Government imposed severe restrictions on the use of sugar in products deemed non-essential to the war effort. Soft drinks, of course, added little to the country's fighting might and fell under the wartime restrictions. For a brief time, the federal government threatened to take its restrictive measures a step further and considered whether or not to ban soft drink production altogether during the course of the war, but government officials stopped short of sounding the industry's death knell. Staving off the termination of their business, however, did not put soft drink producers in a much better position, and each had to make do with sugar supplies reduced to a trickle. Chero-Cola responded by establishing and operating its own sugar refinery, using raw sugar imported from Cuba to keep its operations alive. For roughly three years, the company relied on its sugar refinery for the essential supply of sugar and managed to persevere through the war years, but as Chero-Cola entered the 1920s a host of challenges loomed ahead.
By 1920 Chero-Cola stood as a thriving business, with 700 franchise bottling plants scattered throughout the South and Midwest, but when sugar prices collapsed during the early years of the decade, the company's considerable cache of sugar became a liability. Chero-Cola's problems were amplified in 1923 when its legal battle with Coca-Cola reached a decisive juncture. After nine years of contentious debate, Coca-Cola prevailed, and Chero-Cola was ordered to remove the word "cola" from all advertisements. In the wake of the court's ruling, the abbreviated "Chero" beverage fared far worse than "Chero-Cola" and lost much of its market. Eventually, the production of Chero, which represented Chero-Cola's chief source of revenue, was discontinued entirely.








The quick death of Chero could have had disastrous repercussions for the company, but Hatcher's timing in introducing a new product provided Chero-Cola with a potent, revenue-generating engine that easily made up for the loss of Chero. The same year Coca-Cola won its case against Chero-Cola, Hatcher introduced a new, fruit-flavored beverage named Melo. After Hatcher overheard a salesman refer to a competitor's soft drink bottle as being "knee-high," he changed Melo's name to Nehi, a brand name that became familiar to generations of consumers after its 1924 introduction. By 1928 sales of Nehi beverages were driving the company's financial growth to such an extent that Hatcher changed the name of his business to Nehi, Inc.
With the increasing popularity of Nehi, the company entered the 1930s at full stride, but the Great Depression stood as a formidable obstacle blocking the company's progress, bringing to a halt the encouraging growth that characterized the latter half of the 1920s. To make the company's position more precarious, Hatcher died on New Year's Eve in 1933, stripping Nehi Inc. of its influential leader just as it was grappling with the century's most pernicious economic crisis. Together, the loss of Hatcher and an economic depression of unprecedented proportions represented what could have been a crippling blow to Nehi, Inc., but the company fared remarkably well, recording one of the most successful decades in its history. Between 1933 and 1940, the company's annual sales increased tenfold.
The negative affects of the Depression were only temporary. After Hatcher's sudden death, the company's vice-president of sales, Hilary Richard Mott, took command and immediately cut costs, discontinued slow-selling products, and consolidated production activities. Less than a year after taking charge, Mott stood over a debt-free enterprise exhibiting a vibrancy that belied the woeful economic times. As Mott's healing measures were being implemented, the company's chemist was working on Nehi, Inc.'s next great product: its second cola concoction. The greatest money to be earned in the soft drink industry was still in the cola market. Hatcher's realization of this fact had prompted the development of Chero-Cola in the first decade of the century, and it prompted him to muster another attempt shortly before his death. In 1932 he had instructed his chemist to develop a cola beverage, and by 1934, when the company stood on solid financial ground, the new cola product was ready for distribution. Named Royal Crown, the new soft drink represented the company's future, becoming a favorite of consumers in the decades to follow.
Although the bulk of the company's revenue was derived from the sale of Nehi throughout the remainder of the 1930s, much of the company's promotional efforts were directed toward building consumer awareness of Royal Crown, or "RC" as the cola drink became more commonly known. In 1940 the company pioneered blind taste tests, using the promotional strategy more than three decades before other soft drink manufacturers did so. According to the results of the publicly-performed blind taste tests, RC was the winner, spawning the "Best By Taste Test" slogan. One year after Nehi, Inc. started its blind taste test publicity campaign, it hired numerous Hollywood celebrities to promote the sale of RC. Such luminaries as Bing Crosby, Joan Crawford, Shirley Temple, Lucille Ball, and Ronald Reagan appeared in advertisements alongside RC, piquing consumer interest. As public demand for RC increased under the barrage of promotional campaigns, the company scored an important victory in the courts. In 1944 Nehi, Inc. ultimately prevailed in its 30-year legal battle with Coca-Cola when the courts ruled that the company could use the word cola in its advertisements.

Post-World War II Innovations

RC Cola, as the product could be called after the 1944 ruling, developed into the company's greatest-selling product during the post-World War II period, earning its distinction as the company's mainstay product when Nehi, Inc. became Royal Crown Cola Company in 1959. Under its new corporate banner, the company followed up on its success with RC Cola by developing the soft drink industry's first sugar-free diet beverage, a product the Los Angeles Times selected as the "Leading New Product of the 1960s." Development of the ground-breaking beverage was completed in 1961, and in 1962 Diet Rite Cola hit retail shelves. The product proved to be an enormous success, and one for which the other major soft drink manufacturers had no marketable answer. Fueled by the widespread demand for Diet Rite Cola and RC Cola, the company thrived throughout 1960s, gaining considerable ground on its two biggest rivals, Pepsi and Coca-Cola. According to several accounts, the 1960s ranked as the most successful decade in Royal Crown Cola's history, but the enviable success enjoyed by the company did not carry over into the 1970s. Royal Crown Cola's eye-catching growth came screeching to a halt in October 1969.
On October 18, 1969, the federal government banned the use of the artificial sweetener cyclamate, the essential ingredient in Royal Crown Cola's Diet Rite Cola. The losses suffered from the ban were immediate and profound, stripping the company of the product it had come to rely on for much of its growth. On the heels of the federal edict against cyclamate, company directors vowed never again to become reliant on a single product to drive sales. Their resolution gave rise to a period of diversification that began in the early 1970s with the acquisition of two fruit juice companies, Adams Packing Association and Texsun Company. Next, the company moved into the home decorative accessories field, purchasing seven companies involved in floor tile, mirrors, picture frames, and lamps. Not done there, the company moved farther afield, acquiring fast-food franchiser Arby's in 1976. Two years later, company directors observed the long-held tradition of changing their company's name to reflect the mainstay business, but this time the name change was purposefully less specific. In 1978 Royal Crown Cola Company became Royal Crown Companies Inc.
Under the corporate umbrella of Royal Crown Companies, the soft drink operations were organized into a division, no longer representing the sole source of revenue for the Royal Crown enterprise. When Diet Rite Cola was reintroduced in 1983, the soft drink division generated $242 million of the company's $490 million in sales for the year, a significant percentage of the company's total revenue volume, to be sure, but representative of only half of what the company had developed into in roughly a decade. In 1984 the soft drink division and the rest of the businesses that had been acquired were purchased by corporate takeover artist Victor Posner, who moved Royal Crown Companies to Miami Beach, Florida, and made the company part of DWG Corporation, one of several holding companies under his control.

Lackluster 1980s and Hope for the 1990s

Posner controlled Royal Crown for nine years. His tenure of ownership was notable for the introduction of Cherry RC, Diet RC Cola, and an eight-flavor line of Diet Rite, and it was infamous for Posner's cost-cutting measures that hacked away at Royal Crown's already limited marketing budget. As a result, the company lost ground during the late 1980s and early 1990s, ceding market share to its two, much larger rivals, Pepsi and Coca-Cola. Royal Crown's tailspin showed no signs of ending until ownership of the company passed to new hands, Nelson Peltz and Peter May. In 1993 Peltz and May acquired Royal Crown and Arby's through their company, Triarc Companies, Inc., eventually organizing Royal Crown as a subsidiary of RC/Arby's Corporation, a holding company that also oversaw the operation of Arby's.
Under the ultimate ownership of Triarc, Royal Crown's leading brand, RC Cola, received much greater attention than it had during the 1980s. Triarc added roughly $25 million a year to Royal Crown's marketing budget through the mid-1990s and into the late 1990s, which helped bolster recognition of the RC brand. A new brand, Royal Crown Draft Cola, was introduced in 1995 amid great expectations, but production of the product was discontinued roughly a year later. Following this misstep, the owners of Royal Crown were intent on reestablishing RC Cola as a brand able to wrest market share away from Pepsi and Coca-Cola, something the venerable label had not been able to do for years. Throughout its history, Royal Crown had demonstrated itself to be a creative innovator, but had never seriously threatened its two big rivals. In many respects, the company had served as a research lab for Pepsi and Coca-Cola, yet had never been able to reap the full rewards that should have been realized from its pioneering role. As the company looked toward the 21st century, its was searching for some way to collect the benefits of its legacy of achievement as a soft drink producer.

RC Cola
Since its launch in 1905, RC Cola has been a soft drink that embodies individuality and entrepreneurial spirit. RC's crisp, clean taste distinguishes it from other colas and has become a favorite of cola drinkers throughout America.

What’s in a Name?
RC Cola received its name from the people who matter the most: its consumers. When the reformulated product was released in 1934, the manufacturer named it "Royal Crown Cola." As the soft drink became increasingly successful, consumers affectionately abbreviated the name to "RC."






History
RC Cola originated in Columbus, Georgia, when a young pharmacist named Claud A. Hatcher decided to supply his family's grocery store with drinks that he produced and bottled. Hatcher called his first line of beverages "Royal Crown," and the first cola product "Chero-Cola." 

Sales grew steadily, and in 1912 Hatcher's basement bottling activities grew into the Chero-Cola Co. Sixteen years later, he renamed the company Nehi Corporation, after the successful line of fruity beverages he had developed. 

After Hatcher's death in 1933, Vice President H. R. Mott took control of the company. Part of Mott's plan was the reformulation of the classic Chero-Cola into a more refreshing beverage. Chemist Rufas Kamm was given the responsibility of coming up with the new flavor, which took six months to perfect. The new cola was released to the public with the name of Hatcher's original line of beverages: Royal Crown. 

Royal Crown Cola was an instant sensation. RC Cola, as it is now called, was such a success that the company was eventually renamed Royal Crown Cola Co. By 1940, RC products were available in 47 of the 48 states. 

RC continued to expand throughout the following decade and began to advertise more aggressively. Advertisements were inserted into publications such as The Saturday Evening Post and Good Housekeeping, and endorsements by Hollywood stars such as Joan Crawford, Bob Hope and Bing Crosby were featured on billboards throughout the nation. 

As RC continued to grow, it stayed true to its independent personality by producing innovation after innovation. In 1954, the company became the first to nationally distribute soft drinks in cans, and would later be the first to use all-aluminum cans. Four years later, the company introduced the 16-ounce bottle.

In terms of beverages, RC produced the first low-calorie diet cola (Diet Rite), the first caffeine-free diet cola (RC 100) and the first diet cherry cola (Diet Cherry RC).

The RC Cola brand was acquired in October 2000 by London-based Cadbury Schweppes. Today, RC Cola is part of Plano, Texas-based Dr Pepper Snapple Group, an integrated refreshment beverage business marketing more than 50 beverage brands throughout North America.
