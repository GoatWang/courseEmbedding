Trust a leader in higher education
National American University (NAU) is a respected leader in higher education. We offer master’s degree programs with many emphasis options, which means you’ll find the program that fits your career goals.
All of our faculty members are doctorally qualified by International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE) standards or have doctoral degrees in their field of teaching. As experienced professionals, many of them work in the fields they teach, bringing practical knowledge and experience into the online classroom.

The American Way
At National American University, we believe that every student deserves an opportunity to earn a college degree.
With our flexible online programs, relevant degree programs, and your own personal advisor from day one, you can get the education you deserve. We call that “The American Way.”

Why earn a master’s degree?
Earning your master’s degree will allow you to differentiate yourself from your peers—it demonstrates initiative and dedication to potential employers. But there are financial benefits to earning an advanced degree as well. In fact, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, individuals with a master’s degree are likely to earn 17% more than those with a just a bachelor’s degree.

Medical Assisting
National American University’s Diploma in Medical Assisting program utilizes a combination of lecture and laboratory sessions, as well as a practicum following completion of required coursework, to prepare you for entry-level positions in ambulatory healthcare settings. Medical assistants perform administrative and certain clinical duties under the direction of a healthcare provider such as a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. Administrative duties may include scheduling appointments, maintaining medical records, billing, and coding for insurance purposes. Clinical duties may include taking and recording vital signs and medical histories, preparing patients for examination, drawing blood, and administering medications as directed by a healthcare provider. To learn more about program goals, learning outcomes, and course descriptions, view the undergraduate catalog.
