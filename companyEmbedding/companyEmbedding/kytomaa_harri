Dr. Kytömaa specializes in mechanical engineering and the analysis of thermal and flow processes. He applies his expertise to the investigation and prevention of failures in mechanical systems.  He also investigates fires and explosions and their origin and cause.  He consults in the utilities, oil and gas, and chemical industries.  Dr. Kytömaa’s project experience includes consumer products, intellectual property matters, automobiles, aircraft, turbines, compressors, boilers, steam generators, pneumatic and hydraulic systems, instrumentation, nuclear waste management, heat transfer systems, fuel distribution, delivery and storage systems, including LNG facilities.

Dr. Kytömaa has decades of experience in the area of dynamics and thermal hydraulics of piping systems, valves and pipelines. He has developed flow modeling tools for such systems and their components and has applied these to drilling and downhole applications. He pioneered the modeling of the acoustics of drilling fluid piping systems for acoustic telemetry and Measurement-While-Drilling (MWD), which was one of the enabling technologies for directional drilling. Dr. Kytömaa has also developed ultrasonic techniques for both medical and engineering applications, including instrumentation for flow measurement and the characterization of dense suspensions. 

Dr. Kytömaa was Assistant Professor and Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was head of the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory. He has also held positions as Visiting Professor at the Helsinki University of Technology and at the DOE Pacific Northwest Laboratory in Washington, and served as Lecturer at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Dr. Kytömaa consulted for Teleco Oil Field Services, Inc., developing MWD technology and other downhole applications.
