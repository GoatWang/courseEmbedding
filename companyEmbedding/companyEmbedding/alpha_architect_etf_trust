START









Build a strong core portfolio
Answer 5 quick questions to start.













Question 1
What do you consider your investment style to be?

Conservative
Moderate
Aggressive





Consider risk versus return


Your comfort with risk can depend on your previous investment experience, performance goals, time horizon, and net worth. In general, the higher return you want, the greater risk you'll have to take.






NEXT



Question 1 of 5





Question 2
If the market sees a big downward swing how would you react?

Do nothing
Invest more



Sell some investments
Sell everything


Pause and reflect


Your risk tolerance is key to deciding on your overall portfolio mix. So even when you know that markets constantly move up and down, you should carefully consider these peaks and valleys - and how much of your total investment you're really willing to risk on a possible long-term downturn.

Question 2 of 5





Question 3
If the market sees a big upward swing how would you react?

Do nothing

Sell some investments

Think of the future


Keeping in mind the constant movement of markets, now consider what you would do in an up market. You should take into consideration not just current gains, but also your long-term financial goals.

Question 4
How long do you plan to keep your assets invested for?

YEARS


Estimating your time horizon


Your investing goal may be far in the future, or it could be right around the corner. How many years you have to reach your goals will shape your portfolio.

Question 4 of 5





Question 5
How much would your initial investment be?







Why does the amount matter?


As your portfolio increases in size you can incorporate a larger number of funds to further diversify your portfolio and access more targeted exposures.




Laying the foundation


No matter how much you have to invest, a well-diversified core can help reduce your overall risk long-term. You can use iShares Core Funds as the essential building blocks of your portfolio and add on other kinds of investments to customize for your specific goals.

What is an ETF?










An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a diversified collection of assets (like a mutual fund) that trades on an exchange (like a stock). ETFs are an easy-to-use, low cost and tax efficient way to invest your money.








What are the benefits of ETFs?
 





iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past 5 years1


 




1/3 the price of atypical mutual fund2

1/2 the tax cost of theaverage active mutual fund3

Word on the street

We took to the streets of San Francisco and asked people, "What is an exchange traded fund?" In their words, here's what they had to say.





What is an exchange traded fund






 







Comparing ETFs and mutual funds
Many investors are familiar with mutual funds. How are ETFs similar? And what makes them different?
Hover over the icons to learn more.


Learn more about the differences in investment strategy, fees,and tax implications of ETFs vs mutual funds.







Similarities




Diversification
You get a diversified collection of stocks and/or bonds, which can potentially help reduce risk compared to individual securities.





Professionally managed
The funds are overseen by professional managers.





Risk and reward
The risk profile of an ETF is derived from its underlying holdings, as with mutual funds.



Differences




Cost
ETFs typically cost less than comparable mutual funds (⅓ the cost, on average), and there are no hidden loads or fees. (Your broker may charge a transaction fee, though many iShares ETFs are available commission-free at providers like Fidelity⁴). What’s more, your taxes may be significantly lower: tax costs for iShares ETFs on average are less than ½ those of the average mutual fund³.





Fund performance
Most ETFs seek to closely match the performance of an established stock or bond index, such as the S&P 500 or the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Actively managed mutual funds try to beat the index, which can be hard to do, especially after fees and taxes. iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past five years¹.





Buying and selling
As with stocks, you can buy and sell ETFs at the market price whenever the market is open. Mutual fund shares are purchased directly from the fund at Net Asset Value (NAV) and priced once a day after the market closes.





Knowing what you own
Because ETFs usually aim to track an index, their holdings change relatively little over time – without the “style drift” that may surprise mutual fund investors.

1Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157), and 79.9% (1330/1515) of their active mutual fund peers over the 1, 3, and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For more information on the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds, click here.
2Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. Comparison is between the average Prospectus Net Expense Ratio for the iShares ETFs (0.38%) and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds (1.22%) with 10-year track records that were available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016.
3Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. "Tax Cost Ratio" is a Morningstar measure of the impact of taxes on capital gains and income distributions on performance. The average 10-year Tax Cost Ratio of iShares ETFs and the oldest share class of all actively managed open-end mutual funds available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016 (excluding municipal bond and money market funds) included in the comparison is 0.51% and 1.20%, respectively.
4ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity, if held less than 30 days. Other conditions and fees may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.  BlackRock is not affiliated with Fidelity or any of their affiliates.





 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/ developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.

Transactions in shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions and will generate tax consequences. All regulated investment companies are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders.






Certain traditional mutual funds can also be tax efficient.

What is an ETF?










An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a diversified collection of assets (like a mutual fund) that trades on an exchange (like a stock). ETFs are an easy-to-use, low cost and tax efficient way to invest your money.








What are the benefits of ETFs?
 





iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past 5 years1


 




1/3 the price of atypical mutual fund2

1/2 the tax cost of theaverage active mutual fund3



 


Learn more about why to use ETFs.






 






Word on the street

We took to the streets of San Francisco and asked people, "What is an exchange traded fund?" In their words, here's what they had to say.





What is an exchange traded fund






 







Comparing ETFs and mutual funds
Many investors are familiar with mutual funds. How are ETFs similar? And what makes them different?
Hover over the icons to learn more.


Learn more about the differences in investment strategy, fees,and tax implications of ETFs vs mutual funds.







Similarities




Diversification
You get a diversified collection of stocks and/or bonds, which can potentially help reduce risk compared to individual securities.





Professionally managed
The funds are overseen by professional managers.





Risk and reward
The risk profile of an ETF is derived from its underlying holdings, as with mutual funds.



Differences




Cost
ETFs typically cost less than comparable mutual funds (⅓ the cost, on average), and there are no hidden loads or fees. (Your broker may charge a transaction fee, though many iShares ETFs are available commission-free at providers like Fidelity⁴). What’s more, your taxes may be significantly lower: tax costs for iShares ETFs on average are less than ½ those of the average mutual fund³.





Fund performance
Most ETFs seek to closely match the performance of an established stock or bond index, such as the S&P 500 or the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Actively managed mutual funds try to beat the index, which can be hard to do, especially after fees and taxes. iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past five years¹.





Buying and selling
As with stocks, you can buy and sell ETFs at the market price whenever the market is open. Mutual fund shares are purchased directly from the fund at Net Asset Value (NAV) and priced once a day after the market closes.





Knowing what you own
Because ETFs usually aim to track an index, their holdings change relatively little over time – without the “style drift” that may surprise mutual fund investors.

1Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157), and 79.9% (1330/1515) of their active mutual fund peers over the 1, 3, and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For more information on the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds, click here.
2Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. Comparison is between the average Prospectus Net Expense Ratio for the iShares ETFs (0.38%) and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds (1.22%) with 10-year track records that were available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016.
3Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. "Tax Cost Ratio" is a Morningstar measure of the impact of taxes on capital gains and income distributions on performance. The average 10-year Tax Cost Ratio of iShares ETFs and the oldest share class of all actively managed open-end mutual funds available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016 (excluding municipal bond and money market funds) included in the comparison is 0.51% and 1.20%, respectively.
4ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity, if held less than 30 days. Other conditions and fees may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.  BlackRock is not affiliated with Fidelity or any of their affiliates.





 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.

ETF Performance










When low cost funds post solid performance, investors keep more of what they earn.






 






Want to keep more of what you earn?

Investment fees and taxes matter. See how much you could save if you invest with iShares ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) versus a typical mutual fund.





Want to keep more of what you earn?








Potential savings
When you combine the impact of lower fees, potential tax savings, and performance that seeks to match an index, ETFs may potentially earn you nearly $56,000 over 10 years.







Chart reflects the hypothetical growth of a fictional investment of $250,000 with an 8% return and assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Fund expenses, including management fees and other expenses have been deducted. The graph is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the performance of any actual fund or investment portfolio.






 




How iShares ETFs can help you keep more





1/3 the cost of a typical mutual fund1:
Most ETFs aim to match the performance of a benchmark index. This strategy generally requires less frequent turnover of holdings within the fund, so fund fees tend to be lower.



1/2 the tax cost of the average active mutual fund2:
When you sell your mutual fund or ETF at a gain, you will have to pay taxes on that gain. But capital gains taxes can be incurred even if you don’t sell your shares, due to trading activity within your fund. Active mutual funds that frequently buy and sell securities are often subject to higher capital gains distributions. Because most ETFs track an index, they tend to generate fewer undesirable capital gains distributions.



Only 18% of active managers beat their benchmarks after fees over the last five years3:
Because of the more frequent trading and complex strategies in actively-managed funds, fund expenses are higher – so performance has to be good enough to compensate for those higher fees.















Percent of comparable mutual funds that iShares Core ETFs outperformed







Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns.

Wesley R. Gray, PhD
CEO/CIO

Alpha Architect Launches Alpha Architect Value Momentum Trend ETF (VMOT)






Business Wire




May 3, 2017 11:23 AM EDT













 


















































  Alpha Architect today announced that it has launched its fifth proprietary index fund, the Alpha Architect Value Momentum Trend ETF (Ticker: VMOT) with a zero management fee. 1  VMOT is a fund of funds ETF that seeks to track the Alpha Architect Value Momentum Trend Index ("Index"), which seeks to capture (1) focused value and momentum factor premiums and (2) follows a proprietary trend-following algorithm that seeks to avoid downtrending markets against extreme losses. The Index seeks to mitigate extreme market drawdowns, while capturing focused value and momentum exposures.  Dr. Wes Gray, founder of Alpha Architect, is excited for the Fund's prospects: "We see a great opportunity to provide investors with a unique type of alternative exposure. VMOT provides exposures to what we believe to be the most robust factor premiums: value, momentum, and trend."  VMOT will hold the four flagship funds of Alpha Architect ( QVAL, QMOM, IMOM, and IVAL) and also deploy a trend following system overlay, all for zero management fees beyond the underlying ETF expense ratios.  With zero sales representatives and a "disdain for flash" culture, Alpha Architect has raised $180M in ETF assets in under three years. Their overall asset base has grown from $30M in 2012 to over half a billion (managed accounts and ETFs) to date.  Dr. Wesley Gray and Dr. Jack Vogel, co-CIOs of Alpha Architect, started developing their Value Momentum Trend Index soon after they completed development of their Quantitative Value algorithm and Quantitative Momentum algorithms.  VMOT joins a small number of boutique ETFs that offer trend-following exposure inside of an ETF structure. When trend-following signals "break," the fund will short domestic and international market exposures and move to a protection seeking stance.  Dr. Gray continued, "We seek to deliver a high-conviction value/momentum approach backed by extensive academic and market research and a substantive knowledge of the manner in which irrational investor behavior creates mispricing. With VMOT, we can now give our investors access to this strategy, while simultaneously providing a mechanism that seeks to avoid downtrending markets. For disciplined investors looking to access multiple factor premiums in one package, VMOT may be a compelling product."  VMOT may be best suited for investors and advisors that want focused factor exposures paired with trend-following overlays.

How Asset Managers Are Adapting to Exchange-Traded-Funds

 $hack, $XLU, Guest Posts, ETF Investing 

(Last Updated On: April 12, 2017)

The ETF industry has been around for over 20 years at this point, but over the past 5 years the ETF industry has captivated the investment world. I’ve had a front seat on the action, launching over 650 exchange traded products while I was an associate at the NYSE in the Global Indexing and Exchange Traded Product Group. We built indexes for ETFs, participated on weekly calls with the SEC trying to get approval for innovative ETFs that fell outside the standard rules, and guided new ETF issuers through the whole process.  It was here that I learned one important fact of a new ETF: You, the financial advisor, will never see a bad backtest for an ETF. If the investment idea had a poor backtest, it didn’t make it to market.
I transitioned to RevenueShares to be their Head of Capital Markets, which we grew from $450 million to $1.1 billion and was eventually sold to the mutual fund giant, Oppenheimer Funds. During my seven years in the industry I’ve witnessed that some industry players were prepared, some were caught flat footed, and some are still trying to figure out what to do next.
In this piece, Wes asked me to share some insights on the ETF industry and where it might be heading based on some trends I’ve witnessed. I’ll start this essay with a recap of recent merger and acquisition activity in the ETF space, then discuss why advisors are back in the driving seat, mention briefly some trends in ETF product development, and end with some discussions of what we could expect going forward.

ETFs Create Disruption: Do You Buy Your Way Into the Business?
In 2014 and 2015 there was a wave of ETF company acquisitions by large asset management firms. The reason was simple: if an asset management company was not in the ETF game, they realized they really needed to get in it. ETFs were not a fad that was going away.
Asset management firms had two options:

Build the ETF division of their firm from within
Acquire an ETF company and its existing team and/or ETF products.

Some asset managers chose option 2: IndexIQ was acquired by New York Life. Janus bought VelocityShares. Oppenheimer Funds bought RevenueShares (full disclosure: my former employers). Hartford Funds acquired acquired Lattice Strategies. Columbia Threadneedle bought Emerging Global Advisors. Victory Capital acquired Compass EMP.
If you’re a big asset management firm acquiring a small ETF firm, you want to lever your strengths (your brand, large distribution force, and large amount of capital). You need to acquire an ETF company that enables you to do that. The sweet spot for an acquisition is an ETF company that is small enough in assets under management (AUM) that it isn’t an impossibly steep price, yet large enough in assets that your firm has a head start on distribution and marketing. Combine that sweet spot of assets with a decent length of time for their ETFs track record, and you have a company that is an ideal acquisition target.
If you examined the list of ETF Companies in the U.S. at the start of 2014, there was a decent number of acquirable firms in that AUM and track record sweet spot: ~$500 million — $5 billion in AUM and three to eight years of track record.
At the start of 2017, the ETF landscape looks very different for potential ETF company acquirers.
Looking at the ETF league table from ETF.com, let’s categorize all the ETF product lines/companies that have over $1 billion in AUM. I’ll use some very official divisions to categorize why they’re either totally not acquirable or near impossible (A.U.M. numbers below as of April 5, 2017).
The “You Can’t Buy Us, but Maybe We’ll Buy You” Division

BlackRock —  $1.082 Trillion
Vanguard — $681 Billion
State Street —  $531 Billion
Invesco PowerShares  —   $120 billion
Charles Schwab — $69 Billion
Guggenheim —  $35 Billion

The Privately Owned/Unicorn Division:

First Trust — $46 Billion
VanEck — $36 Billion
ProShares — $27 Billion
Direxion — $12 Billion
U.S. Commodity Funds (technically publicly traded, but a unicorn) — $4.2 Billion

The “Already Acquired By, or Started By, a Larger Wealth Management Firm” Division

ALPS — $14.5 Billion
Deutsche Bank — $13.8 Billion
Northern Trust — $13.4 Billion
PIMCO — $13 Billion
UBS — $7 Billion
Barclays Capital — $6.6 Billion
Credit Suisse — $3.6 Billion
ETF Securities (has one of the largest European ETF businesses) — $2.4 Billion
IndexIQ (acquired by NY Life) — $2.4 Billion
OppenheimerFunds (acquired RevenueShares) — $2 Billion
Victory Capital Management (acquired Compass EMP — $1.3 Billion

(This division is interesting because you *could try to convince some of these firms* that a spin off of their ETF business would enable it to achieve its full value. We’re assuming that’s too complicated and these firms want to hold on.)
The “We Started Later, But Are Choosing To Go It Alone” Division

Fidelity — $6.2 Billion
JPMorgan — $5.3 Billion
Goldman Sachs — $3.3 Billion

The “I’m Kinda Seeing Someone Already” Division

Global X (partially owned by JPMorgan) — $4.7 Billion

The Exemptive Relief Division

Exchange Traded Concepts — $2.6 Billion
ETF Managers Group — $1.2 Billion
AdvisorShares — $1.1 Billion
Millington Securities — $1 Billion

The Wisdomtree Division

Wisdomtree — $42 Billion

(Can they be bought? Yes. Will they be bought? They’re often thrown around as a target acquisition for one of the behemoth asset management firms, but likely too large and too expensive now.)
OK. That is every ETF company/product line that has over $1 billion in assets. None of them are really acquirable. Yes, there’s always a price, but any firm that can buy the firms above, it probably doesn’t make sense to, and any firm that would like to acquire the firms above, can’t.
Under $1 billion in AUM, we have some very large asset management firms that are either going it alone in building their ETF business line, or they bought a small ETF shop mainly as an acqui-hire (saying this because there was either a short track record for the ETF shop acquired, small AUM, or both).
Since the rush of 2014/2015 acquisitions, the options to acquire firms have become much slimmer. If you’re a firm that is looking to buy your way into the ETF space then, what are the best options from what’s left?
Here’s the list of firms under $1 Billion , but over  $200 million in AUM (in millions):
Source: ETF.com
This is a good range to focus on as these firms are large enough to be of interest to a larger firm, or soon could be.
Within those, there’s three independent ETF shops to keep an eye on:

Pacer Financial
O’Shares (FQF Trust)
Cambria

Beyond falling in that AUM range, each of them has a product suite that achieves the following:

Can handle a large capacity of assets due to how they’re structured
Their products can be sold in major portfolio allocation segments
They each have a product suite that has a theme to them that could be expanded upon by a larger firm for future product development.

Those are the key things to look for if you’re considering acquiring your way into the ETF business.
Sure, they each have some flaws in an acquisition scenario (Pacer’s Trendpilot products are more complicated to sell to the average client, O’Shares has a short track record, and Cambria just raised additional capital). But if they were perfect, they’d already be acquired!
The Initial Plan–ETFs Will Deliver Cheap Beta
In part one, we looked at the state of the ETF industry from a business/acquisition perspective.
How did we get here though, and where are we headed next?
The ETF industry started in 1993 with the launch of SPY.  This started the first wave for the industry: market capitalization weighting, or “cheap” beta. To most investors and asset managers, for the next eighteen years (until about 2013), market cap weighting equaled ETFs. ETFs were market cap weighed. They were one in the same. If an advisor wanted the chance at outperformance, they invested with mutual funds; if they wanted cheap beta, they bought an ETF.
The financial advisor was now becoming the active manager once again, helping clients decide among various active and passive offerings. Let me explain. For many of the more seasoned financial advisors in the business (i.e., those who have been around for at least 20 years), when these advisors started their careers, they woke up every morning diving through individual company information to find the best stocks they could purchase for their clients. And that was fun. That was the part of the business that got them excited. If they made the right call for their clients on a stock, it could make their career.
Throughout their careers though, it slowly became less of stock and bond picking, and more of assigning that active management role to the mutual fund industry. The advisor found a few mutual fund companies he (or she) trusted, he picked their funds across asset classes for diversification, put his clients’ money in them, and checked in on the funds occasionally to make sure they were performing to expectations.
The creation of market cap weighted ETFs began to change the financial advisors’ role back to their earlier days of the business. Once again, they had to make the call:

Should I buy the Van Eck Egypt ETF ($EGPT), or maybe invest in India using the iShares India ETF (INDA)?
Gold could protect my clients downside if we have another 2008, maybe I should buy some of State Street’s SPDR Gold Shares ETF ($GLD)?

Yeah, but GLD owns U.S. Gold and the U.S. confiscated people’s Gold in 1933, I better buy ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF ($SGOL) just to be safe…



Decisions, decisions, decisions.
ETFs empowered advisors (and individual investors) with decisions and took that power away from the mutual fund companies.
All of this happened on the back of a relatively small number of market-cap weighted ETFs. For example, in 2011, there were a “record” 304 exchange traded products listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Many people thought that everything that could be done with ETFs, had been done. Around that time, we crossed 1,000 ETFs listed in the U.S. The only thing left to do was launch the “Zimbabwe market cap weighted ETF,” or some other obscure location (or sector) that wasn’t already taken by iShares or State Street.
But the ETF industry was only starting to revolutionize the asset management industry. The industry moved from delivering cheap beta, to delivering so-called “smart” beta. The active mutual fund managers were already in trouble when advisors had more decision points and an ability to allocate to cheap market-cap weighted ETFs, but the introduction of products that would directly compete with mutual fund manager’s active products was extremely disruptive.
The New Plan–ETFs Will Deliver “Smart” Beta
From a product development standpoint, there wasn’t much left to be done in the market-cap weighted space.  To twist a Yogi Berra quote, “No one builds market cap weighted ETFs anymore, they’re too crowded.” Plus, with expense ratios approaching zero, launching a market-cap weighted product only served as a loss leader or as a way to stay relevant in the minds of investors and advisors. In many respects, market-cap weighted ETFs serve as a utility for the asset management industry. Nothing fancy, but they deliver your electricity at low-cost.
Remarkably, these investment “utilities” were difficult to beat. The combination of rules based investing (removing behavioral biases), lower management fees, and the tax efficiency of the ETF wrapper, made it all but impossible for actively managed mutual funds to outperform market cap weighted ETFs over time.
The ETF industry was not satisfied with the status quo. As Jeff Bezos is quoted as saying, “Your profit margin is my opportunity.” ETF firms started seeing the juicy active mutual fund profit margin as an opportunity and decided it was time to compete — and win. Why couldn’t an ETF firm take the benefits of the ETF structure — rules-based, tax-efficient, and transparent — and turn that into a weapon against the active mutual fund managers? Rob Arnott of Research Affiliates (RAFI) figured he’d give it a chance with the advent of “smart beta.”
PowerShares launched the PowerShares FTSE RAFI US 1000 Portfolio ($PRF) on 12/19/2005. No one knew it at the time, but this was the biggest launch of the ETF industry since the launch of SPY in 1993. In contrast to SPY, and most of the ETFs that came before it, this fund removed price from the passive weighting equation of its constituents. They instead chose to weight their ETF holdings by a variety of “value factors,” in an attempt to provide outperformance.
Six months later Wisdomtree, a former personal finance magazine company,  launched their first ETFs in June 2006. WisdomTree also chose not to use price in the weighting of their ETFs. They chose to weight their funds using a dividend methodology.
One year after WisdomTree’s launch, in May 2007, First Trust launched their first Alphadex ETFs. The First Trust Alphadex ETFs, like PowerShares RAFI indexes, chose to use multiple factors to weight their ETFs holdings, and therefore exclude price from the equation.
At the time, these firms were small players in the ETF industry. Fast forward to March 2017 though, and these firms represent numbers four, six, and seven in ETF assets under management.

The era of market cap weighting product development ran from 1993 until 2013, when we saw the final player rush in. Smart Beta started in 2005 and had the two other dominant firms established two years later. It wasn’t until 2014 though that the term Smart Beta really began to take hold. By 2014, mostly everyone knew ETFs were real. Most knew you couldn’t launch market-cap weighted products because that battle was fought (and there was no money left to be made there). But firms thought they could compete on products that provided differentiated weighting schemes.
JPMorgan launched their first ETF in 2014 (a multifactor ETF). About a year after that, Goldman Sachs entered the ETF world with a suite of multifactor ETFs of their own. And Fidelity launched their own suite of smart beta funds in 2016. Though still relatively new players overall, as these firms were sooner to catch the second trend within ETFs, they’ve more rapidly gained assets in the space and now make up a reasonable percentage of the assets in this category.
Since the launch of PRF in 2005, iShares, State Street and many other firms entered the smart beta ETF weighting area as well. ETF product development started out as a race to fill the entire globe with straightforward strategies that would offer investors exposure to anything there was demand for (or not!). It moved on to attempting to offer exposure to those areas in a more intelligent (Smart!) way. That race is continuing, and there is still room for innovation there, but the price war has started here as well.
The Next Plan–ETF will Deliver ESG
With the first two ETF waves — cheap beta and smart beta — when the rush of product development came there was already a large amount of assets invested in those areas and those areas were continuing to grow rapidly. From a product development standpoint, there seems to be a third way emerging: ESG Investing.
There’s been a rush of asset managers launching ETFs in the ESG space, but assets are minimal (a few billion dollars). Legg Mason has filed for two new ESG ETFs. Nuveen launched a suite of ESG ETFs. Oppenheimer Funds launched two. iShares has the longest running ones ($KLD and $DSI). State Street successfully launched the SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF ($SHE).

The rush makes sense for a few reasons: If you’re a larger asset manager, you know from the first two trends that it can pay to be early.
With market cap weighted ETFs being nearly free and smart beta ETFs beginning to experience the same pricing pressure (thanks a lot, Goldman), there could be money to be made here as the ETF issuers are setting higher expense ratios on these products.
If ESG ETFs prove to be the third trend, it could give firms that missed the first two waves a shot at taking major, core allocation, placement in investors portfolios. All good reasons from a business standpoint to take the shot if you have the capital to be patient on waiting to see if the trend takes off.

That business reasoning is why we have the supply of ETFs ready to catch this trend. Let’s analyze the demand for ESG ETFs, and figure out why that isn’t there yet (low asset under management in the products) and if it makes sense that the demand will catch up to the supply.
What’s the real idea behind ESG investing?
The idea is investors want to make a difference with their investments.(1) They want to invest in companies that, at least, aren’t damaging the world or, at best, are making the world a better place in a number of different ways (ESG stands for environmental, social, and governance after all). In doing so, the hope is to coerce companies into making better decisions.
Can investing in certain companies based off certain metrics cause change to be made by individual companies? Yes.
Inclusion in an index likely can change a company’s behavior if there’s enough assets pushing them one way or another. If we had an ETF that had a trillion dollars of AUM in it, and it only invested in the 100 largest companies that powered themselves with solar roofs, we’d see a lot more companies moving to power themselves with solar roofs.
From a financial advisor standpoint, I know there’s demand from clients as well. I had one financial advisor recently tell me after she added the phrase “Socially Responsible Investing Strategies” to her website, she received two unsolicited calls from individual investors telling them they called her instead of her competitors when looking for a financial advisor because she had that phrase listed on her website. (If you’re a financial advisor, I’d recommend you put that phrase on your website–you might get lucky!)
OK. We’re pretty sure we can change companies’ behavior based off of rules for investing in them (or not investing in them), and we’re pretty sure there’s at least some clients out there asking for it. But there’s still no real assets in the space yet on the ETF side. So why are ETF companies rushing to get into the space? The leading reason thrown around for that future demand (and AUM) to come: Millennials. The holders of the future assets.

ETF firms are predicting that based off studies like the one above (full data here), Millennials will be providing a rush of assets into socially responsible funds as they become the wealthiest generation with the Baby Boomer generation aging. The phrasing of these types of questions is highly misleading though. Ask young people from any generation that question, and I bet you’d see similar answers. Let’s flip the question: Do you want to invest in a socially irresponsible manner? You’d likely get 99% saying no, from every generation.
Millennials want their money invested soundly. Companies are changing to make themselves more socially responsible, more environmentally friendly, and have better social governance as the pressure of society forces them to do so. In 2011, under 20% of companies within the S&P 500 reported a sustainability report. By 2015 81% of companies did. The corporate change ESG investing is meant to drive, is occurring already. ETFs are not a missing tool needed to force that change. They are the needed tool in forcing the other changes we are seeing across the financial world (lower cost and more transparency).
ESG investing makes sense from a business standpoint, but it won’t be moving beyond a niche in the ETF world.
The Next Big Idea? Helping Investors and Advisors Pick ETFs
Financial advisors started off in the drivers seat, picking stocks, driving asset allocation, and really being engaged in the asset management piece of their client portfolios. Then mutual funds came around and advisors took a backseat as they simply allocated assets to a few mutual fund families and called it a day. But the demise of mutual funds and the rise of ETFs have shifted portfolio decisions back to financial advisors.
Advisors are now faced with the question of which ETFs to buy and how to set asset allocation. They need help and tools to accomplish their new mission. The next wave of ETF services will revolve around helping financial advisors make sense of it all (a good example is the visual active share tool just released by Alpha Architect). With almost 2000 ETFs, and 10,000 mutual funds out there, the ETF firms that excel in the future are going to be the ones that can provide advisors and investors with the knowledge and tools to confidently construct ETF portfolios and make good use of those 12,000 products. As with the other trends, some firms were early to this trend. Many of the leading ETF issuers provide tools on their websites for clients to build their own models, some are providing pre-built ETF models for free on their websites, and their sales forces are working with financial advisors in a truly consultative way to construct customized ETF models.
Financial advisors are drowning in emails and phone calls from ETF wholesalers looking to pitch them on their products. The last thing a financial advisor needs is one more sales person walking in to tell them they have the best product for them. Some of them are even right, they do have the best product. But how does the product fit into their portfolio? Financial advisors need holistic advice. Below are some example questions an ETF wholesaler should explore with future advisors:

What is the overlap of the ETF we’re discussing and the rest of my portfolio?

Does it increase my diversification in an intelligent way, or is it more ownership in assets I already own?


What does it do for the cost of my portfolio?

Cost isn’t everything, but I better be getting something additional for that cost. ETF exposures are getting cheaper and cheaper!


What does this do for the valuation of my portfolio?

What matters is the historical average valuation of a product. Products can become overcrowded. The SPDR Utilities Select Sector SPDR ($XLU) is always (we hope) going to trade at a lower valuation than the Purefunds ISE Cyber Security ETF ($HACK), but if XLU is trading at a 30 P/E, its probably not the right time to add to it…


What’s the best way to achieve my desired exposure?

As an example, if I’m a value and growth investor, what’s the best way to get my exposure to value and growth?


What are the tax concerns (if any) with this type of product?
What is the current liquidity profile of this product, and can that change? Or, can I get my money out as easily as I can get it in?

Some products can move in and out of more liquid and less liquid assets as they rebalance. This can rapidly change the liquidity profile of the ETF.
In a liquidity crisis, almost everything becomes illiquid.
Wes has a good piece on this subject: (How ETFs trade in the Secondary Market)



If you can help an advisor address the questions above, your ETF firm stands a good chance to pick up assets. If you cannot, you’ve got a 1 in 12,000 shot — ugly!
Constructing lower cost, transparent, tax efficient ETF portfolios is a trend that hasn’t peaked, but now, more than ever, investor education is critical to success.

Trust, but Verify: The Potential Problems of Blind Investing

 Guest Posts, Active and Passive Investing 

(Last Updated On: May 30, 2017)
Nobody can predict the future, but there is a chance the blind purchase of broad-index portfolios will come to an abrupt and potentially chaotic end when the music finally stops. This argument is the thesis of this blog post.
This article looks at decision-making trends in the context of security selection and asset allocation that may have significant implications for investors. In particular, there has been tremendous growth in broad market-cap weighted index investing (e.g. S&P 500) and automated rebalancing strategies (60/40-ish portfolios). These products are often purchased with little to no due diligence. Blindly purchasing an investment product is rarely a sensible idea. For example, one should consider the price paid (e.g., valuation) and the value received (e.g., asset quality). The separation of critical thought and an investment decision often serves as a necessary behavioral condition (perhaps not sufficient) that can lead to so-called bubbles (e.g., the Dot Com Bubble or the 2008 Global Financial Crisis).
Let’s dig into the Global Financial Crisis a bit further. In the build up to the crisis investors demanded investment-grade stamps but skipped due diligence. The word of the ratings agency was good enough — whoops. Trust, but verify. There are potential parallels with the current “passive” index investing frenzy (i.e., Beta ~1, mega-cap factor funds) as due diligence is often no longer a consideration and investors are placing their trust in efficient markets. In recent years, this has worked well for those employing the strategy. Broad passive indexes have crushed almost everything. Limited due diligence, incredible short-term performance, and a perceived “free” investment product.
What could go wrong?
To be fair, index products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be great tools and help many investors (just like collateralized debt obligations or CDOs). However, there is a significant liquidity mismatch between the trading volume of some index products and that of their underlying securities. When index buyers and sellers are close to equilibrium, there may be no problem. However, if an imbalance develops and liquidity spills over into the underlying markets, then we may could see significant volatility if the tail starts wagging the dog (ETF supply/demand drives underlying stock prices, not fundamentals). (Wes has a good summary of the research on this topic here).

This article focuses on the risks posed by a growing number of price-insensitive investors. It is divided into three primary sections followed by a conclusion.

In the first section, I discuss problems I identify with broad market indexing and automated rebalancing strategies.
Next, I draw parallels between investor price-insensitivity and credit crisis in the next section.
Lastly, I present some numbers to put the risks into perspective.

Investing Based on Faith Can Cause Problems
There are two primary decision-makers in the typical investment process:

The advisor who selects and maintains an asset allocation.
The fund managers who select individual securities.(1)

In my mind, thoughtful due diligence should take place at both levels. However, there are strong trends driving many investors in precisely the opposite directions.

Broad Market Passive Index Investing
To be clear, I am an advocate of sensible low-cost index investing; it is easy to do much worse than follow the broad market indices. Investors can get snagged in high-fee and opaque products, which are often the result of limited due diligence (the very issue we are discussing). However, I believe this specific type of index investing is approaching levels whereby its impact on share prices has moved from being “immaterial,” to material.
As I discussed in my article, Index Investing: Low Fees but High Costs (and briefly describe below), broad market index strategies do not employ any risk management approaches other than diversification. Even this is self-defeating, to some degree, due to the mechanical concentration in the largest companies via market-cap weighting. At the end of the day, passive index investors invest in all companies (good and bad) at whatever their prevailing valuations happen to be (cheap, fair, or expensive).(2)
The theory supporting broad market index strategies assumes the rest of the market participants are actively keeping prices more or less in line so index investors can get a free ride on their due diligence. There are merits to this argument, but there is also irony. In my view, the success and growth of these indexing strategies creates two significant issues.

The first issue relates to the basic premise of relying on the rest of the market to keep prices in line. As the balance of index investors increases, there may be fewer investors left to conduct due diligence. While we are far from this scenario, even Vanguard founder Jack Bogle admits “If everybody indexed, the only word you could use is chaos”.
I believe the second issue is more critical. In particular, the process of blindly allocating capital without regard for quality or valuation can reinforce and magnify mispricing. For example, consider a company that has become overpriced. In other words, its market capitalization is larger than it should be. This gives the company a higher weighting in the index.(3) As each new investment dollar pours into the index, more will go to purchasing the overpriced company than if it were fairly valued. This marginal extra buying pressure could then push the price higher. This process represents a vicious cycle whereby index investing can effectively reinforce and exacerbate overpricing. It is worth noting this phenomenon occurs regardless of whether we can or cannot identify which companies are over or underpriced.

Given the tremendous growth of the index investing industry, this is a legitimate concern. Vanguard’s assets under management reached $4 trillion this January. More concerning is that 20% of that figure was due to growth experienced in just the last three years. While it is one thing to invest blindly, I believe it is important to understand the mechanics of index investing and how they can impact the market (especially if these investors are not buy and hold forever investors).
Asset Allocation
Similar logic and reasoning apply to the hottest topic in asset allocation: automated rebalancing systems. Robo-advisors turn off the due diligence process and allow markets to take the steering wheel of their ruled-based investment vehicles. To be fair, many advisors embrace fixed asset allocation approaches. So this is not necessarily an issue with the new technologies for rebalancing, but is still emblematic of the more general trend of blindly following rules without considering the potential implications.(4)
At the heart of each of these strategies is the notion of diversification (defined with varying levels of sophistication). To quote Warren Buffett: “Diversification is protection against ignorance.” As I have discussed in previous articles, diversification is not the only tool investors should use to understand and manage risk. My point is simply that investors relying on diversification should still conduct a sanity-check on their investments for quality and valuation.
The Skinny
Given the extraordinary efforts of central banks in recent years, the prices and valuations of most assets have been elevated. We no longer have the luxury of investing in safe bonds with healthy yields on the order of 5% like we did before the tech and housing bubbles. In my view, many investors have been scared away from bonds where low expected returns are obvious. However, many investors have jumped from the frying pan into the fryer. Valuations in the stock market now exceed those we saw before the credit crisis and rival those seen during the tech bubble. As a result, I believe diversification between stocks and bonds offers the least benefit now relative to any point in the last 50 years.
If markets were not already in such a precarious state, it might be easier to overlook these trends. However, I believe the timing could not be worse. I have already expressed my views on how markets will reconcile with fundamentals in previous articles. So I will take a step back here and describe how I view the bigger picture.
When it comes to investing, the typical advisor-led strategy involves multiple layers of decision-making that impact the returns investors ultimately achieve. At the business level, each company’s management makes decisions that alter its fundamental performance and determine how profits are allocated to investors (i.e., dividends versus buybacks). The market processes this data in aggregate (i.e., market participants buy and sell as they see fit) and fund managers select stocks based on varying combination of fundamentals, management quality, valuation, and other factors. Lastly, advisors select various funds for their client portfolios and rebalance those holdings according to their mandate (e.g. maintain a 60/40 stock/bond allocation).
Given the cozy relationships that exist between many boards of directors and corporate executives, it can be difficult to impose changes at the business level. Thus, the stewardship of fund and portfolio managers who select individual securities becomes more important. In addition to identifying good businesses, they should also ensure management teams pass on sufficient value to their shareholders. Climbing higher up the food chain, advisors should define the appropriate allocation ranges for their clients and allocate capital to quality portfolio managers. In my view, these allocations should reflect the risk profile of the client and also embed forecasts for performance based on the quality and valuations of the assets. Unfortunately, this latter role of due diligence is often missing.(5)
These two roles (advisor and fund/portfolio manager) naturally have implications for the performance of client portfolios. If either of these stewards were not present, then the door would open for unnecessary risks to creep into the portfolio. It is fine and well to use technology to displace the advice and expertise of such professionals (which is often conflicted and less competent than one might hope). However, endeavoring to go on autopilot can be extremely especially dangerous when the flight instructions embed flaws than can actually exacerbate market volatility.
I am not trying to guide one on the pros and cons of blind allocation strategies (or their variants). My point is to help readers become aware of these strategies many other investors are pursuing. In particular, I believe it is important to understand how these mechanics and market dynamics may help explain some markets’ seemingly anomalous performance.(6) More importantly, I hope this will prompt some to conduct sanity checks on how their portfolio is being managed and help them prepare for what markets may be likely to do going forward.
Parallels to the Credit Crisis
There are some behavioral parallels between the current lack of due diligence in the index investing space and in the period leading up to the credit crisis. While many market commentators blame the housing bubble on banking deregulation and greed, I have a different view. Going back as far as the 1970s, the securities exchange commission (SEC) allowed (if not encouraged) the investment community to rely on the ratings provided by the major credit ratings agencies. Eventually, the SEC officially endorsed major credit ratings agencies as being nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations (NRSROs).
This move had significant implications. There was a now a government-endorsed oligopoly on the credit ratings that allowed or disallowed investment from many of the largest pools of money in existence. Indeed, the capacity of many entities including banks, insurers, and pensions to invest in credit products hinged on whether or not they were deemed investment grade or not. The NRSROs were the exclusive gatekeepers that provided this stamp of approval.
As time passed, dependency on NRSRO ratings increased both by both regulated and unregulated investors. The investment world was weaned off of credit due diligence and just looked for the ratings agencies’ stamps.
In theory, the economy of scale of the ratings agencies could provide benefits to the investment community. In practice, conflicts of interest evolved making this an unlikely outcome. In particular, the ratings agencies were paid by issuers to rate their credit products.
It was a perfect recipe for a crisis to brew. Many investors were compelled to purchase investment grade credit products. Then they relied on conflicted parties to rate them. Indeed, these agencies had a natural incentive to provide better ratings to attract business (attract repeat business!). This setup was a huge boon to banks, mortgage agencies, ratings agencies, and other parties involved in manufacturing derivative credit products (i.e., CDOs and the like). Moreover, one could argue political motives regarding universal home ownership helped feed this machine the ingredients it needed to create its products.
Figure 3: Recipe for a Crash
Source: Aaron Brask Capital
In short, I believe the root cause or enabler of the credit crisis was the endorsement of the (conflicted) credit ratings agencies. Given the considerable complexity of these products (e.g., the 3-6% tranches of collateralized debt obligations backed by sub-prime mortgages or other derivative assets), what fiduciary in their right mind would have invested money without conducting due diligence? When investors stopped conducting their own due diligence and started relying on the rating agencies, it opened the door for conflicts of interest and capital misallocation – ultimately culminating in the credit crisis.
While it is easy to blame the banks, I liken the situation to placing a steak on the edge of your lawn. Can you really get mad at your neighbor’s dog for eating it? The ingredients were put in place, the recipe was public knowledge (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been doing this for years), and the table was set with investors waiting to eat.
Is it really such a surprise Wall Street could not resist the allure of profits from manufacturing these products?
As the credit crisis unfolded, there were severe liquidity mismatches. In the case of credit products, the derivatives tail wagged the dog. As many of these products were imploding, they ultimately had to be unwound in the underlying credit market. Unfortunately, the derivatives market was magnitudes larger and this bottleneck creates huge price distortions.
I see investors once again ceasing due diligence. This time it relates to their overall investment strategies and there are no ratings agencies. They are simply placing their trust in market efficiency. If history is any indication, this will likely end in tears. As I explain in the Liquidity section, there is again a liquidity mismatch that may become apparent if there is significant selling of index products.
There are also several anecdotal signs of an emerging bubble:

ETFs of ETFs: There are now hordes of ETFs that invest in other ETFs. This reminds me of two trends before in the period before the credit crisis. The first was the fund-of-funds craze where fund companies were setup to purchase other hedge funds (as if hedge fund fees were not high enough). Second was the CDO-squared product where remnants of old CDOs were tossed together to create new CDOS of CDOs.
Proliferation of Indexes: According to Bloomberg, there are now more indices than stocks in the US.
Leverage: With investors going to great lengths to buy yield in the markets, leverage has become a popular tool. I have observed some similar themes surfacing in equity products. For example, there are multiple products that take leveraged views on the stock market via shorting the VIX (Volatility and market direction are negatively correlated. So taking short positions in the VIX results in leveraged exposure to the underlying market (in this case, the S&P 500 index)). Moreover, now quadruple-leveraged ETFs are being considered by the market. Seriously?

Looking at Some Numbers: Tail Wagging the Dog?
In this section I observe the market from three different angles. First, I observe valuations and compare them to those before the tech and housing bubbles. Second, I look at the relative magnitudes of liquidity in S&P 500 index products versus its underlying constituents. Lastly, I highlight two more buckets of investors who tend to exacerbate market moves with their pro-cyclical buying and selling patterns.
Valuations
One place market folly can show up is in valuations. While many do not see the forest for the trees, high valuations have historically resulted in dismal returns in subsequent years (probably not telling you anything you don’t already know). Indeed, high valuations were evident leading up to both the tech bubble and credit crisis collapses. We know how those stories ended. Unfortunately, valuations are now higher than before the credit crisis and rivaling those seen during the tech bubble.
Based on forecasts by GMO, large US equity is the most overvalued of all asset classes.(7) They expect a -3.8% real return(8) over the next seven years (this translates into a 30% loss of purchasing power). It is worth noting this forecast is worse than their estimate for US large caps (and every other asset class) before the credit crisis. Moreover, their current forecasts are lower now for every asset class except international small cap and emerging market equities. That is why the current market is sometimes referred to as the ‘everything bubble.’
If you are interested in reading more about the relationship between valuation and market performance, please read my articles More Market Correction to Come, The Non-credit Crisis, and Tea Leaves. One can die on the vine waiting for a valuation-based market correction, but this is certainly something to consider as a long-term investor.
Liquidity Mismatch
One worrisome observation about the current market is the liquidity mismatch between index products and their underlying constituents. Futures, ETFs, and other index products have become immensely popular trading vehicles. In fact, they have become so popular that some of their (dollar) trading volumes outweigh those of their underlying constituents.
Figure 4: Index Products Dwarf Underlying Stock Liquidity
Source: Aaron Brask Capital
Figure 4 above illustrates this case for S&P 500 index products. In particular, the average daily trading volume for the S&P 500 e-mini futures is approximately $140 billion per day. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ticker: SPY) trades another $20bn per day. However, the underlying stocks of the S&P 500 index only trade about $34 billion per day. So the trading volume of these two index products is almost five times the volume in the underlying shares.
Given the massive growth of index products in recent years, the creation of new ETF shares has resulted in net buying activity at the stock level. So I suspect this has been a major driver of the recent bull market. Even without this driver, the buyers and sellers of the index products might just trade amongst themselves. In this case there may be no problem as the volume might not spill over into the underlying stocks.
I am concerned with the flip side of the growth situation. Significant problems may arise if markets take a turn south. If that is the case and a significant imbalance develops at the index product level, the underlying stocks may not be able to withstand the magnitude of volume that spills into their market. Given the autopilot nature of the strategies that got markets to this point, it would not surprise me if index investors’ beliefs in efficient markets get shaken and create just such an imbalance. Perhaps these new index investors are iron-willed buy-and-holders, but I doubt this is the case. Unless, of course, human nature has changed.
Two More Cyclical Investors
In addition to the autopilot investors, whom I suspect will exacerbate or intensify future market declines, there are two other groups of investors who also tend to buy and sell in a cyclical pattern. The first group is margin investors. These investors borrow money to purchase shares of stocks. This leverage tends to be employed by more speculative investors. As Figure 5 below illustrates, many of these margin investors tend to evaporate during market declines and thus contribute to the market selling.
Figure 5: NYSE Margin Debt
Source: Aaron Brask Capital, NYSE, S&P
Right now margin debt on the NYSE is at a record high – more than 40% above its previous peak. Previous market declines saw margin debt fall by a bit more than 50%. If that were the case going forward, this would amount to approximately $225 billion in selling. This translates into seven entire days of average stock volume (though, of course, this selling would occur over a longer period).
Figure 6: S&P 500 Buybacks ($bn)
Source: FactSet
Another group of cyclical investors are companies themselves. The bulk of their share repurchases occur during bull market periods, but typically come to a screeching halt during market declines. Figure 6 above illustrates this phenomenon during the credit crisis. This naturally reduces the pool of buyers significantly. The simultaneous increased selling by margin investors and reduced buying by companies likely contributed to the violent nature of the last two major market declines (i.e., the tech and housing bubbles). I do not expect this time to be any different.
Conclusions
I have no crystal ball and market dynamics are incredibly complex. The intent of my piece is not to suggest that the world is falling or anything I’ve foreshadowed is guaranteed to happen. This article is simply meant to make you think. My primary goal is to highlight the lack of due diligence that is currently taking place as well as potential implications for investors. The trend toward automated rebalancing strategies and broad market index investing not only enables markets and individual securities to deviate from their fundamentals, but it can also reinforce or exacerbate it (potentially).
In my view, lack of due diligence was the primary driver of the credit crisis. At least then investors demanded some sort of rubber stamp indicating the credit quality. Now they are relying solely on their belief in efficient markets. As sentiment surveys have shown historically, investors’ beliefs can turn on a dime.
Lack of due diligence is not the only similarity between investors today and then. Indeed, the same types of products are surfacing and there is widespread use of leverage in various forms (e.g., 4x leveraged ETFs, VIX-based funds, ETFs of ETFs, etc.). Moreover, there is a significant mismatch between the liquidity of many of these products and their underlying securities.
As I wrote in my previous article Tea Leaves, there are signs that corporate fundamentals and the economy are slowing. Given the backdrop of investor optimism and elevated market valuations, I believe the same market dynamics that helped propel the market to its current state will eventually turn and exacerbate future volatility and accelerate market declines.
I look forward to your comments and thank you for reading.

Technical Note
Index investing has grown significantly in recent years for good reason, but that it not to say it is not without flaws. Below I highlight three subtle, but significant issues with index investing.

Market capitalization weighting: By construction, this type of allocation overweights overpriced and underweights underpriced stocks (I describe this more below and how this phenomenon can reinforce itself). Research studies have shown this bias can impose a drag of 1-2% on more liquid large cap indices and as much as 3% or more on smaller cap and emerging market indices.
Front-running: While transparency is generally a good thing, hedge funds and other professional traders use the transparency of index rules to front-run their trades. Indeed, index rules are well-known, so it is often not difficult to forecast what stocks will go into and out of index-based portfolios. This activity pushes up (down) the prices of stocks index managers will purchase (sell). My research indicates this can impose a performance drag of at least 0.25% on larger, more liquid indices and as much as 2-3% on indices with less liquid constituents and higher turnover.
Free-float adjustment: Skin in the game is a concept many investment managers look for when investing in stocks. Indeed, inside ownership can surely motivate corporate executives to do what is best for a company. However, many of the standard indices adjust their index weights in precisely the opposite direction. This was not the intention of index providers. However, it was a direct result of their attempt to increase the liquidity of their indices by making their relative weights dependent on the amount of shares available to the public (i.e., not held by insiders).





 3. ↑ I am assuming market capitalization weighted index weightings. 4. ↑ 



Technical Note
Not all rebalancing strategies are the same. Below I consider three such approaches and highlight the risks relevant to this context. While the first two may be blind to underlying asset quality and valuation, the third may be more dangerous in that it can systematically exacerbate volatile markets.

Fixed asset allocation: Even if it is brainless to the extent it ignores the quality and valuation of the assets, I believe maintaining a fixed asset allocation is the most benign of the automated rebalancing strategies. As one asset increases and outgrows its percentage allocations, it gets trimmed and reallocated to other assets. In theory, this translates into a contrarian or volatility dampening strategy since it would purchase stocks in a declining market. Unfortunately, it typically constrains the performance of a portfolio over the long term by systematically trimming allocations to the highest growth assets (e.g., stocks).
Age-based asset allocation: There is an old rule of thumb indicating equity allocations should be “100 minus your age”. This naturally ignores all concepts related to the fundamentals and valuations. It does not embed the contrarian nature of fixed asset allocations, but at least does not necessarily pour lighter fluid on fires. However, if the baby-boomer demographic pursues such strategies, this could translate into fewer and fewer equities in their portfolios over the next few decades.
Risk parity: It is worth noting that risk-parity is a relatively newer phenomenon and some of its implementations use volatility controls. These models effectively increase allocations to asset with lower volatilities. In recent years markets have gone up and pushed volatility down. Thus allocations to equities have presumably increased. However, when volatility surfaces (typically the result of a market decline), then these models adjust by reducing allocations to the volatile assets.

These strategies remind of the constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) strategies which were heavily used during the 1980s. CPPI strategies similarly adjusted market exposures based on trailing performance in such a way that market declines triggered more selling. In my view, these dynamics can be quite dangerous. For example, once selling began on Black Monday (October 19, 1987), a vicious cycle ensued and the Dow Jones Industrial Index and S&P 500 both fell by more than 20%. Markets and strategies have evolved since then (e.g., market circuit breakers), but I suspect the chaos that transpired on Monday August 15 of last year is a sign similar risks still lurk beneath the surface of our markets today.



 5. ↑ William Jahnke described in his 1997 paper The Asset Allocation Hoax how many investment managers happily rely on fixed asset allocation strategies since it “conveniently shelters both the consultant and the investment manager from the most important investment decision.” The more general purpose of his paper was to expose the misinterpretation of a previous study than many advisors cited to promote fixed asset allocation strategies. 6. ↑ There appears to be an almost insatiable thirst for bonds regardless of low and even negative yields in some cases. Stocks in aggregate have defied the gravity of lofty valuations for years now. Numerous headlines have highlighted the top-heavy nature of stock returns (e.g., AAPL has contributed 102% of the Dow Jones Industrial performance year-to-date). 7. ↑ Grantham, Mayo, & van Otterloo is a reputable investment firm that has an impressive history of market forecasts.

DrSoul



Very interesting – and sobering – analysis, thank you. FYI, in the second paragraph under the sub-head “Valuations”, I believe the word “expect” should be “except”.






Wesley Gray, PhD



DrSoul, I fixed the typo. thx






Aaron Brask



Thank you for your comment and the heads-up on the typo. There are various forms of leverage embedded in this market. Only time will tell how this impacts things going forward.






G-Man



Wonderful article and analysis, thank you. It makes perfect sense that the liquidity mismatch between those trading the S&P 500 via index funds and the underlying stocks is likely to magnify a market downturn. 
In a gross over simplification the scene from Die Hard With a Vengeance where Bruce Willis had to get exactly 4 gallons of water with only a 5 gallon and 3 gallon jug comes to mind – If he wasn’t able to get the right amount of “liquid[ity]” in time something was going to blow up!






Aaron Brask



Thank you G-man. More generally, I think too many things have been securitized (loans, homes, commercial property, volatility, etc) and sold to RETAIL investors. This can create a feedback mechanism whereby market pain is transferred back into the economy. Volatility spooks retail, they dump, and then transactions occur in the real economy. Banks and loan-markers no longer provide shock absorption.
FWIW – Fill 3 gallon and pour into 5 gallon. Fill 3 gallon again and pour until 5 gallon full (leaving 1 gallon in 3 gallon jug. Empty 5 gallon. Transfer 1 gallon and then add another 3 by filling and transferring from 3 gallon jug.






G-Man



Thanks for the reply (and no surprises that you nailed the riddle too)!
With regard to the technical note on “Free-float adjustment” – I understand this occurred in 2005 for the S&P 500. No problem there, however, I also understand that the historical returns for that index are NOT adjusted to reflect this change – is that correct?! Effectively this results in the elimination of “insider ownership” from the construction of the index – an attribute associated with higher than market returns! 
How much performance (i.e. return) may have been extricated from the S&P 500 in consequence of this change? 
Also how does S&P benefit (financially) by adjusting for the free float – do they charge a few basis points to fund management companies like Vanguard for using their index and therefore benefit from the increased liquidity created by adjusting for the free float? 
Apologies for the questions; it just seems quite material.






Aaron Brask



Free float: Correct, the historical index values do not reflect that change. And yes, I suspect a properly recalculated history integrating FF adjustment would have lower returns.
S&P benefit: Yes, I assume this was a move to remove a bottleneck and enable more AUM and hence more fees. How much they charge various fund managers is private but I think your estimate of a few bps is fair.

Answer 5 quick questions to start.













Question 1
What do you consider your investment style to be?

Conservative
Moderate
Aggressive





Consider risk versus return


Your comfort with risk can depend on your previous investment experience, performance goals, time horizon, and net worth. In general, the higher return you want, the greater risk you'll have to take.

Question 2
If the market sees a big downward swing how would you react?

Do nothing
Invest more



Sell some investments
Sell everything


Pause and reflect


Your risk tolerance is key to deciding on your overall portfolio mix. So even when you know that markets constantly move up and down, you should carefully consider these peaks and valleys - and how much of your total investment you're really willing to risk on a possible long-term downturn.

What is an ETF?










An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a diversified collection of assets (like a mutual fund) that trades on an exchange (like a stock). ETFs are an easy-to-use, low cost and tax efficient way to invest your money.








What are the benefits of ETFs?
 





iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past 5 years1


 




1/3 the price of atypical mutual fund2

1/2 the tax cost of theaverage active mutual fund3



 


Learn more about why to use ETFs.






 






Word on the street

We took to the streets of San Francisco and asked people, "What is an exchange traded fund?" In their words, here's what they had to say.





What is an exchange traded fund






 







Comparing ETFs and mutual funds
Many investors are familiar with mutual funds. How are ETFs similar? And what makes them different?
Hover over the icons to learn more.


Learn more about the differences in investment strategy, fees,and tax implications of ETFs vs mutual funds.







Similarities




Diversification
You get a diversified collection of stocks and/or bonds, which can potentially help reduce risk compared to individual securities.





Professionally managed
The funds are overseen by professional managers.





Risk and reward
The risk profile of an ETF is derived from its underlying holdings, as with mutual funds.



Differences




Cost
ETFs typically cost less than comparable mutual funds (⅓ the cost, on average), and there are no hidden loads or fees. (Your broker may charge a transaction fee, though many iShares ETFs are available commission-free at providers like Fidelity⁴). What’s more, your taxes may be significantly lower: tax costs for iShares ETFs on average are less than ½ those of the average mutual fund³.





Fund performance
Most ETFs seek to closely match the performance of an established stock or bond index, such as the S&P 500 or the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Actively managed mutual funds try to beat the index, which can be hard to do, especially after fees and taxes. iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past five years¹.





Buying and selling
As with stocks, you can buy and sell ETFs at the market price whenever the market is open. Mutual fund shares are purchased directly from the fund at Net Asset Value (NAV) and priced once a day after the market closes.





Knowing what you own
Because ETFs usually aim to track an index, their holdings change relatively little over time – without the “style drift” that may surprise mutual fund investors.

1Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157), and 79.9% (1330/1515) of their active mutual fund peers over the 1, 3, and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For more information on the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds, click here.
2Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. Comparison is between the average Prospectus Net Expense Ratio for the iShares ETFs (0.38%) and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds (1.22%) with 10-year track records that were available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016.
3Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. "Tax Cost Ratio" is a Morningstar measure of the impact of taxes on capital gains and income distributions on performance. The average 10-year Tax Cost Ratio of iShares ETFs and the oldest share class of all actively managed open-end mutual funds available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016 (excluding municipal bond and money market funds) included in the comparison is 0.51% and 1.20%, respectively.
4ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity, if held less than 30 days. Other conditions and fees may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.  BlackRock is not affiliated with Fidelity or any of their affiliates.





 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/ developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.






There is no guarantee that dividends will be paid.






Transactions in shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions and will generate tax consequences. All regulated investment companies are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders.






Certain traditional mutual funds can also be tax efficient.






Investment comparisons are for illustrative purposes only. To better understand the similarities and differences between investments, including investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses, it is important to read the products' prospectuses.






The strategies discussed are strictly for illustrative and educational purposes and are not a recommendation, offer or solicitation to buy or sell any securities or to adopt any investment strategy. There is no guarantee that any strategies discussed will be effective.

ETF Performance










When low cost funds post solid performance, investors keep more of what they earn.






 






Want to keep more of what you earn?

Investment fees and taxes matter. See how much you could save if you invest with iShares ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) versus a typical mutual fund.





Want to keep more of what you earn?








Potential savings
When you combine the impact of lower fees, potential tax savings, and performance that seeks to match an index, ETFs may potentially earn you nearly $56,000 over 10 years.







Chart reflects the hypothetical growth of a fictional investment of $250,000 with an 8% return and assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Fund expenses, including management fees and other expenses have been deducted. The graph is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the performance of any actual fund or investment portfolio.






 




How iShares ETFs can help you keep more





1/3 the cost of a typical mutual fund1:
Most ETFs aim to match the performance of a benchmark index. This strategy generally requires less frequent turnover of holdings within the fund, so fund fees tend to be lower.



1/2 the tax cost of the average active mutual fund2:
When you sell your mutual fund or ETF at a gain, you will have to pay taxes on that gain. But capital gains taxes can be incurred even if you don’t sell your shares, due to trading activity within your fund. Active mutual funds that frequently buy and sell securities are often subject to higher capital gains distributions. Because most ETFs track an index, they tend to generate fewer undesirable capital gains distributions.



Only 18% of active managers beat their benchmarks after fees over the last five years3:
Because of the more frequent trading and complex strategies in actively-managed funds, fund expenses are higher – so performance has to be good enough to compensate for those higher fees.















Percent of comparable mutual funds that iShares Core ETFs outperformed







Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns.

          3. The BlackRock Diversified Income Portfolio is composed of exchange-traded products (ETPs)—primarily exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—but may contain other investment vehicles, such as mutual funds.
	
    

          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities, which may include the risks associated with investing in smaller companies, foreign securities, commodities, and fixed income investments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. ETPs that target a small universe of securities, such as a specific region or market sector, are generally subject to greater market volatility, as well as to the specific risks associated with that sector, region, or other focus. ETPs that use derivatives, leverage, or complex investment strategies are subject to additional risks. The return of an index ETP is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses, and tracking error. An ETP may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV) (or indicative value in the case of exchange-traded notes). The degree of liquidity can vary significantly from one ETP to another and losses may be magnified if no liquid market exists for the ETP's shares when attempting to sell them. Each ETP has a unique risk profile, detailed in its prospectus, offering circular, or similar material, which should be considered carefully when making investment decisions.

Barron’s 2017 Best Online Broker Ranking
Fidelity takes the top spot, with Interactive Brokers and TD Ameritrade right on its heels


 







By

Theresa W. Carey

 Biography




 




March 18, 2017


The bull market is on sale for online brokerage customers. In the run-up to our 22nd annual ranking of Barron’s Best Online Brokers, two developments topped all others: The three major indexes—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500, and the Nasdaq Composite—all set record highs, and six brokers slashed commissions and other fees. At the 16 brokers we reviewed this year, the average monthly cost of trading for an occasional investor had fallen 25% since early 2016, to $47.51 from $63.45. That means...

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
