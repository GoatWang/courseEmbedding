that riding bicycles and electric assist bikes is a common sense 
solution to the ever increasing cost of transportation, heavy traffic 
congestion and will promote a healthier life style for all ages. People 
who ride bikes and electric assist bikes are ultimately more connected 
to their communities       Our pledge
 to The Green Commuter customer and the community is to be a premier 
provider of products and services for commuters who want to reduce their

Green Commuting 






 


One of the easiest ways to go green and save cash is to adjust your daily commute and encourage your employees to do the same.
The easiest way to go green during your commute is to avoid driving whenever possible. Many cities have improved public transportation systems and added more bike trails in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. By choosing one of these alternatives, you will save gas money while greatly reducing the size of your carbon footprint. 
If you don't have an alternative to driving, consider carpooling with a coworker or two. Sharing the ride will drastically reduce the impact on the environment. Don't forget that carpooling has plenty of other benefits as well. You'll have a shorter commute, since you and your carpooler(s) will be able to take advantage of the lanes reserved for high occupancy vehicles. You'll also have more free time during the commute when you're a passenger; you can read, rest or eat breakfast.
Final tip: Whenever possible, work from home and allow your employees to do the same. The greenest commute is no commute at all.
Check out the following links to learn more about commuting options:
Commuter Choice Learn about the commuting options in your community.
Simple Steps for Drivers Learn how every trip you take can affect air quality.
Bicycle Commuting Tips: The City of Boston’s tips are helpful for new and experienced bicycle commuters anywhere in the U.S.
