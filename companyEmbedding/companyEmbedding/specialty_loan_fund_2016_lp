Enhanced Credit Supported Loan Fund




The Enhanced Capital Arch Note, provided by the Enhanced Credit Supported Loan Fund, makes holdco, senior, and junior loans to U.S.-based companies supported by a backstop from a financial sponsor (Private Equity funds, VC funds or Family Offices). The team works closely with sponsors to find creative solutions to provide non-dilutive financings to their portfolio companies to finance growth/change in lieu of using equity.

                    PLEASE READ AND ACCEPT THESE IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES
                



                          You will usually pay brokerage fees to your dealer if you purchase or sell units of the investment fund on the Toronto Stock Exchange or alternative Canadian trading platforms (an “exchange”).  If the units are purchased or sold on an exchange, investors may pay more than the current net asset value when buying units of the investment fund and may receive less than the current net asset value when selling them.
                      

                      	There are ongoing fees and expenses associated with owning units of an investment fund.  An investment fund must prepare disclosure documents that contain key information about the fund.  You can find more detailed information about the fund in the public filings available at www.sedar.com.  The indicated rates of return are the historical annual compounded total returns including changes in unit value and reinvestment of all distributions and do not take into account certain fees such as redemption costs or income taxes payable by any securityholder that would have reduced returns.  Investment funds are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.
                      

                      	This communication is for information purposes only and does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy the securities referred to herein.  The opinions contained in this report are solely those of Goldman Sachs Asset Management L.P. (“GSAM”) and are subject to change without notice. GSAM makes every effort to ensure that the information has been derived from sources believed to reliable and accurate. However, GSAM assumes no responsibility for any losses or damages, whether direct or indirect which arise from the use of this information. GSAM is under no obligation to update the information contained herein. The communication should not be regarded as a substitute for the exercise of your own judgment. Please read the fund’s offering documents before investing.
                      

                      	Certain statements contained in this document constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of Canadian securities laws. Forward-looking information may relate to matters disclosed in this document and to other matters identified in public filings relating to the Fund, to the future outlook of the Fund and anticipated events or results and may include statements regarding the future financial performance of the Fund. In some cases, forward-looking information can be identified by terms such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “expect”, “plan”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “intend”, “estimate”, “predict”, “potential”, “continue” or other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Actual results may vary from such forward-looking information.  Investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements are made as of the date December 15, 2015 and we assume no obligation to update or revise them to reflect new events or circumstances.
                      

                      	Fund holdings and allocations shown are unaudited, and may not be representative of current or future investments, should not be construed and research or investment advice, and are subject to risk.
                      

                      	Any reference to a specific company or security does not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell, hold or directly invest in the company or its securities. It should not be assumed that investment decisions made in the future will be profitable or will equal the performance of the securities discussed in this document.
                      

                      	Portfolio holdings may change by the time you view this. Portfolio holdings may not be representative of future investments.  The securities discussed may not represent all of the portfolio's holdings and may not be deemed representative of the strategy’s future portfolio holdings. Future portfolio holdings may not be profitable.
                      

                      	The portfolio risk management process includes an effort to monitor and manage risk, but does not imply low risk.
                      

                      	No part of this material may, without Brompton and GSAM’s prior written consent, be (i) copied, photocopied or duplicated in any form, by any means, or (ii) distributed to any person that is not an authorized recipient.  This material is intended for Investment Advisor use only.

Underlying Securities information represented above is as of 07/27/2017 but will vary with future fluctuations in the market.












Risk ConsiderationsEquity Risk. An investment in a portfolio containing common stocks is subject to certain risks, such as an economic recession and the possible deterioration of either the financial condition of the issuers of the equity securities or the general condition of the stock market.Sector Concentration Risk. A portfolio which is concentrated in an individual sector is subject to additional risks, including limited diversification.Buy & Hold Risk – Taxable Trusts. This UIT is a buy and hold strategy and investors should consider their ability to hold the trust until maturity. There may be tax consequences unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified plan.Foreign Securities Risk. An investment in securities of foreign issuers should be made with an understanding of the additional risks involved, such as currency fluctuations, political risk, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting foreign issuers.Health Care Risk. The companies engaged in the health care sector are subject to fierce competition, high research and development costs, governmental regulations, loss of patent protection, and changing consumer spending trends. In addition, passage of the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 has had and will continue to have a significant impact on the health care sector.Industrials Risk. The companies engaged in the industrials sector are subject to a deterioration in the general state of the economy, intense competition, domestic and international politics, excess capacity and changing spending trends.Small-Cap and Mid-Cap Risk. An investment in a portfolio containing small-cap and mid-cap companies is subject to additional risks, as the share prices of small-cap companies and certain mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies due to several factors, including limited trading volumes, products, financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.Volatility Risk. The value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers.
All data used for the sector and style classification comparisons is from 
Bloomberg Finance L.P, which we believe to be reliable, but do not take responsibility 
for its accuracy.

The style and capitalization characteristics used to describe the stocks are designed to help you 
understand how they fit into your overall investment plan.  Due to changes in the value of the stocks 
the characteristics may vary over time.  In general, growth stocks have high relative price-to-book 
ratios while value stocks have low relative price-to-book ratios.  In determining market capitalization 
characteristics, we analyze the market capitalizations of the 3,000 largest stocks in the U.S. (excluding 
foreign securities, ADRs, limited partnerships and regulated investment companies) on a monthly basis. 
Companies with market capitalizations among the largest 10% are considered Large-Cap securities, the next 
20% are considered Mid-Cap securities and the remaining securities are considered Small-Cap securities.

You should carefully consider the trust's investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses before investing. Contact your financial advisor or call First Trust Portfolios, L.P. at 1.800.621.1675 to request a prospectus, which contains this and other information about the trust.

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you. Lenders may perform a soft pull of your credit during the free rate quote process. Soft credit pulls have no impact to your credit scores or rating. You must select a rate quote and then finalize your loan directly with the lender with which you have selected. Any credit product for which you apply is solely the product of the lender. Most lenders will perform a hard credit check under the Fair Credit Reporting Act in order to evaluate your request promptly and adequately. Your permission will be asked for prior to any hard credit inquiry being performed. Final rates, terms and fees will be based on your individual credit history and underwritten by the lender NOT 24/7 Lending Group. 24/7 Lending Group cannot guarantee final terms, rates or repayments as they vary by lender. Providing your information on this Website does not guarantee approval for a product offering.  There is no charge to use 24/7 Lending Group service. 24/7 Lending Group may receive compensation from a lender in certain circumstances.
  Rate quotes provided to customers will be no greater than 35.99% APR (APRs include 0-5% origination fees), with terms from 12 to 72 months and available borrowing amounts of $1,000 to $35,000. Representative Personal Loan Example: For a $5,000 36-month loan at an interest rate of 6.03% with a 1.11% origination fee of $55.50, you will receive a loan amount of $4,944.50 and will make 36 monthly payments of about $152.18 at a 6.78% APR.

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you.

There is no charge to use 24/7 Lending Group service. 24/7 Lending Group may receive compensation from a lender in certain circumstances.
  Rate quotes provided to customers will be no greater than 35.99% APR (APRs include 0-5% origination fees), with terms from 12 to 72 months and available borrowing amounts of $1,000 to $35,000. Representative Personal Loan Example: For a $5,000 36-month loan at an interest rate of 6.03% with a 1.11% origination fee of $55.50, you will receive a loan amount of $4,944.50 and will make 36 monthly payments of about $152.18 at a 6.78% APR.
