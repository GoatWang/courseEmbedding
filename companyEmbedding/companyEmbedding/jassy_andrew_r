Blow Away Your Competition by Replacing Your Old CRM Program with the New Customer Relevant Relationship Management (CRRM) Model – Part 2: The Necessary Components.


March 18, 2012
4 Comments






1) Introduction:

In my previous blog, I covered what the new Customer Relevant Relationship Model (CRRM) is and the benefits of adopting this new model. In this blog, I will cover the components of the new CRRM model and what you need to put in place to make this new model a reality.


Ever wonder why companies like ESPN, Apple, Google, Zynga, Amazon, and Marriott dominate their respective markets? The reason is that they are ‘Customer First’ organizations and are passionate about listening to, understanding and then delighting their customers based on leveraging true customer insights. They treat their customers as business partners vs. commodities and include them in many critical decision making processes. They get this new CRRM model. Why/how ? – Read the rest of this blog to find out…


The differences between the old CRM model and how these companies are embracing the newer CRRM model are depicted in the following chart:

The Old CRM Model vs. New CRRM Model – Customers as Business Partners
2) Customers are fed up with old Dictatorial Management Style & Want to be Empowered as Business Partners
Customers and stakeholders today are longing for a company to partner with them and include them in the corporate decision making process.  These same constituencies are sick and tired of political, corporate, and other organizations making unilateral decisions for them that are really not in-line with their needs,  wants, etc. The backlash from this unwanted dictatorial management style of some companies can be seen in the Bank of America fee customer rebellion, the customer backlash from Netflix deciding to  split their company without first consulting with their customers and HPs initial decision to exit the computer market.
3) Components of the New CRRM Model:
In order to progress your organization from the old CRM model to the new CRRM  model, a few key essentials must be put in place and are as follows:
A. New CRRM Model that includes the 360° Cultivation of Customer & Market Insights.  This model enables a 360° view of all customer and market insights including customer feedback, preferences, likes, dislikes, social sentiment, competitor activity, etc. This new model takes your insights to an entirely new level whereby you are now enabled to delight customers, stakeholders and stockholders by having insights that are light-years ahead of insights provided by a traditional CRM model.

B. Customer First Culture driven by management that is passionate about their customers including a set of customer first principles and guidelines developed by company leaders

C. Customer Ratings & Feedback Structure that will identify areas where you will collect customer 360° feedback from customer and stakeholder interactions

D. Customer Feedback & Preferences Cultivation Process and corresponding infrastructure in order to allow your customers to continually rate how well you are serving them

E. Customer Health Scorecard that provides real-time insights on how well the customers, stakeholders and stockholders perceives you as serving them as well as insights into a Continuous Customer Improvement Process (CCIP) that enables you to continually improve your customer perceptions, satisfaction, brand loyalty, etc.
These components can apply to large enterprises as well as Small to Medium Businesses (SMBs).
The following graphics are all sample components from the list above (A-D) that need to be put in place to enable this new CRRM Model.


New CRRM Model – 360° Cultivation of Customer & Market Insights


 3A) The above chart “New CRRM Model – 360 Cultivation of Customer & Market Insights” demonstrates the new insights model that must be put in place to deliver world-class stakeholder and customer programs. 
These enhanced insights will enable you to deliver products and services that delight your customers, stakeholders and stockholders as well as enable you to leapfrog the competition in terms of market share if they continue to rely on their antiquated CRM data and analytics insights only model.  
For Small to Medium sized Businesses (SMBs), some of the insights do not apply, but the following charts (3B-3E) most certainly apply and can be tracked via simple Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.



CRRM Customer First Policies & Organizational Principles
3B) The above chart “CRRM Organizational Guiding Principles” demonstrates the principles that must be in-place to be customer first culture. This culture is driven by management that is passionate about their customers and governs the company around a set of customer first policies.
Sample Enterprise CRRM Customer Rating & Feedback Structure
3C) The above chart “Enterprise CRRM Customer Rating & Feedback Structure” illustrates a sample structure (will vary for each type of business) whereby customer feedback and preferences will be cultivated in order to develop 360° insights into customer needs, wants, likes, etc.
Enterprise CRRM Customer Feedback & Preferences Cultivation Process
3D) The above chart “CRRM Customer Ratings & Feedback Cultivation Process” illustrates a how customer feedback and preferences will be cultivated in order to develop 360° insights into customer needs, wants, likes, etc.
Sample Enterprise CRRM Customer Scorecard Ratings Visualization
3E) The above chart “Enterprise CRRM Customer Scorecard Ratings Visualization” illustrates a how customer feedback and preferences ratings will be visually represented in a scorecard. 
Sample Enterprise CRRM Customer Scorecard Metrics
3E-2) The above chart “Enterprise CRRM Customer Scorecard” illustrates a how customer feedback and preferences ratings will be rolled up into an analytical scorecard that provides insights into customer trends,  customer feedback, customer issues, core customer strengths and weaknesses, etc. 
This scorecard can also be used to manage a Continuous Customer Improvement Process (CCIP) that continually drives improvements to customer perceptions, ratings, satisfaction, etc. 
Sample Scorecard for “Shopping Experience”
The above depicts how analytics and metrics would be maintained for a business who had a retail or wholesale shopping function.
Sample Shopping Experience Scorecard – #2
Robust Scorecard Analytics and Metrics should support Customer Trend Identification and Root Cause Analysis for Customer Issues.
Sample Branding & Public Relations Scorecard
Sample Public Relations Scorecard Above gives you insights into how well your company and brands are perceived by customers, stakeholders, stockholders, etc. 
Sample Customer Service Scorecard
Sample Customer Scorecard Above from Customer Service tells how well you are serving your customers.
Sample Marketing Scorecard
Sample Marketing Scorecard Above Gives you insights into how well your Marketing Efforts are resonating with your customers.
Sample Product Management Scorecard
The Sample Product Management Scorecard above gives you insights into how well perceived your products and services are with customers and prospects.
4) Company & Customer Benefits of Adopting the CRRM Model:
By treating customers as business partners (vs. commodities) and including them in the corporate decision making process, as well as allowing them to rate how well you are serving them from an array of customer facing areas, companies can reap huge rewards including the following:
1. Better insights into the types of products and services customers want & need
2. Fiercely loyal customers who feel part of the corporate team
3. Customers who are most likely to spend more, be retained longer and purchase at premium prices with higher profit margins
4. Customers who are very likely to be brand advocates and refer others to your company, brands, and services.
5. Customers who feel connected to the company and empowered to improve company operations
The following are actual customer comments from those who have participated in a customer feedback program to help shape products & services:
“I feel like xyz company cares about me since they ask my opinion”
“Finally a company that listens to us”
“It is so refreshing to have a company ask you your opinions on products and services vs. ramming something down our throats that we don’t like”
“Wow – this is fun. I enjoy providing my opinion”
“As silly as this might sound, xyz company is the only company that ever asked me what I wanted”
“In my opinion, xyz company is much more progressive than their competitors by seeking consumer opinions, what matters to them, etc. 
 5) Conclusion:
More dynamic companies like Goodle, Zynga, Amazon, etc. are inviting customers to become part of the corporate decision making process and empowering them to provide feedback, insights and rate company operations in order to drive continous customer improvements. Companies who adopt this new CRRM model whereby company management is democratized by including stakeholders and customers into the decision making process will reap the rewards of ever higher customer acquisition, retention and spend – leading to ever higher profits and share price.

                The Top 4 Amazon Shareholders (AMZN)            


    By Craig Anthony | Updated July 18, 2017 — 8:49 AM EDT    






Share





















































Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) seems to be on everyone's lips these days. The stock recently hit an all time high when the share price passed $1,000 for the first time in June, and has hovered around there since. A few weeks later it was announced it had acquired the organic grocery chain Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NASDAQ: WFM) for $13.7 billion. While some investors are clenching their fists for not getting on the Amazon ride early enough, others are probably pretty happy right about now. (See also: If You Had Invested Right After Amazon's IPO )
The company was founded in July 1994 by Jeffrey Bezos, initially only as an online bookstore. As the company evolved, it began selling DVDs, CDs, and streaming music and video services. It then began offering a wide variety of products such as cloud storage, video games, software and electronics, clothing, toys and food. In fact, there are few things you can't get on Amazon. According to the company's 2016 financials, it employed approximately 341,400 people, had revenues of $136 billion and was the largest Internet-based retailer in the United States.
Per its corporate filings in May 2017, Jeff Bezos, Andrew R. Jassy, Jeffrey M. Blackburn and Jeffrey A. Wilke were its four largest individual shareholders.
Jeff Bezos
The number-one shareholder in the company, with approximately 79.9 million shares, is Amazon's chief executive officer (CEO) and founder, Jeff Bezos. Bezos was born in 1964 in Albuquerque, New Mexico and studied computer science and electrical engineering at Princeton University. Upon graduating, Bezos went to work for the Wall Street firm D.E. Shaw, becoming the youngest senior vice president in its history. He left the company and started Amazon in 1994, initially setting up the company in his garage in Seattle. After Bezos and a few employees wrote the software for Amazon, the company began to make $20,000 per week, selling products in 45 different countries. In September 2000, Bezos also founded an aerospace manufacturer and spaceflight company called Blue Origin. In 2013, Bezos paid $250 million for the Washington Post. As of May 2017, Bezos was reportedly worth $84.8 billion.
Andrew R. Jassy
With over 77,000 shares, Andrew R. Jassy is Amazon's second-largest individual shareholder. Jassy is the CEO of Amazon Web Services, a subsidiary of Amazon that offers various cloud computing services across the globe. Before Jassy became the CEO of Amazon Web Services on April 13, 2016, he served as senior vice president of the group. With a team of 57 people, Jassy founded Amazon Web Services in 2003 and helped it grow into a $6 billion company with 1 million users in 190 different countries. He attended Harvard University, earning a bachelor's degree and master's of business administration (MBA). Prior to joining Amazon, he worked at Coupa Software Inc. and founded a marketing consulting company, serving as its manager.
Jeffrey M. Blackburn
Jeffrey M. Blackburn is the senior vice president of business development and digital entertainment Amazon.com, and has been at the company since 1998. He is also the head of Amazon's M&A, investments and strategic business development worldwide. Blackburn is the third-largest individual shareholder with his 49,700 shares. Prior to joining Amazon he was an associate at both Deutche Bank and Morgan Stanley in Silicon Valley. At Deutche he worked on Amazon's IPO. He holds his undergraduate degree from Darthmouth College and an MBA from Stanford University. 
Jeffrey A. Wilke
Jeffrey A. Wilke is Amazon's fourth-largest individual shareholder, with 10,000 shares. Since April 2016, Wilke has served as CEO of Amazon's worldwide consumer business. Prior to this role, Wilke served as senior vice president in the consumer business, North American retail and worldwide operations groups at Amazon. Wilke obtained a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Princeton University and an MBA and master's in chemical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He worked as a general manager of the pharmaceutical fine chemicals group at AlliedSignal, as well as the general manager of carbon materials and technology. Wilke spent five years working in leadership roles in the chemical, polymer and electronics industries.

  About AWS 


 Create Free Account »





In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses in the form of web services -- now commonly known as cloud computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace up-front capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business. With the Cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster.
Today, Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world. With data center locations in the U.S., Europe, Brazil, Singapore, Japan, and Australia, customers across all industries are taking advantage of the following benefits:






  Low Cost 





AWS offers low, pay-as-you-go pricing with no up-front expenses or long-term commitments. We are able to build and manage a global infrastructure at scale, and pass the cost saving benefits onto you in the form of lower prices. With the efficiencies of our scale and expertise, we have been able to lower our prices on 15 different occasions over the past four years. Visit the Economics Center to learn more. 





  Agility and Instant Elasticity 





AWS provides a massive global cloud infrastructure that allows you to quickly innovate, experiment and iterate. Instead of waiting weeks or months for hardware, you can instantly deploy new applications, instantly scale up as your workload grows, and instantly scale down based on demand. Whether you need one virtual server or thousands, whether you need them for a few hours or 24/7, you still only pay for what you use. Visit the Architecture Center to learn more. 





  Open and Flexible 





AWS is a language and operating system agnostic platform. You choose the development platform or programming model that makes the most sense for your business. You can choose which services you use, one or several, and choose how you use them. This flexibility allows you to focus on innovation, not infrastructure. Download the AWS Overview Whitepaper.  





  Secure 





AWS is a secure, durable technology platform with industry-recognized certifications and audits: PCI DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, FISMA Moderate, FedRAMP, HIPAA, and SOC 1 (formerly referred to as SAS 70 and/or SSAE 16) and SOC 2 audit reports. Our services and data centers have multiple layers of operational and physical security to ensure the integrity and safety of your data.  Visit the Security Center to learn more. 








  Solutions 





The AWS cloud computing platform provides the flexibility to launch your application regardless of your use case or industry. Learn more about popular solutions customers are running on AWS: 









  Application Hosting 





Use reliable, on-demand infrastructure to power your applications, from hosted internal applications to SaaS offerings.









  Websites 





Satisfy your dynamic web hosting needs with AWS’s scalable infrastructure platform.













  Backup and Storage 





Store data and build dependable backup solutions using AWS’s inexpensive data storage services. 









  Enterprise IT 





Host internal- or external-facing IT applications in AWS's secure environment. 













  Content Delivery 





Quickly and easily distribute content to end users worldwide, with low costs and high data transfer speeds. 









  Databases 





Take advantage of a variety of scalable database solutions, from hosted enterprise database software or non-relational database solutions. 












  Get Started 






  Step 1: Sign up for AWS 






By signing up for AWS, you have access to Amazon’s cloud computing services. Note: The sign-up process requires a credit card, which will not be charged until you start using services. There are no long-term commitments and you can stop using AWS at any time. 






  Step 2: Launch an Application 






To start using AWS for web hosting, watch this 10 minute video to help you get started in the cloud. This video will show you how to use a CloudFormation template to quickly launch a WordPress website on AWS, or:
Find developer tools, sample applications, and technical documentation in our Resource Center, or:
Use the point-and-click AWS Management Console to launch and manage your cloud resources.
