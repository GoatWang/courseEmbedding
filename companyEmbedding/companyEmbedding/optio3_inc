          1. Based on data from RegOne Technologies for SEC Rule 605 eligible orders executed at Fidelity between April 1, 2015 and March 31, 2016. The comparison is based on an analysis of price statistics that include marketable orders: market orders and limit orders at the National Best Bid and offer (NBBO), between 100 – 1,999 shares, excluding orders with special handling instructions and order sizes greater than 2,000 shares. A data range of 100 – 499 shares is used for the 100 shares order size and a data range of 100 – 1,999 shares is used for the 1,000 shares order size. Average price improvement for order sizes outside of these data ranges will vary. Fidelity's average retail order size for SEC Rule 605 eligible orders during this time period was 438 shares, or 928 shares when including block trades. Price improvement examples are based on averages and any price improvement amounts related to your trades will depend on the particulars of your specific trade

Core position



Uninvested cash

Uninvested cash in your account is held in what is known as a core position. Think of your core position as a place where money is held before you invest it or distribute it from your account. For the Fidelity Account®, you may choose one of many core positions:

Fidelity Government Money Market Fund (SPAXX), a taxable mutual fund normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. Government securities and related debt, and related repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. Intended for investors seeking as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.*
Fidelity Treasury Money Market Fund (FLTXX), a taxable mutual fund normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. Treasury securities and related repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. Intended for investors seeking as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.*



							
								*
							
							
								
					
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Fidelity’s government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.

Trading Earnings Optimism With Options in Avon Products Inc





Avon Products Inc (NYSE:AVP) : Trading Earnings Optimism With Options
	Date Published:
	
		2017-07-26	


PREFACE

There is a powerful pattern of optimism and momentum in Avon Products Inc (NYSE:AVP)  stock right before of earnings, and we can capture that pattern by looking at returns in the option market. 	
		The strategy won't work forever, but for now it is a momentum play that has not only returned 171% annualized returns, but has also shown a high win-rate of 63%.		
PREMISE

		The premise is simple -- one of the least recognized but most important phenomena surrounding this bull market is the amount of optimism, or upward momentum, that sets in the two-weeks before an earnings announcement. 
		
				That is, totally irrespective of whether the stocks have a history of beating earnings, in the two-weeks before of earnings, several of them tend to rally abruptly into the event. There has been a way to profit from this pattern without taking any actual earnings risk -- and it is very powerful in Avon Products Inc.
				








Option trading isn't about luck -- this four minute video will change your trading life forever:  Option Trading and Truth


The Options Optimism Trade Before Earnings in Avon Products Inc

		Let's look at the results of buying a monthly call option in Avon Products Inc two-weeks before earnings and selling the call before the earnings announcement. 
		
		Here's the set-up in great clarity; again, note that the trade closes before earnings, so this trade does not make a bet on the earnings result. 
		



			
		Here are the results over the last two-years in Avon Products Inc: 
		




AVP: Long Call





% Wins:
63%





Wins:
							5

Losses:
							3





% Return:
 52.5% 





% Annualized:
 171% 






		We see a 52.5% return, testing this over the last 8 earnings dates in Avon Products Inc. That's a total of just 112 days (14 days for each earnings date, over 8 earnings dates).  That's an annualized rate of 171%. That's the power of following the trend of optimism into earnings -- and never even worrying about the actual earnings result. 
		
		
					We can also see that this strategy hasn't been a winner all the time, rather it has won 5 times and lost 3 times, for a 63% win-rate and again, that 52.5% return in less than six-full months of trading. 
				
				
		The trade will lose sometimes, but over the most recent trading history, this momentum and optimism options trade has won ahead of earnings.		
		



WHAT HAPPENED

						Bull markets have quirks, or personalities if you like. 
				
			
		The personality of this bull market is one that shows optimism before earnings -- irrespective of the actual earnings result. That has been a tradable phenomenon in Avon Products Inc.

          1. Based on data from RegOne Technologies for SEC Rule 605 eligible orders executed at Fidelity between April 1, 2015 and March 31, 2016. The comparison is based on an analysis of price statistics that include marketable orders: market orders and limit orders at the National Best Bid and offer (NBBO), between 100 – 1,999 shares, excluding orders with special handling instructions and order sizes greater than 2,000 shares. A data range of 100 – 499 shares is used for the 100 shares order size and a data range of 100 – 1,999 shares is used for the 1,000 shares order size. Average price improvement for order sizes outside of these data ranges will vary. Fidelity's average retail order size for SEC Rule 605 eligible orders during this time period was 438 shares, or 928 shares when including block trades. Price improvement examples are based on averages and any price improvement amounts related to your trades will depend on the particulars of your specific trade

You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Fidelity’s government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.

Barron’s 2017 Best Online Broker Ranking
Fidelity takes the top spot, with Interactive Brokers and TD Ameritrade right on its heels

Theresa W. Carey

 Biography




 




March 18, 2017


The bull market is on sale for online brokerage customers. In the run-up to our 22nd annual ranking of Barron’s Best Online Brokers, two developments topped all others: The three major indexes—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500, and the Nasdaq Composite—all set record highs, and six brokers slashed commissions and other fees. At the 16 brokers we reviewed this year, the average monthly cost of trading for an occasional investor had fallen 25% since early 2016, to $47.51 from $63.45. That means...

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
