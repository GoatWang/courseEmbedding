The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Our Approach

Investment Philosophy and Process
SkyBridge believes that a fund of hedge funds manager must employ a repeatable investment process to achieve risk-adjusted return targets and to preserve capital. SkyBridge takes an active and multi-dimensional approach to portfolio construction, seeking non-correlated risk exposures in an effort to minimize volatility and maximize return. Investments are supported by risk management, operational due diligence and an ongoing monitoring process. Importantly, hedge fund investing is inherently speculative and there can be no guarantees of success.

Our Team



Investment Team
SkyBridge’s investment team is led by Ray Nolte, CIO, and the Portfolio Managers. The investment team has managed the fund of hedge funds with the same investment process since 2005 (at the previous investment manager). Our research analysts cover the four major hedge fund strategies including Relative Value Arbitrage, Event Driven, Directional Macro and Directional Equity.
Operational Due Diligence
SkyBridge’s operational due diligence team is comprised of three individuals with over 30 years of combined experience analyzing hedge funds. The operational due diligence process is separate from the investment due diligence process, and the team reports directly to the CIO. The operational due diligence team has veto power over the investment due diligence team.
Investment Due Diligence
The investment due diligence team is led by the CIO. Each SkyBridge product or service is led by a Senior Portfolio Manager and a Portfolio Manager who are responsible for managing fund sourcing, research, monitoring and due diligence.  Additionally, the Portfolio Managers are responsible for applicable portfolio rebalancing activity.
Risk Management
The risk management team has experience spanning many market cycles. The team is attentive to anticipated performance of fund investments given the hedge fund strategy employed, and continually reviews an underlying manager’s internal capabilities and risk framework infrastructure.

History[edit]
SkyBridge Capital was founded in 2005 with a focus on hedge fund seeding. Anthony Scaramucci was previously the co-founder of Oscar Capital Management, which was sold to Neuberger Berman in 2001. Upon Neuberger Berman's sale to Lehman Brothers in 2003, Scaramucci served as managing director in their Investment Management division. Scaramucci also served as a vice president in Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management group.[6]
In May 2008, SkyBridge formed a strategic partnership with Challenger Financial Services Group Limited, forming the first global institutional emerging manager seeding platform. Additionally, Challenger supports SkyBridge in the Australasia region to source new capital and managers.[7] In April 2010, the firm announced it opened an office in Zürich, Switzerland.[8]
In June 2010, SkyBridge acquired Citigroup Alternative Investments Hedge Fund Management Group and Ray Nolte, joined as co-managing partner and chief investment officer. Nolte was previously the chief executive officer and chief investment officer of the Citigroup Alternative Investments Hedge Fund Management Group. Earlier, he held positions at Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust Company.[9][10] Sadis & Goldberg advised on this transaction.[11]
On July 9, 2013, SkyBridge Capital formed a strategic partnership with Seoul-based Woori Investment & Securities to distribute SkyBridge's hedge funds-of-funds products in Korea and other parts of Asia.[12]
In May 2014, SkyBridge acquired the rights to Wall Street Week, an investment news show that debuted in 1970.[13] The company is reintroducing the show with CNBC's Susan Krakower and Raymond Borelli overseeing its development with Scaramucci as the host. In March 2015, the company opened its third office in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.[14] The company is also the title sponsor of West Palm Beach's inaugural bike share program, SkyBike.[15]
On January 17, 2017, SkyBridge announced that it had signed a definitive purchase agreement with RON Transatlantic and HNA Capital U.S., with the firm continuing to be led by its current senior management team. Its full investment team will remain intact, though founder Scaramucci will step down immediately from his co-managing partnership and no longer maintain affiliation with the firm or the SALT conference. George Hornig, CEO of RON Transatlantic, was announced as joining the SkyBridge board. The transaction is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2017.[4]
SALT Conference[edit]
SkyBridge Capital hosts a large investment conference, known as the SkyBridge Alternatives (SALT) conference, biannually in the U.S. and Asia.[16] The first SALT conference was held in May 2009 in Las Vegas, Nevada and convened 500 asset managers, investors and other industry thought leaders.[17] The flagship conference has grown to include participation by over 1,800 thought decision makers, industry experts, finance professionals and members of the alternative investment community.[18] SALT's mission has been described as being committed to facilitating balanced discussions and debates on macro-economic trends, geo-political events and alternative investment opportunities within the context of a dynamic global economy.[18][19]
Featured speakers have included Ehud Barak, Tony Blair,[20] Gordon Brown, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton,[21] Izzy Englander, Timothy Geithner, Al Gore,[20] Ken Griffin, Valerie Jarrett,[22] Lim Hng Kiang, Kenneth Langone, Jin Liqun,[23] Dan Loeb, Michael Milken, Al Pacino, Leon Panetta, David H. Petraeus, John Paulson,[24] Colin Powell, Wolfgang Puck, Mitt Romney, Don Brownstein,[25] David M. Rubenstein,[22] Nicholas Sarkozy, Paul Singer, Tharman Shanmugaratnam,[26] Oliver Stone, Lawrence H. Summers, David Tepper[27] and Jean Claude Trichet. SALT Asia was first held in October 2012, at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore.[20] It was held again with 1,000 participants at the Marina Bay Sands September 24–27, 2013.[23]
Following its May 16–19, 2017 events in Las Vegas, the SALT Conference is to become a standalone entity.[4]

History[edit]
SkyBridge Capital was founded in 2005 with a focus on hedge fund seeding. Anthony Scaramucci was previously the co-founder of Oscar Capital Management, which was sold to Neuberger Berman in 2001. Upon Neuberger Berman's sale to Lehman Brothers in 2003, Scaramucci served as managing director in their Investment Management division. Scaramucci also served as a vice president in Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management group.[6]
In May 2008, SkyBridge formed a strategic partnership with Challenger Financial Services Group Limited, forming the first global institutional emerging manager seeding platform. Additionally, Challenger supports SkyBridge in the Australasia region to source new capital and managers.[7] In April 2010, the firm announced it opened an office in Zürich, Switzerland.[8]
In June 2010, SkyBridge acquired Citigroup Alternative Investments Hedge Fund Management Group and Ray Nolte, joined as co-managing partner and chief investment officer. Nolte was previously the chief executive officer and chief investment officer of the Citigroup Alternative Investments Hedge Fund Management Group. Earlier, he held positions at Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust Company.[9][10] Sadis & Goldberg advised on this transaction.[11]
On July 9, 2013, SkyBridge Capital formed a strategic partnership with Seoul-based Woori Investment & Securities to distribute SkyBridge's hedge funds-of-funds products in Korea and other parts of Asia.[12]
In May 2014, SkyBridge acquired the rights to Wall Street Week, an investment news show that debuted in 1970.[13] The company is reintroducing the show with CNBC's Susan Krakower and Raymond Borelli overseeing its development with Scaramucci as the host. In March 2015, the company opened its third office in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.[14] The company is also the title sponsor of West Palm Beach's inaugural bike share program, SkyBike.[15]
On January 17, 2017, SkyBridge announced that it had signed a definitive purchase agreement with RON Transatlantic and HNA Capital U.S., with the firm continuing to be led by its current senior management team. Its full investment team will remain intact, though founder Scaramucci will step down immediately from his co-managing partnership and no longer maintain affiliation with the firm or the SALT conference. George Hornig, CEO of RON Transatlantic, was announced as joining the SkyBridge board. The transaction is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2017.[4]
SALT Conference[edit]
SkyBridge Capital hosts a large investment conference, known as the SkyBridge Alternatives (SALT) conference, biannually in the U.S. and Asia.[16] The first SALT conference was held in May 2009 in Las Vegas, Nevada and convened 500 asset managers, investors and other industry thought leaders.[17] The flagship conference has grown to include participation by over 1,800 thought decision makers, industry experts, finance professionals and members of the alternative investment community.[18] SALT's mission has been described as being committed to facilitating balanced discussions and debates on macro-economic trends, geo-political events and alternative investment opportunities within the context of a dynamic global economy.[18][19]
Featured speakers have included Ehud Barak, Tony Blair,[20] Gordon Brown, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton,[21] Izzy Englander, Timothy Geithner, Al Gore,[20] Ken Griffin, Valerie Jarrett,[22] Lim Hng Kiang, Kenneth Langone, Jin Liqun,[23] Dan Loeb, Michael Milken, Al Pacino, Leon Panetta, David H. Petraeus, John Paulson,[24] Colin Powell, Wolfgang Puck, Mitt Romney, Don Brownstein,[25] David M. Rubenstein,[22] Nicholas Sarkozy, Paul Singer, Tharman Shanmugaratnam,[26] Oliver Stone, Lawrence H. Summers, David Tepper[27] and Jean Claude Trichet. SALT Asia was first held in October 2012, at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore.[20] It was held again with 1,000 participants at the Marina Bay Sands September 24–27, 2013.[23]
Following its May 16–19, 2017 events in Las Vegas, the SALT Conference is to become a standalone entity.[4]

Risk ConsiderationsEquity Risk. An investment in a portfolio containing common stocks is subject to certain risks, such as an economic recession and the possible deterioration of either the financial condition of the issuers of the equity securities or the general condition of the stock market.Sector Concentration Risk. A portfolio which is concentrated in an individual sector is subject to additional risks, including limited diversification.Consumer Products Risk. The companies engaged in the consumer products sector are subject to global competition, changing government regulations and trade policies, currency fluctuations, and the financial and political risks inherent in producing products for foreign markets.Foreign Securities Risk. An investment in securities of foreign issuers should be made with an understanding of the additional risks involved, such as currency fluctuations, political risk, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting foreign issuers.IRA Risk. There may be tax consequences unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified plan.Small-Cap and Mid-Cap Risk. An investment in a portfolio containing small-cap and mid-cap companies is subject to additional risks, as the share prices of small-cap companies and certain mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies due to several factors, including limited trading volumes, products, financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.Volatility Risk. The value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers.
All data used for the sector and style classification comparisons is from 
Bloomberg Finance L.P, which we believe to be reliable, but do not take responsibility 
for its accuracy.

The style and capitalization characteristics used to describe the stocks are designed to help you 
understand how they fit into your overall investment plan.  Due to changes in the value of the stocks 
the characteristics may vary over time.  In general, growth stocks have high relative price-to-book 
ratios while value stocks have low relative price-to-book ratios.  In determining market capitalization 
characteristics, we analyze the market capitalizations of the 3,000 largest stocks in the U.S. (excluding 
foreign securities, ADRs, limited partnerships and regulated investment companies) on a monthly basis. 
Companies with market capitalizations among the largest 10% are considered Large-Cap securities, the next 
20% are considered Mid-Cap securities and the remaining securities are considered Small-Cap securities.

Although the portfolio terminates in approximately one year, the strategy is long-term. Investors 
should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios, if available. There 
may be tax consequences unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified plan. 

You should carefully consider the trust's investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses before investing. Contact your financial advisor or call First Trust Portfolios, L.P. at 1.800.621.1675 to request a prospectus, which contains this and other information about the trust. Read it carefully before you invest.
