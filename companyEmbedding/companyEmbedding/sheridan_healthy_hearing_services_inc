Common Questions About The Hearing Screen



IS THE HEARING SCREEN NECESSARY?

Yes, Newborn Hearing screening is state mandated and identifies potential hearing loss beginning at birth.



WHY SHOULD MY BABY BE SCREENED IN THE HOSPITAL?

The ability to hear is the foundation of your baby’s ability to learn, so it’s important to identify any problems just as soon as possible. Newborn hearing screening can detect possible hearing loss in the first days of your baby’s life. If a possible hearing loss is found, further tests will be done to confirm the results.



HOW WILL MY BABY’S SCREENING BE DONE?

The screen takes 15 minutes or less.
It is completely painless and safe for your baby.
The screen is done in the patient room, the nursery, or a quiet room.
It is usually done while your baby is asleep.
If your baby passes, no further screening is necessary.



IS THE HEARING SCREEN SAFE?

The hearing screen is painless and safe for your baby. Three patches are placed on the baby’s forehead and behind the ears. Small earphones are placed in your baby’s ears that transmit soft sounds into each ear. The computer measures the hearing nerves’ pathways to those sounds.



WHAT IS A HEARING SCREEN VS. A DIAGNOSTIC TEST?

A hearing screen determines whether your baby will need further testing for hearing loss. Diagnostic testing can establish whether there is hearing loss, how much hearing loss is present, and whether it is correctable.



WHAT EQUIPMENT IS USED FOR THE SCREEN?

Sheridan uses the Automated Auditory Brainstem Response (AABR) screen. AABR is recommended by national regulatory agencies for providing hearing screens to NICU babies.
For AABR, small sensors are placed on your baby's forehead and behind the ears. Small earphones are placed in your baby's ears, and your baby will hear soft sounds in each ear at a low volume.
When hearing these sounds, your baby’s brain responses are measured by a computer, which interprets how your baby hears the sounds.



WHY DO SOME BABIES NOT PASS THE HEARING TEST?

Fluid in the middle ear.
Debris like vernix or other fluids from birth in the ear canal.
The room may be too noisy.
The baby is restless (moving or crying) during the screen.
Possible hearing loss.



WHY DIDN’T MY BABY PASS THE HEARING SCREEN?

Infants can “refer” for many reasons and it does not necessarily mean that your baby has a hearing impairment. A “referred” screen means there is a need for further evaluation.



WHAT DOES A “FAMILY HISTORY” OF HEARING LOSS MEAN?

Family history refers to any person in your immediate or extended family that was born with hearing loss or developed hearing loss at a young age.



HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?

You may be responsible for part of the cost depending on your insurance coverage. If you have any billing questions, please call our billing office (800) 224-0859

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart
                            

                                N
                            

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.

Hear We Grow



The ability to hear is the foundation of your baby's ability to learn. It’s very important to identify any hearing problems as soon as possible. Sheridan's Healthy Hearing™ newborn hearing screening program has partnered with your hospital to perform your baby's first routine hearing screen.
WHY IS THE HEARING SCREEN SO IMPORTANT?
HEARING MILESTONES – NORMAL AUDITORY DEVELOPMENT
Birth to 4 months

Reacts to sudden, loud sounds
Eyes may widen or blink
Arms may fling out
A sleepy baby may move or begin to wake
Soothed and comforted by your voice

3 to 6 months

Turns eyes and head to look for interesting sounds when name is called
Enjoys music and noise-making toys
Begins to coo and gurgle to repeat sounds

6 to 10 months

Localizes interesting sounds
Responds to own name and looks when called
Responds to familiar voices and sounds such as a telephone ring or a barking dog
Should make a different babbling sound
Understands simple words such as "no" and "bye-bye"

Babies begin learning through their sense of hearing even before they’re born, and the first few months of life are especially important to their development. Most infants have no hearing problems, but for those that do, early screening and intervention can make a big difference in language and social development. 

Children learn to talk by imitating the sounds of voices around them.
Communicating with your baby plants the seed for strong language development.
The more age-appropriate sensory input a child receives, the greater the development of complex brain connections and language skills.
One to three out of every 1,000 newborns has some degree of hearing loss.
Around 95 percent of babies with hearing loss are born to hearing parents.
More than 95 percent of newborns in the U.S. have their hearing screened.
A hearing screen is a simple, non-invasive way to know if your baby can hear well, or if more testing is needed.

					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.

Doctor Follow-up



Following Up With Your Doctor

If your baby doesn't pass the first hearing screen, follow up with your baby's doctor at your next appointment. 
Your baby should be tested in a week or two or referred to an audiologist (a hearing expert). 
An audiologist will conduct a more comprehensive diagnostic exam to identify any issues.
It's important that your baby is scheduled for a repeat screen within the first month of life.



What Should I Do With The Results?

Bring a copy to the pediatrician or audiologist so that they are aware of the results. It is important to monitor developmental milestones for hearing, language, and speech.



When Will My Baby Need To See An Audiologist?

If your baby receives a “refer” result, you should schedule a diagnostic audiology evaluation with an audiologist within 3 months to determine if your baby has hearing loss. Audiologists diagnose and treat hearing disorders and may recommend treatment for your baby if hearing loss is detected.
Early intervention is vital to your baby’s auditory development, which affects speech, language, and social development. If your baby receives a “refer” result, it is important to schedule a repeat screen with your pediatrician and/or audiologist.
