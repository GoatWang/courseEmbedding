Short-Term Fixed Income
Investment Philosophy
Sawgrass Asset Management’s active short-term fixed income product has applied a disciplined and defined investment philosophy since its inception. This strategy focuses primarily on controlled duration management of investment grade securities and secondarily on strategic sector valuations and specific security analysis. This portfolio has an effective duration that ranges from 2-3 years and an average maturity that ranges from 2-4 years. There are currently no sector constraints. The investable universe consists of U.S. dollar-denominated government, high quality corporate and mortgage-backed securities. The goal of this product is to generate investment returns which exceed 1-year Treasury Bills by 100 basis points over a market cycle. The current benchmark is the Merrill Lynch 1-5 Year Gov’t/Corp Index. Sawgrass also manages this product to a customized short-term index when appropriate.
