Microprocessor Knees



Microprocessors provide a more sophisticated method of control to a prosthetic knee. These more complex knee joints are designed to help you walk with a much more stable and efficient gait that more closely resembles a natural walking pattern.












Elevated Vacuum



A mechanical or electric pump that creates suction on the residual limb to improve circulation, reduce forces and decrease volumetric changes. The use of elevated vacuum in a prosthetic socket provides outstanding security and reliability.












Running Feet



The running foot allows runners and sprinters to experience technology that advances energy return, allowing them to run with less effort.












Smart Ankle



The ankle-foot adjusts to changes in walking speed and terrain on the fly and, with a built-in relief function, even makes standing and sitting more natural and comfortable.
