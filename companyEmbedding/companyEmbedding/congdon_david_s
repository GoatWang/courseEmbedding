Product Description▼▲
Rudolf Bultmann's controversial program of demythologizing has been the subject of constant debate since it was first announced in 1941. It is widely held that this program indicates Bultmann's departure from the dialectical theology he once shared with Karl Barth. In the 1950s, Barth thus referred to their relationship as that of a whale and an elephant: incapable of meaningful communication. In The Mission of Demythologizing, David Congdon proposes a contrary reading of demythologizing as the hermeneutical fulfillment of dialectical theology on the basis of a reinterpretation of Barth's theological project.

Author Bio▼▲
David W. Congdon earned a PhD in theology at Princeton Theological Seminary and is associate editor at IVP Academic. He is coeditor of Karl Barth in Conversation (2014) and the author of  The God Who Saves: A Dogmatic Sketch and Bultmann: A Guide for the Perplexed.

Editorial Reviews▼▲
This book is one of the most important and perceptive studies on Rudolf Bultmann and his often misunderstood program of Entmythologisierung (demythologizing) ever written in English.—Michael Lattke, Emeritus, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia
For two generations theology has gone around Bultmann rather than through him. This evasion has led either to scholarly retreats into the false securities of the old historicism or to circling the wagons of Christian traditionalism. In this brilliant book worthy of its subject, a voice from the youngest theological generation now presents a fresh understanding of Bultmanns daring missional program. David Congdon urges the church to look outward and forward by interpreting the news of Jesus Christ on the shifting frontiers of an emerging world.—James F. Kay, Princeton Theological Seminary
"Comprehensively researched and clearly written, this volume provides a convincing reinterpretation of Bultmanns thought as well as a compelling account of its constructive significance for the future of missional theology and hermeneutics. This is an impressive interdisciplinary contribution to the literature of modern Christian thought by one of the most promising young theologians at work today.—John R. Franke, Evangelische Theologische Faculteit, Leuven, Belgium
In this substantial work, David Congdon has produced the most creative and scholarly study of Rudolf Bultmanns theology for more than a generation. In refuting the standard charge of a capitulation to modernity, he shows how Bultmanns demythologizing project is rooted in a robust set of convictions about God as subject and the act of faith as existential and practical. This reassessment of Bultmann as a dialectical theologian is long overdue. In an increasingly secular culture which too readily dismisses Christian faith as believing six impossible things before breakfast, Congdons work promises to rehabilitate Bultmann as an important resource for theological understanding.—David Fergusson, University of Edinburgh
"The Mission of Demythologizing systematically deconstructs the slogans with which New Testament scholars have long caricatured Rudolf Bultmann's hermeneutic. Yet this is no mere demolition job, as David Congdon replaces the stereotype with a Bultmann fully invested in a missiological hermeneutic on behalf of dialectical theology. This book and the discussion it generates will be with us a long time."—Beverly Roberts Gaventa, Baylor University
"David Congdon's work is essential reading for anyone interested in Rudolf Bultmann, Karl Barth, or Christian theology in the modern period. Meticulously researched, lucidly written, and brimming with constructive energy, this is a work of enormous sympathy, intelligence, and creativity."—Adam Neder, Whitworth University
"This is a quite remarkable volume. It seeks to overturn two generations and more of scholarship on the theology of Rudolf Bultmann, not only revisiting and reconceiving the relationship between Bultmann and Karl Barth, but also revisioning and rehabilitating Bultmann's program of demythologization. . . . The result is a painstakingly researched and lucidly presented work that is both compelling and a joy to read, one which evidences the kind of depth, insight, and passion that are the hallmarks of the very finest research in theology. This volume will make an immediate and significant contribution to the reception of the work of Bultmann (and of Barth); but more than this, the constructive and generative agenda which it sets suggests that the work of Protestant theology is far from done and that tales of its demise may be somewhat premature."—Paul T. Nimmo, University of Aberdeen

David Congdon
David Congdon is currently ODFL’s CEO and president. He was recently named to Institutional Investor Magazine’s 2015 All-America Executive Team. He has been named as one of the top three CEOs in the airfreight and surface transportation sector.



Congdon joined the company in 1978 and worked his way through to become the COO in 1997. He laid the foundation of the company with strategies for what he envisioned the publicly traded company would become in ten years.
Since he joined the company, Congdon has maintained a regional (or short haul) and interregional (or long haul) focus. He invested $9 million to $15 million annually to upgrade the company’s IT network and infrastructure, and also began a string of relentless upgrades to the company’s pickup-and-delivery service centers.
The upgrades that Congdon made were what finally transformed the company from the traditional LTL (less-than-truckload) shipper into a serious regional and interregional player, thus enabling it to compete with nationwide powerhouses like United Parcel Service (UPS), FedEx (FDX), ABF freight system, and Con-way Freight (CNW).
Achievements
Congdon’s vision has transformed what used to be only a trucking company into a single-source provider of transportation solutions. The company today stands as the fifth largest truckload carrier by revenue. It also boasts an on-time service performance record of about 99%. Plus, during the economic downturn, it was the only carrier to post a profit in 2009 while not cutting wages.

HIGH POINT — Whenever Kitty and Earl Congdon's family gather for dinner, they end every blessing with “God, help us to help others.”And He has.This year, the Congdons will celebrate 65 years of marriage. In that time, they've raised three children, served on numerous local boards and given millions to organizations in High Point.Earl grew his parent's Old Dominion Freight Line into a billion-dollar worldwide company.The Congdons have boats, planes, a home in Florida and a home here in High Point.“But he calls himself a trucker,” said friend Bill McGuinn. “When the unions came here, Earl drove one of the trucks across the picket line. He's not glitter, he's solid, and so is Kitty. They are downhome people.”Kitty and Earl Congdon are this year's recipients of The High Point Enterprise Citizen of the Year. They will learn about the award when they read their Enterprise this morning or they get the first phone call from a friend congratulating them. They were chosen by past winners of Citizen of the Year who use these criteria to determine the winner: a resident of High Point with a service history of many years in local leadership who will continue public service in High Point.Kitty and Earl Congdon's service history here certainly is a long one.In 1962, Earl, his mother and brother moved Old Dominion's headquarters from Richmond, Virginia, to High Point. Earl had to wait to bring Kitty and their children. Union strikes made it a dangerous time at the company. “The office was bombed three times,” said David Congdon, Kitty and Earl's son. “That's a lot for a 26-year-old to handle.”When Kitty and the children arrived in High Point, the family soon found ways to contribute to the community. They were drawn to the United Way. “Dad started the tradition of asking employees to contribute,” said David Congdon, now CEO of Old Dominion.Today, Old Dominion remains the No. 1 giver to United Way of Greater High Point, pledging more than $470,000 last year. Since the United Way began its CANpaign food drive in 2010, Old Dominion has donated a driver and trailers to carry the food – about 100,000 pounds each year.Kitty and Earl also are longtime members of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society. This means the couple give $10,000 or more a year to the United Way.Over the years, Kitty and Earl have served on and led boards including the United Way and YWCA. They support the Girl Scouts, the YMCA, High Point Regional and the High Point Community Foundation.Kitty was the first woman to serve as the junior warden of St. Mary's Episcopal Church, meaning she oversaw the grounds work. She served as president of the YWCA, which named its women's resource center after her. The Congdons also have made significant donations to build the Community Life Center at the church.The family has given $10 million to High Point University and endowed a scholarship there in the School of Business.Earl and Kitty met in high school in Richmond. They dated about once a year, but married after high school graduation. They are now in their 80s and enjoy traveling. They still hold hands and their children have never seen them argue with each other.“They are lovebirds,” David Congdon said. “Basically inseparable. They taught us to love people.”In the Congdon family, Kitty and Earl are called G1 — for Generation 1. These quiet givers have passed down their helping spirit to their children, G2, and grandchildren, G3, and eventually, G4, their great-grandchildren.This was apparent last May, when the family agreed to pledge $2 million to Say Yes Guilford, a new initiative that will pay last-dollar college tuition to graduates of the Guilford County Schools system.“G1 and G2 came to the Old Dominion boardroom and met with Say Yes representatives,” said Kitty and Earl's daughter, Audrey Congdon. “G3 is really serious about this, too. They came in with questions, research and have gone to the meetings.”G3 is made up of young professionals. They've been involved in last year's United Way campaign, continuing the Congdon family tradition.“Dad and Mom have always quietly done their thing” Audrey Congdon said. “It's in their hearts and they have taught us that our blessings come from God and He has certainly given blessings to us. It's our place to give it back.”Reach Megan Ward at 888-3543 | mward@hpenews.comPast Citizens of the year share thoughts about Kitty and Earl Congdon “Earl and Kitty are great listeners. Their questions are direct, and it is obvious that they value the opinions of others. They give thoughtful suggestions and want to understand the situation firsthand and include others in the decision-making process. They are humble people whose goal when helping others is to focus on self sufficiency and improving life for others. They both have a strong understanding of self and serve their maker with a joyful attitude. God is the centerpiece of their every action.”— Chris Greene, Citizen of the Year 2001  “Kitty and Earl are quiet people, but when it comes time to step up to the table, they're always there. These are people you could easily overlook because they don't tout what they have, but they share. They not only support these things with finances, they support these things from the heart.”— Charlie Greene, Citizen of the Year 1990  “Kitty and Earl Congdon have plowed big portions of their resources back into this community. Their church, HPU, the hospital, the United Way, the community foundation and the Girl Scouts are among the institutions that have benefited from their generosity and leadership. It's a bonus that their next generation also is deeply involved in community leadership.”— Bill McGuinn, Citizen of the Year 1992  “Earl and Kitty Congdon have been my friends for many years, and they have been an inspiration to me and many, many others. They have been generous with their gifts … gifts that are a reflection of their time and energy, and their constant love and caring for this community. These two make things happen in a joyous way.”— Bill Horney, Citizen of the Year 1984 
 “Earl and Kitty have very quietly given back to our community in various ways, whether through their church, making Christmas better for families and kids, supporting the United Way both personally and corporately, and being business leaders supporting the transformation of High Point. Let us not forget that High Point is Earl and Kitty's adopted city. The citizens of High Point are very fortunate.”— Coy Williard, Citizen of the Year 2010  “God blessed the Congdon family, and they are blessing others with their love, their talents, and their gifts. Their impact in our city is both measurable and lasting. At High Point University alone, their philanthropic investment and leadership support frame our work with substantial value and substantive effect on generations of future medical graduates. Through the three decades I've known Kitty and Earl professionally and personally, I learned to respect them as friends and admire them as citizens. They focus on God, family and country with commitment and dedication. Both of them attend every family event, be it a baptism, a graduation, a wedding or a social gathering. They love their extended family and model the values of loyalty and faith with impeccable precision. High Point is a better city because the Congdons live here. We thank God for them.”— Nido Qubein, Citizen of the Year, 1995  “The Congdons were one of the first families to step forward in support of Say Yes. Earl in particular wanted to fully understand how Say Yes worked and was especially interested in the wraparound services which offer support and encouragement to students who otherwise would not be on track reach their full academic potential. Even more heartwarming to me is how their entire family, children and grandchildren have that same sense of community spirit and community service.”— David Miller, Citizen of the Year 1997   “Kitty and Earl exemplify love of family. It shines through in everything they do. They work together and they play together, traveling extensively as a family. Their generosity to our community is unparalleled, and I think it is their love of family that motivates them to share with others. Their leadership has been transformative to the organizations they have helped. They lead quietly, never seeking recognition. How wonderful it is that we have this opportunity to thank them publicly for inspiring us all. They truly lead by example.”— Jeff Horney, Citizen of the Year 2004 “Earl and Kitty have been outstanding members of the High Point Community. They have been leaders in the business, religious and many service organizations. Their generosity in time and financial support has helped High Point to be a better place.”— Jim Morgan, Citizen of the Year 1991
