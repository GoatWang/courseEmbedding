Fund Objective: Seeks current income and capital appreciation. In seeking current income, the Fund intends to pay current cash distributions to shareholders, regardless of the character of such distributions for tax or accounting purposes.


Distribution Yield: The distribution yield measures the percentage return in the form of dividends. It is calculated daily by annualizing the most recent dividend distribution and dividing by the daily share price (NAV or POP). If the Fund did not make a distribution as of the latest scheduled distribution date, "N/A" will be displayed.
12-month Yield: The 12-month yield measures the percentage return in the form of dividends. It is calculated monthly by taking the sum of the trailing 12-month dividend payments divided by the last month's ending share price (NAV or POP) plus any capital gains distributed over previous 12 months. If the Fund did not make any distributions over the previous 12 months, "N/A" will be displayed.
The SEC 30-day Yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the first 30 days of the month by the offering price per share at the end of that period. The yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the period, after the deduction of the Fund's expenses. Yield reflects a fee waiver and/or expense limitation agreement without which the 30-day SEC Yield would have been lower.
Dividend distributions are the distribution of a dividend to mutual fund shareholders as of a certain date. The following Funds declare daily dividends: MainStay California Tax Free Opportunities, MainStay Floating Rate, MainStay High Yield Municipal Bond, MainStay Money Market, MainStay New York Tax Free Opportunities, MainStay Tax Advantaged Short Term Bond, and MainStay Tax Free Bond.

Expenses for MainStay Cushing MLP Premier Fund are as of March 31, 2017.

1. Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) represents an estimate of the Fund’s potential tax expense/(benefit) if it were to recognize the unrealized gains/(losses) in the portfolio. This amount may vary greatly over time depending upon the performance of the Fund’s investments.
2. New York Life Investment Management LLC has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses so that the Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding taxes, deferred income tax expenses, interest, litigation, extraordinary expenses, brokerage and other transaction expenses relating to the purchase or sale of portfolio investments, and acquired (underlying) fund fees and expenses) do not exceed the following percentages of average daily net assets: Class A, 1.60%; Class C, 2.35% and Class I, 1.35%. This agreement will remain in effect for a two-year period unless extended by New York Life Investment Management LLC and approved by the Board of Trustees of the Fund.Total and Net Expense Ratio shown are from the most recent Fund prospectus fee table. Net annual operating expenses reflect contractual waivers and/or expense limitations. Total annual operating expenses are absent the waivers and/or limitations.




Before You Invest
All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
Before considering an investment in the Fund, you should understand that you could lose money.
Securities purchased by the Fund that are liquid at the time of purchase may subsequently become illiquid due to, among other things, events relating to the issuer of the securities, market events, economic conditions, investor perceptions, or lack of market participants. The lack of an active trading market may make it difficult to obtain an accurate price for a security. As a result, an investor could pay more than the market value when buying Fund shares or receive less than the market value when selling Fund shares.
The Fund is a non-diversified, open-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Accordingly, the Fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in a more limited number of issuers than a diversified fund. There are currently approximately 120 publicly traded MLPs. The Fund will select its investments in MLPs from this small pool of issuers together with securities issued by any newly public MLPs, and may invest in securities of private MLPs, affiliates of MLPs, and non-MLP issuers, consistent with its investment objective and policies. An investment in the Fund may present greater risk to an investor than an investment in a diversified portfolio because changes in the financial condition or market assessment of a single issuer may cause greater fluctuations in the value of the Fund’s shares.
The Fund concentrates its investments in the natural resources sector, with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs. MLPs and other natural resources sector companies are subject to certain risks, including, but not limited to fluctuations in the prices of commodities; the highly cyclical nature of the natural resources sector may adversely affect the earnings or operating cash flows of the issuers in which the Fund will invest; a significant decrease in the production of energy commodities would reduce the revenue, operating income, and operating cash flows of MLPs and other natural resources sector companies and, therefore, their ability to make distributions or pay dividends.
The investment strategies, practices, and risk analysis used by the subadvisor may not produce the desired results.
Distributions made by the Fund to shareholders may be considered ordinary income or non-taxable return of capital. The Fund is organized as a regular or “C” corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state, foreign, and local taxes.
Midstream MLPs gather, process, and transport natural resources.
Disclosure1. POP (Public Offering Price) is the NAV (Net Asset Value) plus a sales charge. All POPs are subject to revision and include the maximum sales charge.2. Average annual total returns include the change in share price and reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions. Effective after the close of business 7/11/14, Cushing® MLP Premier Fund was renamed MainStay Cushing MLP Premier Fund. Performance for Class A, C, and I shares reflect the performance of the then-existing Class A, C, and I shares of Cushing MLP Premier Fund (which was subject to a different fee structure) for periods prior to 7/11/14, restated to reflect current sales charges.

The S&P 500® Index is an unmanaged index and is widely regarded as the standard for measuring large-cap U.S. stock-market performance. Index results assume the reinvestment of all capital gain and dividend distributions. The securities holdings and volatility of the Fund differ significantly from the stocks that make up the S&P 500 Index. An investment cannot be made directly into an index.The P/E Ratio (price-to-earnings) denotes the weighted average of all the P/Es of the securities in the Fund's portfolio. The P/B Ratio (price-to-book) is the weighted average of all the P/Bs of the securities in the Fund's portfolio. Return on Equity (ROE) is the weighted average of all the ROEs of the securities in the Fund's portfolio. ROE is calculated by dividing net income by book value. Standard deviation measures how widely dispersed a fund's returns have been over a specified period of time. A high standard deviation indicates that the range is wide, implying greater potential for volatility. Beta is a measure of historical volatility relative to an appropriate index (benchmark) based on its investment objective. A beta greater than 1.00 indicates volatility greater than the benchmark's. Alpha measures a fund's risk-adjusted performance and is expressed as an annualized percentage. R-Squared measures the percentage of a fund's movements that result from movements in the index. The Sharpe Ratio shown is calculated for the past 36-month period by dividing annualized excess returns by annualized standard deviation. The Annual Turnover Rate is as of the most recent annual shareholder report. Upside/Downside Market Capture measures a manager's performance in up/down markets relative to the Fund's benchmark.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
