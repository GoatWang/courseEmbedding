Calling Features
x



Anonymous Call Blocker
Anonymous Call Blocker blocks incoming calls from callers who block their Caller ID information. Those callers can dial *82 to unblock Caller ID.
 
Block Unwanted Callers
Provides the subscriber the ability to maintain a list of 32 numbers from which the subscriber does not want to accept incoming calls.
 
Busy Redial
When you get a busy signal, dial *66 to use Busy Redial, and Optimum Voice will call you back when the line you're calling is free.
 
Call Forwarding
Call Forwarding automatically redirects your incoming calls to a forwarding number so you never miss an important phone call. With Call Forwarding, the incoming call will ring on whatever phone number you choose, like a cell phone or a work number, instead of your Optimum Voice line.
 
Call Forwarding on Busy or No Answer
When the phone line is busy or the line is unanswered all incoming calls will be redirected to the number specified by the subscriber.


Call Forwarding Time-of-Day
Provides the subscriber a scheduling capability to forward calls to another number, during specified time intervals.


Call Forwarding to Back Up Phone
Forwards calls to a specified number when the connection to the cable modem is lost.


Caller ID
Caller ID displays the name and telephone number of the incoming caller, provided they are not blocking that information. This feature requires a Caller ID-compatible telephone or display device.


Caller ID Blocking (*67)
Caller ID Blocking lets you hide your name and number when making a call and is available on a per-call basis. First, dial *67. You should hear a stutter tone indicating that Caller ID Blocking is active. After you hear the stutter tone, proceed to dial the number of the party you are calling.


Caller ID on Optimum TV
Optimum TV customers with Optimum Voice and Optimum Online, also get Caller ID on Optimum TV, which displays caller ID information on your TV, so you can screen your calls while you’re watching your favorite shows and movies.


Call Return (*69)
Call Return (*69) identifies the last incoming caller to your line. Call Return (*69) will also automatically redial the last incoming telephone number for calls received from other Optimum Voice lines and from certain calls within your calling area.


Call Waiting
Call Waiting alerts you of incoming calls when you are on the phone and allows you to switch back and forth between calls. When you are on the phone, a tone will alert you of an incoming call. To pick up an incoming Call Waiting call, or to return to your first call, press the hook switch or flash key of your phone.
 
Call Waiting with Caller ID
Call Waiting with Caller ID provides Caller ID information for all call waiting calls.

Enhanced 911
Enhanced 911 service, sometimes referred to as E911, provides emergency services with the name, phone number and home address associated with your account when 911 is dialed. Therefore, if the caller is unable to speak, emergency services can still be dispatched to your home. Optimum Voice's E911 calls are connected into the same call centers as traditional phone companies, meaning 911 calls will be answered by local emergency dispatchers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.


Enhanced Voicemail
Enhanced Voicemail provides all the features of an answering machine combined with the power of the Web. Like standard voicemail, you can listen to messages, create personal greetings and access your mailbox from any location. However, enhanced voicemail also allows you to
•    Use the Web to check your voicemail.
•    Receive voicemail messages through email.
•    Receive notification of voicemail message by text alerts on your phone


Find Me
With Find Me, calls to your Optimum Voice line will simultaneously ring up to three additional phone lines, like a cell phones or work numbers. The incoming call can be answered by any of the phone lines, and the call will be connected to whichever phone answers first


Free 411
Unlimited free 411 Directory Assistance calls.          


HD calling
Optimum is the first landline telephone service provider in the U.S. to launch High Definition calling. HD calling is the next generation of voice technology that gives you less background noise, sharper sound quality and increased clarity in your phone conversations. To experience HD calling, customers and call recipients must subscribe to Optimum Voice and use HD-capable handsets.


Private Outbound Calling
Private Outbound Calling hides your name and number on all calls you make. The person you are calling will only see "Private" or a similar message on their caller ID screen. Anonymous calls can also be made on a per-call basis by dialing (*67) before each anonymous call you wish to make.


Three-Way Calling
Three-Way Calling allows you to add a third party to your conversation.


VIP Ringing
With VIP Ringing, you can designate up to 32 telephone numbers to ring with a second, distinct ring tone.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
