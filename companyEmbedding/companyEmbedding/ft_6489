The Self-Trimming apron results in a perfect, predictable fit and finish with each installation, and is sized for optimized side-to-side fit between cabinet doors of 36" industry standard apron front cabinetry. The large single basin provides ample functional space to soak and wash large items, and an offset drain placement maximizes basin surface as well as storage space inside the kitchen sink cabinet.

Western Digital CorpWestern Digital Announces Financial Results for Fourth Fiscal Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017TwitterFacebookLinkedInGooglePlusRedditPinterestUrlJul 27 2017 21:10 BSTSource: Business Wire

SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 27, 2017--
      Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ: WDC) today reported revenue of $4.8
      billion, operating income of $652 million and net income of $280
      million, or $0.93 per share, for its fourth fiscal quarter ended June
      30, 2017. The GAAP net income for the period includes charges associated
      with the company’s recent acquisitions. Excluding these charges and
      after other non-GAAP adjustments, fourth quarter non-GAAP operating
      income was $1.2 billion and non-GAAP net income was $881 million, or
      $2.93 per share.
    

      In the year-ago quarter, the company reported revenue of $3.5 billion,
      operating loss of $195 million and net loss of $366 million, or $(1.40)
      per share. Non-GAAP operating income in the year-ago quarter was $451
      million and non-GAAP net income was $269 million, or $1.02 per share.
    

      The company generated approximately $1.0 billion in cash from operations
      during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017, ending with $6.5 billion of
      total cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. On May
      3, 2017, the company declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share of its
      common stock, which was paid to shareholders on July 17, 2017.
    

      For fiscal 2017, the company achieved revenue of $19.1 billion,
      operating income of $2.0 billion and net income of $397 million, or
      $1.34 per share, compared to fiscal 2016 revenue of $13.0 billion,
      operating income of $466 million and net income of $242 million, or
      $1.00 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, fiscal 2017 operating income was
      $3.9 billion and net income was $2.7 billion, or $9.19 per share,
      compared to fiscal 2016 operating income of $1.7 billion and net income
      of $1.4 billion, or $5.79 per share. The company generated $3.4 billion
      in cash from operations during the 2017 fiscal year and it returned to
      shareholders $574 million in dividends.
    

      “We reported strong financial performance in the June quarter to
      complete an outstanding fiscal 2017, demonstrating the differentiated
      value that we can deliver as a comprehensive data solutions provider,”
      said Steve Milligan, chief executive officer. “Our unique platform of
      diverse storage technologies and value-added products helped drive this
      performance as we addressed a broader set of markets following the
      SanDisk acquisition. We operated near the top of our revenue growth
      model with 7 percent year-over-year top-line growth on a pro-forma
      basis, and we delivered very healthy margins.”

      To supplement the condensed consolidated financial statements presented
      in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
      (“GAAP”), the table above sets forth non-GAAP cost of revenue; non-GAAP
      gross profit; non-GAAP operating expenses; non-GAAP operating income;
      non-GAAP interest and other expense, net; non-GAAP income tax expense
      (benefit); non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted income per common
      share (“Non-GAAP measures”). These Non-GAAP measures are not in
      accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance
      with GAAP and may be different from Non-GAAP measures used by other
      companies. Western Digital Corporation believes the presentation of
      these Non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the
      corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors
      for measuring the Company’s earnings performance and comparing it
      against prior periods. Specifically, we believe these Non-GAAP measures
      provide useful information to both management and investors as they
      exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that we believe are not
      indicative of our core operating results or because they are consistent
      with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who
      follow us and our peers. As discussed further below, these Non-GAAP
      measures exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets,
      stock-based compensation expense, employee termination, asset impairment
      and other charges, acquisition-related charges, charges related to cost
      saving initiatives, charges related to arbitration award, convertible
      debt activity, debt extinguishment costs, other charges, and income tax
      adjustments, and we believe these measures along with the related
      reconciliations to the GAAP measures provide additional detail and
      comparability for assessing our results. These Non-GAAP measures are
      some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing our
      performance and planning and forecasting future periods. These measures
      should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with
      GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to,
      GAAP results.
    

      As described above, we exclude the following items from our Non-GAAP
      measures:
    

Amortization of acquired intangible assets.
      We incur expenses from the amortization of acquired intangible assets
      over their economic lives. Such charges are significantly impacted by
      the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and any related impairment
      charges.
    

Stock-based compensation expense. Because
      of the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying
      methodologies for determining stock-based compensation expense, the
      subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the
      volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside
      our control, we believe excluding stock-based compensation expense
      enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and
      assess the underlying performance of our business over time and compare
      it against our peers, a majority of whom also exclude stock-based
      compensation expense from their non-GAAP results.
    

Employee termination, asset impairment and other
      charges. From time-to-time, in order to realign our operations
      with anticipated market demand or to achieve cost synergies from the
      integration of acquisitions, we may terminate employees and/or
      restructure our operations. From time-to-time, we may also incur charges
      from the impairment of intangible assets and other long-lived assets.
      These charges (including any reversals of charges recorded in prior
      periods) are inconsistent in amount and frequency, and we believe are
      not indicative of the underlying performance of our business.
    

Acquisition-related charges. In connection
      with our business combinations, we incur expenses which we would not
      have otherwise incurred as part of our business operations. These
      expenses include third-party professional service and legal fees,
      third-party integration services, severance costs, non-cash adjustments
      to the fair value of acquired inventory, contract termination costs, and
      retention bonuses. We may also experience other accounting impacts in
      connection with these transactions. These charges and impacts are
      related to acquisitions, are inconsistent in amount and frequency, and
      we believe are not indicative of the underlying performance of our
      business.
    

Charges related to arbitration award. In
      relation to an arbitration award for claims brought against the Company
      by Seagate Technology LLC, which was satisfied in October 2014, and the
      related dispute over the calculation of post-award interest, we have
      recorded loss contingencies. The resulting expense is inconsistent in
      amount and frequency.
    

Charges related to cost saving initiatives.
      In connection with the transformation of our business, we have incurred
      charges related to cost saving initiatives which do not qualify for
      special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. These
      charges, which we believe are not indicative of the underlying
      performance of our business, primarily relate to costs associated with
      rationalizing our channel partners or vendors, transforming our
      information systems infrastructure, integrating our product roadmap, and
      accelerated depreciation on assets.
    

Convertible debt activity, net. We exclude
      non-cash economic interest expense associated with the convertible
      senior notes, the gains and losses on the conversion of the convertible
      senior notes and call option, and unrealized gains and losses related to
      the change in fair value of the exercise option and call option. These
      charges and gains and losses do not reflect our operating results, and
      we believe are not indicative of the underlying performance of our
      business.
    

Debt extinguishment costs. From
      time-to-time, we replace our existing debt with new financing at more
      favorable interest rates or utilize available capital to settle debt
      early, both of which generate interest savings in future periods. We
      incur debt extinguishment charges consisting of the costs to call the
      existing debt and/or the write-off of any related unamortized debt
      issuance costs. These gains and losses related to our debt activity
      occur infrequently and we believe are not indicative of the underlying
      performance of our business.
    

Other charges. From time-to-time, we sell
      or impair investments or other assets which are not considered necessary
      to our business operations; are a party to legal or arbitration
      proceedings, which could result in an expense or benefit due to
      settlements, final judgments, or accruals for loss contingencies; or
      incur other charges or gains which we believe are not a part of the
      ongoing operation of our business. The resulting expense or benefit is
      inconsistent in amount and frequency.
    

Income tax adjustments. Income tax
      adjustments reflect the difference between income taxes based on a
      forecasted annual non-GAAP tax rate and a forecasted annual GAAP tax
      rate as a result of the timing of certain non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments.
