All investments carry risk. Different investments carry different levels of risk, depending on the investment strategy and the underlying assets. Generally, the higher the potential return of an investment, the greater the risk.
The risks of investing in this fund include:

Market risk: Changes in the prices of futures positions held by the fund may result in loss of principal or large movements in the unit price of the fund within short or long periods of time. Global and local economic, financial, political, technological and environmental factors can drive changes in the prices of futures positions. It is not possible to predict the occurrence or magnitude of these and other potentially relevant factors. Different factors may affect the price of individual futures positions, particular asset classes (such as shares, bonds, interest rates, currencies and commodities) or futures positions generally at different times.
Leverage risk: Arises when the fund takes on positions that are greater in size than its assets. The fund will take leveraged positions with the aim of increasing returns which can also lead to increased losses. Leverage arises in the fund through taking both long and short futures positions which are larger in size than the net asset value of the fund. While this process forms a key part of the investment strategy, it may mean that gains and losses may be significantly greater than those in a fund that is not leveraged. The fund employs significant leverage and this may result in a loss of some or all of the fund's capital.
Strategy, model and research risk: Winton's investment approach is based on research into past data and the application of that research to the development of mathematical models that attempt to forecast returns, risk, correlation and transaction costs. Many of these models are trend following models that attempt to identify and exploit market trends. Mathematical models are representations of reality but they may be incomplete and/or flawed and there is an inherent risk that any forecasts derived from them may be inaccurate, particularly if the research or models are based on, or incorporate, inaccurate assumptions or data. Assumptions or data may be inaccurate from the outset or may become inaccurate as a result of many factors such as, changes in market structure, increased government intervention in markets or growth in assets managed in accordance with similar investment strategies. In particular, such factors may make Winton’s trend following models less effective because they may lessen the prospect of identified trends occurring or continuing in the future. As a result of the foregoing, the investment system may not generate profitable trading signals and the fund may suffer a loss.

For a full description of the risks of investing in the fund, you should read the Product Disclosure Statement before deciding to invest.

Detailed fund information



       Winton Capital Management Limited (Winton) is a global investment management company, based in London. Winton focuses on achieving absolute returns through advanced statistical research into financial markets. Winton was founded in 1997 by David Harding, one of the pioneers of trend-following systematic trading. It has since become a leader in the specialised field of managed futures and is now one of the largest Commodity Trading Advisers in the world.
    



       The Winton Global Alpha Fund aims to generate long-term total returns from a specialist managed futures strategy.
    

       Futures are contracts that allow investors to buy or sell an asset (for example commodities, equities, bonds) on a specified future date at an agreed price.
    

       The fund can potentially benefit from rising and falling markets, taking advantage of either a rise in the underlying price (if it takes a 'long' position) or a fall in the underlying price (if it takes a 'short' position).
    



       Winton aims to achieve strong long-term returns without relying on general growth in asset values. It pursues a diversified trading strategy and targets risk, not return.
    

       The fund trades approximately 100 global futures markets, across categories such as share indices, bonds, interest rates, currencies and commodities.
    

       Winton further believes that trading strategies, by their nature, need to be constantly updated in order to maintain their competitive edge. For this reason, Winton invests heavily in a program of statistical research.
    

       The Winton Investment System, largely automated and based on mathematical models derived through statistical research, is a result of over 25 years of scientific research into financial markets.
    

       The investment team:
    


        accesses a world of data from thousands of markets including economic statistics, weather records, demographic data and much more
      

        extracts meaning from noisy market data
      

        gains an edge by detecting subtle patterns in the way markets move to make market predictions.

 Systematic Investing

















 








Investment Approach 
Winton’s approach to investment management consists of treating the investment universe as a large body of data within which Winton can search for patterns and structures that give rise to a small degree of predictability.  Such small informational “edges” can be exploited by composing fairly complex portfolios of strategies that are applied, through time, in a consistent and sufficiently disciplined fashion to allow for a profitable outcome to ensue.
 
Systematic Process

Finding such patterns involves organizing and analyzing data, using mathematical and statistical methods similar to those employed by astrophysicists when researching cosmic phenomena or particle physicists in their quest for the Higgs Boson. This explains why many of Winton’s scientists have been trained in these fields.
The core of Winton’s research effort is directed at identifying explanatory variables which could form the basis of profitable investment strategies. 
 Winton's investment systems operate a diverse range of systemic approaches making use of different types of market relevant data.
  
Dedicated Research Team
Over one quarter of our employees are in research and technology roles focused on statistical and computational modelling of data. Winton recruits highly qualified scientists and engineers that are organized into an efficient and multi-disciplinary Research team.  
 
 Consistent, Risk-Adjusted Returns 
Our aim is to generate consistent risk-adjusted returns for our clients over the long term. To this end, our sophisticated models capture a wide range of risk factors, seeking to provide insulation from market shocks and helping to make our returns more stable.

Why Invest 

Led by David Harding, who has  been at the forefront of systematic investment for over 25 years,* having  founded two of the world’s leading quantitative investment firms.
Employs over 100 Research and Data staff continually working on enhancements to Winton’s investment systems.  
Manages assets on behalf of some of the largest and  most sophisticated institutional investors, including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and global financial institutions, as well as wholesale clients.
Over 400 employees, with offices in  London, Oxford, New York, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Tokyo and Zurich.



Investment Philosophy

Winton’s investment solutions are based on the belief that profitable investment opportunities can be identified through the application of advanced statistical and pattern recognition techniques to large datasets.
 Such systems employ forecasts or signals that are typically weak and barely distinguishable from noise. Consequently, Winton focuses much of its efforts on establishing the statistical significance of signals and devising appropriate risk and cost controls.
Winton believes more reliable investment decisions can be made using statistical inference from empirical evidence than deductive reasoning from economic axioms.

Investment Systems

 Winton's investment systems are the  product of nearly two decades of applying science, technology and statistical  research to investment management. The systems combine forecasts of returns, volatilities and correlations with estimates of transaction costs to arrive at  daily investment decisions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. The Fund is a Delaware statutory trust that is registered under the Act as a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to seek long-term capital appreciation through compound growth.
2. The Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Adviser serves as investment adviser to the Fund.
3. The applicants seek an order to permit the Fund to issue multiple classes of shares, each having its own fee and expense structure, and to impose asset-based service and/or distribution fees, EWCs and Early Repurchase Fees.
4. Applicants request that the order also apply to any continuously-offered registered closed-end management investment company that may be organized in the future for which the Adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser, or any successor in interest to any such entity,[1] 
           acts as investment adviser and which operates as an interval fund pursuant to rule 23c-3 under the Act or provides periodic liquidity with respect to its shares pursuant to rule 13e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) (each, a “Future Fund” and together with the Fund, the “Funds”).[2] 

5. The Fund intends to make a continuous public offering of its Class I Shares following the effectiveness of its registration statement (File Nos. 333-201801 and 811-23028) on September 15, 2015. Applicants state that additional offerings by any Fund relying on the order may be on a private placement or public offering basis. Shares of the Funds will not be listed on any securities exchange, nor quoted on any quotation medium. The Funds do not expect there to be a secondary trading market for their shares.
6. If the requested relief is granted, the Fund intends to continuously offer at least one additional class of shares (“Class A Shares”) and may also offer additional classes of shares in the future. Because of the different asset-based service and/or distribution fees, services and any other class expenses that may be attributable to a class of a Fund's shares, the net income attributable to, and the dividends payable on, each class of shares may differ from each other.
7. Applicants state that, from time to time, the Fund may create additional classes of shares, the terms of which may differ from Class I Shares and Class A Shares in the following respects: (i) The amount of fees permitted by different distribution plans or different service fee arrangements; (ii) voting rights with respect to a distribution plan of a class; (iii) different class designations; (iv) the impact of any class expenses directly attributable to a particular class of shares allocated on a class basis as described in the application; (v) any differences in dividends and net asset value resulting from differences in fees under a distribution plan or in class expenses; (vi) any EWC or other sales load structure; (vii) any Early Repurchase Fees; and (viii) exchange or conversion privileges of the classes as permitted under the Act.Start Printed Page 16649

8. Applicants state that currently no Fund intends to impose an Early Repurchase Fee. However, in the future, Funds may subject shares to an Early Repurchase Fee at a rate of 2 percent of the aggregate net asset value of a shareholder's shares repurchased by the Fund if the interval between the date of purchase of the shares and the valuation date with respect to the repurchase of those shares is less than one year. Any Repurchase Fee will apply equally to all shareholders of the applicable Fund, regardless of the class of shares held by such shareholders, consistent with Section 18 of the Act and Rule 18f-3 thereunder. To the extent a Fund determines to waive, impose scheduled variations of or eliminate the Early Repurchase Fee, the Fund will comply with the requirements of Rule 22d-1 under the Act as if the Early Repurchase Fee were a CDSL (defined below) and as if the Fund were an open-ended investment company. The Fund's waiver, scheduled variation in, or elimination of, the Early Repurchase Fee will apply uniformly to all shareholders of the Fund regardless of the class of shares held by such shareholders.
9. Applicants state that the Fund may provide periodic liquidity with respect to its shares pursuant to rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act.[3] 
           A Future Fund may adopt a fundamental investment policy to repurchase a specified percentage of its shares in compliance with rule 23c-3 and make quarterly repurchase offers to its shareholders or provide periodic liquidity with respect to its shares pursuant to rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act. Any repurchase offers made by the Funds will be made to all holders of shares of each such Fund.
10. Applicants represent that any asset-based service and distribution fees for each class of shares will comply with the provisions of NASD Rule 2830(d) (“NASD Sales Charge Rule”).[4] 
           Applicants also represent that each Fund will disclose in its prospectus the fees, expenses and other characteristics of each class of shares offered for sale by the prospectus, as is required for open-end multiple class funds under Form N-1A. As is required for open-end funds, each Fund will disclose its expenses in shareholder reports, and describe any arrangements that result in breakpoints in or elimination of sales loads in its prospectus.[5] 
           In addition, applicants will comply with applicable enhanced fee disclosure requirements for fund of funds, including registered funds of hedge funds.[6] 

11. Each of the Funds will comply with any requirements that the Commission or FINRA may adopt regarding disclosure at the point of sale and in transaction confirmations about the costs and conflicts of interest arising out of the distribution of open-end investment company shares, and regarding prospectus disclosure of sales loads and revenue sharing arrangements, as if those requirements applied to the Fund. In addition, each Fund will contractually require that any distributor of the Fund's shares comply with such requirements in connection with the distribution of such Fund's shares.
12. Each Fund will allocate all expenses incurred by it among the various classes of shares based on the net assets of the Fund attributable to each class, except that the net asset value and expenses of each class will reflect distribution fees, service fees, and any other incremental expenses of that class. Expenses of the Fund allocated to a particular class of shares will be borne on a pro rata basis by each outstanding share of that class. Applicants state that each Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 under the Act as if it were an open-end investment company.
13. Applicants state that each Fund may impose an EWC on shares submitted for repurchase that have been held less than a specified period and may waive the EWC for certain categories of shareholders or transactions to be established from time to time. Applicants state that each of the Funds will apply the EWC (and any waivers, scheduled variations, or eliminations of the EWC) uniformly to all shareholders in a given class and consistently with the requirements of rule 22d-1 under the Act as if the Funds were open-end investment companies.
14. Each Fund operating as an interval fund pursuant to rule 23c-3 under the Act may offer its shareholders an exchange feature under which the shareholders of the Fund may, in connection with the Fund's periodic repurchase offers, exchange their shares of the Fund for shares of the same class of (i) registered open-end investment companies or (ii) other registered closed-end investment companies that comply with rule 23c-3 under the Act and continuously offer their shares at net asset value, that are in the Fund's group of investment companies (collectively, “Other Funds”). Shares of a Fund operating pursuant to rule 23c-3 that are exchanged for shares of Other Funds will be included as part of the amount of the repurchase offer amount for such Fund as specified in rule 23c-3 under the Act. Any exchange option will comply with rule 11a-3 under the Act, as if the Fund were an open-end investment company subject to rule 11a-3. In complying with rule 11a-3, each Fund will treat an EWC as if it were a contingent deferred sales load (“CDSL”).
Applicants' Legal Analysis
Multiple Classes of Shares
1. Section 18(a)(2) of the Act makes it unlawful for a closed-end investment company to issue a senior security that is a stock unless (a) immediately after such issuance it will have an asset coverage of at least 200% and (b) provision is made to prohibit the declaration of any distribution, upon its common stock, or the purchase of any such common stock, unless in every such case such senior security has at the time of the declaration of any such distribution, or at the time of any such purchase, an asset coverage of at least 200% after deducting the amount of such distribution or purchase price, as the case may be. Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of shares of the Funds may violate section 18(a)(2) because the Funds may not meet such requirements with respect to a class of shares that may be a senior security.
2. Section 18(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that a closed-end investment company may not issue or sell any senior security if, immediately thereafter, the company has outstanding more than one class of senior security. Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of shares of the Funds may be prohibited by section 18(c), as a class may have priority over another class as to payment of dividends because shareholders of different classes would pay different fees and expenses.Start Printed Page 16650

3. Section 18(i) of the Act provides that each share of stock issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock. Applicants state that multiple classes of shares of the Funds may violate section 18(i) of the Act because each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to that class.
4. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions from any provision of the Act, or from any rule or regulation under the Act, if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 18(a)(2), 18(c) and 18(i) to permit the Funds to issue multiple classes of shares.
5. Applicants submit that the proposed allocation of expenses relating to distribution and voting rights among multiple classes is equitable and will not discriminate against any group or class of shareholders. Applicants submit that the proposed arrangements would permit a Fund to facilitate the distribution of its shares and provide investors with a broader choice of shareholder services. Applicants assert that the proposed closed-end investment company multiple class structure does not raise the concerns underlying section 18 of the Act to any greater degree than open-end investment companies' multiple class structures that are permitted by rule 18f-3 under the Act. Applicants state that each Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 as if it were an open-end investment company.
Early Withdrawal Charges
1. Section 23(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that no registered closed-end investment company shall purchase securities of which it is the issuer, except: (a) On a securities exchange or other open market; (b) pursuant to tenders, after reasonable opportunity to submit tenders given to all holders of securities of the class to be purchased; or (c) under other circumstances as the Commission may permit by rules and regulations or orders for the protection of investors.
2. Rule 23c-3 under the Act permits a registered closed-end investment company (an “interval fund”) to make repurchase offers of between five and twenty-five percent of its outstanding shares at net asset value at periodic intervals pursuant to a fundamental policy of the interval fund. Rule 23c-3(b)(1) under the Act permits an interval fund to deduct from repurchase proceeds only a repurchase fee, not to exceed two percent of the proceeds, that is paid to the interval fund and is reasonably intended to compensate the fund for expenses directly related to the repurchase.
3. Section 23(c)(3) provides that the Commission may issue an order that would permit a closed-end investment company to repurchase its shares in circumstances in which the repurchase is made in a manner or on a basis that does not unfairly discriminate against any holders of the class or classes of securities to be purchased.
4. Applicants request relief under section 6(c), discussed above, and section 23(c)(3) from rule 23c-3 to the extent necessary for the Funds to impose EWCs on shares of the Funds submitted for repurchase that have been held for less than a specified period.
5. Applicants state that the EWCs they intend to impose are functionally similar to CDSLs imposed by open-end investment companies under rule 6c-10 under the Act. Rule 6c-10 permits open-end investment companies to impose CDSLs, subject to certain conditions. Applicants note that rule 6c-10 is grounded in policy considerations supporting the employment of CDSLs where there are adequate safeguards for the investor and state that the same policy considerations support imposition of EWCs in the interval fund context. In addition, applicants state that EWCs may be necessary for the distributor to recover distribution costs. Applicants represent that any EWC imposed by the Funds will comply with rule 6c-10 under the Act as if the rule were applicable to closed-end investment companies. The Funds will disclose EWCs in accordance with the requirements of Form N-1A concerning CDSLs.
Asset-Based Service and/or Distribution Fees
1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates unless the Commission issues an order permitting the transaction. In reviewing applications submitted under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the participation of the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
2. Rule 17d-3 under the Act provides an exemption from section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 to permit open-end investment companies to enter into distribution arrangements pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act. Applicants request an order under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 under the Act to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to impose asset-based service and/or distribution fees. Applicants have agreed to comply with rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 as if those rules applied to closed-end investment companies, which they believe will resolve any concerns that might arise in connection with a Fund financing the distribution of its shares through asset-based service and/or distribution fees.
3. For the reasons stated above, applicants submit that the exemptions requested under section 6(c) are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants further submit that the relief requested pursuant to section 23(c)(3) will be consistent with the protection of investors and will insure that applicants do not unfairly discriminate against any holders of the class of securities to be purchased. Finally, applicants state that the Funds' imposition of asset-based service and/or distribution fees is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act and does not involve participation on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
Applicants' Condition
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following condition:
Each Fund relying on the order will comply with the provisions of rules 6c-10, 12b-1, 17d-3, 18f-3, 22d-1, and, where applicable, 11a-3 under the Act, as amended from time to time, as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment companies, and will comply with the NASD Sales Charge Rule, as amended from time to time, as if that rule applied to all closed-end management investment companies.

Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) provide advice and services related to trading and investment strategies utilizing futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a wide variety of physical goods such as agricultural products, forest products, metals, and energy, plus derivative contracts on financial instruments such as indices, bonds, and currencies. Each CTA is characterized by its respective trading strategy and the markets it trades.

Company background
Winton Capital Management Limited, a limited liability company registered in England and Wales, registered with the CFTC as a CTA in January 1998 and as a CPO in December 1998.  It became a member of the NFA in January 1998 and has been authorized and regulated by the FSA in the United Kingdom since June 1997.
Investment goal
The investment objective of the Diversified Program is to achieve long- term capital appreciation through compound growth. This goal is achieved by pursuing a diversified trading scheme that does not necessarily rely upon favourable conditions in any particular market, or on market direction.
Strategy
The investment strategy of the Winton Futures Program is to invest globally long and short, using leverage, in a diversified range of liquid instruments including exchange traded futures,options and forwards, currency forwards traded over the counter and other related instruments, by following a systematic investment process that is based on statistical research. Winton Futures Program follows a disciplined investment process that is based on statistical analysis of historical data. The initial stage of the process involves collecting, cleaning and organizing large amounts of data.  The Winton Futures Program uses a wide variety of data inputs including factors that are intrinsic to markets, such as price, volume and open interest; and those that are external to markets, such as economic statistics, industrial and commodity data and public company financial data. Winton conducts statistical research into the data in an attempt to quantify the probability of particular markets rising or falling, conditional on a variety of quantifiable factors. Winton’s research is used to develop mathematical models that attempt to forecast market returns, the variability or volatility associated with such returns (often described as “risk”), the correlation between different markets and transaction costs. These forecasts are used in investment strategies that determine what positions should be held to maximize profit within a certain range of risk. As a result of Winton’s research, it expects that investments made in accordance with this process will have an improved chance of being successful, which is expected to lead to profits over the long-term.

There are substantial risks and potential conflicts of interest associated with managed futures programs. The success of an investment in such a program is dependent upon the ability of a commodity trading advisor (“CTA”) to identify profitable investment opportunities and successfully trade. The identification of attractive trading opportunities is difficult, requires skill, and involves a significant degree of uncertainty. The high degree of leverage often obtainable in futures trading can work against you as well as for you, and can lead to large losses. Returns generated from a CTA’s trading, if any, may not adequately compensate you for the business and financial risks you assume. You can lose all or a substantial amount of your investment. Managed futures accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees. It may be necessary for accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits in order to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets. CTAs may trade highly illiquid markets, or on foreign markets, and may not be able to close or offset positions immediately upon request. You may have market exposure even after the CTA has a request for closure or liquidation.
PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. THERE IS RISK OF LOSS. YOU CAN LOSE MONEY IN A MANAGED FUTURES PROGRAM.

                        There are substantial risks and conflicts of interests associated with Managed Futures and commodities accounts, and you should only invest risk capital. The success of an investment is dependent upon the ability of a commodity trading advisor (CTA) to identify profitable investment opportunities and successfully trade. The identification of attractive trading opportunities is difficult, requires skill, and involves a significant degree of uncertainty. CTAs have total trading authority, and the use of a single CTA could mean a lack of diversification and higher risk. The high degree of leverage often obtainable in commodity trading can work against you as well as for you, and can lead to large losses as well as gains. Returns generated from a CTA’s trading, if any, may not adequately compensate you for the business and financial risks you assume. You can lose all or a substantial amount of your investment. If you use notional funding, you may lose more than your initial cash investment. Managed Futures and commodities accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees. It may be necessary for accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits in order to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets. The disclosure document contains a complete description of each fee to be charged to your account by a CTA. CTAs may trade highly illiquid markets, or on foreign markets, and may not be able to close or offset positions immediately upon request. You may have market exposure even after the CTA has a request for closure or liquidation. PAST RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.
