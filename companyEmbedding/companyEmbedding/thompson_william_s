Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Exclusive: U.S. weighs financial sanctions to hit Venezuela's oil revenue - sources
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    8:36 PM ET 07/21/2017

The move could severely restrict the OPEC nation's crude exports and starve its socialist government of hard currency.

William S. Thompson, Jr. to Retire from Citi Board of Directors





NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Citi’s Board of Directors today announced that William S. Thompson, Jr. 
      will retire from the Board, effective July 20, 2017. Mr. Thompson has 
      served on Citi’s Board since 2009 and was Chairman of the Personnel and 
      Compensation Committee since 2014, in addition to also serving as a 
      member of the Executive and Risk Management Committees.
    
“As one of the longest serving members of the Board, 
      Bill’s contributions to the company are extensive, and his valuable 
      perspectives and commitment to serving our shareholders will be missed.”

      Mr. Thompson was the Chief Executive Officer of Pacific Investment 
      Management Company (PIMCO) from 1993-2009. Before that, he was chairman 
      of Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. in Tokyo from 1991 to 1993. Bill began his 
      career at Salomon Brothers in 1975, and held various positions before 
      moving to Japan, including Head of Corporate Finance, as well as Head of 
      Institutional Sales, both for the Western Region.
    

      “Bill’s long career in financial services and expertise in institutional 
      banking made him an invaluable resource to Citi as the firm refocused on 
      its core banking operations and enhanced risk management coming out of 
      the financial crisis,” said Citi Chairman Michael E. O’Neill.
    

      Mr. Thompson would have reached the mandatory retirement age from Citi’s 
      Board of Directors at the company’s next Annual Meeting in April 2018. 
      Mr. Thompson will remain actively involved with a number of 
      philanthropic and civic activities, including Pacific Symphony Orchestra 
      (Life Director), Thompson Foundation for Autism (Chair), Thompson Family 
      Foundation (President), University of Missouri (President's Financial 
      Advisory Council), and Orange County Community Foundation (Advisory 
      Director).
    

      O’Neill added, “As one of the longest serving members of the Board, 
      Bill’s contributions to the company are extensive, and his valuable 
      perspectives and commitment to serving our shareholders will be missed.”
    

      Following Mr. Thompson’s retirement, the Citi Board will consist of 14 
      directors, including Ellen M. Costello, Duncan P. Hennes, Peter Blair 
      Henry, Franz B. Humer, Renee J. James, Gene McQuade, Gary Reiner, 
      Anthony M. Santomero, Diana L. Taylor, James S. Turley, Deborah C. 
      Wright and Ernesto Zedillo, as well as Michael Corbat, Citi CEO, and 
      Michael E. O’Neill, Chairman.

Hi, thank you for taking time to visit my website! Let me first just say, my passion is Digital Marketing. Specifically, SEO, SEM and content marketing. I’ve been working professionally in marketing in some form or another for over 8 years. However, I’ve been working in web design and marketing for over 10. Before that, after getting my degree in Design/Animation, I had a career as a 3D and Character Animation artist for 10 years. I switched gears around 2008, after moving back to the Kansas City area, and started focusing on building websites, and was fascinated at how even the smallest changes in code and meta tags could affect the number of visitors coming in from Google. And…I was hooked.I had found a new passion that I didn’t even know I had.
Since then, I’ve been optimizing business websites, writing quality content, managing paid search campaigns, and working in all facets of digital and even print marketing. Success for me comes in even the smallest forms, such as lowering a bounce rate, or improving conversions and sales and ROI, or increasing exposure and branding. But that doesn’t mean my successes have been small. I’ve been proud to be part of some drastic improvements in traffic and conversions for both B2B and B2C customers and businesses.
Besides work, I am also passionate about skiing, hiking, biking, basketball, ping pong, great music and movies, and of course, the KC Chiefs and Royals. If you believe I might be a great fit with your business, please contact me and I’ll be thrilled to talk about my skills in more detail. Have a great day!

If you're looking for a kind, detail oriented, team player, William is it! He has a vast knowledge and is always willing to help out and find answers or work toward a solution. It's been wonderful working on the same team as 'Dink' and I know my skills have grown with the knowledge he easily shares with the team. He is very dependable, intelligent and willing to put in the work needed to support his customers and anyone on the team. Dink goes the extra mile for everyone around him. Dink is a great guy, coworker, employee and Web Presence Manager.

"I have had the distinct pleasure of working alongside Dink (or, "William") for just about a year on the Web Presence Management team. Coming into this position, I was lacking extensive knowledge in regards to search, and this was a frustration of mine. Ever cognizant of his team's well-being, Dink spent time with me ensuring I was well-informed and knowledgable enough to feel confident on the subject. Not only does Dink take good care of his team, he ensures his clients are pleased and informed as well. I've learned an incredible amount from him, and am undoubtedly better because of it. I would recommend Dink for any position in the digital space, and his uncanny ability to make those around him better is unrivaled."
