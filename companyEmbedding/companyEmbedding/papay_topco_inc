TOPCAP – Seismic Wine Barrel Rack Holder
 
 Earthquakes are inevitable in California and occur without warning.  Just such a disaster occurred last Sunday morning in Napa, California.
During an earthquake, wine cellars with barrels stacked on racks 4 to 6 high, begin rocking back and fourth violently. The result is that the top barrels become ejected from the stack. Followed by the rest of the barrels and racks to come tumbling down.
Case studies have shown that when the top barrels are secured, the stack has a much better chance of remaining upright.

Our Solution: The TOPCAP
This is a rack with a strap designed to reduce the risks involved with the top barrels falling during an earthquake and everyday service.
♦ Simple and effective design.
♦ Requires only one person to install and remove.
♦ Lightweight approximately 15 pounds.
♦ Works with all common racks and sizes, 2 and 4 barrels.
♦ Design based on testing and research performed at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, California.
♦ Inexpensive “insurance” against earthquakes.
Seismic Wine Barrel Holder
Earthquake Risk Managment
Earthquakes have long been feared as one of natures most terrifying and powerful phenomena. Although earthquakes cannot be prevented, modern science and engineering provide tools that can be used to reduce their effects.
A winery is a fragile production facility. Everyone needs to do their part to ensure that their winery is not left for loss in the next earthquake. The “TOPCAP” helps to protect your wine barrel stacks to enable you to accomplish the first essential step in winery risk management.

WR4 – Four Barrel Rack
 
 The Four Barrel Rack is the best option as far as cellar safety. The larger size has been proven to hold up to earthquakes better than the 2 barrel option.
