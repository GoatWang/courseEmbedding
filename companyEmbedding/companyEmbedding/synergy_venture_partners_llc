NeoCis Inc.NeoCis is developing a small profile robotic guidance system for the dental implant market, enabling implant specialists to place implants easily and precisely, which improves financial results and patient outcomes. The NeoCis system has numerous advantages over conventional surgery, which covers the majority of currently placed implants, and over drill guides, which are currently the best way to guarantee accuracy for complicated cases but which are less accurate and take days to prepare.  NeoCis received FDA approval for their YOMI robot in 2017.NeuroSave, Inc.NeuroSave is developing a therapeutic hypothermia system to locally cool the brain via esophageal lavage with cold saline.   Their device can cool rapidly and deeply, providing potential clinical benefits for stroke, cardiac arrest and cardiac surgery patients. Pulson Inc.Pulson has developed a wearable sensor-based smart feedback system to make aerobic exercise easier, more effective, safer and more fun.

																																																																																																																																																								easily and rapidly, using a retrograde approach.  Current research involves the use of novel plasma pulse to create channels through CTOs quickly and safely.RODO Medical Inc.RODO Medical has developed a unique dental implant retention system based on shape memory metal technology. Current screw or cement retention methods used in implant prosthetic dentistry are technically difficult, time consuming, and have long term complications or difficulties in revision.  The RODO SmileLok system retains the implant prosthesis utilizing a medical grade nickel-titanium shape memory alloy (“nitinol”). The crown can be removed by activating a nitinol component. The delivery or removal process takes minutes without damaging the crown and abutment.Sevident, Inc.Sevident is developing assays built on their patented molecular net technology that can allow extremely low limits of detection and fast test results.  The technology does not require the presence of whole, metabolically active bacteria in a given sample, because it also contains capture molecules to detect protein signatures and the bits and pieces of bacteria, thereby increasing sensitivity. Sevident's molecular net platform is highly flexible, with rapid product development cycles -- a new assay can move from design to working prototype in less than a month, due to the technology's simple design and straightforward manufacturing processes.Tribogenics Inc.Tribogenics is developing the world’s smallest and most portable X-ray devices based on a revolutionary patent-pending technology that eliminates the need for high voltage electricity.  Tribogenics technology will enable the creation of revolutionary X-ray devices including ultra-portable spectrometers for material analysis, low cost security screening systems, portable low-cost medical imaging systems, micro-implantable devices for radiation therapy as well as multi-pixel X-ray sources for 3D mammography.

About 
Founded in 2002 and headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Synergy Financial Partners is a private capital and consulting firm, providing entrepreneurs, private equity professionals and family offices with financial and business solutions.  Synergy Financial assists clients by providing access to growth capital, convertible debt and equity private placement financing.  
Synergy Financial’s mission is to partner with the best people and empower them with the capital and resources to build successful businesses.  A client of Synergy Financial has a true partner that will not only help with the short term growth of the business, but also the long term success of the operator and their company.  This value will not only come in the form of financial capital, but also a wealth of knowledge and a network of professionals to assist the operator and their management team.


 


Philosophy One of Synergy Financial’s core principles is to develop successful partnerships by utilizing our proprietary “1+1=3” philosophy.  Our ability to bring together the best investments with the best investors provides each group the opportunity to bring their unique talents to the partnership for the synergistic benefit of all parties.  It is this value that distinguishes us from other financial firms that are transaction focused as opposed to partnership focused like Synergy Financial.  Allow us to put our significant business and financial expertise together with yours to develop a partnership that will build tremendous value for all parties.
Our focus remains on opportunities to invest with companies, PE firms and families in promising industry sectors and to work in partnership with successful people.  We seek experienced GPs, operators and entrepreneurs who have a solid understanding of their business and industry as well as track records of building shareholder value.  Our partner will be able to clearly describe how their entry, or continued involvement in a market, will allow them to capture market share through superior products or services as compared to their competitors.

For Operators With Synergy Financial, GPs, operators and entrepreneurs benefit from a partner that commits more of themselves, our growth-focused expertise and our financial and operational diligence into your company. We have a deep bench of cycle-tested, experienced partners with a long-term vision that incorporates their financial strength and creativity, deep industry relationships and an entrepreneurial mindset at every stage of a company's lifecycle.
As a partner Synergy Financial will assist the management team in the preparation necessary to raise capital.  We will discuss and develop the business model and company strategy, financial results and the investment opportunity.  We will also advise on the optimal capital structure and funding needs for the business and assist in developing a business plan and materials for potential investors.


 

 


For Investors By utilizing our financial and business expertise as well as our extensive professional network, we will be able to deliver opportunities for investors with the goal to realize above average returns on their investment dollars.  Whether you are a successful business leader looking to assist a growth-stage company with capital and business know-how; or an investor seeking to take advantage of investment opportunities in tech-enabled businesses, energy or real estate deals; Synergy Financial can become a key partner in achieving your investment goals.
Synergy Financial has a vibrant network of professional relationships that yield a substantial number of attractive investment opportunities.  Our expertise is centered on analyzing investment opportunities from early-stage growth companies to mature private equity funds.  We bring only the best opportunities to our investors.
