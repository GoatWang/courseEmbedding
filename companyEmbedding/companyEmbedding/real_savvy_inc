The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Real Estate technology startup Real Savvy Inc. came out of stealth mode Thursday with a Pinterest-like application for prospective home buyers and their brokers.
The Austin-based company, which was launched in July by the former CEO of ATX Innovation Inc., developed a content management platform designed to enable brokers and their clients to collaborate. During a home search, brokers and clients collect and share different images and information about prospective buys or house features, CEO Rick Orr said.

The application is free for brokers and he considers Real Savvy to be in a pilot-program stage seeking validation of the business model versus beta testing. Orr expects to introduce a subscription-based product with "high-value analytics" during the first quarter of 2015.

In September, Real Savvy reported raising $223,000 from nine investors, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It now employs four workers, Orr said.
Orr, a real estate agent since 1998, has said the startup's strategy is to combine more "exciting" data with the information provided by the multiple listing service data. "We want consumers to have a much more intuitive home-search ability," he said.
Orr was previously the founding CEO of mobile application developer ATX Innovation Inc. Founded in 2009, ATX Innovation is best known as the developer of the Tabbedout mobile software that's designed to enable users to pay their restaurant and bar bills with a smartphone.

FAQs




1. How does RealSavvy work for clients? 

Clients can pin homes directly from RealSavvy or they can use our Chrome or Safari  browser extension to pin from their favorite home search sites, like Zillow or Trulia, onto Home Boards that you can collaborate on in real time. Clients can share Home Boards with spouses or roommates to bring everyone involved in their home search onto one central platform.




2. Will my clients be exposed to ads from other agents? 

Clients connected to an agent on RealSavvy never see any competing agents on the site and listings displayed on RealSavvy focus only on the listing agent making it a great place to send Clients for ad-free, accurate search.




4. Can I add homes to a Client's Home Board? 

Absolutely. If you and your Client share a Home Board together, you can pin homes to it directly from RealSavvy or you can use our browser extension to pin from other popular home search sites.




3. What if my client pins a home from another site that is no longer on the market?

Any time a Client pins a home to RealSavvy, we'll match the listing against our MLS data, which is licensed directly from the Austin Board of Realtors (ABoR). So they will instantly know whether a home they've pinned is truly still active.
