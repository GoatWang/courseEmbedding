Green Energy Building Consultations & Energy SolutionsAs of 7/21/2017
Our new address will be
1421 Guerneville Rd. Suite 106
Santa Rosa, CA 95403
At Rick’s Energy Solutions, we are among the nation’s top green building consultants, and a leading name in energy conservation. Based in Santa Rosa, California, we service the city and surrounding areas, focusing heavily on homeowners, architects and home designers. If you are in need of a home energy audit or if you own a company in Northern California, looking for consulting and energy solutions, we are here to meet your needs.
 
About Our Services
 
Rick’s Energy Solutions consists of multi-skilled experts who have 40 years of experience in the construction industry. We are certified energy plan examiners, certified energy analysts, certified green building professionals, certified GreenPoint raters, certified home energy rating system raters (HERS raters) and certified CALGreen special inspectors. We can even help with the preparation and submission of required documentation for California Title 24 energy conservation and Green Building submissions. We are passionate about green energy solutions and we know the business inside and out.
 
At Rick’s Energy Solutions, we assist homeowners in making their living spaces more energy efficient and eco-friendly. It all begins by understanding the home as a comprehensive system and understanding how well your household performs through a home energy audit. This involves evaluating your home for its green building environmental impacts and its carbon footprint. Most houses do not operate to their fullest energy potential, even if the houses are newly constructed. Many homes leak air conditioning during the summer and heat during the winter due to faulty vent installation, windows with poor retention and myriad other reasons.
 
Finding Issues and Improving Efficiency
 
A lot of lighting and appliances utilize more energy than needed to function. This is incredibly wasteful, but very difficult to detect. Many air ducts leak, which wastes heated and cooled air. In addition, many water fixtures are wasteful, using more water than necessary for typical applications. These are all aspects our HERS raters look for in your home, during our audit. We identify hidden issues and offer solutions to help your home consume less energy and resources without requiring you to make any lifestyle changes. These solutions include duct redesign, air sealing, lighting and appliance upgrades, window upgrade, faucet and water fixture replacement and more. All energy problems in your home can be met by our efficient energy solutions.
 
Our services are very important when it comes to architects, designers and contractors. These people are responsible for the construction of future homes and commercial buildings and renovations of existing structures. When we work with them in helping to shape their next projects, you can rest assured that we are setting a new energy-smart status quo for buildings to come.
 
One Team Providing Smart Energy Solutions
 
It is very much a team effort. When working with architects, it is our job to prepare the documentation required for obtaining the Energy Star rating on new homes. The architects are the ones who bring the eco-friendly visions to life. We also prepare the documentation required to submit to the IRS for tax rebates for energy conservation measures. At Rick’s Energy Solutions, we make sure that designers, contractors and architects are up to par with the best knowledge, techniques and technologies when it comes to energy efficiency. It is our way of nipping energy problems in the bud. We consult on such projects as home additions, remodeling jobs and the construction of entirely new homes and commercial buildings to ensure the highest quality of environmental friendliness.
 
When it comes to energy solutions in Santa Rosa California and the surrounding areas, including Sonoma, Mendocino, Lake, Marin and Napa counties, Rick’s Energy Solutions is the most efficient and affordable option. We have more than 40 years of experience in the construction industry, with 25 of those years working in building inspection and plans examination. Our team is equipped to handle any project from all angles imaginable. We have our finger on the pulse of what is needed in terms of the most up-to-date energy-efficient conservation techniques and know the logistics that are involved with making everything come together effectively.
 
We also work closely with architects, contractors and homeowners. We could not do what we do without their skills and cooperation. There is no other green building consultant or energy conservation construction company that has all of their bases covered the way we do. The best defense is a good offense.
 
Get Started on Becoming More Energy Efficient Today
 
Rick’s Energy Solutions is privileged to be doing such important work that affects both our futures and yours alike. If you are a homeowner, a home designer, an architect or a contractor, we would love nothing more than to give you an evaluation of your home or planned project. Our consultation service can help you identify improvements that can be made at your home to help protect the environment and even shape the future of how buildings are constructed.
 
We offer both home and commercial energy audits, and are certified by the California Association of Building Energy Consultants (CABEC), Build It Green, Efficiency First, the International Code Council (ICC) and CalCERTs. We could not be prouder of our company’s past successes, and we are laser focused on the horizon of energy conservation.
 
As energy conservation and green building consultants, we’re standing by to assist homeowners, contractors and designers alike in identifying home energy solutions, preparing and submitting California Title 24 energy conservation and Green Building compliance documents, recommending small changes to improve efficiency and much more. Contact us today by calling 707-578-5380 and lets work to create a better, more energy-efficient tomorrow!

Certified Green Home Energy Plans & Analysis in Santa Rosa - Ricks Energy Solutions
























































 























Office: 707.578.5380
Mobile: 707.529.2570
Rick@rc-networks.com
























Green Home Energy Plans & AnalysisThe following is a list of the tests that we conduct when doing a Green Home Energy Analysis.
1. Combustion Safety and Heating Related Tests.
These tests and inspections are conducted in the heating and cooling equipment area of your house.

Carbon Monoxide Tests
We look for excess carbon monoxide in the flue gases of your heating appliances and in the air of your house.
Drafting Tests
An evaluation of the risk that the combustion gases in building’s flue(s) will be pulled back into your house by a source of negative pressure
Combustion Efficiency Test
A measurement of the efficiency of your heating system. A higher number means that more of the energy goes into your house.
Flue Inspection
An examination of your combustion equipment flue pipes for blockages or other hazardous conditions.
HVAC Equipment Inspection 
A visual inspection examines the overall condition of your heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment.
Duct Air Flow Estimate
This test estimates the amount of air moving through your duct system. Too little air movement in your ducts will affect the comfort and efficiency of your heating and/or cooling system.

2. Health and Durability Inspections.

Moisture Sources and Damage
As part of a walk through of the house, your inspector looks for areas where there is evidence of high humidity or moisture damage.
Indoor Air Pollution Sources
Also as part of a walk through of the house, your inspector looks for areas where there is evidence of potential sources of indoor air pollution.
House Durability Inspection
The inspector looks for areas where there is evidence of maintenance problems affecting the durability of your house.
Insulation and Envelope Inspection
An examination and measurement of the insulation levels in various areas of your building’s “shell.”
Roof and Attic Inspection
The inspector examines the roof and attic for evidence of maintenance problems.
Exhaust Fan Duct Condition
Finally, as part of a walk-through of the house, your inspector examines the condition of your exhaust fan ductwork for length and condition. Too long of a duct run can cause moisture problems, and leaky exhaust ducts can put damaging amounts of moisture into your house.

3. Whole House Performance Tests.

Exhaust Fan Flow
This test measures the ability of your exhaust fan systems to remove air from your house. Not enough airflow means the fan is making noise but not moving air.
Blower Door Test
A comprehensive test measures the leakiness of your house. The building is pressurized and de-pressurized and a measurement of air leakage is performed.
Duct Leakage
A similar test that measures the leakiness of your duct system.
Pressure Mapping
This test helps to determine the unintentional air flows that occur when the heating and cooling fan is on. A second test looks at the unintentional connectedness of various spaces such as attics, basements and garages to your house.

4. Energy Analysis.

Historical Electrical Consumption
Analysis of one year’s worth of historical electric bills. Identify possible savings through photovoltaic. Verify rate schedule is optimized.
Historical Gas Consumption 
Determine viability of renewable heat sources such as solar thermal, solar pool heating, flash hot water systems, etc.
Lighting
Lighting bulbs and fixtures can be replaced with more efficient bulbs and fixtures that last longer and pay for themselves.
Appliances
Energy Star appliances save money and provide high performance. Appliances are identified as potentially benefiting from an upgrade to an Energy Star Appliance.
Pool / Hot Tub / Pond / Well Pump Analysis
Check pumps for sizing and efficiency. Look for ways to time pumping to reduce costs.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
