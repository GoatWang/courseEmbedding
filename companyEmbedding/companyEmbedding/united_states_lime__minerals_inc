United States Lime & Minerals Inc. Digs Up Another Solid Quarter
The lime and limestone product maker benefited from increased demand from environmental and roof shingle customers during the quarter.

Sleepy materials maker U.S. Lime & Minerals (NASDAQ:USLM) reported another quiet quarter. That is after increasing demand for the company's core lime and limestone products led to mid-single-digit growth on both the top and bottom lines. While weak commodity prices continue to weigh down the company's energy-sensitive revenues, it is more than making up for it with stronger demand from other customer segments.

Data source: U.S. Lime & Minerals. YOY = year over year.
What happened with U.S. Lime this quarter? 
Environmental and roof shingle customers picked up the slack this quarter.

The company's core lime and limestone operations continue to do the heavy lifting. Revenue was up 4.5% to $38.1 million on increased sales volumes to environmental and roof shingle customers, which offset reduced demand from oil and gas customers. That said, while demand was up, pricing was somewhat lower from the year-ago quarter.
Meanwhile, revenue from the company's natural gas interests finally stopped plunging. Overall, revenue was basically flat at $0.6 million. While production declined from 177,000 MCF to 156,000 MCF, the average price increased from $3.25 per MCF to $3.56 per MCF.
Gross profit in the company's lime and limestone operations rose from $10.3 million to $10.5 million, while gross profit from its natural gas segment edged up as well.






What management had to say 
CEO Timothy Byrne commented on the quarter by saying:

We are pleased that overall demand for our lime and limestone products increased in the third quarter 2016, although pricing remains a challenge in the current competitive environment.

Byrne laments that U.S. Lime does not have much pricing power in the current environment. That said, while aggregate producing rivals Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) and Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) have yet to report their third-quarter results, both have pushed through price increases this year. In Vulcan's case, its aggregates shipments expanded 3% during the second quarter while aggregates pricing rose 7%. Martin Marietta, likewise, saw a 7% increase in aggregates pricing in the second quarter, on 4.9% volume growth. These higher prices could be due to their much larger scale, which provides greater diversity of product type and more pricing power. 
Looking forward 
While U.S. Lime did not offer any forward guidance in its earnings release, we can look at what rivals are saying to get an idea of what to expect. For example, Martin Marietta's CEO Ward Nye said last quarter that his company remains "highly optimistic as we look toward the second half of the year and well beyond." Likewise, Tom Hill, CEO of Vulcan Materials, said last quarter that the "fundamentals of our aggregates-focused business remain attractive" which reinforced his confidence in the outlook for both 2016 and the longer term. Given that U.S. Lime's third-quarter results did not disappoint, this would imply that, like its rivals, it should continue to see steady growth in the quarters ahead.

Rebounding Oil and Gas Sales Fuel United States Lime & Minerals Inc.'s Q2 Results
The lime and limestone product maker continued to benefit from both higher limestone sales to oil and gas services customers and the impact that improving gas prices has on its natural gas interests.

U.S. Lime & Minerals (NASDAQ:USLM) continues to benefit from a rebound in oil and gas prices. Not only is it fueling demand for its lime and limestone products, but those higher prices are also providing a boost to the profitability of its natural gas interests.

What happened with U.S. Lime this quarter? 
Demand picked up in the second quarter:

Revenue from the company's lime and limestone operations jumped 11.1% to $36 million thanks to a rebound in sales to both construction and oil and gas services customers. However, one of the drivers of the year-over-year improvement in demand from construction customers is that heavy rain negatively affected last year's second quarter. The company also benefited from slightly higher realized prices for its lime and limestone products.
Higher natural gas prices drove a 9.7% increase in revenue from its natural gas interests. Overall, the company realized 21.2% more for its gas in the quarter, which enabled it to overcome a 9.6% drop in volumes resulting from the natural decline of production.
Those dual fuels helped drive profit growth for the company. Overall, its lime and limestone operations reported $8.7 million in gross profit for the quarter, up from $7.2 million in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, gross profit in its natural gas interests rose to $0.1 million, which reversed a year-ago loss of $0.04 million.






What management had to say 
CEO Timothy Byrne commented on the company's second-quarter results:

We are pleased that our second-quarter 2017 revenues and operating results improved over last year's second quarter as our lime and limestone operations continued to see a rebound in demand from our oil and gas services customers, as well as increased demand from our construction customers.

Last year at this time, the company's customers were battling heavy rain and weak oil and gas prices, which muted demand. However, with those headwinds abating this year, customers were able to get back to work, which drove up demand for U.S. Lime's products.
Looking forward 
Despite the good news, the improving demand in the oil patch might start fading later this year because of the slump in oil prices over the past few months. In fact, according to leading oil-field service company Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), U.S. drillers are already "tapping on the brakes." While Halliburton doesn't expect drilling activities to decline, it does see the rig count "showing signs of plateauing." That suggests that U.S. Lime's ability to capture higher volumes and prices might not continue in the coming quarters.

      UNITED STATES LIME & MINERALS REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2017 RESULTS AND DECLARES REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND
    

      Dallas, Texas, July 26, 2017 - United States Lime & Minerals, Inc. (NASDAQ: USLM) today reported second quarter 2017 results: Revenues in the second quarter 2017 were $36.5 million, compared to $32.9 million in the comparable prior year quarter, an increase of $3.6 million, or 11.1%. Revenues from the Company's lime and limestone operations in the second quarter 2017 increased $3.6 million, or 11.1%, to $36.0 million from $32.4 million in the comparable 2016 quarter, while revenues from its natural gas interests increased $49 thousand, or 9.7%, to $0.6 million from $0.5 million in the comparable prior year quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, revenues were $72.7 million, compared to $66.5 million in the comparable 2016 period, an increase of $6.2 million, or 9.3%. Revenues from the Company's lime and limestone operations in the first six months 2017 increased $6.0 million, or 9.1%, to $71.5 million from $65.5 million in the comparable 2016 period, while revenues from its natural gas interests increased $0.3 million, or 27.0%, to $1.2 million from $0.9 million in the comparable prior year period.
    

      The increases in lime and limestone revenues in the second quarter and first six months 2017, as compared to last year's comparable periods, resulted primarily from increased sales volumes of the Company's lime and limestone products due to increased demand, principally from its construction customers and oil and gas services customers.
    

      Demand from construction customers was adversely impacted in the second quarter 2016 due to numerous days of rainfall during the quarter. Prices realized for the Company's lime and limestone products in the 2017 periods were slightly higher compared to the comparable 2016 periods.
    

      Production volumes from the Company's natural gas interests in the second quarter 2017 totaled 142 thousand MCF, sold at an average price of $3.89 per MCF, compared to 157 thousand MCF, sold at an average price of $3.21 per MCF, in the comparable 2016 quarter. Production volumes in the first six months 2017 from natural gas interests totaled 288 thousand MCF, sold at an average price of $4.12 per MCF, compared to the first six months 2016 when 318 thousand MCF was produced and sold at an average price of $2.95 per MCF. The Company's 2017 average prices per MCF were higher than the prior year's average prices primarily due to increases in natural gas and natural gas liquids prices.
    

      The Company's gross profit was $8.8 million in the second quarter 2017, compared to $7.2 million in the comparable 2016 quarter, an increase of $1.6 million, or 22.1%. Gross profit in the first six months 2017 was $17.1 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or 13.2%, from $15.1 million in the first six months 2016.
    

      Included in gross profit in the second quarter and first six months 2017 were $8.7 million and $16.7 million, respectively, from the Company's lime and limestone operations, compared to $7.2 million and $15.2 million, respectively, in the comparable 2016 periods. The increased gross profit for the Company's lime and limestone operations in the second quarter and first six months 2017 resulted primarily from the increased revenues discussed above.

Rebounding Oil and Gas Sales Fuel United States Lime & Minerals Inc.'s Q2 Results
The lime and limestone product maker continued to benefit from both higher limestone sales to oil and gas services customers and the impact that improving gas prices has on its natural gas interests.

U.S. Lime & Minerals (NASDAQ:USLM) continues to benefit from a rebound in oil and gas prices. Not only is it fueling demand for its lime and limestone products, but those higher prices are also providing a boost to the profitability of its natural gas interests.

What happened with U.S. Lime this quarter? 
Demand picked up in the second quarter:

Revenue from the company's lime and limestone operations jumped 11.1% to $36 million thanks to a rebound in sales to both construction and oil and gas services customers. However, one of the drivers of the year-over-year improvement in demand from construction customers is that heavy rain negatively affected last year's second quarter. The company also benefited from slightly higher realized prices for its lime and limestone products.
Higher natural gas prices drove a 9.7% increase in revenue from its natural gas interests. Overall, the company realized 21.2% more for its gas in the quarter, which enabled it to overcome a 9.6% drop in volumes resulting from the natural decline of production.
Those dual fuels helped drive profit growth for the company. Overall, its lime and limestone operations reported $8.7 million in gross profit for the quarter, up from $7.2 million in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, gross profit in its natural gas interests rose to $0.1 million, which reversed a year-ago loss of $0.04 million.






What management had to say 
CEO Timothy Byrne commented on the company's second-quarter results:

We are pleased that our second-quarter 2017 revenues and operating results improved over last year's second quarter as our lime and limestone operations continued to see a rebound in demand from our oil and gas services customers, as well as increased demand from our construction customers.

Last year at this time, the company's customers were battling heavy rain and weak oil and gas prices, which muted demand. However, with those headwinds abating this year, customers were able to get back to work, which drove up demand for U.S. Lime's products.
Looking forward 
Despite the good news, the improving demand in the oil patch might start fading later this year because of the slump in oil prices over the past few months. In fact, according to leading oil-field service company Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), U.S. drillers are already "tapping on the brakes." While Halliburton doesn't expect drilling activities to decline, it does see the rig count "showing signs of plateauing." That suggests that U.S. Lime's ability to capture higher volumes and prices might not continue in the coming quarters.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
