We estimate that the net proceeds to us from our issuance and sale of
3,500,000 ADSs in this offering will be approximately $17.9 million, based on an
assumed initial public offering price of $5.80 per ADS, which is the midpoint of
the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

If the underwriters' option to purchase additional ADSs in this offering is
exercised in full, we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be
approximately $20.7 million, based on an assumed offering price of $5.80 per
ADS, which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this
prospectus, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for:

• conducting research and development activities in order to conduct additional
  clinical trials, expand our pipeline of product candidates and pursue 
  additional indications for our existing product candidates, estimated at 
  approximately $8.0 million;

• the scale-up of our manufacturing capabilities, estimated at approximately 
  $5.0 million;

• the establishment of sales and marketing capabilities for the European market,
  estimated at approximately $1.5 million; and

• the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, including 
  funding the costs of operating as a public company in the United States and 
  Israel.

These expected uses of net proceeds from this offering represent our intentions 
based upon our current plans and business conditions which could change in the 
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of 
our actual expenditures may vary significantly and will depend upon numerous 
factors, including the progress of our development and commercialization 
efforts, the status of and results from our clinical trials and preclinical 
studies, whether or not we enter into strategic collaborations or partnerships,
the amount of cash available from other sources, and our operating costs and 
expenditures. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility and
broad discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering.

We expect proceeds from this offering to meet our capital requirements for at 
least the next three years. The proceeds of this offering will not be sufficient
to achieve any additional marketing approval of our product candidates. We will 
need substantial additional capital in order to independently pursue FDA or 
other regulatory approvals of any of our product candidates. The ability to 
pursue further regulatory approvals of our product candidates will be dependent 
upon, among other things, our ability to enter into partnerships and 
collaborations, to execute additional financings, and to generate net income 
from our operations.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in low-risk, 
high-quality, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit, or direct
or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government or other governments, or hold
as cash.

We have no current commitments or binding agreements with respect to any
material acquisition of or investment in any technologies, products, or 
companies other than our own plans and business.


We are not aware of any competitors that produce human collagen from plants
or that produce recombinant type I human collagen. However, our industry is
characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition, and our
rhCollagen-based product candidates will compete with several alternative
tissue-derived or synthetic products. Adequate protection of intellectual
property, successful product development, adequate funding, and retention of
skilled, experienced, and professional personnel are among the many factors
critical to success in the pharmaceutical industry.

Generally, our competitors currently include large fully integrated
companies, as well as academic research institutes and companies in various
developmental stages that develop alternative sources and forms of collagen and
tissue-derived products.

Our VergenixSTR product candidate will compete with companies that sell
steroid injections and PRP kits, including Biomet Inc., Arthrex Inc., Harvest
Technologies Corporation, MTF Sports Medicine, and Arteriocyte Medical
Systems Inc.

The primary competitors to our VergenixFG product candidate are products based 
on tissue-derived collagens. Manufacturers of these products include, among 
others, Integra Lifesciences Corporation, Wright Medical Technology Inc., Smith 
& Nephew, Molnlycke, Convatec, Coloplast, and Urgo.

The CollPlant Surgical Matrix will compete primarily with Medtronic Inc.'s 
INFUSE bone graft product, which combines a recombinant bone growth protein and
bovine-based collagen; Nuvasive Inc.'s Osteocel, a cellular bone matrix product;
and Othrofix's TRINITY ELITE allograft product.


Company Description
We are a clinical-stage regenerative medicine company focused on developing and 
commercializing tissue repair products, initially for the orthobiologics and
advanced wound care markets. Our product candidates are based on our rhCollagen,
a form of human collagen produced with our proprietary


 plant-based genetic
engineering technology. We believe our technology is the only commercially
viable technology available for the production of genetically engineered, or
recombinant, human collagen. We believe that our rhCollagen, which is identical
to the type I collagen produced by the human body, has significant advantages
compared to currently marketed tissue-derived collagens, including improved
biofunctionality, superior homogeneity, and reduced risk of immune response. We
believe the attributes of our rhCollagen make it suitable for numerous tissue
repair applications in orthobiologics and advanced wound care throughout the
human body. Orthobiologics use cell-based therapies and biomaterials to promote
healing. Advanced wound care is composed of biocompatible products that are
intended to actively promote wound healing by interacting either directly or
indirectly with wound tissues. We believe that the annual market opportunity for
our current product candidates utilizing our rhCollagen within the
orthobiologics and advanced wound care markets exceeds $5 billion. We have not
generated any material revenue from product sales to date. We have incurred
losses in each year since our inception in 2004, and have an accumulated deficit
of $40.3 million as of September 30, 2016. Our recurring net losses and negative
cash flows from operations have raised substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern, and as a result, our independent registered public
accounting firm has noted this in the opinion they issued on our consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. We anticipate that we
will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and we may never be
profitable.

Our VergenixSTR product candidate is a soft tissue repair matrix which combines 
cross-linked rhCollagen with platelet-rich plasma, or PRP, and is intended to 
accelerate healing in the treatment of tendinopathy. In August 2016, we 
completed an open label, single arm, multi-center clinical trial of VergenixSTR
in Israel. In October 2016, we received CE marking certification for 
VergenixSTR, which is required for a product to be marketed in the European
Union. In November 2016, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement
with Arthrex GmbH in Munich, Germany, an affiliate of Arthrex, Inc. for
VergenixSTR covering Europe, the Middle East, India, and certain African
countries.

Our VergenixFG product candidate is a wound-filling flowable gel made from our 
rhCollagen intended to enhance the quality and speed of closure of deep surgical
incisions and wounds, including diabetic ulcers, burns, bedsores, and other 
chronic wounds. We completed an open label, single arm, multi-center clinical 
trial of VergenixFG in Israel to support CE marking certification. In February 
2016, we received CE marking certification for VergenixFG, and in July 2016, we 
supplied our first order in Europe. To bring our initial two product candidates
to market, we intend to first commercialize the product candidates in Europe and
expect to pursue U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approval, under the
pre-market approval, or PMA regulatory pathway, for our rhCollagen-based 
products.

We are developing a bone graft surgical matrix, which we refer to as the 
CollPlant Surgical Matrix, in collaboration with Bioventus LLC, or Bioventus, a
global leader in active orthopedic healing. The CollPlant Surgical Matrix is a
novel resorbable carrier composed of rhCollagen and synthetic minerals which is
intended to be charged with a bone morphogenic protein, or BMP, developed by
Bioventus for use as a bone graft substitute in bone repair indications such as
spinal fusion and trauma. The CollPlant Surgical Matrix charged with a BMP,
which we refer to as the Bioventus product candidate, is intended to stimulate
the recruitment and differentiation of bone-forming cells, which can heal
existing bone and produce new natural bone. We are party to a non-binding term
sheet entered into on July 9, 2015 with Bioventus for the license and supply of
the CollPlant Surgical Matrix. In anticipation of filing an Investigational New
Drug application, or IND, Bioventus is undertaking preclinical animal studies
comparing the Collplant Surgical Matrix to other active comparators. While
negotiations for a binding license and supply agreement are ongoing, no license
and supply agreement has been entered into and there can be no assurance that we
will enter into any definitive agreement with Bioventus.

Our rhCollagen has superior biological function when compared to any 
tissue-derived collagens, whether from animal or human tissues, according to
data published in peer-reviewed scientific publications. Our rhCollagen can be
fabricated in different forms, shapes, and viscosities including gels, pastes,
sponges, sheets, membranes, fibers, and thin coats, all of which have been
tested in vitro and in animal models and proven superior to tissue-derived
products. These different forms of our rhCollagen broaden the potential
applications of our products. For example, collagen gels made of our rhCollagen
are more homogenous and less viscous compared to tissue-derived collagens,
making the rhCollagen gels ideal for any injectable product. We have
demonstrated that, due to its homogeneity, rhCollagen can produce fibers and
membranes with high molecular order, meaning all the molecules are oriented in
the same direction, which enables the formation of tissue repair products with
distinctive physical properties, including improved tensile strength due to the
alignment of the collagen fibers, higher levels of transparency, and the ability
to achieve high concentrations of collagen at low viscosities. The unique
properties of our rhCollagen make it an ideal building block for many products
such as BioInks for 3-D printing, artificial tendons, and transparent ophthalmic
products that we believe cannot currently be produced using tissue-derived
collagens.

The production of our rhCollagen begins when five human genes essential for the 
production of collagen are introduced into a tobacco plant. The genetically
engineered tobacco plantlets are distributed to qualified greenhouses across
Israel, where they are grown to maturity, which takes about eight weeks. The
tobacco leaves are then harvested and processed to an extract, which undergoes
purification until the final rhCollagen product is produced. Cost-effective
production, the abundant supply of raw materials, and the resulting product,
pristine human collagen, are the most important features of plant-based
production. We are advancing a new production process that we believe will
result in higher yields and labor cost reductions, assuring adequate supply as
demand for rhCollagen increases.

Wound Care




    The global market for wound care encompasses traditional dressings and bandages, as well as advanced wound care products such as bioengineered skin and skin substitutes and wound care growth factors. Over the past 30 years, there has been a shift from traditional wound dressings towards advanced therapies that aim to optimize the wound healing environment. Advanced wound care is composed of biocompatible products that are intended to actively promote wound healing by interacting either directly or indirectly with wound tissues. Attempts to reduce the duration of hospital stays in order to limit healthcare costs and the goal of enhancing therapeutic outcomes are driving the demand for advanced wound care and closure products. One of the primary market drivers for advanced wound care products is the increasing incidence of chronic wounds, which are on the rise due to an aging population and a sharp rise in the incidence of diabetes and obesity worldwide. Both advanced age and chronic medical conditions are associated with a slower healing process, and all phases of wound healing are affected. The inflammatory response is decreased or delayed, as is the proliferative response. Espicom estimates that the global market for advanced wound care in 2013 had reached $6.2 billion, representing a growth rate of approximately 5% since 2012. 
With a wide range of dressings to choose from, dressing selection is a significant challenge for wound care clinicians. The ideal dressing should induce rapid healing at reasonable cost with minimal inconvenience to the patient. In a healing wound, a cascade of events occurs that includes platelet accumulation, inflammation, fibroblast proliferation, cell contraction, angiogenesis, and re epithelization, ultimately leading to scar formation and wound remodeling. Collagen plays an important role in each of these phases of wound healing. Native intact collagen provides a natural scaffold or substrate for new tissue growth. Dressings containing collagen are thought to provide the wound with an alternative collagen source that is degraded over time, leaving the endogenous native collagen to continue normal wound healing.
Advanced wound dressings have the benefit of forming part of the natural tissue matrix and some of them play an important role in natural wound healing and new tissue formation. These characteristics make them the most attractive and fastest growing segment of the overall advanced wound care market, experiencing double digit growth in 2013. In certain instances, these matrices are incorporated with compounds such as growth factors and antimicrobials for delivery to the wound site. There are a number of advanced wound care dressings available that incorporate tissue derived collagen to enhance wound bed preparation.

 We are initially focused on the orthobiologics and advanced wound care markets. GlobalData recently estimated that the major segments of the orthobiologics market, including bone allograft, bone graft substitutes, and viscosupplementation, currently comprise an annual $6.7 billion worldwide market. The overall increase in prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders combined with technological advancements in the orthobiologics field are fueling the growth of this market, resulting in a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 7.7% in the North American market from 2014 to 2019, as predicted by MicroMarket Monitor. The advanced wound care market, which includes device based wound care, moist wound care products, and biologics, was estimated by Espicom to be $6.2 billion in 2013, representing a growth rate of approximately 5% since 2012.
We believe the market opportunity for our current product candidates utilizing our rhCollagen platform technology exceeds $5 billion.
