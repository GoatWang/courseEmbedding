Quality Growth Fund (MFGIX)

Investment Objective - The investment objective of the Monteagle Quality Growth Fund is long-term capital appreciation.
                Principal Investment Strategy - Monteagle Quality Growth Fund (the "Fund") uses a "growth investing" style by investing under normal circumstances at least 80 percent of its assets in the common stock of domestic companies that its sub-adviser believes have superior growth potential and fundamental characteristics that are significantly better than the market average and support internal earnings growth capability. The Fund only invests in companies that have a minimum market capitalization of $250 million at the time of purchase, and seeks to maintain a minimum average weighted market capitalization of $5 billion.
Principal Risks
Risks in General. Domestic economic growth and market conditions, interest rate levels, and political events are among the factors affecting the securities markets of the Fund’s investments. There is the risk that these and other factors may adversely affect the Fund’s performance. The loss of money is a risk of investing in the Fund. The Fund could underperform other investments. 
Investment Selection Risk. The Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective is dependent on the Sub-adviser’s ability to identify profitable investment opportunities for the Fund. 
Small and Mid Capitalization Risk. The Fund may invest in small and medium capitalization companies which involve greater risks than those associated with larger, more established companies. Smaller companies may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements. 
An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is not a complete investment program.

The Texas Fund 
      (BIGTX - Institutional Shares)

Investment Objective – The investment objective of The Texas Fund (the “Fund”) is long-term capital appreciation.  The Fund is an equity fund.
    Principal Investment Strategy – The Fund’s principal investment strategy is to invest at least 80% of its assets, less any borrowing for investment purposes, in the common stock of companies either (i) headquartered in Texas based on information provided by Morningstar, Inc., (ii) organized under the laws of Texas, or (iii) that, during the most recent fiscal year, derived at least 50% of its revenues or profits from goods produced or sold, investments made, or services performed in Texas or that have at least 50% of its assets in Texas.  In determining whether a company meets this condition, the Sub-Adviser may rely on such information and sources as the Sub-Adviser deems reasonable and appropriate.
 The Fund will be invested across a broad market capitalization spectrum, including small, mid and large capitalization companies.  The Sub-Adviser typically selects companies in which to invest by performing an initial market capitalization screening of $1,000,000,000 or more.  The Sub-Adviser controls for Fund risks by performing fundamental analyses of the initially screened companies.  The Sub-Adviser analyzes factors such as financial conditions, industry position, and market and economic conditions and trends to select investments and make buy and sell decisions.  Once the Sub-Adviser selects companies in which to invest, the Sub-Adviser initially equally weights the companies within each sector.  The Sub-Adviser does not equally weight each sector within the Fund. 
 The Fund will not invest 25% or more of its assets in any industry or group of related industries.  However, the Fund does intend to have a high level of investments in the oil and gas industry due to the Fund’s management team’s belief that such industry has superior growth opportunities.  Except as otherwise permitted by the Fund’s non-fundamental policies, any concentration in a specific sector or industry will be under this 25% concentration threshold. 
Principal Investment Risks An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of some or all of the principal amount invested.There can be no assurance that the Fund will be successful in meeting its investment objective.Generally, the Fund will be subject to the following additional risks:
    Investment Selectiona Risk. The Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective is dependent on the Sub-Adviser’s ability to identify profitable investment opportunities for the Fund.
      Market Risk. The value of securities in the Fund’s portfolio may decline due to daily fluctuations in the securities markets, including fluctuation in interest rates, national and international economic conditions and general equity market conditions. 
Business and Sector Risk. From time to time, a particular set of circumstances may affect a particular industry or certain companies within an industry, while having little or no impact on other industries or other companies within the industry. 
Geographic Concentration Risk. The Fund’s investments are concentrated in Texas, and therefore the Fund will be susceptible to adverse market, political, regulatory, social, economic and geographic events affecting Texas.The Fund’s performance may be more volatile than the performance of more geographically diverse funds.Since one of the main industries in Texas is mining and logging, including the oil and gas sectors, Texas is particularly susceptible to economic, environmental and political activities affecting this industry. 
Oil and Gas Sector Risk. Companies in the oil and gas sector may have significant operations in areas at risk for natural disasters, social unrest and environmental damage.These companies may also be at risk for increased government regulations and intervention, litigation, and negative publicity and perception. 
Large Company Risk. The Fund may invest in larger, more established companies, which may be unable to respond to new competitive challenges.Additionally, large companies may be unable to attain the high growth rates of successful, small companies, especially during extended periods of economic expansion. 
Small and Mid-Capitalization Company Risk. The Fund may invest in small and medium capitalization companies which involve greater risks than those associated with larger, more established companies.Smaller companies may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements. 
New Portfolio Managers Risk. Although the Fund’s Portfolio Managers have managed individual separate accounts in the past, they have not had previous experience managing a mutual fund prior to serving as the Portfolio Managers for the Fund, which may limit the Portfolio Managers’ effectiveness. 
New Fund Risk. The Fund was formed in September, 2013, and the Sub-Adviser has not previously managed an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.Accordingly, investors in the Fund bear the risk that the Fund may not be successful in implementing its investment strategy. 
An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.The Fund is not a complete investment program.

Value Fund (MVRGX)

Investment Objective - The investment objective of the Monteagle Value Fund is long term growth of capital.
                Principal Investment Strategy - The Fund takes a long-term (or "buy and hold") approach to managing the Fund's portfolio. The Fund invests primarily in common stocks of medium and large capitalization U.S. companies (those with market capitalizations of $1 billion or more) that are believed to be undervalued based on value characteristics, such as lower relative price valuations, above average earnings per share growth and higher dividend yields compared to the S&P 500 Index. The stock will be sold when the stock is no longer undervalued or when the fundamentals of the company that affect revenue and profitability have changed significantly, either in a positive or negative direction.
Principal Risks
Risks in General. Domestic economic growth and market conditions, interest rate levels, and political events are among the factors affecting the securities markets of the Fund’s investments. There is the risk that these and other factors may adversely affect the Fund’s performance. The loss of money is a risk of investing in the Fund. The Fund could underperform other investments. 
Investment Selection Risk. The Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective is dependent on the Sub-adviser’s ability to identify profitable investment opportunities for the Fund. 
Company Risk. The Fund might decrease in value in response to the activities and financial prospects of an individual company in the Fund’s portfolio. The value of an individual company can be more volatile than the market as a whole. 
Volatility Risk. Common stocks tend to be more volatile than other investment choices. Because the Fund will emphasize various growth industries, the value of your shares is likely to be more volatile than a fund that invests in a broader range of industries. 
Portfolio Turnover Risk. Generally, the Fund intends to invest for long-term purposes. However, the Fund’s rate of portfolio turnover will depend upon market and other conditions, and it will not be a limiting factor when the Sub-adviser believes that portfolio changes are necessary or appropriate. Periods of portfolio “repositioning” may result in a high portfolio turnover rate. A high portfolio turnover would result in correspondingly greater brokerage commission expenses and may result in the distribution to shareholders of additional capital gains for tax purposes. These factors may negatively affect the Fund’s performance. 
Small and Mid Capitalization Risk. The Fund may invest in mid-capitalization companies which involve greater risks than those associated with larger, more established companies. Smaller companies may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements, for reasons including that the stocks are generally traded in lower volume and that the issuers are more sensitive to changing conditions and have less certain growth prospects. 
Sector Risks. While the Fund will not concentrate its investments in any one industry or group of related industries by investing more than 25% of the portfolio, the Fund may make significant investments in certain sectors or group of sectors within a particular industry or industries from time to time. 
Value Style Risk. The Fund invests in a style that emphasizes “value stocks”. The market may not agree with the determination that a stock is undervalued, and the stock’s price may not increase to what the Fund’s investment adviser or Sub-adviser believes is its full value. It may even decrease in value. 
An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is not a complete investment program.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1277 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Above Average because they fall between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks long-term capital appreciation.




Strategy



The fund uses a "growth investing" style by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its assets in the common stock of domestic companies that its Sub-adviser believes have superior growth potential and fundamental characteristics that are significantly better than the market average and support internal earnings growth capability. It invests in small and mid-capitalization companies that have a minimum market capitalization of $250 million at the time of purchase. The fund seeks to maintain a minimum average weighted market capitalization of at least $5 billion.


Risk



Growth stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and can be more volatile than other types of stocks. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average

This fund scores Below Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.

Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
