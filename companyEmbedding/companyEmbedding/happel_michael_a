New York REIT, Inc.
 


 

 




 





 


NEW YORK, Dec. 30, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- New York REIT, Inc. (NYSE:   NYRT) ("NYRT" or the "Company"), a publicly traded real estate investment trust ("REIT"), announced today that its Board of Directors has appointed Michael Happel, the Company's President, to the role of Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. 
Mr. Happel succeeds Nicholas S. Schorsch, who has notified the Board of his decision to step down from his position as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of NYRT. The Company also announced that William M. Kahane has been elected as Executive Chairman of the Board, effective immediately. 
As a result of these changes, the NYRT Board of Directors now comprises four directors, three of whom are independent, and all of whom bring to the Company significant industry, senior leadership and corporate governance experience. Moreover, these changes further demonstrate the continuing effort by NYRT to enhance its corporate governance practices and advance the interests of all of its shareholders.  The Company will continue to consider the appointment of additional independent directors to its Board of Directors.
"I am honored to be appointed CEO of NYRT, and I wish to thank Nick for his leadership, vision and tireless dedication to NYRT," commented Mr. Happel. "As a proven industry leader and innovator, Nick has been instrumental in the firm's tremendous success since the Company's inception, offering invaluable insights and unparalleled business expertise to position NYRT as a leader in the New York City commercial real estate market."  
Mr. Happel continued, "Furthermore, I am pleased to be joined by Bill, as Executive Chairman of our Board, with whom I have worked beginning in 1988 at Morgan Stanley. Supported by a highly skilled executive leadership team, NYRT will continue to strive to capitalize on growth opportunities to further solidify the Company's leading platform, and to unlock the significant value-creation potential in the New York City market. I am excited to build on NYRT's track record of excellence and growth."
"Under Michael's leadership, I firmly believe the Company will further capitalize on the extraordinary opportunities ahead of us," said Mr. Kahane. "Michael is an industry veteran with over 25 years of experience investing in real estate, and I am confident that his expertise will be invaluable as we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives. In my new role as Executive Chairman, I look forward to working with Michael and the entire management team to solidify NYRT's position as a leading New York City-focused REIT. This transition is part of our overall effort to enhance our corporate governance practices, increase transparency, reduce complexity and mitigate potential conflicts of interest among related parties. The Board remains confident in our management team and its ability to deliver value to all shareholders."
"On behalf of the entire Company and Board, I would also like to express our deepest appreciation and gratitude to Nick for all that he has done for NYRT," said P. Sue Perrotty, Independent Director, NYRT. "As a true industry pioneer and visionary, Nick has been instrumental to NYRT's success, offering NYRT a truly unique vision and thoughtful, decisive strategy. His unwavering integrity, commitment to investors and uncompromising focus has been central to the Company's success, strategically positioning the Company to capitalize on the significant, attractive investment opportunities in the New York City commercial real estate market. With NYRT's experienced management team and investor-dedicated Board, the Company is committed to driving growth to the benefit of all stakeholders."
