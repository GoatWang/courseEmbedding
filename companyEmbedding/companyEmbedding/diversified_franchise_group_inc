History — Diversified Franchise Group



















































History








OUR HISTORYThe Company draws upon the 37 years of franchise sales, marketing and administrative experience of its founder, Brian Pappas and the 30+ years of franchise experience of his brother Jeff Pappas.  Brian was CEO of Creative Learning Corporation (CLC), a public company (OTCQX:CLCN) and developed three franchise concepts from July, 2009 to July, 2015–  Bricks 4 Kidz, Challenge Island and Sew Fun Studios. Pappas grew Bricks 4 Kidz from 1 location to over 750 International locations (over 40 countries) in 6 years generating over $22 million in revenue and over $4 million in pre-tax profits. Bricks 4 Kidz has become one of the fastest growing franchises in the world.   CLC generated revenue for Y/E 2014 of $7.7M and pre-tax profit of $1.4M. 



















What We Do — Diversified Franchise Group



















































What We Do








Diversified Franchise Group will focus on, but not be limited to, low-cost food franchises (under $200k investment for the franchisee) and the lucrative and expanding children’s edutainment (education/entertainment) sector. The Pappases demonstrated beyond any shadow of a doubt, that the children’s edutainment sector has tremendous potential for penetration and growth.  For this sector the Company will develop “mobile” franchises vs. “brick and mortar”.  Such a business model has enjoyed success due to several factors:•    The cost of entry for the franchisee is very low – typically under $40,000 and can be under $30,000•    Very little overhead so the franchisee can realize positive cash flow very quickly after initial training;•    Recession proof;•    The business ramps up very quickly;             •  The demand is high for “mobile” franchises.The Company has been organized to:•    Capitalize on the dynamics and growth of the franchise industry by tapping into the   tremendous demand from prospective franchisees for innovative new franchise concepts – both domestically and internationally;•     Mitigate the risk that emerging, franchiseable companies often confront; and•    Take advantage of the enormous lead generation capabilities of the Internet. 







While at Creative Learning Corporation,  Brian Pappas awarded on average 10 franchises per month (after the first full year of operations).  In some months 20+ franchises were awarded.  As a result, Bricks 4 Kidz grew exponentially and now is operating in 40 countries.

The art of growing your business from A to Z.   


60 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. Diversified Franchise Group (DFG), a Delaware corporation, is a franchise development company. DFG acquires early to mid-stage underperforming franchisors (50 – 100 units) and emerging franchisors (unique franchise concepts that have not been developed or have little competition).  Read about our team  here.

Process
 



THE PROBLEM







The founders of Diversified Franchise Group developed this concept because it was clear that franchise consultants and the investment community were not providing what emerging franchising companies really need - capital AND manpower support. DFG provides both. THE SOLUTIONInstead of investing passively in a franchiseable business, the Company will create a development arrangement between Diversified Franchise Group and the company that wishes to franchise its business. DFG will organize an operating company (the “Franchise Company”) for the sole purpose of developing the franchise and will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Diversified Franchise Group. The Company provides funding to the new entity and all the manpower required to develop and build a national franchise network.
