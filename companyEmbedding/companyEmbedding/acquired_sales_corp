Acquired Sales Corp. Plans to Acquire Aggregated Marketing Platform Inc. and Processing for a Cause Inc. | Business Wire


























































Acquired Sales Corp. Plans to Acquire Aggregated Marketing Platform 
      Inc. and Processing for a Cause Inc.






June 23, 2016 09:58 AM Eastern Daylight Time



LAKE FOREST, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Acquired Sales Corp. (OTC Pink: AQSP) 
      today announced that it has signed a letter of intent with H. Warren 
      Moon, David C. Meltzer and Sports 1 Marketing LLC, Irvine, California, 
      to acquire Aggregated Marketing Platform Inc. ("AMP"), Processing for a 
      Cause Inc. ("PFAC"), and a related management company.
    


      The proposed acquisitions, which can only be closed upon the parties 
      meeting several conditions, will include up to $200,000 in cash 
      consideration, and stock consideration of 7 million shares and options 
      to purchase 5 million shares of common stock of Acquired Sales. Up to 
      71% of such shares will be cancelled if certain consolidated pre-tax 
      income milestones are not met by December 31, 2019, and up to 100% of 
      such options will be cancelled if those consolidated pre-tax income 
      milestones are not met by December 31, 2026.
    

      AMP plans to aggregate virtual gifting programs with traditional TV, 
      radio, billboards, stadium screens and other marketing media using 
      patent-pending software, and AMP is in negotiations with several 
      professional sports teams to launch its aggregated marketing platform 
      starting next month. PFAC plans to market credit card processing 
      programs designed to benefit not-for-profit entities. AMP and PFAC were 
      both launched by Sports 1 Marketing in January of 2016.
    

      Following the acquisitions, H. Warren Moon and Gerard M. Jacobs will 
      serve as Co-Chairmen of Acquired Sales, and David C. Meltzer and Gerard 
      M. Jacobs will serve as Co-CEOs of Acquired Sales.
    

      Closing of the acquisitions is subject to a number of conditions, 
      including the completion of mutually acceptable due diligence, delivery 
      of audited financial statements, completion of a capital raise of at 
      least $4.5 million, execution of definitive acquisition documents, 
      obtaining necessary third party approvals, and completion of all 
      necessary securities filings.
    

      Gerard M. Jacobs, the Chairman and CEO of Acquired Sales, said, “We 
      believe that Warren Moon and Dave Meltzer's vision for aggregated online 
      and traditional marketing, starting with virtual gifting program nights 
      at major professional sports and entertainment events, has the potential 
      to disrupt the marketing industry. Acquired Sales is excited to partner 
      with Warren and Dave, and to benefit from their years of experience and 
      contacts."
    

      "As a Hall of Fame Quarterback, I have played with some of the greatest 
      athletes in the world. Camaraderie and energy between co-workers and 
      managers, similar to teammates and coaches, is one of the most valuable 
      assets a company can have," says Warren Moon, Co-Founder and President 
      of Sports 1 Marketing. "Putting people first creates an unparalleled 
      office environment in which I am excited to continue to build a team on 
      our shared values."
    

      "I've been blessed to be a industry leader in both technology and 
      sports, and can’t think of a better partnership built for growth and 
      success," says David Meltzer, CEO of Sports 1 Marketing.
