Canada Dry is a brand of soft drinks[2] owned since 2008 by the American Dr Pepper Snapple Group.[3] For over a century, Canada Dry has been known for its ginger ale, though the company also manufactures a number of other soft drinks and mixers. Although Canada Dry originated in Canada, it is now produced in many countries around the globe, including the United States, Mexico, Colombia, the Middle East, Europe and Japan.
The "Dry" in the brand's name refers to not being sweet, as in a dry wine. When John J. McLaughlin, who first formulated "Canada Dry Pale Ginger Ale", originally made his new soft drink, it was far less sweet than other ginger ales then available; as a result, he labelled it "dry".[4]

History[edit]

1916 Toronto Star ad for the product.


In 1890, Canadian pharmacist and chemist John J. McLaughlin of Enniskillen, Ontario, after working in a soda factory in Brooklyn, New York,[5] opened a carbonated water plant in Toronto.[1] McLaughlin was the eldest son of Robert McLaughlin, founder of McLaughlin Carriage and McLaughlin Motor Car.[6] In 1904, McLaughlin created "Canada Dry Pale Ginger Ale". Three years later, the drink was appointed to the Viceregal Household of the Governor General of Canada, and the label featuring a beaver atop a map of Canada was replaced with the present Crown and shield.[7]
When McLaughlin began shipping his product to New York, it became so popular that he opened a plant in Manhattan shortly thereafter. After McLaughlin's death in 1914, the company was run briefly by his brother, Samuel McLaughlin. P. D. Saylor and Associates bought the business from the McLaughlin family in 1923 and formed Canada Dry Ginger Ale, Inc., a public company.[1]
Canada Dry's popularity as a mixer began during Prohibition, when its flavor helped mask the taste of homemade liquor.[8] In the 1930s, Canada Dry expanded worldwide. From the 1950s onward, the company introduced a larger number of products.
Norton Simon took an interest in the company in 1964, and it merged with Simon's other holdings, the McCall Corporation and Hunt Foods, to form Norton Simon Inc. Dr Pepper bought Canada Dry from Norton Simon in 1982.[9][10] In 1984, Dr Pepper was acquired by Forstmann Little & Company, and Canada Dry was sold to R. J. Reynolds' Del Monte Foods unit to pay off acquisition debt.[11] RJR Nabisco sold its soft drink business to Cadbury Schweppes in 1986. Today, Canada Dry is owned by Dr Pepper Snapple Group, which was spun off from Cadbury Schweppes in 2008.[1][12]

Canada Dry is a brand of soft drinks[2] owned since 2008 by the American Dr Pepper Snapple Group.[3] For over a century, Canada Dry has been known for its ginger ale, though the company also manufactures a number of other soft drinks and mixers. Although Canada Dry originated in Canada, it is now produced in many countries around the globe, including the United States, Mexico, Colombia, the Middle East, Europe and Japan.
The "Dry" in the brand's name refers to not being sweet, as in a dry wine. When John J. McLaughlin, who first formulated "Canada Dry Pale Ginger Ale", originally made his new soft drink, it was far less sweet than other ginger ales then available; as a result, he labelled it "dry".[4]

History[edit]

1916 Toronto Star ad for the product.


In 1890, Canadian pharmacist and chemist John J. McLaughlin of Enniskillen, Ontario, after working in a soda factory in Brooklyn, New York,[5] opened a carbonated water plant in Toronto.[1] McLaughlin was the eldest son of Robert McLaughlin, founder of McLaughlin Carriage and McLaughlin Motor Car.[6] In 1904, McLaughlin created "Canada Dry Pale Ginger Ale". Three years later, the drink was appointed to the Viceregal Household of the Governor General of Canada, and the label featuring a beaver atop a map of Canada was replaced with the present Crown and shield.[7]
When McLaughlin began shipping his product to New York, it became so popular that he opened a plant in Manhattan shortly thereafter. After McLaughlin's death in 1914, the company was run briefly by his brother, Samuel McLaughlin. P. D. Saylor and Associates bought the business from the McLaughlin family in 1923 and formed Canada Dry Ginger Ale, Inc., a public company.[1]
Canada Dry's popularity as a mixer began during Prohibition, when its flavor helped mask the taste of homemade liquor.[8] In the 1930s, Canada Dry expanded worldwide. From the 1950s onward, the company introduced a larger number of products.
Norton Simon took an interest in the company in 1964, and it merged with Simon's other holdings, the McCall Corporation and Hunt Foods, to form Norton Simon Inc. Dr Pepper bought Canada Dry from Norton Simon in 1982.[9][10] In 1984, Dr Pepper was acquired by Forstmann Little & Company, and Canada Dry was sold to R. J. Reynolds' Del Monte Foods unit to pay off acquisition debt.[11] RJR Nabisco sold its soft drink business to Cadbury Schweppes in 1986. Today, Canada Dry is owned by Dr Pepper Snapple Group, which was spun off from Cadbury Schweppes in 2008.[1][12]

Appearance
																Clear, deep amber-colored ale with an off-white head.															

Aroma

The Right Blend of Ingredients and Imagination

	Blue Moon® Belgian White* was our first year-round release back in 1995.


	It started with our brewmaster, Keith Villa, wanting to craft a beer inspired by the flavorful Belgian Wits he enjoyed while studying brewing in Belgium. He brewed his interpretation using Valencia orange peel versus the traditional tart Curaçao orange peel, for a subtle sweetness, and added a touch of coriander to provide balance. Then he added oats and wheat to create a smooth, creamy finish that’s inviting to the palate. As a final touch, he garnished the beer with an orange slice to heighten the citrus aroma and taste. Its natural unfiltered appearance adds to the depth of flavors in Belgian White*.


	Available in 12-oz. bottles, 6-pack, 12-pack, 12-oz. can, 16-oz. can, Draft





Ingredients and Profile

Malts: Pale, White Wheat, Oats  Hops: Blend of Imported and Domestic   Our Twist: Valencia Orange Peel , Coriander  IBUs: 9   Original Gravity: 13º Plato  ABV: 5.4%  

Glassware
																Pour our Belgian White* into our signature Blue Moon® glass to highlight the depth of the beer. This glass opens wide at the top to make room for the aromatic citrus notes. Cap with a creamy, white head and garnish with an orange slice.															

Appearance
																Will appear cloudy because it’s unfiltered for more depth of flavor.															

Aroma
																You’ll notice a zesty orange fruitiness with a light spicy wheat aroma.															

Taste
																The flavor starts crisp and tangy and ends with a coriander and orange spiciness. The Valencia orange peel gives a subtle sweetness to the beer.															

Mouthfeel
																The oats give the beer a nice creamy body, so it’s not too thin.															

Finish
																Our Belgian White* has a slow finish of coriander and orange spiciness.															




Food Pairing
 
The Valencia orange peel and coriander in Blue Moon Belgian White pairs well with seafood such as grilled shrimp, Asian dishes like pad thai, and marinated chicken dishes.

Food Pairing






Best Of Both Styles

	For our white IPA our brew masters wanted to combine the citrus flavors of an IPA with the smooth, balanced malts of a Belgian white Belgian-Style Wheat Ale. They began by experimenting with hop after hop until they found the perfect combination of four hops, including a rare German hop called Huell Melon. The result is a pronounced citrus and fruity hop taste, perfectly balanced by wheat, coriander, and orange peel. We bring the best of two styles together to craft an IPA with a unique twist. Hoppy. Unfiltered. Balanced.


	Available in 12-oz. bottles, 6-packs, and draft in select markets. Available nationally April 1, 2015.





Ingredients and Profile

Malts: Wheat, Oats  Hops: Simcoe, Cascade, Citra®   Our Twist: Use of the Huell Melon Hop from Germany  IBUs: 45   ABV: 5.9%  

Glassware
																We recommend Blue Moon Signature Glassware to showcase the beer’s pale, cloudy appearance and to bring out the deep citrus and smooth malt flavors.															

Appearance
																Cloudy, pale color with a creamy white head.															

Aroma
																Pronounced grapefruit, citrus and fruity hop aroma.															

Taste
																Assertive, clean bitter flavor with strong citrus and fruity hop taste balanced by smooth malts.															

Mouthfeel
																Medium body.															

Finish
																Lingering bitter finish with bold citrus and fruity hop notes.															




Food Pairing

	Pairs well with bold, flavorful seafood dishes, spicy Mexican food, and strong cheeses such as sharp cheddar and blue cheese.
