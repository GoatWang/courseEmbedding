Between 2004 and 2007, Mr. Savoy consulted with The Muckleshoot Indian Tribe on investment-related matters, strategic planning and economic development. Mr. Savoy served as a consultant for Vulcan Inc., an investment entity that manages the personal financial activities of Paul Allen, from September 2003 to December 2005. Vulcan Inc. resulted from the consolidation in 2000 of Vulcan Ventures Inc., a venture capital fund, and Vulcan Northwest. Mr. Savoy served in various capacities at Vulcan Inc. and its predecessors from 1988 to September 2003, most recently as President of the portfolio and asset management division, managing Vulcan's commercial real estate, hedge fund, treasury and other financial activities, and as President of both Vulcan Northwest and Vulcan Ventures. Mr. Savoy served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Layered, Inc., a software company, from June 1989 until its sale in June 1990 and as its Chief Financial Officer from August 1988 to June 1989. Mr. Savoy received a B.S. in computer science, accounting and finance from Atlantic Union College. Mr. Savoy has financial expertise, industry experience with portfolio companies, experience managing product development, and mergers and acquisitions experience. He has also held board positions with other publicly traded companies, including Drugstore.com from 1999 through its acquisition in 2011. The Board of Directors has concluded that Mr. Savoy should serve as a director because his experience as a chief executive officer, and in various other executive roles, has provided him with broad leadership and executive experience, which contributes operational knowledge and strategic planning skills, along with knowledge important to our corporate development and any mergers and acquisitions activities.
