 Virginia National Bankshares Corp	
Business Description








	Virginia National Bankshares Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the 
Commonwealth of Virginia on February 21, 2013 at the direction of the Board of 
Directors of Virginia National Bank (the “Bank”) for the purpose of 
acquiring all of the outstanding shares of the Bank and becoming the holding company 
of the Bank. On June 19, 2013, the shareholders of the Bank approved the Reorganization 
Agreement and Plan of Share Exchange, dated March 6, 2013, whereby the Bank would 
reorganize into a holding company structure. 
On December 16, 2013, when the Reorganization became effective, the Bank became 
  a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and each share of the Bank’s 
  common stock was exchanged for one share of the Company’s common stock. 
  The Company is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended 
  (“BHC Act”), and is subject to inspection, examination and supervision 
  by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal 
  Reserve Board” or “Federal Reserve”). The Company is also 
  under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) 
  and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities 
  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”) as administered 
  by the SEC. Virginia National Bankshares Corporation is headquartered at 404 
  People Place, Charlottesville, Virginia.
Virginia National Bank, the principal operating subsidiary of the Company, 
  was organized in 1998 under federal law as a national banking association to 
  engage in a general commercial and retail banking business. The Bank received 
  its charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) 
  and commenced operations on July 29, 1998. The Bank is headquartered in Charlottesville, 
  Virginia. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to the maximum amount provided 
  by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
  (“FDIC”). The Bank is subject to the supervision, examination and 
  regulations of the OCC.
The Bank serves the Virginia communities in and around the City of Charlottesville, 
  Albemarle County, Orange County and the City of Winchester. The Bank also has 
  a loan production office in Warrenton, Virginia. The Bank offers a full range 
  of banking and related financial services, including checking accounts, NOW 
  accounts, money market deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, individual 
  retirement accounts and other depository services. The Bank actively solicits 
  such accounts from individuals, businesses, associations and other organizations 
  within its trade area. The Bank also offers short to long term commercial, real 
  estate and consumer loans. The Bank is committed to being a reliable and consistent 
  source of credit, with loans that are priced based upon an overall banking relationship, 
  easy access to the Bank’s local decision makers who possess strong local 
  market knowledge, local delivery, fast response, and continuity in the banking 
  relationship. Other services offered by the Bank include automated teller machines 
  (“ATMs”), Internet banking, treasury and cash management services 
  and merchant card services. In addition, the Bank is affiliated with Visa® 
  which is accepted worldwide and offers debit cards to consumer and business 
  customers.
As a bank holding company registered under the BHC Act, the Company is subject 
  to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Company 
  is also registered under the bank holding company laws of Virginia and is subject 
  to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Virginia State Corporation 
  Commission (the “SCC”).
Permitted Activities. A bank holding company is limited to managing or controlling 
  banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries, and 
  engaging in other activities that the Federal Reserve determines by regulation 
  or order to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks 
  as to be a proper incident thereto. In determining whether a particular activity 
  is permissible, the Federal Reserve must consider whether the performance of 
  such an activity reasonably can be expected to produce benefits to the public 
  that outweigh possible adverse effects. Possible benefits include greater convenience, 
  increased competition, and gains in efficiency. Possible adverse effects include 
  undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts 
  of interest, and unsound banking practices. Despite prior approval, the Federal 
  Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any 
  activity or to terminate ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal 
  Reserve has reasonable cause to believe that a serious risk to the financial 
  safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company 
  may result from such an activity.

Virginia National Bankshares's Comment on Competitors and Industry Peers  

The Company engages in highly competitive activities. Each activity involves competition 
with other banks, as well as with non-banking enterprises that offer financial 
products and services that compete directly with the Company’s product and 
service offerings. The Company actively competes with other banks in its efforts 
to obtain deposits and make loans, in the scope and types of services offered, 
in interest rates paid on time deposits and charged on loans, and in other aspects 
of banking.
In addition to competing with other commercial banks within and outside its 
  primary service areas, the Company competes with other financial institutions 
  engaged in the business of making loans or accepting deposits, such as credit 
  unions, insurance companies, small loan companies, finance companies, mortgage 
  companies, certain governmental agencies and other enterprises. Competition 
  for funds from securities brokers and mutual funds for money market accounts 
  is strong. Additional competition for deposits comes from government and private 
  issues of debt obligations and other investment alternatives for depositors 
  such as money market funds.
The market areas served by the Company are highly competitive with respect 
  to banking. Competition for loans to small businesses and professionals is intense, 
  and pricing is important. Many of the Company’s competitors have substantially 
  greater resources and lending limits than the Company and offer certain services 
  such as extensive and established branch networks that the Company does not 
  expect to match. Deposit competition is also very strong. Management believes, 
  however, that a market exists for the personal and customized financial services 
  an independent, locally owned bank can offer.

	In conjunction with Ms.

	Continuity Agreement, and the Bank and Ms. Harrison entered into a
	Non-Disclosure, Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition Agreement, each of which is
	discussed in more detail below.





	Material Compensatory
	and Other Agreements with Executive Officers







	On March 2, 2017, the
	Company entered into a Management Continuity Agreement with each of the
	following executive officers of the Company: Glenn W. Rust, Chief Executive
	Officer and President of the Company and the Bank; Virginia R. Bayes, Chief
	Credit Officer and Executive Vice President of the Bank; Tara Y. Harrison, Chief
	Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of the Company and the Bank; and
	Donna G. Shewmake, General Counsel, Executive Vice President and Corporate
	Secretary of the Company and the Bank (collectively the




	2









	Executives and
	individually, the Executive). On the same date, the Bank entered into a
	Non-Disclosure, Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition Agreement with each of the
	Executives.




	Under the terms of the Management Continuity Agreement entered into with each of the Executives, in the event
	of a Change in Control (as defined in the agreement) of the Company, the Company or its successor is required to
	continue to employ each Executive for a period of two years following the date of the Change in Control with
	commensurate authority, responsibilities, compensation and benefits for that period. Each Management Continuity
	Agreement also provides for certain benefits and payments to an Executive in the event of the termination of
	employment following a Change in Control. If an Executives employment terminates without Cause or for
	Good Reason (each as defined in the agreement), such Executive is entitled to receive, in addition to accrued
	obligations, (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of (A) two times the sum of the Executives annual base
	salary in effect at termination, plus (B) the average annual bonus paid or payable to the Executive for the two most
	recently completed years, plus (C) any amounts contributed by the Executive during the most recently completed
	year pursuant to a salary reduction agreement or any other program that provides for pre-tax salary reductions or
	compensation deferrals; (ii) continuation of employee welfare benefits for up to eighteen months following the date
	of termination; and (iii) a lump sum equal to the Companys contributions to the Executives account in the
	Company sponsored 401(k) retirement savings plan for the two-year period prior to termination of
	employment. The severance benefits will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of the golden
	parachute excise taxes under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. Each Management Continuity Agreement
	also provides that any incentive based compensation or award an Executive receives will be subject to clawback by
	the Company as may be required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and on such basis as the
	Board of Directors of the Company determines, but in no event with a look-back period of more than two years,
	unless required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements.




	Under the Non-Disclosure, Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition Agreement, each of the Executives has agreed
	(i) to protect and not disclose the confidential and proprietary information of the Bank or its affiliates (collectively,
	VNB), (ii) not to solicit VNBs customers or employees during the twelve-month period following termination
	of the Executives employment, and (iii) not to engage in any activity or work that is competitive with VNBs
	business within a thirty-mile radius of his/her office location or within a ten-mile radius of any other VNB location
	during employment and for the three-month period following (A) voluntary or involuntary termination of
	employment in the case of Mr. Rust, or (B) for each of the other Executives, the termination of employment by the
	Executive for any reason or VNBs termination of Executives employment for Cause (as defined in the
	agreement). Under the terms of the Management Continuity Agreement, the provisions of the Non-Disclosure,
	Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition Agreements will survive termination of the Executives employment except
	the non-competition provisions will not apply after the Executive ceases to be employed by the Company following
	a Change in Control

	unless

	the Executive is entitled to receive severance benefits provided under the Management
	Continuity Agreement in connection with termination of his/her employment without Cause or for Good Reason.

	Exhibit 10.1






	MANAGEMENT CONTINUITY
	AGREEMENT







	This Management Continuity
	Agreement, dated as of March 2, 2017 (Agreement), is by and between Virginia
	National Bankshares Corporation, a Virginia corporation, and any successor
	thereto (the Company), and



	[Name
	of Employee]



	(the Executive).




	1.





	Purpose







	The Company recognizes that
	the possibility of a Change in Control exists and the uncertainty and questions
	that it may raise among management may result in the departure or distraction of
	management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders.
	Accordingly, the purpose of this Agreement is to encourage the Executive to
	continue employment with the Company and/or its affiliates or successors in
	interest by merger or acquisition after a Change in Control by providing
	reasonable employment security to the Executive and to recognize the prior
	service of the Executive in the event of a termination of employment under
	certain circumstances after a Change in Control.




	2.





	Term of the Agreement







	The term of this Agreement
	will be effective on the date set forth above (the Effective Date) and will
	continue until December 31, 2019; provided however, that on December 31, 2018
	and each December 31

	st

	thereafter (each such December 31

	st

	referred to as the Renewal Date), this Agreement will be automatically
	extended for an additional calendar year so as to terminate two (2) years from
	such Renewal Date. The Agreement will not, however, be extended if the Company
	gives the Executive written notice of such non-renewal before the Renewal Date
	(the initial and any extended term of this Agreement is referred to as the
	Change in Control Period).




	3.





	Employment after a Change in Control







	If a Change in Control of
	the Company (as defined in Section 12) occurs during the Change in Control
	Period and the Executive is employed by the Company on the date the Change in
	Control occurs (the Change in Control Date), the Company will continue to
	employ the Executive in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
	Agreement for the period beginning on the Change in Control Date and ending on
	the second anniversary of such date (the Employment Period). If a Change in
	Control occurs on account of a series of transactions, the Change in Control
	Date is the date of the last of such transactions.




	4.





	Terms of Employment







	(a)





	Position and Duties



	.
	During the Employment Period, (i) the Executives position, position title,
	authority, reporting structure, duties and responsibilities will be the same in
	all material respects with the most significant of those held, exercised and
	assigned to Executive by the Company at any time during the twelve (12) month
	period immediately preceding the Change in Control Date and (ii) the Executives
	services will be performed at









	either the location where
	the Executive was performing his services immediately preceding the Change in
	Control Date or any office that is the headquarters of the Company prior to the
	Change in Control and is less than thirty-miles (30) miles from such location.




	(b)





	Compensation



	.




	(i)





	Base Salary



	. During the
	Employment Period, the Executive will receive an annual base salary (the Annual
	Base Salary) at least equal to the highest base annualized salary paid or
	payable to the Executive by the Company and its affiliated companies during the
	twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the Change of Control Date.
	During the Employment Period, the Annual Base Salary will be reviewed at least
	annually and will be increased at any time and from time to time as will be
	substantially consistent with increases in base salary generally awarded in the
	ordinary course of business to other peer executives of the Company and its
	affiliated companies, but may not be decreased. Any increase in the Annual Base
	Salary will not serve to limit or reduce any other obligation to the Executive
	under this Agreement. The Annual Base Salary will not be reduced after any such
	increase, and the term Annual Base Salary as used in this Agreement will refer
	to the Annual Base Salary as so increased. The term affiliated companies
	includes any company controlled by, controlling or under common control with the
	Company during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the Change of
	Control Period.




	(ii)





	Annual Bonus



	. In addition
	to the Annual Base Salary, the Executive will be awarded for each year ending
	during the Employment Period and for which the Executive is employed on the last
	day of the year an annual bonus (the Annual Bonus) in one lump sum cash
	payment at least equal to the average annual bonus paid or payable, including by
	reason of any deferral, for the two (2) years immediately preceding the year in
	which the Change in Control Date occurs. Each such Annual Bonus will be paid no
	later than two and one-half (2 ½) months after the end of the year for which the
	Annual Bonus is awarded.




	(iii)





	Incentive, Savings and Retirement Plans



	. During the Employment Period, the Executive will
	be entitled to participate in all incentive (including stock incentive), savings
	and retirement, insurance plans, policies and programs applicable generally to
	other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies, but in no
	event will such plans, policies and programs provide the Executive with
	incentive opportunities, savings opportunities and retirement benefit
	opportunities, in each case, less favorable, in the aggregate, than those
	provided by the Company and its affiliated companies for the Executive under
	such plans, policies and programs as in effect at any time during the twelve
	(12) months immediately preceding the Change in Control Date.




	(iv)





	Welfare Benefit Plans



	.
	During the Employment Period, the Executive and/or the Executives family, as
	the case may be, will be eligible for participation in and will receive all
	benefits under welfare benefit plans, policies and programs provided by the
	Company and its affiliated companies to the extent applicable generally to other
	peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies, but in




	2









	no event will such plans,
	policies and programs provide the Executive with benefits that are less
	favorable, in the aggregate, than the most favorable of such plans, policies and
	programs in effect at any time during the twelve (12) months immediately
	preceding the Change in Control Date.




	(v)





	Fringe Benefits



	. During
	the Employment Period, the Executive will be entitled to fringe benefits in
	accordance with the most favorable plans, policies and programs of the Company
	and its affiliated companies in effect for the Executive at any time during the
	twelve (12) months immediately preceding the Change in Control Date or, if more
	favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally from time to time after the
	Change in Control Date with respect to other peer executives of the Company and
	its affiliated companies.




	(vi)





	Paid Time Off



	. During the
	Employment Period, the Executive will be entitled to paid time off in accordance
	with the most favorable plans, policies and programs of the Company and its
	affiliated companies in effect for the Executive at any time during the twelve
	(12) months immediately preceding the Change in Control Date or, if more
	favorable to the Executive, as in effect generally from time to time after the
	Change in Control Date with respect to other peer executives of the Company and
	its affiliated companies.




	5.



	Termination of Employment Following a Change in
	Control







	(a)





	Death or Disability



	. The
	Executives employment will terminate automatically upon the Executives death
	during the Employment Period. If the Company determines in good faith that a
	Disability of the Executive has occurred during the Employment Period, it may
	terminate the Executives employment. For purposes of this Agreement,
	Disability means the Executives inability to perform the essential functions
	of his/her position with the Company on a full time basis for one hundred eighty
	(180) consecutive days or a total of at least two hundred forty (240) days in
	any twelve (12) month period as a result of the Executives incapacity due to
	physical or mental illness (as determined by an independent physician selected
	by the Board of the Company).




	(b)





	Cause



	. The Company may
	terminate the Executives employment during the Employment Period for Cause. For
	purposes of this Agreement, Cause means (i) gross incompetence, gross
	negligence, willful misconduct in connection with the performance of the
	Executives duties or breach of a fiduciary duty owed to the Company or any
	affiliated company; (ii) conviction of or entering of a guilty plea or a plea of
	no contest with respect to a felony or a crime of moral turpitude or commission
	of an act of embezzlement or fraud against the Company or any affiliated
	company; (iii) any material breach by the Executive of a material term of this
	Agreement, including, without limitation, material failure to perform a
	substantial portion of his/her duties and responsibilities hereunder; or (iv)
	deliberate dishonesty of the Executive with respect to the Company or any
	affiliated company.




	(c)



	Good Reason



	. The Executives employment may be terminated during the Employment
	Period by the Executive for Good Reason. The Executive must provide written




	3









	notice to the Company of
	the existence of the event or condition constituting such Good Reason within
	ninety (90) days of the Executive becoming aware of the event or condition
	alleged to constitute Good Reason. Upon delivery of such notice by the
	Executive, the Company shall have a period of thirty (30) days during which it
	may remedy in good faith the event or condition constituting Good Reason, to the
	Executives satisfaction and the Executives employment shall continue in effect
	during the thirty (30) day period. In the event the Company shall remedy in good
	faith the event or condition constituting Good Reason, then such notice of
	termination shall be null and void, and the Company shall not be required to pay
	the amount due to the Executive under Section 6(a). If the Company has not
	remedied the event or condition constituting Good Reason during the thirty (30)
	day cure period and the Executive does not terminate his/her employment for Good
	Reason within ninety (90) days thereafter by providing the Company with a Notice
	of Termination (as such term is defined herein), then the Executive will deemed
	to have waived his/her right to terminate for Good Reason with respect to such
	grounds.




	For purposes of this
	Agreement, Good Reason means:




	(i)




	a
	material reduction in the Executives duties or authority or any of the
	employment characteristics as described in Section 4(a);




	(ii)




	a
	failure by the Company to comply with any of the provisions of Section 4(b);




	(iii)




	the
	Companys requiring the Executive to be based at any office or location other
	than that described in Section 4(a)(ii);




	(iv)




	the
	failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section 7(b); or




	(v)




	the
	Company fails to honor any term or provision of this Agreement.




	Notwithstanding the
	foregoing, Good Reason shall not include any resignation by the Executive where
	Cause for the Executives termination by the Company exists.




	(d)





	Notice of Termination



	. Any
	termination during the Employment Period by the Company or by the Executive for
	Good Reason shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the other
	party hereto. For purposes of this Agreement, a Notice of


	Termination shall mean a notice which shall
	indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon.




	(e)





	Date of Termination



	. Date
	of Termination means (i) if the Executives employment is terminated by the
	Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of receipt of
	the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as the case may
	be, (ii) if the Executives employment is terminated by the Company other than
	for Cause or Disability, the date specified in the Notice of Termination (which
	shall not be less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days from the date
	such Notice of Termination is given unless the Executive otherwise agrees), and
	(iii) if the Executives employment is terminated for Disability,




	4









	thirty (30) days after
	Notice of Termination is given, provided that the Executive shall not have
	returned to the full-time performance of his/her duties during such thirty (30)
	day period.




	(f)



	Resignation of All Other Positions



	. Effective upon the termination of the
	Executives employment for any reason, the Executive shall be deemed to have
	resigned from all positions the Executive holds as an officer or member of the
	Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) of the Company or any of its
	affiliates.




	6.



	Compensation Upon Termination







	(a)



	Termination Without Cause or for Good
	Reason



	. In the event the
	Executives employment with the Company terminates or is terminated during (i)
	the six (6) months immediately preceding a Change in Control, or (ii) during the
	Employment Period, unless such termination in either case is or was (A) by the
	Company for Cause or (B) by the Executive other than for Good Reason, Executive
	shall be entitled to the following benefits; provided with respect to the
	payments set forth in paragraphs (ii), (iii) and (iv) below, the Executive (or
	the legal representative of the Executive or the Executives estate) signs a
	release and waiver of claims in favor of the Company, its affiliates and their
	respective officers and directors in the form attached hereto as Attachment A,
	and such release has become effective (the Release) (for avoidance of doubt,
	no release is required in connection with the payments set forth in paragraph
	(i) below).




	(i)





	Accrued Obligations



	. The
	Accrued Obligations are the sum of: (1) the Executives Annual Base Salary
	through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect just prior to the time a
	Notice of Termination is given; (2) the amount, if any, of any incentive or
	bonus compensation theretofore earned which has not yet been paid; (3) the
	product of the Annual Bonus paid or payable, including by reason of deferral,
	for the most recently completed year and a fraction, the numerator of which is
	the number of days in the current year through the Date of Termination and the
	denominator of which is 365; and (4) any benefits or awards (including both the
	cash and stock components) which pursuant to the terms of any plans, policies or
	programs have been earned or become payable, but which have not yet been paid to
	the Executive (but not including amounts that previously had been deferred at
	the Executives request, which amounts will be paid in accordance with the
	Executives existing directions). The Accrued Obligations will be paid to the
	Executive in a lump sum cash payment within ten (10) days after the Date of
	Termination;




	(ii)





	Salary Continuance Benefit



	. The Salary Continuance Benefit is an amount equal to two (2) times the
	Executives Final Compensation. For purposes of this Agreement, Final
	Compensation means the Annual Base Salary in effect at the Date of Termination,
	plus an amount equal to the average Annual Bonus paid or payable for the two (2)
	most recently completed years and any amounts contributed by the Executive
	during the most recently completed year pursuant to a salary reduction agreement
	or any other program that provides for pre-tax salary reductions or compensation
	deferrals. The Salary Continuance Benefit will be paid to the Executive in a
	lump sum cash payment on the first regular payroll date following the sixtieth
	(60

	th

	) day after the Date of




	5









	Termination, provided that
	on or before such date the Release has been executed and any period in which the
	Executive may revoke such Release has expired, without such Release having been
	revoked; and




	(iii)



	Welfare Continuance Benefit



	. For eighteen (18) months following the Date of
	Termination, the Executive and his/her eligible dependents will continue to be
	covered under all health and dental plans, disability plans, life insurance
	plans (including split dollar endorsement agreements related to Bank Owned Life
	Insurance policies), and all other welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section
	3(1) of ERISA) (Welfare Plans) in which the Executive and his/her dependents
	were participating immediately prior to the Date of Termination (the Welfare
	Continuance Benefit) to the extent permissible under the terms of the
	respective Welfare Plans and applicable law. Health and medical coverage will be
	provided under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
	amended (COBRA). The Executive will pay only that portion of the COBRA
	premiums that he was paying as an active employee prior to the Date of
	Termination. The Company will pay any additional premium costs. Notwithstanding
	the foregoing, the Welfare Continuance Benefit as to any Welfare Plan will cease
	if and when the Executive has obtained coverage under one or more welfare
	benefit plans of a subsequent employer that provides for substantially equal or
	greater benefits to the Executive and his/her dependents with respect to the
	specific type of benefit; and




	(iv)





	401(k) Contributions



	. A
	lump sum cash payment equal to the total contributions made by the Company to
	the Executives account in the Company sponsored 401(k) retirement savings plan
	during the two-year period prior to termination of employment. This payment will
	be paid to the Executive on the first regular payroll date following the
	60

	th

	day after the Date of Termination, provided that on or before
	such date the Release has been executed and any period in which the Executive
	may revoke such Release has expired, without such Release having been revoked.




	(b)





	Death



	. If the Executive
	dies during the Employment Period while employed, this Agreement will terminate
	without any further obligation on the part of the Company under this Agreement,
	other than for (i) payment of the Accrued Obligations (which shall be paid to
	the Executives beneficiary designated in writing or his/her estate, as
	applicable, in a lump sum cash payment within thirty (30) days of the date of
	death); (ii) the timely payment of the Welfare Continuance Benefit to the
	Executives spouse and other dependents; and (iii) the timely payment of all
	death and retirement benefits pursuant to the terms of any plan, policy or
	arrangement of the Company and its affiliated companies. If the Executive dies
	after the Date of Termination, but prior to the expiration of the Welfare
	Continuance Benefit period, the Executives spouse and other dependents will be
	entitled to the remaining payment of the Welfare Continuance Benefit due to the
	Executive under Section 6(a)(iii).




	(c)





	Disability



	. If the
	Executives employment is terminated because of the Executives Disability
	during the Employment Period, this Agreement will terminate without any further
	obligation on the part of the Company under this Agreement, other than for (i)
	payment of the Accrued Obligations (which shall be paid to the Executive in a
	lump sum cash payment within thirty (30) days of the Date of Termination; (ii)
	the timely payment of the Welfare




	6









	Continuance Benefit; and
	(iii) the timely payment of all disability and retirement benefits pursuant to
	the terms of any plan, policy or arrangement of the Company and its affiliated
	companies.




	(d)





	Cause; Other than for Good Reason



	. If the Executives employment is terminated for Cause during the
	Employment Period, this Agreement will terminate without further obligation to
	the Executive other than the payment to the Executive of the Annual Base Salary
	through the Date of Termination, plus the amount of any compensation previously
	deferred by the Executive. If the Executive terminates employment during the
	Employment Period, excluding a termination for Good Reason, this Agreement will
	terminate without further obligation to the Executive other than for the Accrued
	Obligations (which will be paid in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30) days of
	the Date of Termination) and any other benefits to which the Executive may be
	entitled pursuant to the terms of any plan, program or arrangement of the
	Company and its affiliated companies.




	(e)



	Potential Limitation of Payments and
	Benefits



	.




	(i) Subject to subsection
	(ii) below, in the event that the aggregate value of the payments and benefits
	to which Executive may be entitled under this Agreement or any other agreement,
	plan, program or arrangement in connection with a Change in Control (the Change
	in Control Termination Benefits) would subject Executive to the excise tax
	imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax), then the Change in
	Control Termination Benefits shall be reduced in a manner determined by the
	Company (by the minimum possible amount) that is consistent with the
	requirements of Section 409A of the Code until no amount or benefit payable to
	Executive will be subject to the Excise Tax.




	(ii) Notwithstanding the
	foregoing, no reduction in the Change in Control Termination Benefits shall be
	made if Executives Net After-Tax Benefit (as defined below) assuming such
	reduction was not made exceeds by $25,000 or more of Executives Net After-Tax
	Benefit assuming such reduction was made.




	(iii) Net After-Tax
	Benefit shall mean the amount of the Change in Control Termination Benefits
	which Executive receives or is then entitled to receive, less the amount of all
	applicable taxes payable by you with respect to the Change in Control
	Termination Benefits, including any Excise Tax.




	(iv) All calculations and
	determinations under this Section 6(e) shall be made by an independent
	accounting firm or independent tax counsel appointed by the Company (the Tax
	Advisor) whose determinations shall be conclusive and binding on the Company
	and Executive for all purposes. The Tax Advisor may rely on reasonable, good
	faith assumptions and approximations concerning the application of Section 280G
	and Section 4999 of the Code. The Company shall bear all costs of the Tax
	Advisor.

	Binding Agreement; Successors







	(a)




	This
	Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Executive (and
	his/her personal representative), the Company and any successor organization or
	organizations which shall succeed to substantially all of the business and
	property of the Company, whether by means of merger, consolidation, acquisition
	of all or substantially of all of the assets of the Company or otherwise,
	including by operation of law.




	(b) The Company will
	require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger,
	consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or
	assets of the Company to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in
	the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to
	perform it if no such succession had taken place.




	(c) For purposes of this
	Agreement, the term Company includes any subsidiaries of the Company and any
	corporation or other entity which is the surviving or continuing entity in
	respect of any merger, consolidation or form of business combination in which
	the Company ceases to exist; provided, however, that for purposes of determining
	whether a Change in Control has occurred herein, the term Company refers to
	Virginia National Bankshares Corporation or its successors.




	8.



	Fees and Expenses; Mitigation







	(a)




	The
	Company will pay or reimburse the Executive for all costs and expenses,
	including without limitation court costs and reasonable attorneys fees,
	incurred by the Executive (i) in the Companys contesting or disputing any
	termination of the Executives employment or (ii) in the Companys seeking to
	obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement, in each case
	provided the Executive is the prevailing party in a proceeding brought in a
	court of competent jurisdiction. The Company shall reimburse the foregoing costs
	on a current basis after the Executive submits a claim for reimbursement with
	the proper documentation of the costs and expenses.




	(b)




	The
	Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment the
	Company becomes obligated to make to the Executive in connection with this
	Agreement, by seeking other employment or otherwise. The amount of any payment
	provided for in Section 6 shall not be reduced, offset or subject to recovery by
	the Company by reason of any compensation earned by the Executive as the result
	of employment by another employer after the Date of Termination, or otherwise.




	9.





	No
	Employment Contract







	Nothing in this Agreement
	will be construed as creating an employment contract between the Executive and
	the Company prior to Change in Control.

	10.





	Survival of Certain Restrictive Covenants







	Section 4 of the
	Non-Disclosure, Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition Agreement dated as of the
	same hereof, between the Company and the Executive (the Loyalty Agreement)
	with respect to the Executives covenants concerning non-competition will not
	apply to the Executive after the Executive ceases to be employed by the Company
	following a Change in Control, unless the Executive is entitled to receive any
	severance benefits provided for in Section 6(a) of this Agreement in connection
	with the termination of his/her employment without Cause or for Good Reason in
	which case the restrictions imposed by Section 4 in the Loyalty Agreement will
	continue to apply. The non-solicitation restrictions in Section 3 of the Loyalty
	Agreement and the non-disclosure in Section 2 of the Loyalty Agreement together
	with the other provisions of the Loyalty Agreement, except to the extent Section
	4 of the Loyalty Agreement may not apply as provided above, will survive the
	termination of the Executives employment and are incorporated into and made a
	part of this Agreement as though the Loyalty Agreement was set forth in full in
	this Agreement.




	11.





	Notice







	Any notices and other
	communications provided for by this Agreement will be sufficient if in writing
	and delivered in person, or sent by registered or certified mail, postage
	prepaid (in which case notice will be deemed to have been given on the third day
	after mailing), or by overnight delivery by a reliable overnight courier service
	(in which case notice will be deemed to have been given on the day after
	delivery to such courier service). Notices to the Company shall be directed to
	the Secretary of the Company, with a copy directed to the Chairman of the Board
	of the Company. Notices to the Executive shall be directed to his/her last known
	address.




	12.





	Definition of a Change in Control







	No benefits shall be
	payable hereunder unless there shall have been a Change in Control of the
	Company as set forth below. For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in
	Control means:




	(a)




	The
	acquisition by any Person of beneficial ownership of thirty percent (30%) or
	more of the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, provided
	that an acquisition directly from the Company (excluding an acquisition by
	virtue of the exercise of a conversion privilege) shall not constitute a Change
	in Control;




	(b)




	Individuals who constitute the Board on the date of this Agreement (the
	Incumbent Board) cease to constitute a majority of the Board, provided that
	any director whose nomination was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of
	the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board will be considered a member of
	the Incumbent Board; provided however, that any director whose initial
	assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election
	contest relating to the election of the directors of the Company shall not be
	considered a member of the Incumbent Board;




	9









	(c) Consummation by the
	Company of a reorganization, merger, share exchange or consolidation (a
	Reorganization), provided that a Reorganization will not constitute a Change
	in Control if, upon consummation of the Reorganization, each of the following
	conditions is satisfied:




	(i)




	more
	than fifty percent (50%) of the then outstanding shares of common stock of the
	corporation resulting from the Reorganization is beneficially owned by all or
	substantially all of the former shareholders of the Company in substantially the
	same proportions as their ownership existed in the Company immediately prior to
	the Reorganization;




	(ii)




	no
	Person beneficially owns thirty percent (30%) or more of either (1) the then
	outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation resulting from the
	transaction or (2) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
	securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
	directors; and




	(iii)




	at
	least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation
	resulting from the Reorganization were members of the Incumbent Board at the
	time of the execution of the initial agreement providing for the Reorganization.




	(d) Approval by the
	shareholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the
	Company, or the consummation of a sale or other disposition of all or
	substantially all of the assets of the Company.




	(e) For purposes of this
	Agreement, Person means any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of
	Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act),
	other than any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained
	by the Company or any affiliated company, and beneficial ownership has the
	meaning given the term in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act.




	13.



	Miscellaneous







	No provision of this
	Agreement may be amended, modified, waived or discharged unless such amendment,
	modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in a writing signed (a) by the
	Executive and (b) for the Company by either the Chairman of the Board, Chairman
	of the Compensation Committee, Chief Executive Officer, or President of the
	Company; provided, however, the Executive may not sign on behalf of the Company
	even if he/she holds one of the identified positions with the Company. This
	Agreement replaces and supersedes any prior agreements, written or oral,
	relating to the subject matter hereof, and all such agreements are hereby
	terminated and are without any further legal force or effect. No waiver by
	either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or
	of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed
	by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions
	or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or
	representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the
	subject matter hereof have been made by either party that are not expressly set
	forth in this Agreement.

	14.





	Governing Law







	The validity,
	interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed
	by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Company and the Executive
	submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any state or federal court
	located within the Commonwealth of Virginia for resolution of any such claims,
	causes of action or disputes arising out of or relating to or concerning this
	Agreement.




	15.





	Validity





	The invalidity or
	unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the
	validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall
	remain in full force and effect.




	16.





	Deferred Compensation Omnibus Provision







	(a) It is intended that
	payments and benefits under this Agreement that are considered to be deferred
	compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be provided and paid in a
	manner, and at such time and in such form, as complies with the applicable
	requirements of Section 409A of the Code to avoid the unfavorable tax
	consequences provided for therein for non-compliance. Notwithstanding any other
	provision of this Agreement, the Companys Compensation Committee or Board of
	Directors is authorized to amend this Agreement, to amend or void any election
	made by the Executive under this Agreement and/or to delay the payment of any
	monies and/or provision of any benefits in such manner as may be determined by
	it to be necessary or appropriate to comply with Section 409A of the Code or to
	comply with an exception from Section 409A if that is the intent of the
	provision. For purposes of this Agreement, all rights to payments and benefits
	hereunder shall be treated as rights to receive a series of separate payments
	and benefits to the fullest extent allowed by Section 409A of the Code.




	(b)




	If the
	Executive is deemed on the date of separation of service with the Company to be
	a specified employee, as defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code, then
	payment of any amount or provision of any benefit under this Agreement that is
	considered deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code shall not
	be made or provided prior to the earlier of (A) the expiration of the six (6)
	month period measured from the date of separation of service or (B) the date of
	death (the 409A Deferral Period).




	(c)




	In the
	case of benefits that are subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Executive may
	pay the cost of benefit coverage, and thereby obtain benefits, during the 409A
	Deferral Period and then be reimbursed by the Company when the 409A Deferral
	Period ends. On the first day after the end of the 409A Deferral Period, all
	payments delayed pursuant to this Section 16 (whether they would have otherwise
	been payable in a single lump sum or in installments in the absence of such
	deferral) shall be paid or reimbursed to the Executive in a lump sum, and any
	remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or
	provided as originally scheduled.




	11









	(d)




	Termination of employment shall have the same meaning as separation of
	service, as that phrase is defined in Section 409A of the Code (taking into
	account all rules and presumptions provided for in the Section 409A
	regulations).




	17.



	Clawback



	The Executive agrees that any incentive based compensation or award that
	he receives, or has received, from the Company or its Affiliates under this
	Agreement or otherwise, will be subject to clawback by the Company as may be
	required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and on such
	basis as the Board of Directors of the Company determines, but in no event with
	a look-back period of more than two (2) years, unless required by applicable law
	or stock exchange listing requirement.

	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this
	Agreement has been executed as a sealed instrument by Virginia National
	Bankshares Corporation by its duly authorized officer, and by the Executive, as

	integral role in the continued growth and development of a community-based
	financial services organization, and other good and valuable consideration, the
	adequacy and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged, with your signature you
	acknowledge and agree to the following:





	1. Acknowledgement of
	VNBs Interest.







	You acknowledge that VNB
	has invested substantial time, money and resources in the development and
	retention of its customers, accounts, business and employees. You acknowledge
	and agree that any and all "goodwill" associated with any customer, account,
	business or employee of VNB belongs exclusively to VNB. You further acknowledge
	and agree that during the course of your performing services for VNB, VNB
	employees and/or customers may furnish, disclose or otherwise make available to

	developed by VNB through the expenditure by VNB of substantial time, effort and
	money, (b) all such relationships, information and training are valuable to VNB
	and (c) use of such relationships, information and training by you other than

	to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information. You agree to
	use the Confidential Information, both during and after your employment, for the
	sole benefit of VNB.




	You agree and attest that
	any and all such Confidential Information is, and shall remain, the sole
	property of VNB. You agree that you will hold such Confidential Information in
	the strictest confidence and that you will not (except as required in the course
	of your employment with VNB, as required by any court, supervisory authority or
	administrative agency, or as otherwise required by applicable law) disclose,
	either directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information to any other
	business, firm, entity or person, unless such information









	has become a matter of
	public knowledge at the time of such disclosure. You further agree that you will
	not remove or retain any Confidential Information regardless of how it is
	maintained. You agree to return to VNB any and all copies of the Confidential
	Information that you have, or have had, in your possession immediately upon
	termination of employment, whether voluntary or involuntary or upon any request
	by VNB. The terms of this paragraph are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any
	legal or other contractual obligations that you may have, or believe you may
	have, relating to the protection of the Confidential Information or your
	employment. The terms of this paragraph shall survive indefinitely the
	termination of this Agreement and/or your employment with VNB.

	a. You agree that both
	during the course of your employment, and for a period of twelve (12) months
	following the voluntary or involuntary termination of your employment, you will
	not, directly or indirectly, on your own behalf or in the service of or on
	behalf of any other person or entity other than VNB, solicit, divert or
	appropriate, or attempt to solicit, divert or appropriate, any business from any
	VNB customers or prospective customers with whom/which you have had contact
	during the course of your employment or about whom/which you have obtained
	Confidential Information during the course of your employment.




	b. You agree that both
	during the course of your employment, and for a period of twelve (12) months
	following the voluntary or involuntary termination of your employment, you will
	not (i) enter into, and will not participate in, any plan or arrangement to
	cause any employee of VNB to terminate his or her employment with VNB, or (ii)
	directly or indirectly solicit any VNB employee for employment in connection
	with any business initiated by you or any other person, firm, company or
	corporation.





	4. Non-Competition.





	You agree that both during
	the course of your employment, and for a period of three (3) months following
	the voluntary or involuntary termination of your employment, you will not accept
	employment or otherwise engage in any activity or work, that is in any way
	competitive with the business of VNB in which you are significantly involved at
	any time during your employment with VNB in a geographic area within a 30 mile
	radius of your then current office location (or, if applicable, the office
	location at which you were primarily working immediately prior to the
	termination of your employment with VNB) or within a 10 mile radius of any other
	VNB location. For purposes of this Agreement, you acknowledge and agree that VNB

	international and factoring, and that those services and businesses will be
	considered competitive with VNB under the terms of this Agreement to the extent
	that you are significantly involved in such services or businesses during your

	5. Enforcement of this
	Agreement.





	You agree that the
	provisions outlined above are necessary and reasonable to protect the best
	interests of VNB, its customers, and its employees. Further, you agree that in
	the event of your breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, VNB would
	suffer substantial irreparable harm and that monetary damages alone may not be
	sufficient to protect VNB adequately from such breach. In the event of a breach
	or threatened breach by you of any of the provisions of this Agreement, in
	addition to such other remedies as VNB may have available at law, VNB shall be
	entitled to seek and obtain equitable relief, in the form of specific
	performance, or temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief, or any
	other equitable remedy which then may be available. The seeking or granting of
	an injunction or other equitable remedy shall not affect VNBs right to seek and
	obtain damages or other equitable relief on account of any such

	actual or threatened
	breach. You agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by VNB in
	enforcing the provisions of this Agreement, including VNBs attorneys
	fees.





	6. Miscellaneous





	a. You acknowledge that you
	will be an at will employee of VNB and that your employment may be terminated
	at any time, with or without cause, at the option of you or VNB. You also
	acknowledge that neither this Agreement nor any employee handbook or other
	document you may receive creates any contractual rights contrary to the
	foregoing and that no representative or agent of Employer other than an
	Authorized Representative of VNB through a written, signed document has any
	authority to enter into any agreement for employment for any specified time
	period or to make any other agreement contrary to the foregoing. For purposes of
	this Agreement, an Authorized Representative of VNB shall mean either the
	Chairman of the Board, Chairman of the Compensation Committee, Chief Executive
	Officer, or President of VNB; provided, however, you may not sign on behalf of
	VNB even if you hold one of the identified positions with VNB.




	b. This Agreement contains
	the entire understanding between you and VNB and supersedes any prior written or
	oral agreements with VNB. This Agreement shall not be modified or waived except
	by written instrument signed by you and an Authorized Representative of VNB.




	c. In the event that any
	provision of this Agreement shall be declared unenforceable or invalid, the
	remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable.




	d. This Agreement shall
	inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by VNB and/or VNBs successors in
	interest, subsidiaries and affiliates.




	e. You acknowledge that
	this Agreement shall be governed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
	Commonwealth of Virginia, without regard to conflicts of law principal. You
	agree that the state and federal courts located in the City of Charlottesville
	or the County of Albemarle shall be the exclusive jurisdictions for the
	resolution of any disputes concerning this Agreement, and you agree to submit to
	the jurisdiction of those courts.




	f. You acknowledge that you
	have had the opportunity to consult with an attorney prior to signing this
	Agreement.




	With your signature, you
	attest to your understanding of the provisions outlined above and voluntarily

	Name:   ________________





	Virginia National Bank and
	its affiliates, including Virginia National Bankshares Corporation and VNBTrust,
	N.A., also known as VNB Wealth Management (together VNB), has provided you
	with the [continued] opportunity to be a key member of VNBs executive
	management team. As a condition of your employment opportunity with VNB, you
	must sign and return this Non-Disclosure, Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition
	Agreement (this Agreement).




	In consideration of this
	employment opportunity, your compensation, including your base salary, potential
	incentive compensation, Management Continuity Agreement with VNB, benefits,
	training, personal and professional growth potential, the opportunity to play an
	integral role in the continued growth and development of a community-based
	financial services organization, and other good and valuable consideration, the
	adequacy and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged, with your signature you
	acknowledge and agree to the following:





	1. Acknowledgement of
	VNBs Interest.







	You acknowledge that VNB
	has invested substantial time, money and resources in the development and
	retention of its customers, accounts, business and employees. You acknowledge
	and agree that any and all "goodwill" associated with any customer, account,
	business or employee of VNB belongs exclusively to VNB. You further acknowledge
	and agree that during the course of your performing services for VNB, VNB
	employees and/or customers may furnish, disclose or otherwise make available to
	you confidential and proprietary information and that VNB may provide you with
	unique and specialized training. You also acknowledge that (a) such
	relationships, information and training have been, and will continue to be,
	developed by VNB through the expenditure by VNB of substantial time, effort and
	money, (b) all such relationships, information and training are valuable to VNB
	and (c) use of such relationships, information and training by you other than
	for VNBs benefit will cause substantial harm to VNB.





	2. Non-Disclosure of
	Confidential and Proprietary Information.





	VNB has developed and
	continues to develop, use and maintain confidential and proprietary information,
	which may include competitive information and trade secrets, concerning VNBs
	business, customers and employees, including, without limitation, the following:
	identity and other information related to present and prospective customers;
	business organization and structure; business and marketing plans and
	strategies; training programs and materials; product information; personnel
	information including employees' capabilities, salaries, benefits, and any other
	terms of employment; policies, standards and procedures; current and prospective
	vendors and contracts; and profit, loss and other financial information
	(collectively, the "Confidential Information"). You acknowledge that during your
	employment with VNB you will have direct and indirect access to, and knowledge
	of, the Confidential Information, and you agree to take all reasonable measures
	to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information. You agree to
	use the Confidential Information, both during and after your employment, for the
	sole benefit of VNB.




	You agree and attest that
	any and all such Confidential Information is, and shall remain, the sole
	property of VNB. You agree that you will hold such Confidential Information in
	the strictest confidence and that you will not (except as required in the course
	of your employment with VNB, as required by any court, supervisory authority or
	administrative agency, or as otherwise required by applicable law) disclose,
	either directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information to any other
	business, firm, entity or person, unless such information has become a matter of
	public knowledge at the time of such disclosure. You further agree that you will
	not remove or retain any Confidential Information regardless of how it is
	maintained. You agree to return to VNB any and all copies of the Confidential
	Information that you have, or have had, in your possession









	immediately upon
	termination of employment, whether voluntary or involuntary or upon any request
	by VNB. The terms of this paragraph are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any
	legal or other contractual obligations that you may have, or believe you may
	have, relating to the protection of the Confidential Information or your
	employment. The terms of this paragraph shall survive indefinitely the
	termination of this Agreement and/or your employment with VNB.





	3. Non-Solicitation.





	a. You agree that both
	during the course of your employment, and for a period of twelve (12) months
	following the voluntary or involuntary termination of your employment, you will
	not, directly or indirectly, on your own behalf or in the service of or on
	behalf of any other person or entity other than VNB, solicit, divert or
	appropriate, or attempt to solicit, divert or appropriate, any business from any
	VNB customers or prospective customers with whom/which you have had contact
	during the course of your employment or about whom/which you have obtained
	Confidential Information during the course of your employment.




	b. You agree that both
	during the course of your employment, and for a period of twelve (12) months
	following the voluntary or involuntary termination of your employment, you will
	not (i) enter into, and will not participate in, any plan or arrangement to
	cause any employee of VNB to terminate his or her employment with VNB, or (ii)
	directly or indirectly solicit any VNB employee for employment in connection
	with any business initiated by you or any other person, firm, company or
	corporation.





	4. Non-Competition.





	You agree that both during
	the course of your employment, and for a period of three (3) months following
	your voluntary termination of your employment for any reason or VNBs
	termination of your employment for Cause, as defined below, you will not
	accept employment or otherwise engage in any activity or work, that is in any
	way competitive with the business of VNB in which you are significantly involved
	at any time during your employment with VNB in a geographic area within a 30
	mile radius of your then current office location (or, if applicable, the office
	location at which you were primarily working immediately prior to the
	termination of your employment with VNB) or within a 10 mile radius of any other
	VNB location. For purposes of this Agreement, you acknowledge and agree that VNB
	and its affiliates are engaged in the financial services business which
	includes, without limitation, commercial and retailing banking and lending,
	treasury management, private banking, trust, investment/brokerage services,
	wealth management and funds management. You also acknowledge that VNB has
	strategic plans related to offering services such as leasing, brokerage,
	international and factoring, and that those services and businesses will be
	considered competitive with VNB under the terms of this Agreement to the extent
	that you are significantly involved in such services or businesses during your
	employment with VNB. For purposes of this Section, Cause means (i) gross
	incompetence, gross negligence, willful misconduct in connection with the
	performance of your duties or breach of a fiduciary duty owed to VNB or any
	affiliated company; (ii) your conviction of or entering of a guilty plea or a
	plea of no contest with respect to a felony or a crime of moral turpitude or
	commission of an act of embezzlement or fraud against VNB or any affiliated
	company; (iii) any material breach by you of a material term of this Agreement,
	your Management Continuity Agreement or other agreement related to your
	employment, including, without limitation, material failure to perform a
	substantial portion of your duties and responsibilities; or (iv) your deliberate
	dishonesty with respect to VNB or any affiliated company.





	5. Enforcement of this
	Agreement.





	You agree that the
	provisions outlined above are necessary and reasonable to protect the best
	interests of VNB, its customers, and its employees. Further, you agree that in
	the event of your breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, VNB would
	suffer substantial irreparable harm and that monetary damages alone may not be
	sufficient to protect VNB adequately from such breach. In the event of a breach
	or threatened breach by you of any of the provisions of this Agreement, in
	addition to such other remedies as VNB may have available at law, VNB shall be
	entitled to seek and obtain equitable relief, in the form of




	Page 2 of 3









	specific performance, or
	temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief, or any other equitable
	remedy which then may be available. The seeking or granting of an injunction or
	other equitable remedy shall not affect VNBs right to seek and obtain damages
	or other equitable relief on account of any such actual or threatened breach.
	You agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by VNB in enforcing
	the provisions of this Agreement, including VNBs attorneys fees.





	6. Miscellaneous

	will be an at will employee of VNB and that your employment may be terminated
	at any time, with or without cause, at the option of you or VNB. You also
