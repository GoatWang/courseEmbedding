Winemaker's Notes
Offering aromas of cola, crushed lavender, coriander, plum, black pepper and earth. The palate is dense with notes of graphite, blackberry and blueberry fruit. This wine has an intensity that flows through the long finish.


Critical Acclaim




RP97


The Wine Advocate - "The 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon Kathryn Hall is largely sourced from their Sacrashe Vineyard. The color is dense ruby/purple. The wine is very young, and less evolved than many of its peers, but bursting with potential. Lots of blueberry and black raspberry fruit with a hint of mocha and background oak are all present in this full-bodied, opulent, absolutely spectacular Cabernet Sauvignon. This is a long-distance runner, although not so much because of the tannic structure, because the fruit seems younger and more primary than some of its siblings. Nevertheless, it is loaded with potential promise, and as Kathryn Hall says so frequently, “Magic.” This full-bodied, classic Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa should hit its prime in 4-5 years and last at least two decades or more. Rating: 97+"




WE95


Wine Enthusiast - "Pulling from both the Sacrashe and Bergfeld vineyards, as well as other partner sites, this is a tremendously impressive wine, bright in herb, cedar and cassis, with soft, integrated tannins. Concentrated, it maintains elegance despite the full-bodied luxuriousness, finishing in decadent chocolate. Drink now through 2022. Cellar Selection."




WS92


Wine Spectator - "Aromas of red candy and candied apple fold over to the palate in this elegant, medium-weight style. Shows hints of crushed rock and minerality. Long and clean on the finish. Drink now through 2027. 4,300 cases made."

 Related Links: Shop our most popular wine from Napa Valley Shop our top rated wine from Napa Valley  It's hard not to think of Napa Valley when thinking of California wines. The region is, after all, the one that brought world recognition to California wine making. The area was settled by a few choice wine families in the 1960's who bet that the wines of the area would grow and flourish. They were right. The Napa wine industry really took off in the 1980's, when vineyard lands were scooped up and vines were planted throughout the county. A number of wineries emerged, from large conglomerates to small boutiques to cult classics. Cabernet Sauvignon is definitely the grape of choice here, with many winemakers also focusing on Bordeaux Blends. Whites are usually Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. Notable Facts Within the Napa Valley lie smaller sub-AVAs that lend even more character specifics to the wines. Furthest south is Carneros, followed by Yountville, Oakville & Rutherford. Above those two is St.-Helena and finally, just granted an AVA, Calistoga. These areas are situated on the valley floor and are known for creating rich, smooth Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Chardonnay. There are a few mountain regions as well, nestled on the slopes overlooking the valley AVAs. Those include Howell Mountain, Stags Leap and Mount Veeder. Wines from the mountain regions are often more structured and firm, benefiting from more time in the bottle to evolve and soften.

It's not rare to see a wine's country of origin listed as "California." A country unto itself in the wine world, California makes enough varieties and styles to match many European wine countries. It produces a diverse range of wines that span the quality spectrum.
The most famous of the California wine regions is Napa Valley, and these wines are certainly outstanding – but it's not as broad and diverse as its larger neighbor, Sonoma County. Down south, Santa Barbara's Santa Maria Valley is well-known for its Rhône blends, as well as cool-climate varieties like Pinot and Chardonnay. The Central Coast, the largest California AVA, has many different microclimates that lead to a wide range of wines with many sub-AVAs.

Alcohol By Volume Guide
Most wine ranges from 10-16% alcohol by volume. Some varietals tend to have higher (for example Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon) or lower alcohol levels (Pinot Noir and many white varietals), but there is always some variation from producer to producer. Some wine falls outside of this range, for instance Port weighs in closer to 20%, while Muscat and Riesling are usually a bit below 10%.


Wine Style Guide

Light & Fruity
Red wines that are more fruit-forward and lighter in tannin and body.
Smooth & Supple
Medium bodied reds that go down easy, with smooth tannins and supple fruit.
Earthy & Spicy
Wines where earthy and/or spicy dominate the flavors – typically medium to full body.
Big & Bold
Full bodied wines that have concentrated fruit and are higher in alcohol and/or tannins. Some need age.

Winemaker's Notes
Inky garnet in color, the Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon exudes warmth and allure. Effusive aromas of ripe dark cherry , spiced chocolate , dusty earth and raspberry compote spill from the glass. The entry is voluptuous, supple, and opulent, while the mid-palate features enticingly decadent dark fruit and lengthy, sweet tannins, almost defying the boundaries of richness. Blend: 95% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Merlot, 1% Petit Verdot


Critical Acclaim




RP96


The Wine Advocate - "The 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon Kathryn Hall from Napa is another blockbuster, exhibiting an opaque bluish purple color, notes of charcoal, graphite, blackberry, chocolate and exotic spices, a full-bodied mouthfeel, and a long, long finish. Like most 2013s, it is just hinting at its ultimate potential, but this wine is loaded and exciting. Forget it for another 4-5 years and drink it over the following three decades.

"




WS93


Wine Spectator - "Offering aromas of opulent blackberry, plum and currant, this is floral, tightly focused and delivers ample fruit intensity and purity on the palate. Drink now through 2030."




V92


Vinous / Antonio Galloni - "The 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon Kathryn Hall is dark, powerful and juicy. Raspberry jam, mocha, new leather and dark spices, along with supple, forward fruit give the Kathryn Hall its soft, succulent personality. This is one of the more approachable, racy 2013 Cabernets readers will come across. Silky tannins add to the wine's finesse and texture."

Some wine falls outside of this range, for instance Port weighs in closer to 20%, while Muscat and Riesling are usually a bit below 10%.

Earthy & Spicy

Big & Bold

Winemaker's Notes
Offering aromas of cola, crushed lavender, coriander, plum, black pepper and earth. The palate is dense with notes of graphite, blackberry and blueberry fruit. This wine has an intensity that flows through the long finish.


Critical Acclaim



The Wine Advocate - "The 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon Kathryn Hall is largely sourced from their Sacrashe Vineyard. The color is dense ruby/purple. The wine is very young, and less evolved than many of its peers, but bursting with potential. Lots of blueberry and black raspberry fruit with a hint of mocha and background oak are all present in this full-bodied, opulent, absolutely spectacular Cabernet Sauvignon. This is a long-distance runner, although not so much because of the tannic structure, because the fruit seems younger and more primary than some of its siblings. Nevertheless, it is loaded with potential promise, and as Kathryn Hall says so frequently, “Magic.” This full-bodied, classic Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa should hit its prime in 4-5 years and last at least two decades or more. Rating: 97+"



Vinous / Antonio Galloni - "Dark cherries, plums, spices, smoke, licorice and menthol all flesh out in the Cabernet Sauvignon Kathryn Hall. Inviting, rich and seductive, the 2012 is beautiful and totally expressive today. Sweet floral, spice and raspberry notes add complexity on the perfumed finish. Range: 91-93"

Winemaker's Notes

The 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon is a classic Alexander Valley wine with medium body, great fruit flavors and grippy tannins. Winemaker Kevin Hall added 7% Merlot for structure, a touch of Cabernet Franc for floral notes and Malbec and Petit Verdot for color.
There are aromas of dark fruit, blackberry, cherry, cassis, plum, vanilla and a slight cocoa and chocolate note. In the glass there are rich flavors of cherry, cassis, blackberry, plum, spice, tobacco and chocolate. This is a plush wine with medium body, nice balance and a long finish.
Pairs well with grilled or pan seared beef, lamb or tuna is a classic. For an unexpected pairing try a blue cheese soufflé as an appetizer.

        Robert Parker's Wine Advocate
    


        A flamboyant wine, the 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon Kathryn Hall flows across the palate with the essence of raspberry jam, spices, licorice, flowers and crushed rocks. This voluptuous, totally sexy Cabernet Sauvignon captivates all the senses with its sumptuous fruit and fabulous overall balance. The style is rich and opulent but also beautifully balanced at the same time. With time in the glass, the wine fleshes out a bit more, showing its considerable power and intensity. Anticipated maturity: 2015-2025.  Once again, I tasted a large number of wines from Hall this year. The 2010s are off the charts, and a big step up from the more inconsistent 2009s. A meticulous approach to vineyard and cellar work, including organic farming, native fermentations and malos, and the avoidance of fining and/or filtration informs wines of true pedigree and personality. The Hall wines are unapologetically big, powerful and exceptionally well balanced.

        Offers bold, ripe, opulent tiers of dark berry fruit, plum, currant and blackberry flavors, with pretty oak shadings and hints of anise, cigar box and cedar. The finish is long and persistent. Drink now through 2026. 3,563 cases made. JL (Web Only)

        Good bright medium ruby. Sexy high-toned aromas of cassis, licorice, dark chocolate and minerals. Sweet, suave and pliant, offering a captivating combination of generosity of texture and underlying power. Finishes with substantial dusty, ripe, seamless tannins and a chocolatey quality”

                            Varietal:
                        

Cabernet Sauvignon and Blends


 - Cabernet Sauvignon has come a long way from its role as a blending varietal, however dominant, in the wines of Bordeaux. Today it is the most planted red varietal in the world. Identified as a descendent of Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon Blanc, the late-ripening Cabernet Sauvignon needs to be planted in warmer climates to fully ripen. Its small berries can easily be identified for their distinctive blue color, thick skins and high tannins. And while the varietal has its own definitive characteristics: green pepper-like aromas and black currant flavors among them, it is perhaps most prized for its ability to convey terroir, vintage and winemaking. 
A relatively new varietal, Cabernet Sauvignon started making inroads into the wines of the Médoc and Graves in the late-18th century. Today it is also dominant in the up-and-coming Entre-Deux-Mers region of Bordeaux and can also be found in Southwest France. It is the companion varietal to Sangiovese in Italy's Super Tuscans and is planted all over Europe, stretching to lesser-known winegrowing regions like Russia and Lebanon. In the Americas Cabernet Sauvignon has found champions in every nook and cranny of California and among winemakers in Washington, where it complements plantings of Merlot. In South America, Cab thrives in Chile, but can also be found in smaller amounts in Argentina and even in Mexico.                        



                            Country:
                        

United States


 - When people consider domestic wine, they normally think about the state of California. The fine viticultural Region within California, including the Napa Valley, Sonoma, Santa Cruz Mountains, Mendocino and Santa Barbara, are capable of growing grapes of world-class quality. But there's plenty of fabulous wine coming from other states, too. Oregon, Washington and New York are also causing eyebrows (and glassware) to be raised around the world.  Click for a list of bestselling items from the United States.                        



                            Sub-Region:
                        

California


 - With the explosive growth that California's wine industry has seen the past several years, it's easy to view winemaking and grape growing in the Golden State as a recent phenomenon.  And while it's true that California's viticultural history is brief compared to several European countries, this state's roots date back well over 200 years.  Due to the enormous response to California wine within the United States and worldwide, there are thousands of excellent and diverse wines being produced within the state each year.  For our entire selection of California wines, please visit this link.                        



                            Specific Appellation:
                        

Napa Valley


 - America's most famous wine region, which encompasses a varied geographical territory running about 20 miles long from the San Francisco Bay northward to the foot of Mount St. Helena. Napa's great diversity, both in terms of climate and terroir, has led to the creation of a number of smaller AVAs like Stags Leap District, Rutherford, Howell Mountain, Oakville and Mount Veeder, among others. Cabernet and chardonnay still reign supreme, but just about everything under the sun is grown in Napa Valley, in quality levels ranging from $2 jug wine to $500 a bottle California cab.

 Product Description

The Kathryn Hall Cabernet Sauvignon is the pinnacle of our blending efforts each year. The exalted Sacrashe vineyard takes center stage, and is the basis of this blend. The vineyard contributes the mouth-coating richness and complexity, offering deep, dark earthy cassis flavors and powerfully dense tannins. From there, we search out complementary vineyards, usually from the most regarded mountain appellation, to create balance, symmetry and finesse in the wine. Lastly, we introduce vineyards with profound depth and decadence to heighten the voluptuousness and opulence that have become a hallmark character of our flagship wine.  VARIETAL COMPOSITION 95% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Merlot, 1% Petit Verdot
