OmniGuide Holdings, Inc. Hires John Markovich as CFO, Ajay Bhave as VP Operations and John Barnhill as VP Marketing & Business Development


Press Release
-


									updated: Nov 10, 2016							

 


			Lexington, MA, 
			November 10, 2016			(Newswire.com) -
	OmniGuide Holdings, Inc., the parent company of OmniGuide Surgical, Inc. and Domain Surgical, Inc., announced today the appointment of John Markovich as CFO.  The company also named Ajay Bhave as VP of Operations and John Barnhill as VP of Marketing / Business Development.  The addition of Markovich, Bhave and Barnhill follows the recent appointment of new President and CEO John T. Buhler and the company’s recently announced merger with Domain Surgical, which complements OmniGuide Surgical’s leadership in flexible fiber CO2 laser surgery by offering electrically silent ferromagnetic technology that has been clinically proven to precisely cut, coagulate and seal tissue.  The recent leadership additions continue OmniGuide Holdings’ commitment to enhancing OmniGuide Surgical’s growing CO2 laser business while commercially accelerating the Domain Surgical product line.
Reporting to Buhler, Markovich as CFO will be oversee the company’s overall financial operations.  Markovich has over 25 years of diverse financial leadership experience, which includes directing multiple privately-held startups and several public companies, including a NYSE-listed Fortune 500 multi-national, in both the healthcare and technology industries.  Previously, Markovich held CFO positions with Veritone, Inc., NanoH20, Inc., EMCORE Corporation and Orqis Medical, Inc.
“John’s extensive experience directing all financial and business management activities for companies of varying sizes, as well as his involvement with numerous successful M&A and IPO transactions make him a valuable addition to our team,” said Buhler. “John’s financial acumen will help guide the company as we continue along our growth trajectory, focusing on new opportunities within the advanced energy space.”
Bhave, who as part of OmniGuide Holdings senior staff, will be responsible for the company’s Global Operations, including manufacturing and the integration of Domain Surgical.  Prior to joining OmniGuide Holdings, Inc., Bhave held the position of Corporate VP of Global Engineering with Natus Medical Inc., with responsibility for all aspects of new product development. Prior to Natus, he held a number of senior management positions, including global supply chain and plant management, during his 21 years with General Electric Healthcare.
“Ajay’s 32 years of medical device manufacturing and engineering experience will help us enhance our operational capabilities, providing an analytic-based discipline that will ultimately accelerate our manufacturing operations while simultaneously maintaining OmniGuide’s high standard of quality,” said Buhler. “This is vital as we expand our core advanced energy portfolio to include Domain Surgical’s high-performance ferromagnetic technology.”
Barnhill will be responsible for global marketing efforts and business development strategy. Previously, Barnhill held a similar position with RF Surgical, Inc., an early-stage medical technology company that was recently acquired by Medtronic.  Prior to that, Barnhill was with Edwards Lifesciences where he held several global marketing and medical education positions within both the Heart Valve Therapy and Critical Care franchises.  Barnhill also held a marketing leadership position with SenoRx, where he grew the company’s breast cancer therapy portfolio, contributing to the successful exit of the company.  He will also report to Buhler.
“By adding John to our team, the company has demonstrated its commitment to building awareness around our advanced energy applications as well as implementing marketing strategies to support our growth aspirations,” said Buhler. “John’s market development expertise will help us educate a broader customer base around the performance and patient safety benefits associated with our product portfolio.”
