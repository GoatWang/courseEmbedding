investment objective—seeks long-term capital appreciation
The Paradigm Value Fund (PVFAX) focuses on small companies that are often ignored by Wall Street. The Fund’s management conducts extensive research to identify companies it believes are trading at an unwarranted discount to their peers and/or their long-term prospects. The goal is to find what we believe to be good companies with sound businesses and strong management teams whose stock prices don’t reflect the value of the underlying company.


performance

Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Returns do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.
1 The Fund’s expense ratio is from the most recent prospectus. The Advisor has contractually agreed to waive management fees and reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to maintain total annual operating expenses (excluding brokerage fees and commissions, interest and other borrowing expenses, taxes, extraordinary expenses and indirect costs of investing in Acquired Funds) at 1.50% of the Value Fund’s average daily net assets through April 30, 2017. The Fund’s total annual operating expense is 2.00% including management fees and other expenses. Effective May 1, 2017 the Advisor reduced the annual investment management fee for the Value Fund to 1.50% of the average daily net assets of the Fund.

important information
As is the case with most investments, you may lose money by investing in the Fund. The Fund invests in companies that appear to be “undervalued” in the marketplace (i.e., trading at prices below the company’s true worth). If the Fund’s perceptions of value are wrong, the securities purchased may not perform as expected, reducing the Fund’s return. The Fund primarily invests in small capitalization companies (less than $2.5 billion). Small capitalization companies can be riskier investments than larger companies.
Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a mutual fund before investing. This report must be preceded or accompanied by a prospectus containing more detail including information on risks, fees, sales charges and expenses. Please contact Paradigm Funds Advisors LLC at 1-800-239-0732. Please read it carefully before you invest or send money. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. You may obtain performance data current to the most recent month-end by calling the transfer agent at 1-877-59-Funds. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing.
2 Holdings are subject to change and may not be representative of current or future holdings.
3 Sector allocations are based upon the GICS Classifications and represent a % of the common stock held and is subject to change and may not be representative of current or future holdings.
The Russell 2000® Value Index is an unmanaged index of small capitalization stocks with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values than the total population of small capitalization stocks whose composition is different from the Fund. An investor cannot invest directly in an index, and index performance does not reflect the deduction of any fees, expenses or taxes. P/E Ratio is the market price per share divided by earnings per share. Price/Book Ratio is the market price per share divided by book value. Standard Deviation shows the degree of variation in the Fund’s returns and can serve as a useful measure of the Fund’s risk. It is measured using monthly observations, but expresses the result on an annualized basis. Market Capture Ratios is a statistical measure of the Fund’s overall performance in up-markets (positive return periods) and down-markets (negative return periods). The market capture ratios are used to evaluate how well an investment performed relative to an index during periods when that index has risen or fallen. The ratio is calculated by dividing the Fund’s returns by the returns of the index during the up-market or the down-market, and multiplying that factor by 100.
Star ratings are based on a Morningstar risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The overall rating is a weighted average of the 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) returns. 5 Stars = top 10% of funds in a category; 4 stars = next 22.5% of funds; 3 stars = middle 35%; 2 stars = next 22.5%; 1 star = bottom 10%. A fund must be in existence three years to be rated. Ratings are subject to change monthly. As of 3/31/17, the Paradigm Value Fund had a 3-star rating for the 3-year period (625 funds), and a 1-star rating for the 5-year period (537 funds), and a 3-star rating for the 10-year period (377 funds) and a 2-star rating for the Overall period (625 funds). © 2010 Morningstar, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Morningstar and/or its content providers are the proprietors of this information; do not permit its unauthorized copying or distribution; do not warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely; and are not responsible for damages or losses arising from its use. Percentile Rank in Category is the Fund’s total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category. The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1.
Lipper Leader calculations are subject to change monthly and are based on an equal-weighted average of percentile ranks for the category’s metrics over 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year periods (if applicable). The highest 20% of funds in each peer group are named Lipper Leaders and the next 20% receive a score of 4. A fund or class must be in existence three years to be rated. Both designations reflect the Fund’s ranking relative to its peer group as of 3/31/17, and do not take sales charges into account. Lipper ratings are not intended to predict future results, and Lipper does not guarantee the accuracy of this information. More information is available at www.lipperleaders.com. Lipper Leader Copyright 2002, Reuters, All Rights Reserved. Performance for the Fund reflects fee waivers in effect; in their absence, returns would have been lower, which may have adversely affected the Fund’s Lipper Rankings. The Paradigm Value Fund is in the Lipper equity funds category and received a score of 2 for Total Return for the 3-year period (751 funds), and a score of 1 for the 5-year period (650 funds), and a score of 2 for the 10-year period (464 funds) and a score of 2 for the Overall period (751 funds). For Tax Efficiency, the Fund received a score of 1 for the 3-year period (759 funds), and a score of 1 for the 5-year period (657 funds), and a score of 2 for the 10-year period (471 funds) and a score of 2 for the Overall period (759 funds).

For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Morningstar ratings are based upon Investor class of shares, unless otherwise indicated. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Share this story with your networkFacebook0TwitterGoogle+1Pinterest2New Orleans, Louisiana – July 25, 2017 – LongueVue Capital (“LVC”) is pleased to announce it has partnered with management to acquire Zavation Medical Products (“Zavation” or the “Company”) and provide capital for growth. Zavation is a designer and manufacturer of high quality spinal implants, instruments, and biologics. Zavation expands LVC’s healthcare portfolio and is the second medical device business LVC has partnered within the past 18 months.
Based in Jackson, MS, Zavation designs, engineers, and manufactures a portfolio of spinal hardware covering key areas including thoracolumbar, cervical, interbody fusion, and minimally invasive surgery. Founded in 2010 with its first sale in 2012, Zavation has experienced exceptional growth and created a national network of 100+ distributors across approximately 35 states. The Company has commercialized over 10 product families since inception, with 10 additional novel products expected to launch over the next two years. Zavation operates a 24,000 square foot vertically integrated facility with approximately 50 employees.
“Zavation has demonstrated exceptional growth and is a perfect cornerstone to our expanding healthcare portfolio.

As such, we look forward to our partnership with Zavation’s management team and driving significant growth, both organically and through acquisitions of unique technologies.”
“Zavation fits well within LVC’s investment strategy,” added Rick Rees, Founder and Managing Partner of LVC. “We love partnering with entrepreneur owned businesses at inflection points that have proven management teams willing to invest meaningfully alongside LVC. The Company’s rapid growth is a testament to management’s ability to capitalize on compelling demographics and other industry tailwinds favoring smaller, more agile, and customer focused OEMs. Lastly, although we are geographically agnostic, it is always great to partner with entrepreneurs in our back yard, the Gulf South. As such, we are incredibly excited to partner with management and welcome Zavation into the LVC family.”
“The management team at Zavation chose LVC due to their entrepreneur-friendly investment approach to value creation and their knowledge and expertise in growing middle market companies at inflection points like ours. With a shared vision and culture, we are confident Zavation will remain focused on its core values of excellent customer service and quality products,” said Jeffrey Johnson, President and CEO of Zavation. “LVC’s financial and operational resources will allow us to introduce new products, meet and exceed distributor and surgeon expectations, expand our market presence, and take market share at an even faster and more deliberate speed. We are excited for our Company, our distributors, our surgeons, and our LVC partners.”

Vanguard portfolio holdings disclaimerPortfolio holdings information:Vanguard may publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, the ten largest stock portfolio holdings of a Vanguard fund, and the percentage of the fund's total assets that each of these holdings represents as of the most recent calendar-quarter-end, 15 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter, except for Vanguard index funds (15 calendar days after the end of the month).Vanguard may also publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, the ten largest stock portfolio holdings of a Vanguard fund, and the aggregate percentage that these holdings represent of the fund's total net assets and equities, as of the most recent month-end, ten business days after the end of the month.Vanguard may publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, a detailed list of the securities (aggregated by issuer for money market funds) held in a Vanguard fund (portfolio holdings) as of the most recent calendar-quarter-end, 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter, except for Vanguard Market Neutral Fund (60 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter), Vanguard index funds (15 calendar days after the end of the month), and Vanguard Money Market Funds (within five [5 business days after the last business day of the preceding month). Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, Vanguard may exclude any portion of these portfolio holdings from publication on this Site when deemed in the best interest of the fund.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on a delayed basis and will not necessarily represent all of the actual investments held by the relevant Vanguard fund.Portfolio holdings may exclude any temporary cash investments and equity index products.The following additional terms and conditions apply to the publication on this Site of any Vanguard fund's portfolio holdings as described above:By accessing the portfolio holdings, you agree not to reproduce, distribute, or disseminate the portfolio holdings, in whole or in part, in any form without prior written permission of Vanguard.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on an "as is" basis, and Vanguard makes no express or implied warranties or representations with respect to the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or fitness of the portfolio holdings or any financial results you may achieve from their use.In no event shall Vanguard or its affiliates have any liability relating to the use of the portfolio holdings.






StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for bond funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for bond funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.






About the optionsFund share classesA fund may offer multiple share classes. The objectives, strategies, and policies for all share classes of a fund are identical. However, expense ratios vary by share class, reflecting the differing costs of providing services to the holders of each share class.Here are some of the key distinctions:Investor SharesTraditional shares for individual investors that typically feature low minimum initial investments.Admiral™ SharesA lower-cost share class generally available without a minimum initial investment requirement to institutional investors and financial intermediary clients. Vanguard created Admiral Shares to recognize and encourage the cost savings stemming from large, long-standing investment accounts and to pass these savings on to the shareholders who generate them.Institutional SharesShares generally available to institutions or other investors with fund account balances of $5 million or more.Institutional Plus SharesShares generally available to institutions or other investors with fund account balances from $100 million to $200 million, depending on the fund.Institutional Select SharesShares generally available to large institutional investors. Fund account minimums range from $3 billion to $5 billion, depending on fund.ETF SharesExchange-traded shares of certain Vanguard index funds, ETF Shares combine the benefits of indexing, such as low costs and broad market diversification, with the trading and pricing flexibility of individual stocks.Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.Notes:All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.

Fees

•

Purchase fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor buys shares. This fee is not a sales charge or load because it is paid directly to the fund to offset the costs of trading certain securities. None

•

Redemption fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor sells shares. A redemption fee differs from a back-end load because the money is paid back into the fund. Many funds charge redemption fees only when shares are bought and then sold within a specific period of time, generally in an effort to discourage market-timing and short-term trading. Some brokers also charge their clients redemption fees for the sale of securities. None

Product management
Vanguard Capital Value Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation in a relatively concentrated portfolio of undervalued stocks across the capitalization spectrum. Using an opportunistic approach, the fund’s advisor, Wellington Management Company LLP, invests in out-of-favor stocks that offer longer-term earnings growth projections comparable to those of the market averages. Wellington Management relies on the depth and experience of its industry analysts to uncover stocks that are undervalued relative to their potential earnings prospects, asset values, or dividends.

Risk and volatility are based on the share class with the earliest inception date.
Risk measures are calculated from trailing 36-month fund returns relative to the associated benchmarks.
An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by: Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.Investment style risk: The chance that returns from small- and mid-capitalization value stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. Small and mid-size companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.Asset concentration risk: The chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks. The fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings.Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

The ship has sailed for any investors interested in BKM Capital Partners‘ inaugural investment vehicle, as the institutional fund manager recently wrapped up the final close of BKM Industrial Value Fund I LP.  The $105 million in equity commitments provides the fund with a leveraged total of $300 million for the acquisition of multi-tenant, value-add industrial assets.
It wasn’t just institutional investors that took a liking to Fund I, which launched in 2014; a small group of high net worth investors participated as well. BKM reeled them in with a different approach. The company opted to invest its own capital to finance the amassing of a crackerjack team in advance of  raising funds. Additionally, BKM raised seed money through a friends and family round, which resulted in a $100 million budget for acquisitions. “Through this strategy, we were able to demonstrate to our larger institutional investors that we can successfully acquire and generate value with our focused niche, and that it can be scaled,” Brian Malliet, co-founder & CEO of BKM, said in a prepared statement.
To date, Fund I has invested approximately $117 million in assets totaling nearly 1.2 million square feet. Purchases include the 223,000-square-foot Patrick Commerce Center in Las Vegas; the 98,500-square-foot Hayden Island Business Park in Portland; and Black Canyon Business Park, a property in Phoenix featuring 219,400 square feet. In line with its value proposition, BKM repositioned the underperforming assets, boosting their income and value.
“This value-add strategy, coupled with our ability to execute, was a major driver of investor interest during the fundraise period,” Malliet added. Fund I calls for a five-year hold period for the properties. In the meantime, the investment vehicle has money to spend, which it plans to do in its target region: the Western U.S. The focus is on metropolitan markets in California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona and Utah; however, California, Oregon and Washington are highest on the radar.
