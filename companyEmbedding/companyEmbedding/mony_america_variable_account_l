Common Questions
Beneficiary information 



What is a beneficiary?
The beneficiary is the person(s) designated in the policy to receive the death proceeds in the event of the Insured's death.


Can I designate my minor child as a beneficiary?
Yes. If proceeds become payable to a child during his/her minority, we will pay the court-appointed guardian for the estate of the child. The minor's parent automatically serves as guardian of the minor's person but not his/her estate.
Alternative suggestion: The policy owner should consider designating a Custodian to receive, manage, invest and distribute the proceeds for the minor under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. Ex: John Doe as custodian for Bobby Smith, a minor born 3/3/98, under the NY UTMA. When the minor reaches the age of majority, the custodianship terminates and the balance of any funds are distributed to the child.


Can I designate my revocable trust as beneficiary?
Yes, simply indicate the name of the trustee(s), the name of the trust, the date of the trust and the name(s) of the grantors in Section 1 of the Title Change Form. Sample wording: XYZ Bank as trustee or the successor trustee under an agreement known as the John Smith Living Trust dated 01/01/98, made by and between John Smith and said trustee. Click here for a printable form.


When is my change of beneficiary effective?
Any change of beneficiary will take effect as of the date the form was signed, provided is has been accepted and recorded at the Operations Center, subject to any payment made by us or action taken by us before receipt of the request at our Operations Center.


Can I designate multiple persons as primary beneficiary?
Yes. Simply indicate the relationship(s) to the insured person(s) along with the full names of the proposed beneficiaries. All primary beneficiaries should be listed in Section 1 under First Beneficiary(ies). Joint beneficiaries will receive equal shares proportionate to the number of those beneficiaries who survive the insured.


What should I do to change my beneficiary now that I am recently married?
A Title Change form (10481) should be completed, dated and signed. Indicate the new beneficiaries in Section 1 (be sure to indicate the full name and relationship of each person to the insured). Your change of name can also be indicated on the form in the space directly under the policy number. Click here for a printable form.


Must I complete a new change of beneficiary request form to reflect a change in the beneficiary's name due to marriage or divorce?
No. Simply write to us at
MONY Life of AmericaP. O. Box 4830Syracuse, NY 13221
advising us that your beneficiary, Jane Doe, has changed her name to Jane Smith. Provide her new address, if appropriate. We will make note of this information. No forms are necessary. Please be sure to include your policy number(s).


Can I use one form to change the beneficiary on all of my MONY policies/contracts?
Multiple policies may be indicated on each Title Change form (10481). However, separate forms must be used for each insured,except in the case of a Multi-Life policy. Click here for a printable form.


What is a Rights holder?
The person who can exercise rights is the rights holder of the policy. This term is synonymous with Owner, the individual who can exercise all rights under the provisions of the policy.


How does a Divorce impact my Beneficiary Designation?
If you are required to designate an ex-spouse or children as beneficiary(ies) pursuant to a divorce decree or order, then the decree should be submitted to us. We will conform the beneficiary designation to the terms of the decree. If you currently have your ex-spouse listed as beneficiary, then you should either change the beneficiary to reflect your new choice of beneficiary or to reconfirm your desire to designate the ex-spouse despite the divorce. In most states, a divorce does not automatically extinguish the rights of an ex-spouse as beneficiary. Therefore, an Insured who inadvertently leaves his/her ex-spouse as beneficiary of record may cause payment of the death benefits to the ex-spouse even though such payment is contrary to his/her intent.



Lost policy



How do I replace a policy that has been lost?
Once you have determined that the policy is lost and not temporarily misplaced, please advise us by completing a Certification of Loss or Destruction of Policy/Contract form(3551)and mailing it to the address shown.
Click here for a printable form.(If someone is holding the policy and refusing to surrender it due to an adverse death claim, the policy is not considered lost and you should advise us of the circumstances of the claim.)



Dividends



What are policy dividends?
Policy dividends are a return of divisible surplus to the owners of participating policies. Dividends are based on factors which change from year to year including investment earnings, mortality experience and expenses. Dividends are not guaranteed.


What are the available dividend options?
MONY has a wide variety of dividend options to choose from. For example, dividends can be: used to purchase paid-up additional insurance coverage

sent in cash
used to reduce the premium
left with the company to earn interest (which would be reported to the IRS via a 1099INT).

Other dividend options may be available from time to time.


Can dividends be withdrawn?
Yes. The available cash value of any dividend additions and/or deposits may be: withdrawn in cash

used to pay premiums on the same policy 
used to repay outstanding loan balances 

Such withdrawals will affect the total death benefit payable but will not affect the base policy face amounts.



Payments



What are the billing options available on my policy?
We offer a number of payment modes that may be available to pay premiums. Annual billing is the least expensive due to our lower billing costs and immediate interest earnings on the annual premium received.

Annual - Will require payment of the full year's payment on the policy anniversary date
Semi-Annual - Will require payments at six-month intervals, with one premium due on the policy anniversary date
Quarterly - Will require a payment at three-month intervals, with one premium due on the policy anniversary date
Monthly - Automatic payments under our MONY-Matic plan. Click here for a printable form.



Do I have an option to have premiums automatically withdrawn from my checking account?
Yes! We offer a convenient MONY-Matic payment method, which allows monthly premiums to be automatically withdrawn from your checking account. You can do this by completing our MONY-Matic Authorization form. Click here for a printable form.

Policy values



What is total death benefit?
The amount payable to a beneficiary upon the death of the insured. This generally represents the face amount of the base policy, the face amount of any additional coverage on the insured provided under a rider, the face amount of any dividend additions, the cash value of any dividend deposits, less any outstanding indebtedness (loan balance and loan interest).


What is total policy cash value?
This represents the guaranteed cash value of the base policy, if any, the cash value of any riders, the cash value of any accumulated dividends, less any outstanding indebtedness (loan balance and loan interest) that would be paid upon termination of the contract.


How can I access the funds in my policy and keep my valuable insurance protection?
There are several options that may be available to you

Withdraw any dividend for cash 
Withdraw any dividend cash value to help pay premiums 
Withdraw available dividend cash value to reduce any outstanding loan balance and/or pay loan interest 
Take a loan against the policy's cash value 
Take a policy loan to help pay premiums

Note: Please keep in mind when borrowing against the cash value, that loan interest will accrue daily and will be due on the policy anniversary date. Any outstanding indebtedness will be deducted from and will reduce the proceeds payable at surrender, lapse, or payment of a claim. Furthermore, withdrawals of dividend cash value will reduce the proceeds payable at surrender, lapse or payment of claim.


How can I obtain investment information on my Variable Life Policy?

Loans 



How does a policy loan affect my coverage?
Any outstanding indebtedness will be deducted from the proceeds payable at lapse, surrender, maturity, or payment of the death claim. Therefore, it is in the client's best interest to make loan repayments whenever possible. Loan repayments will also reduce future loan interest payments.


How can loan repayments be made?
Loan repayments can be made at your convenience in amounts of $10.00 or more by sending a check indicating the policy number and how the money is to be applied, to MONY Life of America, PO Box 4830, Syracuse, NY 13221. Additional loan repayment options are available such as

What is loan interest?
Like most financial institutions, we charge loan interest on the policy anniversary date to compensate for our loss of investment earnings from the borrowed amount. Please refer to your contract for details concerning your policy's loan interest rate.


How is loan interest charged?
Loan interest accrues daily on the unpaid loan balance and is due once a year on the policy anniversary date or upon full repayment of the loan principal. In most circumstances, if the loan interest remains unpaid at the end of the 31-day grace period, it will automatically be added to the existing loan balance, becoming interest-bearing loan principal.


How can I access the funds in my policy and keep my valuable insurance protection?
There are several options that may be available to you

Withdraw any dividend for cash 
Withdraw any dividend cash value to help pay premiums 
Withdraw available dividend cash value to reduce any outstanding loan balance and/or pay loan interest 
Take a loan against the policy's cash value 
Take a policy loan to help pay premiums 

Note: Please keep in mind when borrowing against the cash value, that loan interest will accrue daily and will be due on the policy anniversary date.

Net Cash Surrender Value reflects deductions from your policy's cash value for any loan and loan interest and any surrender charges, if they apply.

By calling our toll-free number at (800) 487-6669 and speaking to a Customer Service Representative



Do I have to repay the loan?
You can repay all or part of your loan at any time. Please note that unpaid policy loan balance and interest will reduce your policy's death benefit and cash value.
Interest will be billed annually, on your policy's anniversary. If you do not pay the amount due, it will be added to the amount of the loan and next year's interest will be based on this new loan amount. If the cash surrender value is ever insufficient to pay the loan balance, including unpaid loan interest, the policy could lapse.


What is the effect of a loan on a policy that is a MEC (Modified Endowment Contract)?
If your policy is a MEC (Modified Endowment Contract) the tax treatment of any death benefit provided under the contract will still qualify for income tax free treatment. However, you may be subject to additional taxes and penalties on any distributions from your policy during the lifetime of the insured. Any distribution from a policy that is a MEC will be taxed on an "income-first" basis. Distributions for this purpose include a loan (including any increase in the loan amount to pay interest on an existing loan or an assignment or a pledge to secure a loan) or withdrawal. Any such distributions will be considered taxable income to you to the extent there is gain in the policy at the time of distribution. That is, the distribution will be includible in income up to the amount your account value exceeds your basis in the policy.
A 10% penalty tax also will apply to the taxable portion of most pre-age 59 1/2 distributions from a policy that is a Modified Endowment Contract.

12. The section 26 Applicants propose the Substitutions as part of a continued and overall business plan by each Insurance Company to make its Contracts more attractive to existing Contract owners, participants or prospective purchasers, as the case may be, and more efficient to administer and oversee. Each Insurance Company represents that it has carefully reviewed its Contracts and each investment option offered under its Contracts with the goal of providing a superior choice of investment options. 
13. Among the principal purposes of the Substitutions, the section 26 Applicants assert that the Removed Portfolios generally have not attracted sufficient Contract owner or participant interest to support maintaining them as separate investment options under the Contracts, particularly where they duplicate or substantially overlap with other investment options offered through the Separate Accounts. As of December 31, 2006, the Separate Accounts had allocated approximately the following amounts to the Removed and Replacement Portfolios: Start Printed Page 41537

14. The section 26 Applicants also maintain that substituting the Replacement Portfolios for the Removed Portfolios would lead to greater efficiencies in administering the Contracts and potentially enable the Insurance Companies to offer a wider range of investment options in the future that would be more attractive to Contract owners and participants. In this connection, the section 26 Applicants note that the deletion of unpopular investment options would create additional capacity on their systems and platforms to offer new investment options. 
15. The section 26 Applicants further assert that the Substitutions also are designed and intended to simplify the prospectuses and related materials with respect to the Contracts and the investment options available through the Separate Accounts. In certain cases, the Insurance Companies offer several investment alternatives that overlap one another by having similar investment objectives, policies and risks. The proposed Substitutions would eliminate these overlapping investment alternatives. The section 26 Applicants believe that the deletion of overlapping investment options should not adversely affect Contract owners and participants given that other similar investment options will remain available under the Contracts and that the Contracts will either offer the same number of investment options or, in those cases where the number of investment options is being reduced, continue to offer a significant number of alternative investment options (currently expected to range in number from 27 to 51 after the Substitutions versus 28 to 57 before the Substitutions). 
16. In addition, some Contracts offer investment alternatives from multiple fund complexes, each with its own prospectus and disclosure format, which significantly increases the volume and complexity of information that is received by Contract owners and participants. The Insurance Companies believe that this situation may be confusing to Contract owners and participants. By substituting the Replacement Portfolios for the Removed Portfolios, the respective Insurance Company anticipates that it would simplify the Contract prospectuses and related materials provided to Contract owners and participants and thereby reduce the potential for Contract owner and participant confusion. The section 26 Applicants also assert that the Substitutions will enable an Insurance Company to reduce certain costs that it incurs in administering the Contracts by removing overlapping and unpopular Portfolios and thereby allowing an Insurance Company to offer more competitively priced products in the future. 
17. The section 26 Applicants note that Contract owners and participants with subaccount balances invested in shares of the Replacement Portfolios will have the same or lower net operating expenses immediately after the Substitutions. In addition, the Insurance Companies have agreed to impose certain expense limits on Replacement Portfolios to ensure that Contract owners and participants on the Substitution Date incur the same or lower expense ratios for certain periods after the Substitutions. In addition, many of the Replacement Portfolios are larger than their corresponding Removed Portfolios. Generally speaking, larger funds tend to have lower expenses than comparable funds that are smaller. This is because, with a larger asset size, fixed fund expenses are spread over a larger base, lowering the expense ratios. Therefore, as a result of certain Substitutions, various costs such as legal, accounting, printing and trustee fees will be spread over a larger base with each Contract owner and participant bearing a smaller portion of the cost than would be the case if the Replacement Portfolios and/or the Trust (as applicable) were smaller in size. Larger funds also may have lower trading expenses, potentially resulting in higher returns. 
18. The section 26 Applicants also argue that certain of the proposed Substitutions would replace an outside Portfolio with a Portfolio for which AXA Equitable serves as Manager and, thus, would permit AXA Equitable, Start Printed Page 41538under the Multi-Manager Order, to appoint, dismiss and replace Advisers and amend Advisory Agreements as necessary to seek optimal performance from the Portfolio and its portfolio managers. Notwithstanding the Multi-Manager Order, with respect to the Substitution involving the EQ/Van Kampen Real Estate Portfolio, after the Substitution Date (as defined herein), the Section 26 Applicants agree not to change the Adviser to the EQ/Van Kampen Real Estate Portfolio without first obtaining shareholder approval of either (a) the Adviser change or (b) AXA Equitable's continued ability to rely on the Multi-Manager Order. Even with respect to this Substitution, the section 26 Applicants believe that the Substitution would provide AXA Equitable, as the investment manager of the Trust, with greater oversight capabilities with respect to portfolios offered through its Contracts. 
19. Moreover, certain of the Substitutions will replace an outside Portfolio with a Portfolio that is managed by AXA Equitable. In this regard, the relevant Replacement Portfolios generally are only available through the variable insurance and annuity products offered by AXA Equitable and its affiliates. Consequently, the Board of Trustees of the relevant Replacement Portfolios has greater sensitivity to the needs of Contract owners and participants. The relevant Substitutions also will provide AXA Equitable with more influence over the administrative aspects of the Portfolios, while providing Contract owners and participants with the benefit of third party asset management. Influence is important because changes to Removed Portfolios can result in costly, off-cycle communications and mailings to Contract owners and participants. Conversely, for the relevant Replacement Portfolios, AXA Equitable has greater influence over the pace and timing of such changes. AXA Equitable believes that the relevant Substitutions will enable it to exercise more influence over the management and administration of the Portfolios, thereby reducing costs and customer confusion. The added influence will give AXA Equitable the ability to react more quickly to changes and problems it encounters in its oversight of the relevant Replacement Portfolios. 
20. The section 26 Applicants also maintain that the Substitutions will substitute shares of a Replacement Portfolio for shares of a Removed Portfolio, which has very similar, and in some cases substantially similar, investment objectives, investment policies and risks as those of the corresponding Removed Portfolio. This fact is expected to simplify the process of explaining the Substitutions to Contract owners and participants, including an explanation of the relevant differences in the policies of the Replacement and Removed Portfolios, and should facilitate their understanding of the effect of the Substitutions on them. A summary description of the investment objectives, investment policies and principal risks of each Removed Portfolio and its corresponding proposed Replacement Portfolio is set forth below.

As of December 31, 2006, the assets of the Replacement Portfolio were approximately $21 billion, while the assets of the Removed Portfolio were approximately $150 million.
22. The section 26 Applicants currently expect that the proposed Substitutions will be carried out on or about August 17, 2007 or as soon as reasonably practical thereafter (“Substitution Date”) and by supplements to the prospectuses for the Contracts and Separate Accounts, which were delivered to Contract owners and participants at least thirty (30) days before the Substitutions, each Insurance Company has notified all Contract owners and participants of its intention to take the necessary actions, including seeking the order requested by the application, to substitute shares of the Replacement Portfolios for the Removed Portfolios as described herein. The supplements advised Contract owners and participants that from the date of the supplement until the date of the proposed Substitutions, Contract owners and participants are permitted to make transfers of Contract value (or annuity unit value) out of each Removed Portfolio subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfers (or exchanges) being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers (or exchanges) or a limited number of transfers (or exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge, as applicable. The supplements also informed Contract owners and participants that the Insurance Companies will not exercise any rights reserved under any Contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least 30 days after each proposed Substitution.[88] 
           The supplements also advised Contract owners and participants how to provide instructions on reallocating Contract value in light of the proposed Substitutions. 
23. In addition, the supplements advised Contract owners and participants that any Contract value remaining in a Removed Portfolio subaccount on the Substitution Date will be transferred to the corresponding Replacement Portfolio subaccount and that the Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value. The supplements also advised Contract owners and participants that for at least 30 days following each proposed Substitution, the Insurance Companies will permit Contract owners and participants to make transfers of Contract value (or annuity unit value) out of each Replacement Portfolio subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfers (or exchanges) being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers (or exchanges) or a limited number of transfers (or exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge, as applicable. 
24. Each Insurance Company has sent or will send Contract owners and participants prospectuses for the relevant Replacement Portfolios prior to the Substitutions. The section 26 Applicants will send the appropriate prospectus supplement (or other notice, in the case of Contracts no longer actively marketed and for which there are a relatively small number of existing Contract owners or participants), containing this disclosure to all existing Contract owners and participants. Prospective purchasers and new purchasers of Contracts will be provided with a Contract prospectus and the Start Printed Page 41559supplement containing disclosure regarding the Substitutions, as well as a prospectus and/or supplement for the Replacement Portfolios. The Contract prospectus and the supplement and the prospectus and/or supplement for the Replacement Portfolios will be delivered to purchasers of new Contracts in accordance with all applicable legal requirements. 
25. In addition to the prospectus supplements distributed to Contract owners and participants, within five business days after the proposed Substitutions are completed, Contract owners and participants will be sent a written notice of the Substitutions informing them that each Substitution was carried out and that they may transfer all Contract value or cash value under a Contract invested in any one of the subaccounts on the date of the notice to one or more other subaccounts available under their Contract at no cost and without regard to the usual limit on the frequency of transfers among the variable account options. The notice will also reiterate that (other than with respect to implementing policies and procedures designed to prevent disruptive transfers and other market timing activity) each Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers or, to the extent transfer charges apply to a Contract, to impose any charges on transfers until at least 30 days after each proposed Substitution. The Insurance Companies will also send each Contract owner and participant a current prospectus for each of the relevant Replacement Portfolios to the extent they have not previously received a current version. 
26. Each Insurance Company also is seeking approval of the proposed Substitutions from any state insurance regulators whose approval may be necessary or appropriate. The proposed Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value determined on the date of the Substitutions pursuant to Section 22 of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contract owner's or participant's Contract value, cash value, or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the Separate Accounts. Each Substitution will be effected by redeeming shares of the Removed Portfolio in cash and/or in-kind on the Substitution Date at their net asset value and using the proceeds of those redemptions to purchase shares of the Replacement Portfolio at their net asset value on the same date. All in-kind redemptions from a Removed Portfolio of which any of the Applicants is an affiliated person will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in the no-action letter issued by the staff of the Commission to Signature Financial Group, Inc. (Dec. 28, 1999). 
27. Moreover, the section 26 Applicants state that Contract owners and participants will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions, nor will their rights or insurance benefits or the Insurance Companies' obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. Consequently, all expenses incurred in connection with the proposed Substitutions, including any brokerage, legal, accounting, and other fees and expenses, will be paid by the Insurance Companies. In addition, the proposed Substitutions will not impose any tax liability on Contract owners or participants. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract owners and participants to be greater after the proposed Substitutions than before the proposed Substitutions. All Contract-level fees will remain the same after the proposed Substitutions. No fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed Substitutions because each proposed Substitution will not be treated as a transfer for purposes of assessing transfer charges or computing the number of permissible transfers under the Contracts.

Basic Value Fund (Series I shares), Fidelity Growth Opportunities Portfolio (Initial Class and Service Class shares), PIMCO Total Return Portfolio (Administrative shares), Universal Core Plus Fixed Income Portfolio (Class I shares), and the Universal U.S. Real Estate Portfolio (Class I and Class II shares), the Section 26 Applicants represent that, with respect to those who were Contract owners or participants on the date of the proposed Substitutions, at no time after the date of the Substitution will the Insurance Companies increase Contract charges or total Separate Account charges (net of any waiver or reimbursements) of the subaccounts that invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio. If the net operating expenses for the applicable Replacement Portfolio (taking into account any expense waivers or reimbursements) for any fiscal quarter following the date of the Substitution exceed on an annualized basis the net expense ratio for the corresponding Removed Portfolio for fiscal year 2006, the Insurance Companies will reimburse the Separate Account expenses paid during that quarter of the subaccount that invests in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the extent necessary to offset the amount by which that Replacement Portfolio's net expense ratio for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, that of the corresponding Removed Portfolio. 
30. The section 26 Applicants also agree that, with respect to shares issued in connection with the proposed Substitution involving the Universal U.S. Real Estate Portfolio, the Rule 12b-1 fees for the Replacement Portfolio's Class IB shares will not be raised above the Removed Portfolio's Class II shares maximum Rule 12b-1 fee (0.35%) Start Printed Page 41560without first obtaining shareholder approval.[89] 

31. In addition, the section 26 Applicants further agree that with respect to the Substitutions involving the Alger American Balanced Portfolio (Class O shares), MFS Total Return Series (Initial Class shares), T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Balanced Portfolio, Fidelity Growth Portfolio (Initial Class and Service Class shares), and the Universal Equity Growth Portfolio (Class I shares), the Insurance Companies will not increase total separate account charges with respect to the corresponding Replacement Portfolio sub-accounts for any outstanding Contracts on the date of the Substitutions for a period of two years from the date of the Substitutions. 
32. Moreover, the section 26 Applicants agree that, with respect to the Substitutions involving the Alger American Balanced Portfolio (Class O shares), MFS Total Return Series (Initial Class shares), and the T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Balanced Portfolio, to the extent that the annualized expense ratio of each applicable Replacement Portfolio exceeds, for each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the two years following the date of the proposed Substitutions, the net expense ratio of the corresponding Removed Portfolio for fiscal year 2006, the Insurance Companies will, for each Contract outstanding on the date of the proposed Substitutions, reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the two years following the date of the proposed Substitution, the subaccounts investing in the Replacement Portfolio such that the sum of the Replacement Portfolio's net operating expense ratio (taking into account any expense waivers or reimbursements) and subaccount expense ratio (asset-based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculations of subaccount unit value) for such period will not exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the Removed Portfolio's net operating expense ratio (taking into account any expense waivers or reimbursements) and subaccount expense ratio for fiscal year 2006. 
33. In addition, with respect to the Substitutions involving the Fidelity Growth Portfolio (Initial Class and Service Class shares), and the Universal Equity Growth Portfolio (Class I shares), the Section 26 Applicants agree that, in connection with assets held under Contracts affected by the Substitutions, the Insurance Companies will not receive, for three years from the date of the proposed Substitutions, any direct or indirect benefits from the relevant Replacement Portfolio, its advisers, or underwriters (or its affiliates) at a rate higher than that which they had received from the corresponding Removed Portfolios, their advisers, or underwriters (or their affiliates), including without limitation, 12b-1, shareholder service, administration or other service fees, revenue sharing or other arrangements in connection with such assets. The Insurance Companies also represent that the proposed Substitutions and the selection of the relevant Replacement Portfolio were not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to the Insurance Companies or their affiliates by the relevant Replacement Portfolio, its advisers, underwriters or affiliates. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act prohibits the depositor of a registered unit investment trust that invests in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without Commission approval. Section 26(c) provides that “[t]he Commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title.” 
2. The section 26 Applicants assert that the each proposed Substitution involves a substitution of securities within the meaning of section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and therefore request an order from the Commission pursuant to section 26(c) approving the proposed Substitutions. 
3. The section 26 Applicants state they have reserved the right under the Contracts to substitute shares of another eligible investment fund for one of the current investment funds offered as a funding option under the Contracts both to protect themselves and their Contract owners and participants in situations where either might be harmed or disadvantaged by events affecting the issuer of the securities held by a Separate Account and to preserve the opportunity to replace such shares in situations where a substitution could benefit the Insurance Companies and their respective Contract owners and participants. 
4. The section 26 Applicants also argue that each Replacement Portfolio and its corresponding Removed Portfolio have similar, and in some cases substantially similar or identical, investment objectives, policies and risks. In addition, each proposed Substitution retains for Contract owners and participants the investment flexibility that is a central feature of the Contracts. The section 26 Applicants assert that any impact on the investment programs of affected Contract owners and participants, including the appropriateness of the available investment options, should therefore be negligible. 
5. The section 26 Applicants further assert that the ultimate effect of the Substitutions would be to remove overlapping and duplicative investment options and those investment options that have not attracted sufficient Contract owner or participant interest to support maintaining them as investment options under the Contracts. The Substitutions will permit the Insurance Companies to present information to their Contract owners and participants in a simpler and more concise manner, and it is anticipated that after the proposed Substitutions, Contract owners and participants will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under their Contracts. 
6. In addition, the section 26 Applicants also argue that in connection with each proposed Substitution, Contract owners and participants with subaccount balances invested in a Replacement Portfolio will have the same or lower net operating expense ratio(s) after the Substitution. In this regard, each Insurance Company has agreed to impose certain expense limits, as discussed above, to ensure that Contract owners and participants do not incur higher expenses as a result of a Substitution either for a period of two years after the Substitution or for the life of the Contract, as applicable. 
7. In addition to the foregoing, the section 26 Applicants generally submit that each proposed Substitution meets the standards that the Commission and its staff have applied to similar substitutions that the Commission previously has approved. The section 26 Applicants also submit that the proposed Substitutions are not of the type that section 26(c) was designed to prevent as the Contracts provide each Contract owner or participant with the right to exercise his or her own judgment, and transfer Contract values and cash values into and among other investment options available to Contract owners or participants under their Contracts. Additionally, the Substitutions will not, in any manner, reduce the nature or quality of the Start Printed Page 41561available investment options. In this regard, the proposed Substitutions retain for Contract owners and participants the investment flexibility which is a central feature of the Contracts. 
8. Moreover, the section 26 Applicants will offer Contract owners and participants the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty (other than with respect to implementing policies and procedures designed to prevent disruptive transfer and other market timing activity) that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the supplement notifying Contract owners and participants of the proposed Substitutions (which supplement has been delivered to Contract owners and participants at least thirty (30) days before the Substitutions) and ending no earlier than thirty (30) days after the proposed Substitutions. The Substitutions, therefore, will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that section 26(c) was designed to prevent. 
9. The section 26 Applicants also note that the proposed Substitutions are also unlike the type of substitution that section 26(c) was designed to prevent in that by purchasing a Contract or participating in a group Contract, Contract owners and participants select much more than a particular underlying fund in which to invest their Contract values. They also select the specific type of insurance coverage offered by the section 26 Applicants under the applicable Contract, as well as numerous other rights and privileges set forth in the Contract. Contract owners and participants also may have considered the Insurance Company's size, financial condition, and its reputation for service in selecting their Contract. These factors will not change as a result of the proposed Substitutions, nor will the annuity, life or tax benefits afforded under the Contracts held by any of the affected Contract owners or participants. 
10. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits the same persons, acting as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company. 
11. Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, issue an order exempting any proposed transaction from the provisions of Section 17(a) if: (i) the terms of the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (ii) the proposed transactions are consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned; and (iii) the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act. 
12. The section 17 Applicants request an order pursuant to section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting them from the provisions of section 17(a) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the In-Kind Transactions in connection with the proposed Substitutions. 
13. The section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed In-Kind Transactions, including the consideration to be paid and received, as described in the application, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. The In-Kind Transactions will be effected at the respective net asset values of each of the relevant Removed Portfolios and each of the relevant Replacement Portfolios, as determined in accordance with the procedures disclosed in the registration statement for the relevant investment company and as required by Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act. The In-Kind Transactions will not change the dollar value of any Contract owner's or participant's investment in any of the Separate Accounts, the value of any Contract, the accumulation value or other value credited to any Contract, or the death benefit payable under any Contract. After the proposed In-Kind Transactions, the value of a Separate Account's investment in a Replacement Portfolio will equal the value of its investments in the corresponding Removed Portfolio (together with the value of any pre-existing investments in the Replacement Portfolio) before the In-Kind Transactions. 
14. The section 17 Applicants state they will assure themselves that the In-Kind Transactions will be in substantial compliance with the conditions of Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act. The section 17 Applicants will assure themselves that the investment companies will carry out the proposed In-Kind Transactions in conformity with the conditions of Rule 17a-7 (or, as applicable, a Removed Portfolio's and a Replacement Portfolio's normal valuation procedures, as set forth in the relevant investment company's registration statement), except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold will not be cash. 
15. The section 17 Applicants also assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. Furthermore, the section 17 Applicants represent that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be consistent with the policies of the Removed and corresponding Replacement Portfolios, as recited in their respective current registration statements, and that the proposed In-Kind Transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act and do not present any conditions or abuses that the 1940 Act was designed to prevent. 
Conclusion 
For the reasons set forth in the application, the Applicants each respectively request that the Commission issue an order of approval pursuant to section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and an order of exemption pursuant to section 17(b) of the 1940 Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the Public Reference Branch of the Commission, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549 (tel. (202) 551-8090).
Applicants' Representations
1. MLOA is a stock life insurance company organized in 1969 under the laws of the State of Arizona. MLOA is licensed to sell life insurance and annuities in 49 states (not including New York), the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. MONY is a stock life insurance company organized in 1998 under the laws of New York. MONY is licensed to sell life insurance and annuities in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each Insurance Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of AXA Financial, Inc., a diversified financial services company, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the AXA Group, the holding company for an international group of insurance and related financial services companies. MLOA serves as depositor for each of the MLOA Separate Accounts; MONY serves as depositor for each of the MONY Separate Accounts.
2. MLOA Separate Account A and MLOA Separate Account L were established under Arizona law in 1987 and 1985, respectively, pursuant to authority granted by MLOA's Board of Directors. Each MLOA Separate Account is a segregated asset account of MLOA and is registered with the Commission as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. The MLOA Separate Accounts fund the respective variable benefits available under the Contracts issued by MLOA. Units of interest in the MLOA Separate Accounts under the Contracts are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (“1933 Act”).[1] 

3. MONY Separate Account A and MONY Separate Account L were each established under New York law in 1990 pursuant to authority granted by MONY's Board of Trustees. Each MONY Separate Account is a segregated asset account of MONY and is registered with the Commission as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. The MONY Separate Accounts fund the respective variable benefits available under the Contracts issued by MONY. Units of interest in the MONY Separate Accounts under the Contracts are registered under the 1933 Act.[2] 

4. EQAT and VIP are each organized as a Delaware statutory trust and registered as an open-end management investment company under the 1940 Act. Each is an affiliate of the Section 26 Applicants. The shares of each Trust are registered under the 1933 Act. Each Trust is a series investment company. EQAT currently has 63 separate series and VIP currently has 20 separate series (each a “Portfolio” and collectively, the “Portfolios”). AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company currently serves as investment manager (“Manager”) of each of the Portfolios. The Replacement Portfolios are series of the Trusts. The Removed Portfolios are series of unaffiliated registered investment companies.
5. Each Trust currently offers two classes of shares, Class IA and Class IB shares for EQAT and Class A and Class B shares for VIP, which differ only in that Class IB and Class B shares are subject to a distribution plan adopted and administered pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act. Under that distribution plan, up to 0.50% of the average daily net assets attributable to the Class IB or Class B shares of each Portfolio may be used to pay for distribution and shareholder services. The distributors for the shares of each Portfolio are AXA Advisors, LLC (“AXA Advisors”) and AXA Distributors, LLC (“AXA Distributors”). Under the Distribution Agreements with respect to the promotion, sale and servicing of shares of each Portfolio, payments to AXA Advisors and AXA Distributors, with respect to activities under the distribution plan, are currently limited to payments at an annual rate equal to 0.25% of the average daily net assets of each Portfolio (including the Replacement Portfolios) attributable to its Class IB or Class B shares.
6. The Manager has retained investment sub-advisers (“Advisers”) to provide day-to-day investment advisory services for each of the 61 of the 63 current EQAT Portfolios and 11 of the 20 current VIP Portfolios. The Trusts have received an exemptive order from the Commission (“Multi-Manager Order”) that permits the Manager, or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control (within the meaning of Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act) with the Manager, subject to certain conditions, including approval of the Board of Trustees of the relevant Trust, and without the approval of shareholders to: (i) Select new or additional Advisers for each Portfolio; (ii) enter into new Investment Advisory Agreements with Advisers (“Advisory Agreements”) and/or materially modify the terms of any existing Advisory Agreement; (iii) terminate any existing Adviser and replace the Adviser; and (iv) continue the employment of an existing Adviser on the same contract terms where the Advisory Agreement has been assigned because of a change of control of the Adviser.
7. The variable annuity Contracts subject to this Application include flexible premium deferred variable annuity contracts with a variety of sales charge structures. These variable annuity Contracts are issued to or on behalf of individuals. All variable annuity Contracts allow the Contract owner to allocate contributions or premium payments among the variable and any fixed investment options available under the variable annuity Contracts. The contributions or premium payments accumulate in the investment options. The variable life insurance Contracts issued by the Insurance Companies include flexible premium individual variable life, second to die and corporate variable life policies. Premium payments under the variable life insurance Contracts Start Printed Page 61088accumulate in variable and any fixed investment options.
8. The Section 26 Applicants have reserved the right under the Contracts to substitute shares of another eligible investment fund for one of the current investment funds offered as a funding option under the Contracts. The prospectuses for the Contracts and the Separate Accounts contain appropriate disclosure of this right.
9. The Contracts do not restrict transfers from a variable subaccount and there are no limits on transfers into a variable subaccount or a guaranteed account (for those Contracts that offer a guaranteed account investment option), although transfer charges may apply. For those variable annuity Contracts that offer a guaranteed account investment option, except with respect to New York variable annuity Contracts, transfers from the guaranteed account are subject to a market value adjustment if the transfer request is not received at the end of the prescribed accumulation period. In addition, for New York variable annuity Contracts, a minimum amount must be maintained in a guaranteed account for those Contracts that have investments in such accounts and a minimum number of free transfers are guaranteed. For variable life insurance Contracts that offer a guaranteed account investment option, there is a dollar limit on the amount that can be held in, and the amount that may be transferred from, the guaranteed account. Also with respect to variable life insurance Contracts, transfers from a guaranteed account may only be made once a year. With respect to certain variable life insurance Contracts, including New York life insurance Contracts, there are a minimum number of free transfers guaranteed. With respect to corporate-owned life insurance Contracts, transfers are not permitted between a guaranteed account and a fixed separate account.
10. Each Insurance Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Separate Accounts, proposes to exercise its contractual right to substitute a different eligible investment fund for one of the current investment funds offered as a funding option under the Contracts. In particular, the Section 26 Applicants propose the following substitutions:
Removed portfoliosReplacement portfoliosThe Dreyfus Socially Responsible Growth Fund, Inc. (Initial Class shares)EQ/Calvert Socially Responsible Portfolio (Class IA shares).Dreyfus Variable Investment Fund—International Value Portfolio (Initial Class shares)EQ/Mercury International Value Portfolio (Class IA shares).Lord Abbett Series Fund—Growth and Income Portfolio (Class VC shares)EQ/Lord Abbett Growth and Income Portfolio (Class IA shares).T. Rowe Price Fixed Income Series, Inc.—Limited-Term Bond PortfolioEQ/Short Duration Bond Portfolio (Class IA shares).T. Rowe Price Fixed Income Series, Inc.—Prime Reserve PortfolioEQ/Money Market Portfolio (Class IA shares).T. Rowe Price International Series, Inc.—International Stock PortfoliolEQ/Alliance International Portfolio (Class IA shares).The Universal Institutional Funds, Inc.—Emerging Markets Equity Portfolio (Class I shares)EQ/Van Kampen Emerging Markets Equity Portfolio (Class IA shares).Old Mutual Insurance Series Fund—Mid-Cap PortfolioEQ/FI Mid Cap Portfolio (Class IA shares).Lord Abbett Series Fund—Mid-Cap Value Portfolio (Class VC shares)EQ/Lord Abbett Mid Cap Value Portfolio (Class IA shares).PIMCO Variable Insurance Trust—Real Return Portfolio (Administrative Class shares)EQ/JPMorgan Core Bond Portfolio (Class IA shares).Lord Abbett Series Fund—Bond-Debenture Portfolio (Class VC shares)AXA Premier VIP High Yield Portfolio (Class A shares).
11. The Section 26 Applicants propose the Substitutions as part of a continued and overall business plan by each of the Insurance Companies to make its Contracts more attractive to existing Contract owners or to prospective purchasers, as the case may be. Each Insurance Company has reviewed its Contracts and each investment option offered under its Contracts with the goal of providing a superior choice of investment alternatives. The Substitutions are being proposed to address the lack of Contract owner interest in the Removed Portfolios, which generally have not attracted sufficient Contract owner interest to support maintaining them as separate investment options under the Contracts, particularly where they duplicate or substantially overlap with other investment options offered through the Separate Accounts. The Substitutions also are intended to simplify the prospectuses and related materials with respect to the Contracts and the investment options available through the Separate Accounts. Additionally, each Substitution will substitute shares of the Replacement Portfolio for shares of the Removed Portfolio, which has similar investment objectives, policies and risks as the Replacement Portfolio. In addition, the Insurance Companies have agreed to impose certain expense limits with respect to the Replacement Portfolios for certain periods after the Substitutions, as described below. Furthermore, the Substitutions ultimately may enable the Insurance Companies to reduce certain of the costs that they incur in administering the Contracts by removing overlapping and unpopular Portfolios. Moreover, the proposed Substitutions would replace an unaffiliated Portfolio with a Portfolio for which AXA Equitable serves as Manager and, thus, would permit AXA Equitable to appoint, dismiss and replace Advisers and amend Advisory Agreements as necessary to seek optimal performance from the Portfolio and its portfolio managers. Finally, the Substitutions are designed to provide Contract owners with an opportunity to continue their investment in a similar Portfolio without interruption and without any cost to them.
12. The Insurance Companies have agreed to bear all expenses incurred in connection with the Substitutions and related filings and notices, including legal, accounting, brokerage and other fees and expenses. On the effective date of the Substitutions (“Substitution Date”), the amount of any Contract owner's Contract value or the dollar value of a Contract owner's investment in the relevant Contract will not change as a result of the Substitutions.

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, the net annual operating expense ratio of the Replacement Portfolio was lower than the Removed Portfolio's net annual operating expense ratio due primarily to the Replacement Portfolio's lower management fee rate and an expense limitation arrangement in effect for the Replacement Portfolio.
As of December 31, 2005, the assets of the Replacement Portfolio were approximately $72.5 million, while the assets of the Removed Portfolio were approximately $431.2 million. Although the Replacement Portfolio is smaller than the Removed Portfolio, it is anticipated that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expense ratio will be lower than the Removed Portfolio's annual operating expense ratio immediately after the Substitution due to the expense limitation arrangement in effect. The Section 26 Applicants assert that the proposed Substitution of the Replacement Portfolio for the Removed Portfolio will therefore benefit the Contract owners by lowering the annual operating expense ratio. To ensure that Contract owners with amounts allocated to the Removed Portfolio on the date of the Substitution do not incur higher expenses with respect to such amounts for a period of two years after the Substitution, MLOA and MONY also have agreed to impose a two-year expense limitation with respect to such amounts, as summarized below.

Information regarding the average annual total returns of each Replacement and Removed Portfolio for the one-, five- and ten-year periods (or since inception, if shorter) ended December 31, 2005 is included in the Appendix.
26. By supplements to the prospectuses for the Contracts and Separate Accounts which will be delivered to Contract owners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitutions, each Insurance Company will notify all Contract owners of its intention to take the necessary actions, including seeking the order requested by the Application, to substitute shares of the Replacement Portfolios for the Removed Portfolios as described in this notice. The supplements will advise Contract owners that from the date of the supplement until the date of the proposed Substitutions, owners are permitted to make transfers of Contract value (or annuity unit value) out of each Removed Portfolio subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfers (or exchanges) being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers (or exchanges) or a limited number of transfers (or exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge. The supplements also will inform Contract owners that the Insurance Companies will not exercise any rights reserved under any Contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least 30 days after each proposed Substitution (other than with respect to implementing policies and procedures designed to prevent disruptive transfer and other market timing activity). The supplements also will advise Contract owners how to provide instructions on reallocating Contract value in light of the proposed Substitutions. In addition, the supplements will advise Contract owners that any Contract value remaining in a Removed Portfolio subaccount on the Substitution Date will be transferred to the corresponding Replacement Portfolio subaccount and that the Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value. The supplements will also advise Contract owners that for at least 30 days following each proposed Substitution, the Insurance Companies will permit Contract owners to make transfers of Contract value (or annuity unit value) out of each Replacement Portfolio subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfers (or exchanges) being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers (or exchanges) or a limited number of transfers (or exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge, as applicable.
27. Each Insurance Company also will send affected Contract owners prospectuses for the Replacement Portfolio prior to the Substitutions. Also the Section 26 Applicants will send the appropriate prospectus supplement (or other notice, in the case of Contracts no longer actively marketed and for which there are a relatively small number of existing Contract owners (“Inactive Contracts”)), containing this disclosure to all existing Contract owners. Prospective purchasers and new purchasers of Contracts will be provided with a Contract prospectus and the supplement containing disclosure regarding the Substitutions, as well as a prospectus and/or supplement for the Replacement Portfolios. Applicants represent that the Contract prospectus and the supplement and the prospectus and/or supplement for the Replacement Portfolios will be delivered to purchasers of new Contracts in accordance with all applicable legal requirements.
28. In addition to the prospectus supplements distributed to Contract owners, within five business days after the proposed Substitutions are completed, Contract owners will be sent a written notice of the Substitutions informing them that each Substitution was carried out and that they may transfer all Contract value or cash value under a Contract invested in any one of the subaccounts on the date of the notice to one or more other subaccounts available under their Contract at no cost and without regard to the usual limit on the frequency of transfers among the variable account options. The notice will also reiterate that (other than with respect to implementing policies and procedures designed to prevent disruptive transfers and other market timing activity) each Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers or to impose any charges on transfers until at least 30 days after each proposed Substitution. The Insurance Companies will also send each Contract owner a current prospectus for each of the relevant Replacement Portfolios to the extent they have not previously received a current version. Each Insurance Company also is seeking approval of the proposed Substitutions from any state insurance regulators whose approval may be necessary or appropriate.
29. The proposed Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value determined on the date of the Substitutions pursuant to Section 22 of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder, with no change in the amount of any Contract owner's Contract value, cash value, or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the Separate Accounts. Each Substitution will be effected by redeeming shares of the Removed Portfolio in cash and/or in-kind on the Substitution Date at their net asset value and using the proceeds of those redemptions to purchase shares of the Replacement Portfolio at their net asset value on the same date. All in-kind redemptions from a Removed Portfolio of which any of the Applicants is an affiliated person will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in the no-action letter issued by the staff of the Commission to Signature Financial Group, Inc. (Dec. 28, 1999).
30. Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions, nor will their rights or insurance benefits or the Insurance Companies' obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. All expenses incurred in connection with the proposed Substitutions, including any brokerage, legal, accounting, and other fees and expenses, will be paid by the Insurance Companies. In addition, the proposed Substitutions will not impose any tax liability on Contract owners. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitutions than before the proposed Substitutions. All Contract-level fees will remain the same after the proposed Substitutions. No fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed Substitutions because each proposed Substitution will not be treated as a transfer for purposes of assessing transfer charges or computing Start Printed Page 61105the number of permissible transfers under the Contracts.
31. With respect to those who were Contract owners on the date of the proposed Substitutions, the Insurance Companies will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the two years following the date of the proposed Substitutions, the subaccounts investing in the Replacement Portfolios such that the sum of each Replacements Portfolio's net operating expense ratio (taking into account any expense waivers or reimbursements) and subaccount expense ratio (asset-based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculations of subaccount unit value) for such period will not exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the corresponding Removed Portfolio's net operating expense ratio (taking into account any expense waivers or reimbursements) and subaccount expense ratio for fiscal year 2005, except for the Substitutions involving the Lord Abbett Series Fund—Growth and Income Portfolio, PIMCO Variable Insurance Trust—Real Return Portfolio and Lord Abbett Series Fund—Bond-Debenture Portfolio. With respect to the Lord Abbett Series Fund—Growth and Income Portfolio, PIMCO Variable Insurance Trust—Real Return Portfolio and Lord Abbett Series Fund—Bond-Debenture Portfolio, the Insurance Companies will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) for the life of each Contract outstanding on the date of the proposed Substitutions, the subaccounts investing in the Replacement Portfolios such that the sum of each Replacement Portfolio's net operating expense ratio (taking into account any expense waivers or reimbursements) and subaccount expense ratio (asset-based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculations of subaccount unit value) for such period will not exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the corresponding Removed Portfolio's net operating expense ratio (taking into account any expense waivers or reimbursements) and subaccount expense ratio for fiscal year 2005.
32. For a period of two years from the date of each proposed Substitution, except the Substitutions involving the Lord Abbett Series Fund—Growth and Income Portfolio, PIMCO Variable Insurance Trust—Real Return Portfolio and Lord Abbett Series Fund—Bond-Debenture Portfolio, the Insurance Companies will not increase total Separate Account charges (net of any waivers or reimbursements) for any existing owner of the Contracts on the date of the proposed Substitutions. With respect to the Lord Abbett Series Fund—Growth and Income Portfolio, PIMCO Variable Insurance Trust—Real Return Portfolio and Lord Abbett Series Fund—Bond-Debenture Portfolio, at no time after the date of the proposed Substitutions will the Insurance Companies increase the total Separate Account charges (net of any waiver or reimbursements) of each Contract outstanding on the date of the proposed Substitutions.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act prohibits the depositor of a registered unit investment trust that invests in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without Commission approval. Section 26(c) provides that “[t]he Commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title.” Section 26(c) protects the expectation of investors that the unit investment trust will accumulate shares of a particular issuer and is intended to ensure that unnecessary or burdensome sales loads, additional reinvestment costs and other charges will not be incurred due to unapproved substitutions of securities.
2. The proposed Substitutions involve a substitution of securities within the meaning of Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act. The Section 26 Applicants, therefore, request an order from the Commission pursuant to Section 26(c) approving the proposed Substitutions.
3. The Section 26 Applicants have reserved the right under the Contracts to substitute shares of another eligible investment fund for one of the current investment funds offered as a funding option under the Contracts. The prospectuses for the Contracts and the Separate Accounts contain appropriate disclosure of this right. The Section 26 Applicants have reserved this right of substitution both to protect themselves and their Contract owners in situations where either might be harmed or disadvantaged by events affecting the issuer of the securities held by a Separate Account and to preserve the opportunity to replace such shares in situations where a substitution could benefit the Insurance Companies and their respective Contract owners.
4. Applicants assert that each Replacement Portfolio and its corresponding Removed Portfolio have similar, and in some cases substantially similar or identical, investment objectives, policies and risks. In addition, the proposed Substitutions retain for Contract owners the investment flexibility that is a central feature of the Contracts. According to the Applicants, any impact on the investment programs of affected Contract owners, including the appropriateness of the available investment options, should therefore be negligible.
5. Applicants maintain that the ultimate effect of each Substitution would be to remove overlapping and duplicative investment options and that each Substitution will permit each Insurance Company to present information to its Contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner. Applicants anticipate that after each proposed Substitution, Contract owners will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under their Contracts.
6. Applicants also state that, as a result of each proposed Substitution, Contract owners with subaccount balances invested in each Replacement Portfolio will have lower net operating expenses. Each Insurance Company has agreed to impose a two year expense limit, except with respect to the proposed Substitutions involving the Lord Abbett Series Fund—Growth and Income Portfolio, PIMCO Variable Insurance Trust—Real Return Portfolio and Lord Abbett Series Fund—Bond-Debenture Portfolio for which each Insurance Company has agreed to impose an expense limit for the life of each Contract, so that the sum of each Replacement Portfolio's net operating expense ratio (taking into account any expense waivers and reimbursements) and subaccount expense ratio (asset-based charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculation of subaccount unit values) for each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) will not exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the corresponding Removed Portfolio's net operating expense ratio and subaccount expense ratio for fiscal year 2005.
7. Applicants contend that, therefore, each Substitution protects the Contract owners who have allocated Contract value to each Removed Portfolio by: (i) Providing an underlying investment option for subaccounts invested in the Removed Portfolio that is similar to the Removed Portfolio; (ii) providing such Contract owners with simpler disclosure documents; and (iii) providing such Contract owners with an investment option that would have net operating Start Printed Page 61106expenses that are lower than the current investment option.
8. Applicants assert that the proposed Substitutions are not of the type that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Unlike traditional unit investment trusts where a depositor could only substitute investment securities in a manner which permanently affected all the investors in the trust, the Contracts provide each Contract owner with the right to exercise his or her own judgment, and transfer Contract values and cash values into and among other investment options available to Contract owners under their Contracts. Additionally, the Section 26 Applicants claim that the Substitutions will not, in any manner, reduce the nature or quality of the available investment options. Moreover, the Section 26 Applicants will offer Contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the supplement notifying Contract owners of the proposed Substitutions (which supplement will be delivered to Contract owners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitutions) and ending no earlier than thirty (30) days after the Substitution Date. The Substitutions, therefore, will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent.
9. Applicants maintain that the proposed Substitutions are also unlike the type of substitution that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent in that by purchasing a Contract, Contract owners select much more than a particular underlying fund in which to invest their Contract values. They also select the specific type of insurance coverage offered by the Section 26 Applicants under the applicable Contract, as well as numerous other rights and privileges set forth in the Contract. Contract owners also may have considered the Insurance Company's size, financial condition, and its reputation for service in selecting their Contract. These factors will not change as a result of the proposed Substitution.
10. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act prohibits any affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act) of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits the same persons, acting as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company.
11. The Section 17 Applicants state that shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company and that, the Insurance Companies and their affiliates collectively own substantially all of the shares of EQAT. Accordingly, EQAT and its respective Portfolios are arguably under the control of the Insurance Companies, notwithstanding the fact that the Contract owners may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the Separate Accounts. If EQAT is under the common control of the Insurance Companies, then each Insurance Company is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of EQAT and its respective Portfolios. If EQAT and its respective Portfolios are under the control of the Insurance Companies, then EQAT and its respective affiliates are affiliated persons of the Insurance Companies.
12. The Section 17 Applicants note that, regardless of whether or not the Insurance Companies can be considered to control EQAT and its respective Portfolios, because the Insurance Companies and their affiliates own of record more than 5% of the shares of each of them and are under common control with each Replacement Portfolio's investment adviser, the Insurance Companies are affiliated persons of EQAT and its respective Portfolios. Likewise, EQAT's respective Portfolios are each an affiliated person of the Insurance Companies.
13. In addition to the above, the Insurance Companies, through their respective Separate Accounts, in the aggregate own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of certain of the Removed Portfolios, including the Dreyfus Variable Investment Fund—International Value Portfolio, Lord Abbett Series Fund—Bond-Debenture Portfolio, T. Rowe Price Fixed Income Series, Inc.—Prime Reserve Portfolio, Old Mutual Insurance Series Fund—Mid-Cap Portfolio and PIMCO Variable Insurance Trust—Real Return Portfolio. Therefore, each Insurance Company is an affiliated person of those portfolios.
14. The Section 17 Applicants state that the proposed In-Kind Transactions could be seen as the indirect purchase of shares of certain Replacement Portfolios with portfolio securities of certain Removed Portfolios and the indirect sale of portfolio securities of certain Removed Portfolios for shares of certain Replacement Portfolios. Pursuant to this analysis, the proposed In-Kind Transactions also could be categorized as a purchase of shares of certain Replacement Portfolios by certain Removed Portfolios, acting as principal, and a sale of portfolio securities by certain Removed Portfolios, acting as principal, to certain Replacement Portfolios. In addition, the proposed In-Kind Transactions could be viewed as a purchase of securities from certain Removed Portfolios, and a sale of securities to certain Replacement Portfolios, by MONY or MLOA (or their Separate Accounts), acting as principal. If categorized in this manner, the proposed In-Kind Transactions may be deemed to contravene Section 17(a) due to the affiliated status of these participants.
15. Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act exempts from the prohibitions of Section 17(a), subject to certain enumerated conditions, a purchase or sale transaction between registered investment companies or separate series of registered investment companies, which are affiliated persons, or affiliated persons of affiliated persons, of each other, between separate series of a registered investment company, or between a registered investment company or a separate series of a registered investment company and a person which is an affiliated person of such registered investment company (or affiliated person of such person) solely by reason of having a common investment adviser or investment advisers which are affiliated persons of each other, common directors, and/or common officers.
 16. MONY, MLOA, their Separate Accounts, certain Removed Portfolios, and certain Replacement Portfolios, in connection with their participation in the proposed In-Kind Transactions, must rely on that portion of Rule 17a-7 that requires that they be affiliated persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser or affiliated investment advisers, common directors, and/or common officers. That is not the case as detailed above. Moreover, one of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7 requires that the transaction be a purchase or sale, for no consideration other than cash payment against prompt delivery of a security for which market quotations are readily available. If the proposed In-Kind Transactions are viewed as purchases and sales of securities, the consideration in the proposed redemptions of shares of certain Removed Portfolios and the proposed purchases of shares of certain Replacement Portfolios would not be cash, but would be the portfolio securities received from the Removed Portfolio.
17. Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, issue an order Start Printed Page 61107exempting any proposed transaction from Section 17(a) if: (i) The terms of the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (ii) the proposed transactions are consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned; and (iii) the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
18. The Section 17 Applicants request an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the In-Kind Transactions in connection with the proposed Substitutions.
19. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed In-Kind Transactions, including the consideration to be paid and received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. The Section 17 Applicants also submit that the proposed In-Kind Transactions are consistent with the policies of the relevant Removed Portfolios and the relevant corresponding Replacement Portfolios, as recited in the current registration statement and reports of the relevant investment company filed with the Commission under the federal securities laws. Finally, the Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed In-Kind Transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
20. The Section 17 Applicants state that they will assure themselves that the investment companies will carry out the proposed In-Kind Transactions in conformity with the conditions of Rule 17a-7 (or, as applicable, a Removed Portfolio's and a Replacement Portfolio's normal valuation procedures, as set forth in the relevant investment company's registration statement), except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold will not be cash. The In-Kind Transactions will be effected at the respective net asset values of each Removed Portfolio and the corresponding Replacement Portfolio, as determined in accordance with the procedures disclosed in the Portfolios' registration statements and as required by Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act. The In-Kind Transactions will not change the dollar value of any Contract owner's investment in any of the Separate Accounts, the value of any Contract, the accumulation value or other value credited to any Contract, or the death benefit payable under any Contract. After the proposed In-Kind Transactions, the value of a Separate Account's investment in a Replacement Portfolio will equal the value of its investments in the Removed Portfolio (together with the value of any pre-existing investments in the Replacement Portfolio) before the In-Kind Transactions.
21. When the Commission initially proposed and adopted Rule 17a-7, it noted that the purpose of the rule was to eliminate the filing and processing of applications “in circumstances where there appears to be no likelihood that the statutory finding for a specific exemption under Section 17(b) could not be made” by establishing “conditions as to the availability of the exemption to those situations where the Commission, upon the basis of its experience, considers that there is no likelihood of overreaching of the investment companies participating in the transaction.” When the Commission amended Rule 17a-7 in 1981 to cover transactions involving non-investment company affiliates, it indicated that such transactions could be reasonable and fair and not involve overreaching if appropriate conditions were imposed on the transaction. In this regard, the Section 17 Applicants state they will assure themselves that the In-Kind Transactions will be in substantial compliance with the conditions of Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act. The Section 17 Applicants assert that because the proposed In-Kind Transactions would comply in substance with the principal conditions of Rule 17a-7, the Commission should consider the extent to which the In-Kind Transactions would meet these or other similar conditions and issue an order if such conditions would provide the substance of the protections embodied in Rule 17a-7.
22. The Section 17 Applicants state that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be effected based upon the independent current market price of the portfolio securities as specified in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-7. The proposed In-Kind Transactions will comply with paragraph (d) of Rule 17a-7 because no brokerage commission, fee or other remuneration (except for any customary transfer fees) will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed In-Kind Transactions. Furthermore, a written record of the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be maintained and preserved in accordance with paragraph (g) of Rule 17a-7. With respect to those securities for which market quotations are not readily available, the Substitutions will be effected in accordance with the relevant Removed Portfolios' and the relevant corresponding Replacement Portfolios' normal valuation procedures, as set forth in the registration statement for the relevant investment company.
23. Even though the proposed In-Kind Transactions will not comply with the cash consideration requirement of paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-7, the Section 17 Applicants state that the terms of the proposed In-Kind Transactions will offer to each of the relevant Removed Portfolios and each of the relevant Replacement Portfolios the same degree of protection from overreaching that Rule 17a-7 generally provides in connection with the purchase and sale of securities under that Rule in the ordinary course of business. In particular, the Insurance Companies and their affiliates cannot effect the proposed In-Kind Transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any Replacement Portfolio.
24. The Section 17 Applicants represent that the proposed redemption of shares of each of the relevant Removed Portfolios will be consistent with the investment policies of each Removed Portfolio and the corresponding Replacement Portfolio, as recited in their respective current registration statements, provided that the shares are redeemed at their net asset value in conformity with Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act. Likewise, the proposed sale of shares of each of the relevant Replacement Portfolios for investment securities is consistent with the investment policies of the relevant Replacement Portfolio, as recited in the relevant Trust's registration statement, provided that: (i) The shares are sold at their net asset value; and (ii) the investment securities are of the type and quality that a Replacement Portfolio could have acquired with the proceeds from the sale of its shares had the shares been sold for cash. To assure the second of these conditions is met, the Manager and relevant Adviser will examine the portfolio securities being offered to each Replacement Portfolio and accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such Portfolio in a cash transaction.
25. Applicants also assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act and that the proposed In-Kind Transactions do not present any conditions or abuses that the 1940 Act was designed to prevent. In particular, Sections 1(b)(2) and 1(b)(3) of the 1940 Act state, among other things, that the national public interest and the interest of investors are adversely affected “when investment companies are organized, operated, managed, or their portfolio securities are selected in the Start Printed Page 61108interest of directors, officers, investment advisers, depositors, or other affiliated persons thereof, * * * or in the interest of other investment companies or persons engaged in other lines of business, rather than in the interest of all classes of such companies' security holders; * * * when investment companies issue securities containing inequitable or discriminatory provisions, or fail to protect the preferences and privileges of holders in their outstanding securities.” As explained above, the terms of the proposed In-Kind Transactions are designed to prevent the abuses described in Sections 1(b)(2) and 1(b)(3) of the 1940 Act.
26. The Section 17 Applicants submit that, for all the reasons stated above, the terms of the proposed In-Kind Transactions as set forth in the Application, including the consideration to be paid and received, are reasonable and fair to: (i) Each of the relevant Replacement Portfolios and each of the relevant Removed Portfolios; and (ii) Contract owners. The Section 17 Applicants also assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. Furthermore, the Section 17 Applicants represent that the proposed In-Kind Transactions are, or will be, consistent with all relevant policies of (i) the relevant Replacement Portfolios and the relevant Removed Portfolios as stated in the relevant investment company's registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act, and (ii) the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
Conclusion
For the reasons set forth in the Application, the Section 26 Applicants and the Section 17 Applicants respectively state that the proposed Substitutions and the related In-Kind Transactions meet the standards of Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and of Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act, and request that the Commission issue an order of approval pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and an order of exemption pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act.
