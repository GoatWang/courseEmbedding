Other notes

This mine is written up in the legends of California:
http://thelongestlistofthelongestst…res74.html
However, contrary to what is says, the mine was actually mined all the way to 1983 as described on the website.
We now wish to have a modern looking logo reflecting the current status of gold and the difficult process in the inhospitable Mojave Dessert.
The target audience is investors in gold and gold shares.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Basis of Presentation

Dutch Oven Gold Group Inc. (F/K/A Nexam Acquisition Corp.) (the
"Company") was
incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 11,
2008 and
has been inactive since inception.  The Company intends to
serve as a vehicle
to effect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock
or other
business combination with a domestic or foreign business.

The Company has not earned any revenue from operations. 
Accordingly, the
Company's activities have been accounted for as those of a
"Development Stage
Enterprise" as set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement No.
7 ("SFAS 7").  The Company's financial statements are
identified as those of a
development stage company, and that the statements of operations,
stockholders'
equity and cash flows disclose activity since the date of the
Company's
inception.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Accounting Method

The Company's financial statements are prepared using the accrual
method of
accounting. The Company has elected a fiscal year ending on
December 31.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and  assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of  assets  and 
liabilities, disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial  statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity
of three
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are provided in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting
Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109), Accounting for Income Taxes.  A
deferred tax
asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences
between financial
and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. 
Deferred tax expense
(benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred
tax assets
and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance when,
in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some
portion of
all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.  Deferred tax
assets and
liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and
rates on
the date of enactment. There were no current or deferred income tax
expenses or
benefits due to the Company not having any material operations for
period ended
June 30, 2011.

Earnings per Share

The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per
Share"
("EPS").  SFAS No. 128 provides for the calculation of basic
and diluted
earnings per share.   Basic EPS includes no dilution and
is computed by
dividing income or loss available to common stockholders by the
weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period. 
Diluted EPS
reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in
the earnings
or losses of the entity.  Such amounts include shares
potentially issuable
pursuant to shares to be issued, convertible debentures and
outstanding options
and warrants.

Impact of New Accounting Standards

The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued
accounting
pronouncements to have a material impact on the Company's results
of
operations, financial position, or cash flow.

NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN

The Company's financial statements are prepared using the accrual
method of
accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the
United States of America ("GAAP"), and have been prepared on a
going concern
basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
settlement of
liabilities in the normal course of business.  The Company
currently has no
source of revenue to cover its costs.  The Company will limit
all operational
activities to searching and consummating a business
combination.  The Company
will offer non-cash consideration and seek equity lines as the sole
method of
financing for the near term.  If the Company is unable to
secure financing
until a business combination is consummated, it may substantially
limit or
terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities
through strategic
alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute the
interests of
existing stockholders.

NOTE 4 - SHAREHOLDER'S EQUITY

The Company's board of directors has the authority to establish and
fix the
designation, powers, or preferences of preferred shares without
further vote by
the shareholders.

The Company has the following classes of capital stock as of June
30,
2011:

* Common stock - 250,000,000 shares authorized; $0.0001 par value;
111,840,000
shares issued and outstanding.

* Preferred stock - 20,000,000 shares authorized; $0.0001 par
value; no shares
issued and outstanding.







Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Conditions and
        Results of
Operations
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction
with our
financial statements and notes to the financial statements included
elsewhere
in this report as well as the Form 10-12G registration statement.
This report
contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section
27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and
Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange
Act.  We
intend that the forward-looking statements be subject to the safe
harbors
created by those sections.

PLAN OF OPERATION; GOING CONCERN

BACKGROUND OF THE COMPANY

Dutch Oven Gold Group Inc. (F/K/A Nexam Acquisition Corp.) (the
"Company") was
organized on January 11, 2008, as a blank check or shell company
under the Laws
of the State of Delaware. The Company does not currently engage in
any business
activities that provide cash flow. From inception, the primary
activity of the
Company has been directed towards organizational efforts,
compliance matters
and locating potential merger or acquisition candidates. The
Company's primary
purpose is to engage in a merger with or acquisition of one or more
private
domestic or foreign companies.

The Company is continuing its efforts to locate a merger candidate
for the
purpose of a merger. It is possible that the Company will be
successful in
locating such a merger candidate and closing such merger. However,
if the
Company cannot effect a non-cash acquisition, the Company may have
to raise
funds from a private offering of its securities under Rule 506 of
Regulation D.
There is no assurance the Company would obtain any such equity
funding.

The Company is still a "blank check" or "shell" company. At
present, the
Company has no business opportunities under contemplation for
acquisition or
merger.

GENERAL OVERVIEW

The Company's activities since inception have been limited to
organizational
matters, compliance efforts and locating potential merger
candidates, and the
Company has not engaged in any operating activity since its
inception.

The Company has registered its Common Stock on a Form 10-SB
registration
statement filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the Exchange
Act) and Rule 12(g) thereof. The Company files with the U.S.
Securities and
Exchange Commission periodic reports under Rule 13(a) of the
Exchange Act,
including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form
10-K.

The Company was formed to engage in a merger with or acquisition of
an
unidentified domestic or foreign company which desires to become a
U.S.
reporting (public) company whose securities are qualified for
trading in the
United States secondary market. The Company meets the definition of
a blank
check company contained in Section 7(b)(3) of the Securities Act of
1933, as
amended.

The Company believes that there are perceived benefits to being a
reporting
company with a class of publicly-traded securities which may be
attractive to
foreign and domestic private companies.

These benefits are commonly thought to include:

  (1) the ability to use registered shares to make acquisition
of assets or
      businesses;

  (2) increased visibility in the financial community;

  (3) the facilitation of borrowing from financial
institutions;

  (4) improved trading efficiency;

  (5) shareholder liquidity;

  (6) greater ease in subsequently raising capital;

  (7) compensation of key employees through options for stock
for which there
      is a public market;

  (8) enhanced corporate image; and,

  (9) a presence in the United States capital market.

A private company which may be interested in a business combination
with the
Company may include the following:

  (1) a Company for which a primary purpose of becoming public
is the use of
      its securities for the acquisition
of assets or businesses;

  (2) a company which is unable to find an underwriter of its
securities or
      is unable to find an underwriter of
securities on terms acceptable to it;

  (3) a company which wishes to become public with less
dilution of its Common
