Disruptive Capital For a Disruptiv...














Disruptive Capital For a Disruptive Industry
Craft is disrupting the food and drink industry. Artisan makers are disrupting the food and drink market by focusing on variety and smaller batches.  Specialty foods seized over $85B in sales in 2012.  Craft beer continues double digit growth as the overall beer market contracts.
Equity crowdfunding will disrupt financing.  State and federal regulations are changing such that small businesses will soon have access to a much greater pool of capital through the sale of equity online. The potential to sell equity to customers will disrupt and democratize the traditional finance model.
The perfect pairing.  As an alternative source of capital, equity crowdfunding will help craft food and drink makers gain more market share.  Additionally, equity crowdfunding is a grassroots source of capital that is more consistent with these craft brands.

Investment VS. Rewards Crowdfunding














Investment VS. Rewards Crowdfunding
Rewards crowdfunding.  The rewards crowdfunding model popularized by sites such as kickstarter is the process of sourcing capital online from a larger group of individual contributors.  The contributions are best understood as donations. In exchange for a donation, individuals receive “rewards” such as a sample product or gear.
Equity crowdfunding. Equity crowdfunding is the process of sourcing capital by selling equity online to a larger group of investors.  Previously, companies were only permitted to sell shares to the very wealthy.  Because of recent regulatory changes, small businesses will be able for the first time to sell shares directly to the general public.  Therefore, an investor receives a stake in the company as opposed to a t-shirt.
Turning customers and local residents into owners and advocates. We believe investment crowdfunding is the future for food, drink and place makers. Startups will have access to more seed capital.  Existing companies will have an opportunity to grow in a more grassroots manner by turning customers and local community into owners and advocates.

A Disruption Based Out Of The "Brew City"
Join Our Disruptive Mission >







CraftFund Story
The CraftFund story is firmly rooted in the "Brew City"--Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The story began with two good friends sharing a beer and discussing our passion for craft beer and the city of Milwaukee. We discussed our love for how craft beer disrupts the status quo as well as our passion for seeing our local place thrive. We also discussed visiting new places, discovering local makers, and experiencing others' passion for where they live. It became clear that what we wanted was the ability to take ownership of our local places.
Around the same time we were having these conversations, a grassroots campaign to purchase one of Milwaukee's storied breweries--Pabst Brewing Co.--was underway. The attempt was wildly successful, receiving over $200 million in pledges from over 5 million potential investors. Unfortunately, the campaign technically violated securities laws and was shut down by the SEC.
We then realized we were part of a broader consumer demand for ownership experiences in craft makers. This demand went unmet due to decades old laws that precluded general public from investing in local companies. So we set out to create a solution.
Using his legal and regulatory background, David Dupee worked with the Wisconsin legislature to adopt one of the first state equity crowdfunding laws and the first to be passed through the legislative process.  Wisconsin is now at the forefront of a growing movement to democratize capital by allowing residents to invest in small businesses online. As a result, consumer demand for ownership experiences will finally be met.  In addition, local food and place makers have access to a new source of capital that is more consistent with their brand and projects.
CraftFund is therefore the next chapter in a beautiful story about customers and community members turned owners and advocates. Our mission is to provide local residents with a platform to craft better communities through investments in food, drink and place makers. Join the movement to democratize capital. Own Craft. Own your Place.

Intrastate Crowdfunding













Advancing Industry Growth By Turning Local Customers Into Owners
Join our growing community >







Intrastate Crowdfunding
How We Got Here
Raising capital is a highly regulated exercise.  The general rule is that to raise capital by selling equity a company must first register the offering with federal and state governments unless it is able to meet a federal exemption. Traditionally and generally speaking, the exemptions have only applied when selling to high net worth individuals called “accredited investors.” This appeared set to change when Congress passed the JOBS Act in 2012, which created an exemption to allow companies to sell smaller amounts of equity online to the general public nationwide so long as certain conditions. However, the JOBS Act has still not gone into effect due to prolonged rulemaking. 
What It Is
Frustrated with pace of JOBS Act implementation, states have begun to proactively create their own solutions.  Pursuant to the federal intrastate exemption, several states have passed or are considering state investment crowdfunding laws to make it easier for state business to sell equity to state residents.
Wisconsin Example
Wisconsin was the third state to create an intrastate crowdfunding law and first to do so through the legislative process.  CraftFund was very involved in getting the law passed, which will go into effect June 1, 2014.  Below is a high level overview of  Wisconsin Assembly Bill 350:

Wisconsin companies that generate at least 80% of their business from operations in Wisconsin can raise up to $1M (no audit) or $2M (audit) from Wisconsin residents every 12 months;
Every Wisconsin resident may invest up to $10,000 in a Wisconsin company; Wisconsin residents making at least $100,000 per year may invest an unlimited amount;
Wisconsin companies must limit the offer and sale of equity to Wisconsin residents;
Companies wishing to advertise the offering must conduct the raise through an internet portal registered with the Department of Financial Institutions;
Companies must provide Department of Financial Institution and investors with a required disclosure document;
Funds held in escrow with Wisconsin bank until target amount is hit or exceeded;
Companies with successful raises required to deliver quarterly reports to shareholders.

Wisconsin Offers Preview of Equity Crowdfunding Under JOBS Act
CraftFund was formed to help food and beverage companies raise capital from passionate customers and local residents.  It’s based on the deep-seated conviction that the opportunity to invest should depend on how much one knows about the company, not how much money one makes. From the outset this has required changes in securities laws to allow for democratization of investing.
Therefore, we are excited that the SEC is poised on Friday to release final rules that will...

TWEETS















F.A.Q.

What is CraftFund?


CraftFund is an online platform that allows local residents to craft the future of their communities through investments in food, drink and place makers.


What types of companies can use CraftFund?


CraftFund is a platform for place makers. Just as we enjoy exploring new places and local products, so too would we like to see an online market for place-based investments. A platform where you can go to learn more about products/projects in your area as well as invest in companies that might need funding. We believe this new funding model will work best with products and businesses that people are familiar with and are passionate about. 

Right now we are only open to food/beverage companies and real estate developers. 


How does it work? 


Food and beverage companies can create a profile to advertise local products.  Real estate developers can create a profile to highlight certain projects. Companies in need of capital can seek investments from local customers (only in WI right now). Customers can browse company profiles to learn more about local food products and real estate projects.  Customers can do due diligence on and invest in these companies raising capital on the site (only WI residents right now).


How is CraftFund different from Kickstarter?


CraftFund is an equity platform.  This means that instead of donating to companies, investors on this site purchase shares or investment interests in the companies.  In short, every deal on this site turns customers into actual owners of the companies they are passionate about.



What types of securities can companies offer on CraftFund?


Food and beverage companies will offer equity (a percentage of the company) to investors.  Real estate developers will have the option to offer equity or debt.



What is the difference between equity and debt?


Simply put, an investor in an equity deal becomes a part owner of the company.  The actual percent ownership is determined by dividing the investment amount by the company's valuation (what the company determines it is worth).  In a debt deal, the investor does not become an owner in the company. Instead, the investment functions as a loan that the company agrees to pay back in addition to interest accrued.  


Why are offerings only allowed in Wisconsin?


The offerings presented on CraftFund are possible under the intrastate exemption to federal securities laws.  WI is one the first states to create a state crowdfunding law under this intrastate exemption.  We will explore additional markets as laws change.



How are investor funds held?


CraftFund does not hold investor funds.  Instead, state law requires that companies enter into an escrow agreement with a bank located chartered under Wisconsin law. All investments are in the form of a check that gets deposited into an escrow account with a Wisconsin bank serving as escrow agent.  Investors mail a check directly to the Wisconsin bank.


What happens if the company does not hit its target?


Investors have the right to cancel a commitment to invest and have funds returned by escrow agent if the company does not reach its minimum target. However, the investor can also choose to proceed with the investment. CraftFund will follow up with each investor to determine how they wish to proceed.


What about the JOBS Act?


The President signed the federal JOBS Act in April of 2012.  Once implemented by the SEC, the JOBS Act will allow companies to sell equity online to the general public nationwide through funding portals and/or broker dealers.  There are concerns over whether the JOBS Act will be cost prohibitive for small companies. Regardless, we are closely monitoring regulatory developments.



How much can I invest in a company?


Any WI resident can invest up to $10,000 in a Wisconsin company. WI residents with at least $100,000 income or $750,000 net worth can invest an unlimited amount.



Who can invest in companies on CraftFund?


Only residents of the state where the offering company is located may invest in deals.  Right now the platform is limited to WI companies.  Therefore, only WI residents may invest in WI companies.





 


Are these investments risky?


Yes. Investing in private/and or early stage companies is always risky.  You could lose all of your money.  Read our Investor 101 for more details.



Who is responsible for conducting due diligence?


Investors.  CraftFund’s initial due diligence is limited to checking for any bad actors associated with the company.  The fact a company is listed on our site simply means that our reasonable investigation has not turned up any such bad actors.  It should not be taken as a recommendation or endorsement. Instead, our investor community is responsible for performing its own due diligence on attractiveness of each deal.  We believe members of local community are in best position to evaluate these companies.



What will I get in return for my investment?


This will depend on the terms of each investment.  Ownership interests in private companies can entitle investors to dividends.  Also, companies may choose to provide discounts or other shareholder perks.  Ultimately, every investment allows an investor to become an actual stake holder in local companies they are passionate about.



Can I sell shares purchased on CraftFund?


Shares purchased on this site cannot be resold for a certain period of time (often 9-12 months) except under very limited circumstances.  Regardless, investments in private companies are often illiquid, meaning investors should be prepared to hold the investment indefinitely.



How do I know if my company is a WI company?


Your company must be organized and do substantial business in the state that you seek to seek capital from.  The general rule of thumb for proving substantial business in a state is that a company derives at least 80% of its business from the state.



How much does it cost to raise funds on CraftFund?


It is free to sign up and invest in companies. It is also free to create a company profile.  Wisconsin companies raising funds will be charged a due diligence and listing fee.  We do not take a backend success fee.



My company is not in WI. Can I raise funds on the site?


Right now only WI companies may raise funds on the site.  However, we expect expand as more states adopt crowdfunding laws and/or federal JOBS Act develops.



My company is not in WI. Can we create a product profile?


Yes, any U.S. food and drink company can create a free basic profile.  Basic profiles are limited to general brand and product description and cannot include any solicitation or offers.  CraftFund reserves the right to remove any content that goes beyond brand and product description.


What are the benefits of equity crowdfunding?


Equity crowdfunding is a desperately needed new source of capital for small businesses.  Additionally, equity crowdfunding is an innovative way for companies to connect with and engage customers.




Can my company offer shareholder perks?


Yes.  Companies are encouraged to create ownership experiences for investors.



Are there any reporting requirements?


Yes. State laws require companies to provide a quarterly report to investors.



Do you help with shareholder relations post investment?


Yes. Our shareholder portal is a mechanism for companies to deliver required reports and engage/communicate investors.












The Numbers
Craft beer and crowdfunding are two nascent and trending industries. For the past several years, the craft beer market has grown double digits, including 17% growth in 2012. Today there are over 2400 breweries in the U.S., the most since the 1880's. Despite this growth, craft beer still only claims 6% of the total beer volume and 10% of total beer dollars. The craft category is expected to continue its steady growth and become a $17 billion industry by 2017. Crowdfunding is also in its early stages, having raised around $2 billion in 2012. However, new laws will open investment crowdfunding to average investors, which could dramantically expand the market. For example, the crowdfunding market would stand at $300 billion if the average investor invests just 1% of assets in crowdfunded projects.

$5 Million Awarded to Three Firms to Spur High-Growth Technology Commercialization 







WYSIWYGGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced $5 million has been awarded to three Upstate investment firms to spur new business and create jobs in communities across Upstate New York. The funding, part of the Governor's $50 million Innovation Venture Capital Fund program, will be matched by at least $5 million in private sector investment capital to enable new businesses to work with colleges and universities to accelerate the research and development and marketing of their technologies. Investment firms in Rochester, Buffalo and Syracuse will strategically invest the funds.  "By giving entrepreneurs the tools and resources that they need to succeed, we can turn ideas into real, marketable solutions," Governor Cuomo said. "The Innovation Venture Capital Fund does just that – it empowers creators to realize their potential, competitively attracting business and creating jobs in communities all across New York."   The three Upstate firms that will invest the funds are Excell Partners, LLC in Rochester, SCP Buffalo Incubator/Z80 Labs LLC in Buffalo, and CenterState CEO's Grants for Growth in Syracuse. Investment of funds by each firm will be leveraged with matching private sector investment capital at a ratio of at least 1:1. Recipients of the venture funding will receive pre-seed stage investments of up to $100,000.  The $50 million New York State Innovation Venture Capital Fund program supports the transition from ideas and research to marketable products or services, accelerates seed and early-stage business formation and provides investment funding to support, and attracts high growth, technology based companies to New York State. The fund is expected to leverage at least $100 million in private capital to support high growth areas including advanced materials, clean technology, life sciences/biotechnology and information technology.  Empire State Development President, CEO & Commissioner Kenneth Adams said, "The three firms approved for funding were selected based on their qualifications, track record and proposed investment strategy. Their equity investments into pre-seed companies will help ensure our State's innovative technologies have the support necessary to move from the lab to marketplace."  Excell Partners, a for-profit affiliate of the University of Rochester, was approved for $2 million in NYS Innovation Venture Capital funds to invest in pre-seed stage businesses, including those focused on life sciences, energy, software and consumer products located in the Southern Tier, Western New York, Finger Lakes, Capital, and Central New York regions. Excell has successfully invested in more than 41 seed stage companies since its launch in 2005. Excell was also selected as a participant in ESD's Innovate NY Fund investment program.  Excell Partners, Inc. CEO Theresa Mazzullo said, "We thank ESD for their ongoing confidence in Excell. This award is particularly important for upstate because its focus is on the pre-seed stage in life science, energy and advanced materials, three areas that are seriously challenged for capital. Excell is proud of its track record for investing in these industry segments. This award will allow Excell to continue to identify, invest and support high potential, high tech startups in New York."   SCP Buffalo Incubator/Z80 Labs LLC was approved for $1.5 million in NYS Innovation Venture Capital funds to invest in pre-seed stage companies in Western New York – a region that has strong growth potential in the internet broadband and life sciences spaces. The business and its managing partners will operate under the umbrella of Seed Capital Partners, a successful northeast early stage technology focused venture capital firm. SCP Buffalo Incubator/Z80 Labs was also selected as a participant in the Innovate NY Fund investment program.  "We are excited to receive this additional award that will allow us to continue the extraordinary momentum the Governor's Buffalo Billion initiative has generated including the 43North Buffalo Business Plan Competition, our Accellerator Z80 Labs and the addition of dozens of new start-ups that have begun to generate job, excitement and opportunity here in Buffalo," said Jordan Levy, General Partner Softbank Capital. "With the support of ESD to date, we have funded a dozen start-ups that are now employing almost forty people, now, with this new grant, we will be able to help a few dozen additional entrepreneurs get their business ideas off the ground and follow their dreams and at the same time build a new economy culture in our New York State."   Grants for Growth, managed by CenterState CEO, was approved for $1.5 million in NYS Innovation Venture Capital funding to manage the technology commercialization and pre-seed stage company investment by leveraging the support, mentoring and commitment of the state-funded Innovation Hot Spots in Central New York, the North Country and Southern Tier regions. By joining forces, the fund will extend its reach to cover 22 counties of Upstate New York, including leading regional sources of innovation, incubation and commercialization, plus research and technology transfer at institutions like Clarkson University, Cornell University, Syracuse University and upstate SUNY campuses.  "This fund builds on Grants for Growth's eight-year track record of supporting commercialization by uniquely aligning three of New York's Innovation Hot Spots," said Seth Mulligan, VP of Innovation Services at CenterState CEO. "The evolution and scale-up of this program would not be possible if not for the vision and commitment of New York State Senator John DeFrancisco, who has supported Grants for Growth since its inception. Now, with an even more robust network of academic partners, mentors and innovation resources, we are positioned to leverage the state's investment to successfully launch even more new startups and create new, high-quality jobs across these regions."  The three Upstate firms were chosen through a competitive process. Additional investments to spur business development and jobs through firms in the New York City, Long Island and Mid-Hudson regions will be announced soon.  About the NYS Innovation Venture Capital Fund  The NYS Innovation Venture Capital Fund is part of Governor Cuomo's broader commercialization agenda in order to encourage innovation and drive economic growth in communities across the State. It is being coordinated with the State's existing business resources and innovation investments, including the Governor's START-UP NY program, Innovation Hot Spots, the Regional Economic Development Councils, the Centers of Advanced Technology and Centers of Excellence networks and the SUNY 2020 Initiative.  As part of his Opportunity Agenda, the Governor has proposed expanding the program and doubling the fund to $100 million in the 2015-16 Executive Budget.
