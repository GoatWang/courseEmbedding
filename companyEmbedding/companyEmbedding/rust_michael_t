Keynote Speaker Michael T. Rust


Michael T. Rust was named President and Chief Executive Officer of the Kentucky Hospital Association (KHA) on January 1, 1996, becoming the third leader of the organization in their eighty-four year history. The organization is made up of 131 hospitals and health systems across the state of Kentucky. Additionally, Mike serves as President and CEO of the organization’s four subsidiary corporations. Before assuming the role of President for the KHA, he worked in hospital leadership positions in Florida and West Virginia.

Today, Mr. Rust continues to divide a portion of his personal time to several boards including the University of Louisville Board of Overseers, Frontier Nursing University, and St. Catharine College. During Rust’s tenure as Chairman of the Board at St. Catharine College, he and his wife Nancy oversaw the establishment of the Nancy Lemon Rust Surgical Laboratory and Research Center and, just recently, the dedication of the Rust Auditorium at Saint Catharine College.

The Rust family has been involved in several philanthropic charitable causes in the Louisville area and throughout the state of Kentucky. They have also been significant contributors to Glenville State College’s mission of educating students that may not have a chance to attend college if it were not for GSC. As such, Mike and Nancy have funded a $100,000 scholarship for nursing students.

Mr. Rust currently sits on the Board of Directors and serves on the Executive Committee of Republic Bank and Trust Company. The bank is one of the largest community banks in Kentucky and has recently diversified by acquiring banks in Ohio, Florida, Indiana, and Minnesota.

Working with his son Joshua, Mr. Rust has also developed a passion for thoroughbred horse racing. The Rust stable currently has twenty-six thoroughbreds racing throughout the country.

Rust received a bachelor’s degree from Glenville State College in business administration in 1973 and a master’s degree in health care administration from the University of Tennessee. He has been recognized by the University of Kentucky receiving the Distinguished Service Award in 2004 and was named a University of Kentucky Fellow the same year. In 2010, he was recognized as an Adopted Alumni of the University of Louisville. He was then honored as Alumnus of the Year by the Glenville State College Alumni Association in 2013.

Mike is married to the former Nancy Lemon. They have two children (Kelli and Joshua) whose families live nearby in Louisville, Kentucky, along with their three grandchildren Tysen, Cora, and Jude.

Free All® Deep Penetrating Oil Versus The Other Guys
An independent testing lab found that Free All has more rust breaking strength than other leading brands.
Unlike the other guys, Free All is MORE than a lubricant because it has special ingredients that actually eat rust.









The diagram above illustrates how little effort is required to use Free All compared with other competing brands.











The Secret’s Out:
Free All® Does All the Work
Industrial strength Free All spreads deep into rusted or frozen parts, freeing them in seconds with ease!
It’s been the secret weapon in the toolboxes of mechanics, and other professionals for years.











Here are some of Free All Deep Penetrating Oil’s most popular uses:






 Rusty exhaust clamps and brackets
 Fuel tank removal
 Seized engines
 Stuck ball joints
 Exhaust manifold removal
 Frozen emergency brake cables







 Brake caliper removal
 Axle nut removal
 Rusty pliers and other tools
 Corroded u-bolts
 Rusty chains and gears

 Testimonials








Free All is the best penetrating oil ever made! I use this product daily during alignments on rusty bolts and Free All will set them free! 
Joshua O’Connor, Silver Creek, New York







I started using Free All when I was working on my dock on the intracoastal waterway. After a hurricane, I used Free All on my boat lifts and it neutralized the salt and rust like magic! Another time I used Free All on a thumb screw that was buried in my yard for over 5 years. I sprayed Free All on it overnight and the next morning the screw let go without breaking. Thanks for making a product that makes my life easier!
Edward Moss, Apex, North Carolina







A friend swears by Free All Deep Penetrating Oil for all of his farming equipment, so I decided to use it on a truck tailgate that I was repainting. I sprayed it on the rusty edges, let it sit and came back later to wipe away the rust with a rag. It just ate the rust right off. My toolbox will always have Free All in it!
Alex Bartsoff







I appreciate having high quality tools and products. Free All Deep Penetrating Oil stands shoulder to shoulder with the rest of my tools.
John H. Simmons, Boonville, Indiana







It just plain works! Rust? Over-torqued? No problem. I used it to prevent galling on stainless to stainless fasteners and it worked great! And you can use it on the interior parts of your car without stinking the place up.
Jay Shilcutt, Wichita, Kansas







I had some brake caliper bolts that were hard to break. I sprayed on Free All, waited a couple of minutes, and they broke free. Good stuff! I have used lots of penetrating oils – and this one is great!
Mike Corcoran, Cincinnati, Ohio







This product works better than any penetrating oil I have ever used. I used it for an old exhaust and literally watched the rust melt away.
Michael Russell, South Bend, Indiana







I am recommending this product to everyone I know. WD-40 is obsolete now – thanks to Free All Deep Penetrating Oil!
Michael Winters, Dixon, Illinois







That stuff is awesome, it really works!
Monroe Muffler Shop, Fairport, New York
