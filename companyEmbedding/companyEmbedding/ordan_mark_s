Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Mark Ordan Named CEO Of Washington Prime Group, Inc.

Feb 25, 2014, 13:48 ET
		  		  							
						 from   Simon Property Group, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 25, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:  SPG), a global leader in retail real estate, announced today the appointment of Mark Ordan as Chief Executive Officer of Washington Prime Group, Inc. which will be an independent, publicly traded REIT, comprised initially of SPG's strip center business and its smaller enclosed malls. Washington Prime Group's mission is to own stable, quality retail properties that effectively serve the communities in which they are located. Washington Prime Group is expected to initially own or have an interest in 98 diversified retail real estate assets. 
Ordan brings to the new enterprise a progressive and successful career leading public companies at the nexus of real estate and consumer demand in retailing, retail real estate and healthcare. Most recently, Ordan was CEO of Sunrise Senior Living, having led its successful turnaround and eventual sale to Health Care REIT and KKR. Prior to Sunrise, Ordan guided the turnaround of The Mills Corporation as its CEO, and then led its sale to Simon Property Group and Farallon Capital Management.
Ordan was founder and CEO of Fresh Fields which he sold to Whole Foods Market. He served on the board of Federal Realty Investment Trust for 10 years and was non-executive Chairman from 2001 through 2006 when he led the Board of Director's restructuring of the senior management team.
David Simon, Chairman and CEO of Simon Property Group said, "We worked closely with Mark during the Mills transaction and found him to be a top-rate executive with particular expertise in creating value for an organization. I am very confident Mark has the retail real estate operating experience to lead this exciting new company."
"We are pleased to have a Chief Executive Officer of Mark's background which combines success leading public companies as both a CEO and Board Chair with prominent positions in retail and retail real estate," said Richard S. Sokolov, SPG's President and COO. "He is perfectly suited for this position."
Ordan received his BA from Vassar College and has served on its Board of Trustees for 15 years. He received his MBA from Harvard Business School. He lives outside Washington, DC with his wife and family.

Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:  SPG) is an S&P 100 company and a global leader in the retail real estate industry.  The Company currently owns or has an interest in more than 325 retail real estate properties in North America, Asia and Europe comprising approximately 243 million square feet.

PHOENIX, June 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- American Realty Capital Properties, Inc. (NASDAQ:    ARCP) ("ARCP" or the "Company") announced the appointment of Mark S. Ordan as an Independent Director and a member of the Audit Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") effective today.













                American Reality Capital Properties ("ARCP") is a leading, self-managed commercial real estate investment trust focused on acquiring and owning single tenant freestanding commercial properties subject to net leases with high credit quality tenants.
              

 
 



"I am very pleased to have Mark join the Board of Directors, establishing a diverse and experienced reconstituted Board," said Glenn J. Rufrano, Chief Executive Officer of ARCP. "His knowledge of the real estate and retail industries, coupled with his impressive track record of leading and managing highly complex workouts and restructurings of public companies, will be a tremendous asset to our Board. This appointment demonstrates the success of our efforts in building credibility through proper corporate governance by adding strong board members with appropriate backgrounds and core competencies."
Mr. Ordan currently serves as Executive Chairman of WP Glimcher, the surviving entity following the closing of Washington Prime Group's acquisition of Glimcher, and will transition to Non-Executive Chairman effective January 1, 2016. WP Glimcher is a retail real estate investment trust ("REIT") and a recognized leader in the ownership, management, acquisition and development of mixed use, open-air and enclosed regional malls as well as community centers. Additionally, Mr. Ordan has been CEO and held various senior-level positions during his 30-year career including leadership positions at Sunrise Senior Living, The Mills Corporation, Balducci's gourmet food store chain and Fresh Fields Markets. Mr. Ordan currently serves on the boards of the following nonprofit organizations: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; the National Endowment for Democracy; the Seed School Foundation; and the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. He received his undergraduate degree from Vassar College and his MBA from Harvard University. 
Korn Ferry assisted with the search and placement for Mr. Ordan's position on the Board.

Generally, the words "expects," "anticipates," "targets," "goals," "projects," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," variations of such words and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, and any statements regarding ARCP's future financial condition, results of operations and business are also forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond ARCP's control. 

The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in forward-looking statements: ARCP's ability to realize success from the reconstitution of the Board; and the developments disclosed herein. Additional factors that may affect future results are contained in ARCP's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), which are available at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. 
The forward-looking statements contained herein reflect ARCP's beliefs, assumptions and expectations regarding ARCP's future performance, taking into account all information currently available to it. These beliefs, assumptions and expectations are subject to risks and uncertainties and can change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to ARCP. If a change occurs, ARCP's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may vary materially from those expressed in its forward-looking statements. ARCP disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events or other changes, except as required by law.
