What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

Teekay Corporation, Teekay Offshore Partners L.P. Stocks Sink 10%: Here's What's Happening
The sky is falling. Two-thirds of the earth is water. Therefore shipping stocks are getting hit the hardest? It's all I got, Fools. 











                Jason Hall
            

                (TMFVelvetHammer)



            
            Jan 7, 2016 at 5:50PM
            
            






What: Shares of offshore energy shipping giant Teekay Corporation (NYSE:TK) and its MLP Teekay Offshore Partners L.P. (NYSE:TOO) are both down more than 10% on January 7, while shares of Teekay Tankers Ltd. (NYSE:TNK) and Teekay LNG Partners L.P. (NYSE:TGP) are down about 6%. 
Since the beginning of December, that puts shares of the Teekay empire companies down a lot:

TK data by YCharts
So what: Today, the market is terribly afraid, and that fear started while most Americans slept. China's stock market opened for trading early this morning, and promptly lost 7% of its value before trading was halted and the market was closed... 29 minutes into the session. 
Needless to say, every other major global stock market that opened after this fell sharply, and the U.S. exchanges have been no exception. All the major U.S. indices finished trading down more than 2%. 





What does this have to do with Teekay Tankers, Teekay LNG Partners, Teekay Corporation, and Teekay Offshore Partners? Today's stock market sell-off doesn't really have anything directly to do with them, but what's happening on the global stage is quite relevant, at least in the long-term. 
The Chinese stock market is falling because of greater fears about China's economy. Economic growth has slowed sharply over the past half-decade, and many are concerned that growth will slow even more in 2016. 
Now what: Tying it all back to the Teekay companies is this: China (and much of Asia) is a massive market for energy, and the oil, natural gas, and the products made from these commodities that Teekay ships, must have end-market demand. If consumption of these products falls, that's bad for Teekay, and that seems to be the driving fear right now. In explanation, Chinese demand for energy is set to weaken, and companies like Teekay that help transport it will suffer. 
But these companies aren't standing still, just waiting for the inevitable. Three weeks ago, it was announced that Teekay, Teekay LNG Partners, and Teekay Offshore Partners would all cut their dividends going forward, and the benefit of this retained cash flow would help support growth initiatives under way at Teekay LNG and Teekay Offshore.





Management has been adamant that all of the Teekay entities are in better shape than the market seems to think, and that the cash flows produced by operations at them will be more than sufficient to support operations and capital plans for the foreseeable future. 
I think that's probably the case, and the worst has probably already happened for Teekay and its partnerships, but there still remains a measure of uncertainty. Now could be a great time to invest, but there's a solid chance these stocks don't really go anywhere over the next year or so. If you're willing to ride out that uncertainty, the long-term looks fine for Teekay, and is probably less at-risk than the market seems to think.

PETROJARL KNARR


Biggest project to date









With a production capacity of 63,000 barrels of oil per day, FPSO Petrojarl Knarr is Teekay’s largest FPSO project to date. Its internal turret allows the vessel to freely rotate 360 degrees and ensures it’s always facing the rough weather present in the North Sea. Watch this video to learn more about the vessel technology and how its smart engineering makes the Petrojarl Knarr suitable for harsh weather environments.

THE GINA KROG FSO


A new life for an aging shuttle tanker









The shuttle tanker “Randgrid” is currently being converted to a harsh weather FSO for Statoil to service the Gina Krog oil and gas field in the Southern part of the North Sea. Teekay will provide, install, operate and decommission the vessel as well as the Turret, Mooring and Riser system. Start of production is scheduled for the first quarter of 2017.

Built on Sevan Marine’s unique cylindrical hull design, Arendal Spirit is Teekay’s first of three UMS. This advanced piece of engineering ensures a sable platform with high uptime and a large storage capacity. The vessel has already secured a three year charter contract for Petrobras in Brazil.

About KNOP


 KNOT Offshore Partners LP  We are a limited partnership formed in February 2013, to operate and acquire shuttle tankers under long-term charters, which we define as charters of five years or more. Our sponsor, Knutsen NYK Offshore Tankers AS (Knutsen NYK), a market leading independent owner and operator of shuttle tankers, which is jointly owned by TS Shipping Invest AS (TSSI), and Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK). TSSI controlled by our Chairman, is a private Norwegian company with ownership interests in shuttle tankers, liquefied natural gas (LNG), tankers and product/chemical tankers. NYK is a Japanese public company with a fleet of approximately 800 vessels, including bulk carriers, containerships, tankers and specialized vessels. As of March 17, 2017, Knutsen NYK owns a 28.9% limited partner interest in us and owned and controlled our general partner, which owns a 1.85% general partner interest in us and a 0.3% limited partner in us.  We currently own and operate a modern fleet of thirteen state of the art shuttle tankers, each equipped with the latest advanced technology, including dynamic positioning and offshore systems, ensuring safe and efficient offloading from offshore installations, in the most challenging of locations and weather conditions. All our vessels operate under long term charters with major oil and gas companies engaged in offshore productions, such as Shell, ExxonMobil, Statoil, Transpetro and ENI. It is our strategy to operate our vessels under long-term charters with stable cash flows and to grow our position in the shuttle tanker market through acquisitions from Knutsen NYK and third parties.
