Our approach
TowerBrook’s proven value creation strategy aims to transform the capabilities and the prospects of the businesses in which we invest.
We invest both through our Private Equity Funds and our Structured Opportunities Fund, allowing us to access a range of opportunities throughout the cycle. Our overall objective is to deliver superior, risk-adjusted returns to investors on a consistent and responsible basis. This requires a commitment to fundamental value and a highly disciplined approach to the assessment and management of our investments.
We work as a single, integrated team that has grown in parallel in Europe and the USA since the inception of TowerBrook. Our entrepreneurial, multinational and cross-cultural approach allows us to act with speed and certainty in multiple jurisdictions.
Read more about TowerBrook’s mission here and about our team members here.


Private Equity strategy
TowerBrook’s Private Equity strategy is to pursue control-oriented investments in large and mid-market companies, principally on a proprietary basis and often in situations characterised by complexity. These may include management/shareholder dislocation, a distressed parent company or an out-of-favour industry where we nonetheless identify attractive potential for significant growth.
The success of our strategy depends on our ability to choose well, to buy well, to structure our investments appropriately and to harness the right expertise to unlock growth. Our team of seasoned investment professionals is complemented by a network of experienced advisers. We work in close partnership with them and with highly talented senior managers to optimise the performance of our portfolio companies.


How we work










Paul Pindar, former Chief Executive of Capita plc, Chair of ICS and a member of our Senior Advisory Board, talks about partnering with TowerBrook.












Christophe Czajka, Executive Chair of Infopro Digital, talks about TowerBrook's support of the company's ambitious expansion plans.












Cathy Stauffer, Chair of Wilton, Chair of BevMo! and a member of our Senior Advisory Board, talks about how TowerBrook and management teams work together to build better businesses.




Structured Opportunities strategy
TowerBrook’s Structured Opportunities strategy leverages our experience and expertise to allow us to invest in opportunities that fall outside the investment parameters of our Private Equity strategy. We define structured opportunities as complex transactions incorporating contractual downside protection that take advantage of changing market conditions, or situation-specific events where traditional control-oriented Private Equity attributes may not apply.
Our Structured Opportunities investment universe includes multiple asset classes, from stressed and distressed debt instruments in both primary and secondary markets to structured equity and structured assets.


A responsible owner
We encourage our partners and portfolio companies to share our commitment to the principles of responsible ownership. Together, we are actively involved in helping to promote good practices that sustain not only the businesses in which we invest but the communities in which we operate.
Read more about our responsible ownership policy here.


 
TowerBrook supports Level 20, a not-for-profit organisation that works with industry leaders to attract and retain more women as senior professionals in European private equity.




 
TowerBrook is a member of the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA), the trade body for the UK private equity industry.

As a member of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (BVCA), TowerBrook Capital Partners (U.K.) LLP, which is authorised and regulated by the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority with firm reference number 416020, welcomes the Guidelines for Disclosure and Transparency in Private Equity published by Sir David Walker in November 2007 (as updated from time to time), and is committed to conforming to those Guidelines on a ‘comply or explain’ basis. TowerBrook Capital Partners (U.K.) LLP acts as an investment advisor to TowerBrook’s affiliated funds under management.
Information about TowerBrook, including details of our structure, team and investment strategy, can be found on this website. In providing this information, we have taken an approach that we believe to be proportionate given the extent of our current activities in the UK. This means that, in some cases, we have not included all the detailed information required by the Guidelines. Currently, none of TowerBrook’s portfolio companies is a “Walker company” subject to enhanced disclosure under the Guidelines. If you would like any additional information about TowerBrook, please contact us.
Currently, none of the companies in the TowerBrook portfolio is a UK portfolio company subject to the enhanced reporting requirements set out in the Guidelines. However, TowerBrook is committed to promoting conformity with the Guidelines on the part of any qualifying UK companies in which we may invest in future.
TowerBrook has arrangements in place to ensure that any conflicts of interest that may arise in relation to our investment activities are managed fairly and responsibly.
