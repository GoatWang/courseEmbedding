Except with respect to confirmed defective Products in breach of the foregoing warranty, Company conveys no right of return to Customer and no returns will be accepted. The foregoing warranty is contingent upon proper use of the Products by trained and authorized personnel in their intended and approved uses, and the foregoing warranty will not apply to items that were modified or otherwise altered or changed without Company's prior written approval, that were repaired by persons not authorized by Company, that were subjected to unusual physical, electrical or environmental stress or that were damaged during shipment to Customer. Except for the foregoing warranty, Company makes no warranty, express, implied or statutory, as to any matter whatsoever, including any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. The foregoing warranty applies only in favor of Customer who is the end user and original purchaser of the Products and is not transferable. Return of defective Products must be made according to Company's then-current return goods authorization procedures. Company will not accept any returns of sterile Products if the original packaging has been tampered with or opened, without Company's prior approval.

Pending final determination of a claim through arbitration, a party may seek interim or provisional relief from a court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect the rights or property of such party.
14.  Indemnity. Each party will indemnify the other party against all liabilities, claims and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses) incurred by that party against third parties arising from any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement by the respective party.
15.  Miscellaneous. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the parties regarding its subject matter, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to such subject matter. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without reference to principles of conflicts of law of any jurisdiction. This Agreement may not be assigned by Customer, by operation of law or otherwise, without Company's prior written consent. Company has the right to assign this Agreement without notice or consent. Any attempted assignment in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. No amendment of this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, will be effective unless in writing signed by both parties. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and be interpreted so as best to reasonably effect the intent of the parties.

Except for the foregoing warranty, Company makes no warranty, express, implied or statutory, as to any matter whatsoever, including any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. The foregoing warranty applies only in favor of Customer who is the end user and original purchaser of the Products and is not transferable. Return of defective Products must be made according to Company's then-current return goods authorization procedures.

Pending final determination of a claim through arbitration, a party may seek interim or provisional relief from a court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect the rights or property of such party.
14.  Indemnity. Each party will indemnify the other party against all liabilities, claims and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses) incurred by that party against third parties arising from any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement by the respective party.

This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without reference to principles of conflicts of law of any jurisdiction. This Agreement may not be assigned by Customer, by operation of law or otherwise, without Company's prior written consent. Company has the right to assign this Agreement without notice or consent. Any attempted assignment in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.

Except for the foregoing warranty, Company makes no warranty, express, implied or statutory, as to any matter whatsoever, including any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. The foregoing warranty applies only in favor of Customer who is the end user and original purchaser of the Products and is not transferable.

4. Use of Products. (a) The Products will be used only by an Authorized User in the Country of Use. Any Authorized User who is not a Licensed Physician will use the Products only under the active supervision of a Licensed Physician.  Allowing the use of any Products by any person other than an Authorized User who is, or is acting under the active supervision of a Licensed Physician may violate applicable law and may endanger patient safety. For purposes hereof, "active supervision" means having a Licensed Physician available during the performance of any procedure using the Products. (b) Customer will use, and will ensure that its employees and agents use, the Products only for their intended and approved uses and in accordance with this Agreement and all Company documentation and any updates thereto. (c) Customer will not sell, donate or otherwise transfer any Product to any third party, or export or re-export any Product or any Software contained therein, without Company's prior written consent and without all necessary United States and foreign government consents and licenses. (d) Customer will not tamper with, modify or assist any third party in modifying any Product. Company reserves the right not to sell any Products necessary for the continued use of any Products previously purchased if Company believes the Products are being used in violation of this Agreement.
5. Adverse Events. Customer will promptly (and in any event within two days) report to Company's Customer Service Department any malfunction of a Product or any injury arising out of use of a Product and provide all related information requested by Company.
6.  Proprietary Rights. Company retains all proprietary rights, including all patents, copyrights and trade secrets, in and to all designs, engineering details and other technology and information pertaining to the Products. In furtherance of the foregoing, Company retains sole and exclusive ownership of all software included in or provided in connection with the Products (the "Software"), and Company hereby grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Software as incorporated into, and solely for use in connection with, the Products in accordance with this Agreement. For clarity, the Software is licensed, and not sold, to Customer; any references to "sale" or "purchase" in this Agreement with respect to the Software mean the sale or purchase of such license.

Upon at least 10 days notice, Customer will grant Company access to Products to install any new versions, updates or upgrades of the Software.

Customer will ensure that its Authorized Users attend all training offered by or on behalf of Company that relates to safe use of the Products.
10.  Warranty. Company warrants to Customer that the Products will be free from significant manufacturing defects in materials and workmanship during the Company's standard manufacturer's warranty period stated on the Sales/Lease Order Request. The sole and exclusive remedy of Customer for Company's breach of the foregoing warranty will be, at Company's option, the repair or replacement of a confirmed defective unit and such replacement may be with new or refurbished units. Except with respect to confirmed defective Products in breach of the foregoing warranty, Company conveys no right of return to Customer and no returns will be accepted. The foregoing warranty is contingent upon proper use of the Products by trained and authorized personnel in their intended and approved uses, and the foregoing warranty will not apply to items that were modified or otherwise altered or changed without Company's prior written approval, that were repaired by persons not authorized by Company, that were subjected to unusual physical, electrical or environmental stress or that were damaged during shipment to Customer. Except for the foregoing warranty, Company makes no warranty, express, implied or statutory, as to any matter whatsoever, including any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. The foregoing warranty applies only in favor of Customer who is the end user and original purchaser of the Products and is not transferable. Return of defective Products must be made according to Company's then-current return goods authorization procedures. Company will not accept any returns of sterile Products if the original packaging has been tampered with or opened, without Company's prior approval.
11.  Limitation of Liability. Company's total aggregate liability arising out of this Agreement will be limited to the amount of the purchase price for the Product in question. Under no circumstances will Company be liable for any incidental, consequential, indirect, exemplary, punitive or special damages, including damages for lost revenue, profits or business opportunities, the cost of procurement of substitute goods or services or other financial losses. These limitations apply even if Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages, notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy and regardless of the theory of liability.
12.  Term and Termination. This Agreement will commence on the date of the last signature below and will continue in force until Company gives notice of termination.  Sections 4–7, 11, and 13–15 will survive any termination, as well as all payment obligations incurred prior to termination.
13.  Dispute Resolution. Any claim or dispute arising out of or relating to a Product or this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration conducted in the English language by a single arbitrator in San Francisco, California in accordance with the International Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the arbitration award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Pending final determination of a claim through arbitration, a party may seek interim or provisional relief from a court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect the rights or property of such party.
14.  Indemnity. Each party will indemnify the other party against all liabilities, claims and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses) incurred by that party against third parties arising from any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement by the respective party.
15.  Miscellaneous. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the parties regarding its subject matter, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to such subject matter. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without reference to principles of conflicts of law of any jurisdiction. This Agreement may not be assigned by Customer, by operation of law or otherwise, without Company's prior written consent. Company has the right to assign this Agreement without notice or consent. Any attempted assignment in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. No amendment of this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, will be effective unless in writing signed by both parties. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and be interpreted so as best to reasonably effect the intent of the parties.

FDA clears new indication for Myoscience's iovera° system to relieve pain and symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the kneeFREMONT, CA (May 17, 2017) - California-based Myoscience, Inc. announced that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared its iovera° device for the relief of pain and symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the knee for up to 90 days. The ioveraº technology is a non-opioid and non-systemic treatment for blocking pain signals from peripheral nerves.

Osteoarthritis compromises the quality of life of more than 27 million Americans, with approximately 25% of knee osteoarthritis sufferers complaining of pain while performing daily activities (walking, climbing stairs, kneeling, etc.) (1). The effect of this disease on the United States economy is estimated to be $60 billion per year (2). Also, Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that the US is in the throes of an opioid epidemic, and that the total number of opioid-related deaths may be underestimated.
“The iovera° technology has the potential to change the current paradigm of pain management for osteoarthritis”, said Dr. Vinod Dasa. “The patients that I have treated with this technology have experienced immediate and long-lasting pain relief; and are grateful to have an option that is non-narcotic and non-systemic.”
The FDA clearance was based on a recent prospective, multi-center, sham-controlled, randomized, double-blind study of 180 subjects. The study concluded that patients treated with the iovera° device reported statistically significant greater reduction in pain and improvement in symptoms (p=0.001) when compared to patients who received the sham treatment (3). Also, patients who received the iovera° treatment reported pain relief lasting up to 90 days, accompanied by reduced stiffness and improved physical function.

The full study results are published in the Osteoarthritis and Cartilage journal.
Cary Vance, President and CEO of Myoscience, stated that “The addition of osteoarthritis to the indications for the iovera° treatment will help in extending our innovative non-opioid therapy to more patients, especially in the growing baby-boomer population. I anticipate this technology to become the non-narcotic and non-systemic solution of choice to manage knee pain.”
The iovera° treatment uses the body’s natural response to cold to treat peripheral nerves. A sensory nerve will stop sending pain signals immediately after receiving targeted cold therapy via the iovera° treatment. The effect on the nerve is transient, providing pain relief until the nerve regenerates and its sensory function is fully restored. This pain relief is achieved without the use of habit-forming drugs such as opioids.

ABOUT OSTEOARTHRITIS
According to reports from the CDC, approximately 27 million Americans suffer with osteoarthritis. While 1 in 2 people develop osteoarthritis during their lifetime, obesity increases the risk of knee osteoarthritis to 3 in 5. Quality of life is routinely affected, with 25% of knee osteoarthritis sufferers reporting trouble performing simple daily activities, such as walking, climbing, kneeling or stooping. (Source: A National Public Health Agenda for Osteoarthritis. CDC. February 4, 2010)

ABOUT THE KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS STUDY
The knee osteoarthritis study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the iovera° device for the temporary relief of pain associated with knee osteoarthritis. Study population included male or female, ages 35-75 with chronic knee pain related to knee osteoarthritis.

Breakthrough pain therapy device, iovera°, reaches max  enrollment for two knee pain studies ahead of schedule; makes strong entry into orthopedic marketFREMONT, CA (March 1, 2016) – California-based Myoscience, Inc., announces the completion of patient enrollment in two prospective, randomized, placebo controlled studies focused on relieving knee pain.  Both studies measure the effect of using the proprietary, FDA cleared, iovera° treatment to freeze the peripheral nerves which transmit pain in the knee.  The iovera° treatment provides an immediate nerve block that is a non-systemic, non-narcotic solution to blocking pain for an extended period of time.  The iovera° treatment has been commercially available in the United States since March 2014.

 

The MYO-1070 study evaluates post-surgical pain management for patients treated prior to undergoing a total knee replacement; 150 patients were enrolled, the enrollment target was reached six weeks early.  The primary endpoint is cumulative opioid consumption at 6 weeks post-TKA surgery, comparing the iovera° treatment group and the control group. The MYO-0946 study evaluates iovera° as a temporary nerve block for patients with chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis; 180 patients were enrolled.  The primary endpoint hypothesis of the study is that the change in score after 30 days under iovera° is superior to that of control.  Both studies will be critical at establishing the iovera° treatment as a non-systemic alternative for effective pain therapy.  Results of the studies will be available later this year.

 

Dr. Antonia Chen, orthopedic surgeon at the Rothman Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is an Investigator in MYO-1070. She sees the potential for therapies like the iovera° treatment - “Opioid abuse is becoming a larger problem in our society, and it may be beneficial to add non-narcotic pain therapies such as iovera° to reduce pain in our total knee replacement patients.”

 

Dr. Richard Berkowitz, orthopedic surgeon at the Phoenix Clinical Research Institute in Tamarac, Florida is also an Investigator in MYO-1070.  He feels it's a good fit for many orthopedic practices - “The duration of effect of the iovera° treatment will make it a useful adjunct for surgical applications especially knee replacement surgery.  Our staff have become experts on performing the treatment and it is a fast, safe and simple treatment to do in an office or hospital setting.”

 

The iovera° system is comprised of a handheld unit, charging dock and disposable Smart Tips, which deliver Myoscience’s patented Focused Cold Therapy® technology to treat peripheral nerves to block pain. Using the body's natural response to cold, the iovera° system can immediately relieve peripheral nerve pain – without the use of drugs or other systemic therapies.

 

Myoscience is expanding their commercial efforts by building an orthopedic distribution network in the United States and is exhibiting at the upcoming American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons annual conference in Orlando, Florida from March 2-4 (booth 3518).

 

Additional information on clinical studies for the iovera° treatment can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Myoscience Expands Platform Technology for Pain Treatments to Reach Deep Peripheral NervesFREMONT, CA (Sep 9, 2015) – California based myoscience, inc., continues to revolutionize cryotherapy pain treatments with the release of the new 1x55mm Smart Tip for the iovera° device. The new Smart Tip consists of a single cannula that is 55mm in length, enabling physicians to reach peripheral nerves that are deeper in the body. This is the second Smart Tip released for the treatment of peripheral nerves to block pain with the iovera° device.

 

“With the launch of the 1x55mm Smart Tip, we have expanded the treatment possibilities,” says Jeff Gold, CEO of myoscience. “The current 3x6.9mm Smart Tip is excellent for superficial nerves and now, with the 1x55mm, we are able to reach a wide range of deep nerves, making the iovera° system a must-have treatment option for any physician specializing in pain.”

 

The iovera° treatment is powered by the Focused Cold TherapyTM delivery system, a patented miniaturization of traditional cryotherapy. Offering patients a non-systemic, minimally-invasive treatment for pain, physicians are excited about the possibilities with the 1x55mm Smart Tip.

 

David Smolins, MD, of Remedy Medical Group in Redwood City, CA says, "This is an exciting development for physicians and patients. The iovera° 1x55mm Smart Tip allows for cryoablative treatment of anatomy previously difficult to access. This greatly increases the conditions we can treat with this modality, benefitting the large population of patients seeking relief for their pain. iovera° is intuitive and easy to use, and its application in the treatment of lumbar conditions is very promising."

 

Over 2,000 commercial iovera° treatments have been performed to date in the U.S. Peripheral nerves treated with the iovera° system are temporarily stopped from signaling for a period of time, followed by a restoration of function. Results from the iovera° treatment can be felt immediately after treatment and last until the nerve has regenerated.

New York City Pain Specialists Introduce New Treatment for Knee Pain First Physicians in Northeast to offer iovera° treatmentRedwood City, CA – February 23, 2015   Myoscience announced today that Dr. Halland Medical, and Manhattan Spine and Pain have joined a growing number of cutting-edge medical facilities in the nation, and become the first in the Northeast, to offer the iovera° system for the treatment of anterior and interior knee pain. The iovera° system, cleared by the FDA to treat peripheral nerve pain, utilizes its patented Focused Cold Therapy™ delivery system to direct a controlled cold dosage via closed-end probes to specific nerves for precise, predictable, drug-free pain relief.

 

“The iovera° treatment provides my knee pain patients with a very effective, natural option that provides relief precisely at their point of pain allowing them, in many cases, to avoid or reduce their need for systemic painkillers,” said Sudhir Diwan, M.D., Manhattan Spine and Pain. “My patients are excited to have a minimally-invasive, drug-free treatment that enables them to walk out of my office pain-free and stay that way for up to 3 months.”

 

“Patients are relieved when they realize that there is a minimally-invasive, non-systemic option that can give them instant knee pain relief,” said Halland Chen, M.D., of Dr. Halland Medical. “There’s something familiar and comforting to patients about using the simple power of cold to eliminate pain, and with iovera° we can now use cold in a very high-tech, precise way to block specific nerve signals temporarily.”

 

Frequent knee pain limits function and mobility, and impairs quality of life for approximately 25% of adults.1 Peripheral nerves treated with the iovera° system are temporarily stopped from signalling for a period of time, followed by a restoration of function - results may vary per patient*. Because peripheral nerve function is disrupted rather than destroyed, the results are safe, effective and temporary.

 

“We are so pleased that these pain specialists have seen the unique value of the Focused Cold Therapy delivery system for patients with knee pain,” said Jeff Gold, myoscience CEO. “The iovera° treatment allows physicians to target a patient’s pain directly at the source by treating the specific peripheral nerves involved with a natural, safe dose of cold that temporarily stops the nerves from signalling and delivers immediate pain relief.”

 

The iovera° system delivers liquid nitrous oxide from a convenient and powerful handheld device to the closed-end probes of the Smart Tip during treatment. While this highly pressurized liquid travels from the handpiece to the Smart Tip, it undergoes a phase change becoming very cold, drawing in heat energy from the surrounding tissue and forming a precise zone of cold at the targeted nerve. The gaseous nitrous oxide returns into the handpiece, leaving nothing behind in the body. This precise cold treatment causes a reversible nerve block based on a process called Wallerian degeneration. Pain is relieved in sensory nerves, which send messages to the central nervous system. The nerve re-innervates 1-2 mm per day, which gives a predictable restoration of nerve function.

 

About iovera°

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the iovera° system for use in peripheral nerves in January 2013. iovera° is being used most frequently for knee pain but can be used to treat pain in any peripheral nerve. The iovera° system is specifically cleared to destroy tissue during surgical procedures by applying cold temperature. It can also be used to produce lesions in peripheral nervous tissue by the application of cold to the selected site for the blocking of pain. The iovera° system is not indicated for treatment of central nervous system tissue.

Bay Area Pain Specialists Freeze Out Knee Pain Becoming Among the First Clinics Nationwide to Offer the iovera° treatmentiovera° harnesses cold to block nerve signals and reduce pain
 Redwood City, CA – September 24, 2014   myoscience announced today the launch of its iovera° system for the treatment of anterior and interior knee pain at three practices in the San Francisco Bay area:  Remedy Medical Group, Fremont Holistic Center and California Spine Care.  The iovera° system, cleared by the FDA to treat peripheral nerve pain, utilizes its patented Focused Cold Therapy™ delivery system to apply a controlled cold zone via a Smart Tip to specific nerves for precise and predictable pain relief.

“We are pleased that these Bay Area pain specialists are joining the growing ranks of leading facilities in the nation offering the iovera° system for knee pain sufferers,” said Jeff Gold, myoscience President and Chief Operating Officer.  “The iovera° treatment gives physicians the opportunity to safely address their patients’ peripheral nerve pain – the immediate result allows them to see the relief and the subsequent excitement first hand.”

Frequent knee pain affects approximately 25% of adults, limits function and mobility, and impairs quality of life.1 Peripheral nerves treated with the iovera° system stop signaling pain for a set period of time, usually up to 3 months, after which their function is restored.  Because peripheral nerve function is disrupted rather than destroyed, the treatment is safe, effective and temporary.

“iovera° is unique in that it offers safe, highly targeted pain relief right at the peripheral nerve involved in a patient’s pain,” said David Smolins, M.D., Remedy Medical Group.  “It’s exciting to see so many of my patients come in with debilitating knee pain and walk out of my office pain-free after their first iovera° treatment.”

“Our patients are delighted to have the option of a non-invasive, drug-free treatment that specifically targets the area of pain,” said Santi Rao, M.D., California Spine Care.  “We are finding that if patients can avoid or reduce their use of systemic medicines and their side effects, they prefer that option.”

“Our patients are achieving immediate and sustained pain relief which allows them to comfortably pursue and make progress in physical therapy, but also, and perhaps more importantly, get back to the activities that matter most to them,” said Barry Shibuya, M.D, Founder and Medical Director, Fremont Holistic Center.

The iovera° system delivers liquid nitrous oxide from a convenient and powerful handheld device to the closed-end probes of the Smart Tip during treatment.  While this highly pressurized liquid travels from the hand piece to the Smart Tip, it undergoes a phase change and becomes very cold, drawing in heat energy from the surrounding tissue and forming a precise zone of cold at the targeted nerve. The gaseous nitrous oxide returns into the hand piece, leaving nothing behind in the body.  This precise cold treatment causes a reversible nerve block based on a process called Wallerian degeneration. Pain is relieved in sensory nerves, which send messages to the central nervous system.  Pain relief can last up to 3 months, at which time predictable restoration of nerve function occurs.

 

About iovera°

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the iovera° system for use in peripheral nerves in January 2013.  The iovera° system is being used most frequently for knee pain but can be used to treat pain in any peripheral nerve. The iovera° system is specifically cleared to destroy tissue during surgical procedures by applying cold temperature.  It can also be used to produce lesions in peripheral nervous tissue by the application of cold to the selected site for the blocking of pain. The iovera° system is not indicated for treatment of central nervous system tissue. www.ioverahealth.com

Bay Area Pain Specialists Freeze Out Knee Pain Becoming Among the First Clinics Nationwide to Offer the iovera° treatment
September 24, 2014 - Read Press Release
Louisiana State University Department of Orthopaedic Surgery  Becomes One of the First Clinics Nationwide to Offer iovera˚ Focused Cold Therapy  to Freeze Out Knee Pain
iovera˚ harnesses cold to block nerve signals and reduce pain
 

Redwood City, CA – July 16, 2014   myoscience announced today the launch of its iovera° system for the treatment of anterior and interior knee pain at the Louisiana State University (LSU) Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.  The iovera° system utilizes its patented Focused Cold Therapy™ delivery system to direct a controlled cold dosage via closed-end probes to specific nerves for precise and predictable pain relief.

 

“We are excited that LSU is among the first cutting edge orthopaedic facilities in the nation to offer the iovera° system for knee pain sufferers,” said Clint Carnell, myoscience CEO and iovera° developer.  “iovera° gives physicians the opportunity to address their patients’ peripheral nerve pain in a very targeted way harnessing the natural power of cold to temporarily stop nerves from signalling and to deliver immediate toxin-free, drug-free pain relief.”

 

Frequent knee pain affects approximately 25% of adults, limits function and mobility, and impairs quality of life.1 Peripheral nerves treated with the iovera° system stop signalling pain for a set period of time, usually up to 3 months, after which their function is fully restored.  Because peripheral nerve function is disrupted rather than destroyed, the results are safe, effective and temporary.

 

“This technology has the potential to change the current paradigm of acute and chronic pain management.  The patients that I have treated are all grateful to have an option that is very safe and that has allowed them to get back to functionality quickly,” said Vinod Dasa, MD, Assistant Professor of Clinical Orthopaedics at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) School of Medicine in New Orleans, one of the first U.S. physicians to perform the procedure and to treat more than 60 patients.  “Focused cold therapy offers reliable pain relief in areas such as the knee which may allow for physical therapy to proceed, and even reduce the need for systemic pain relievers.”

myoscience Named Winner of the 2014 Red Herring Top 100 North America Award
May 21, 2014 - Read Press Release
Forbes Living Features iovera° by myoscience, Inc.May 20, 2014, St. Petersburg, FL – The producers of Forbes Living are excited to announce that the iovera°® health treatment, an innovative peripheral nerve pain treatment designed by myoscience, Inc., will be featured in an upcoming segment as part of their "Healthy Living" series.  The show is hosted by Forbes Riley, an award-winning TV host in the D2C industry, author, entrepreneur, mother and one of the nation’s leading health and wellness experts.

The primary function of a peripheral nerve is to transmit signals from the spinal cord to the rest of the body, and to return signals sensing things like pain from the rest of the body to the spinal cord. Damage to peripheral nerves can cause severe pain, affecting one's quality of life and emotional well-being.

The team at myoscience has harnessed the healing power of cold to treat peripheral nerves that signal pain.  The iovera° treatment utilizes myoscience’s platform technology, the Focused Cold Therapy™ delivery system, to precisely target peripheral nerves, temporarily interrupting pain signaling pathways. This precise cold treatment causes a reversible nerve block based on a process called Wallerian degeneration that is followed by a predictable restoration of nerve function.  The iovera° system offers patients a new non-habit forming treatment option, with no systemic side effects and nothing being injected into the body. Most patients experience instant pain relief after an iovera° treatment, with results that can last up to three months.

The iovera° treatment is minimally invasive and can be performed inside a physician's office. Patients benefit from an immediate reduction in pain. The average treatment time for one treatment site is approximately 20-30 minutes.

”The opportunity to work with Forbes to educate consumers about this breakthrough pain treatment will be a big step in spreading the word about how the power of cold can treat pain," said Clint Carnell, CEO of myoscience. "We are pleased to be partnering with such a respected program."

Vancouverites looking for natural beauty 

New cosmetic treatment iovera° uses body’s natural response to cold to smooth forehead wrinkles
Survey reveals over half of Vancouverites would consider non-surgical cosmetic treatment
30-35 age group most concerned with looking younger


Vancouver, April 2014 - A survey conducted by new cosmetic wrinkle treatment iovera°® has found that there is a growing desire among Vancouverites for more natural beauty products and treatments.  Two thirds of respondents (67%) said that they have become more aware of the ingredients in cosmetics and beauty products in the last two years.  While quality (58%) and price (51%) are important, natural ingredients (39%) ranked highly on factors influencing purchasing decisions.

 

The iovera° treatment provides a new option for people who want to treat their dynamic forehead wrinkles but who are uncomfortable or unsuitable for existing treatments which use a toxin.  The effects of the 20 minute procedure targets forehead lines precisely using the Focused Cold TherapyTM delivery system. The Focused Cold Therapy delivery system is an advanced technology that works immediately and relaxes facial muscles that cause wrinkles without leaving any toxins or chemicals behind in the body. The effects of the treatment last up to 3 months.

 

The survey of more than 500 Vancouverites found that appearance matters with the majority (80%) of those questioned admitting they put a great deal or quite a lot of effort into looking their best.  72% of women surveyed claimed they would be unlikely to go out and meet friends without doing their hair and makeup.  They are not alone, as 62% of men would not go out without doing their hair.

 

Living and looking healthy is also important to Vancouverites. Nine out of ten (90%) of those polled said they would like to lead a healthier lifestyle and many will check the label for artificial ingredients and preservatives in foods (73%) and beauty (60%) products.

 

Ultimately people would like to look younger (72%) and healthier (86%) and just over half (54%) said they would consider a non-surgical cosmetic treatment to smooth forehead lines and wrinkles.

 

Dr. Charles Cheng, MD at Skin Matters and iovera° trained doctor said, "The iovera° system provides instant gratification for those seeking a non-toxin option for wrinkle prevention and reduction.  This technology shows incredible promise and should prove to become one of the leading choices in wrinkle treatment for doctors and patients alike.”

 

76% of respondents who would consider a cosmetic wrinkle treatment find the idea of a treatment, which uses the body’s natural response to cold more appealing, compared to one in nine (11%) that find a treatment, which uses a toxin more appealing.  Fear of looking fake, plastic or unnatural is the biggest fear among those who would not consider such a treatment.

 

Clint Carnell, CEO of myoscience who developed the iovera° treatment in California, is positive about the growing interest being shown for the treatment in Canada: “The iovera° technology enables physicians to treat using only the power of cold which is an appealing option for many.”

 

“We developed iovera˚ in partnership with some of the world’s leading physicians. There is powerful consumer demand for the treatment because it offers an immediate wrinkle solution without the use of a toxin,” says Clint.

New cosmetic treatment iovera° uses body’s natural response to cold to smooth forehead wrinkles
Survey reveals over half of Londoners would consider non-surgical cosmetic treatment
30-35 age group most concerned with looking younger

London, March 2014 - A survey conducted by new cosmetic wrinkle treatment iovera°® has found that there is a growing desire among Londoners for more natural beauty products and treatments.  Two thirds of respondents (65%) said that they have become more aware of the ingredients in cosmetics and beauty products in the last two years.  While quality (59%) and price (48%) are important, natural ingredients (32%) ranked highly on factors influencing purchasing decisions.

 

The iovera° treatment provides a new option for people who want to treat their dynamic forehead wrinkles but who are uncomfortable or unsuitable for existing treatments which use a toxin.  The effects of the 20 minute procedure targets forehead lines precisely using the Focused Cold TherapyTM delivery system. The Focused Cold Therapy delivery system is an advanced technology that works immediately and relaxes facial muscles that cause wrinkles without leaving any toxins or chemicals behind in the body. The effects of the treatment last up to 3 months.

 

The survey of more than 500 Londoners found that appearance matters with the majority (59%) of those questioned admitting they put a great deal or quite a lot of effort into looking their best.  54% of women surveyed claimed they would be unlikely to go out and meet friends without doing their hair and makeup.  They are not alone as 43% of men would not go out without doing their hair.

 

Living and looking healthy is also important to Londoners. Nine out of ten (90%) of those polled said they would like to lead a healthier lifestyle and many will check the label for artificial ingredients and preservatives in foods (76%) and beauty (62%) products.

 

Ultimately people would like to look younger (73%) and healthier (89%) and just over half (54%) said they would consider a non-surgical cosmetic treatment to smooth forehead lines and wrinkles.

 

Dr Yannis Alexandrides, MD at 111 Harley Street and iovera° trained doctor said, "Patients at my clinic seek treatments that will provide them a natural result, one that leaves them looking fresh and rejuvenated. iovera° allows me to offer this result with the added benefit that no toxins are actually injected into the body."

 

68% of respondents who would consider a cosmetic wrinkle treatment find the idea of a treatment which uses the body’s natural response to cold more appealing, compared to one in five (22%) that find a treatment which uses a toxin more appealing.  Fear of looking fake, plastic or unnatural is the biggest fear among those who would not consider such a treatment.

 

Clint Carnell, CEO of myoscience who developed the iovera° treatment in California, is positive about the growing interest being shown for the treatment in the UK: “The iovera° technology enables physicians to treat using only the power of cold which is an appealing option for many.”

 

“We developed iovera˚ in partnership with some of the world’s leading physicians. There is powerful consumer demand for the treatment because it offers an immediate wrinkle solution without the use of a toxin,” says Clint.

device technology has received FDA clearance for the treatment of pain.
myoscience’s patented technology precisely delivers cold to targeted nerves. The
cold induces a hibernating state resulting in a temporary interruption of nerve
signaling to sensory receptors or muscle tissue.The device uses the power of cold to
achieve an immediate result with nothing left behind in the patient. The myoscience
device received CE approval and a medical device license from Health Canada in
2011.
The hand-held device is intended for use in the physician’s office and represents a
breakthrough advance in the treatment of pain. The myoscience technology can
address multiple indications in a targeted treatment with no systemic side effects or
addictive potential.
“FDA clearance for our device in the US provides myoscience with a platform
technology on which to grow our company by addressing further indications and an
expanding geography,” said Clint Carnell, Chief Executive Officer of myoscience.

Myoscience Closes $33 Million Series D FinancingFunds to commercialize first indication of platform Focused Cold Therapy for forehead wrinkles

REDWOOD CITY, CA, March 21, 2012 – Venture-backed myoscience, Inc. announced that it closed on $33 million in Series D financing and anticipates a second tranche of up to $12 million dollars due to significant interest in the investment community. Myoscience is committed to making its platform technology, focused cold therapy (FCT), the pre-eminent treatment for conditions involving nerves. The company will use the proceeds of the current financing round to commercialize the first indication in Europe, which is a treatment to reduce ‘dynamic facial lines,’ more commonly referred to as forehead wrinkles. Toxin-free FCT is uniquely positioned to expand the aesthetic market for treatment of dynamic facial lines currently addressed by neurotoxins.

Myoscience’s strategy is to establish FCT as a platform technology for multiple indications, starting with the treatment of dynamic facial lines. The company then plans to expand the technology into therapeutic indications for the focal treatment of pain and muscle disorders. The company believes the addressable aesthetic market is approximately $2 billion while the market for the focal treatment of pain and muscle disorders may be up to $9 billion.

“Our financing was significantly oversubscribed -- a marker, we believe, of our company’s significant progress this year and potential in the near future,” said Clint Carnell, myoscience President & CEO. “We look forward to commercializing our aesthetic indication in Europe, and believe that our natural, nontoxin approach will expand the entire category by pulling toxin-averse patients off the sidelines and into the doctor’s office. With the platform complete we can now work with physicians to develop nonaddictive, non-injectable treatments for various therapeutic applications in pain and muscle disorders, an equally exciting and compelling market for our unique technology.”

The Series D financing included the following existing investors: Accuitive Medical Ventures, American Equities Overseas, DeNovo Ventures, Medicis Capital, Nexus Medical Partners, Saratoga Ventures, and Valiance.

Myoscience received CE Mark clearance and its Canadian market license in December 2011 for temporary treatment of wrinkles and the treatment of pain. The company recently submitted a 510k application for the treatment of pain with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and will shortly begin to enroll subjects in a pivotal trial to support FDA clearance for treatment of wrinkles. The technology is presently cleared in the U.S. for treatment of peripheral pain syndromes and use in general tissue ablation.

FDA clears new indication for Myoscience's iovera° system to relieve pain and symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the kneeFREMONT, CA (May 17, 2017) - California-based Myoscience, Inc. announced that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared its iovera° device for the relief of pain and symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the knee for up to 90 days. The ioveraº technology is a non-opioid and non-systemic treatment for blocking pain signals from peripheral nerves.

Osteoarthritis compromises the quality of life of more than 27 million Americans, with approximately 25% of knee osteoarthritis sufferers complaining of pain while performing daily activities (walking, climbing stairs, kneeling, etc.) (1). The effect of this disease on the United States economy is estimated to be $60 billion per year (2). Also, Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that the US is in the throes of an opioid epidemic, and that the total number of opioid-related deaths may be underestimated.
“The iovera° technology has the potential to change the current paradigm of pain management for osteoarthritis”, said Dr. Vinod Dasa. “The patients that I have treated with this technology have experienced immediate and long-lasting pain relief; and are grateful to have an option that is non-narcotic and non-systemic.”
The FDA clearance was based on a recent prospective, multi-center, sham-controlled, randomized, double-blind study of 180 subjects. The study concluded that patients treated with the iovera° device reported statistically significant greater reduction in pain and improvement in symptoms (p=0.001) when compared to patients who received the sham treatment (3). Also, patients who received the iovera° treatment reported pain relief lasting up to 90 days, accompanied by reduced stiffness and improved physical function.

The full study results are published in the Osteoarthritis and Cartilage journal.
Cary Vance, President and CEO of Myoscience, stated that “The addition of osteoarthritis to the indications for the iovera° treatment will help in extending our innovative non-opioid therapy to more patients, especially in the growing baby-boomer population. I anticipate this technology to become the non-narcotic and non-systemic solution of choice to manage knee pain.”
The iovera° treatment uses the body’s natural response to cold to treat peripheral nerves. A sensory nerve will stop sending pain signals immediately after receiving targeted cold therapy via the iovera° treatment. The effect on the nerve is transient, providing pain relief until the nerve regenerates and its sensory function is fully restored. This pain relief is achieved without the use of habit-forming drugs such as opioids.

Breakthrough pain therapy device, iovera°, reaches max  enrollment for two knee pain studies ahead of schedule; makes strong entry into orthopedic marketFREMONT, CA (March 1, 2016) – California-based Myoscience, Inc., announces the completion of patient enrollment in two prospective, randomized, placebo controlled studies focused on relieving knee pain.  Both studies measure the effect of using the proprietary, FDA cleared, iovera° treatment to freeze the peripheral nerves which transmit pain in the knee.  The iovera° treatment provides an immediate nerve block that is a non-systemic, non-narcotic solution to blocking pain for an extended period of time.  The iovera° treatment has been commercially available in the United States since March 2014.

 

The MYO-1070 study evaluates post-surgical pain management for patients treated prior to undergoing a total knee replacement; 150 patients were enrolled, the enrollment target was reached six weeks early.  The primary endpoint is cumulative opioid consumption at 6 weeks post-TKA surgery, comparing the iovera° treatment group and the control group. The MYO-0946 study evaluates iovera° as a temporary nerve block for patients with chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis; 180 patients were enrolled.  The primary endpoint hypothesis of the study is that the change in score after 30 days under iovera° is superior to that of control.  Both studies will be critical at establishing the iovera° treatment as a non-systemic alternative for effective pain therapy.  Results of the studies will be available later this year.

 

Dr. Antonia Chen, orthopedic surgeon at the Rothman Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is an Investigator in MYO-1070. She sees the potential for therapies like the iovera° treatment - “Opioid abuse is becoming a larger problem in our society, and it may be beneficial to add non-narcotic pain therapies such as iovera° to reduce pain in our total knee replacement patients.”

 

Dr. Richard Berkowitz, orthopedic surgeon at the Phoenix Clinical Research Institute in Tamarac, Florida is also an Investigator in MYO-1070.  He feels it's a good fit for many orthopedic practices - “The duration of effect of the iovera° treatment will make it a useful adjunct for surgical applications especially knee replacement surgery.  Our staff have become experts on performing the treatment and it is a fast, safe and simple treatment to do in an office or hospital setting.”

 

The iovera° system is comprised of a handheld unit, charging dock and disposable Smart Tips, which deliver Myoscience’s patented Focused Cold Therapy® technology to treat peripheral nerves to block pain. Using the body's natural response to cold, the iovera° system can immediately relieve peripheral nerve pain – without the use of drugs or other systemic therapies.

 

Myoscience is expanding their commercial efforts by building an orthopedic distribution network in the United States and is exhibiting at the upcoming American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons annual conference in Orlando, Florida from March 2-4 (booth 3518).

 

Additional information on clinical studies for the iovera° treatment can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov.

“With the launch of the 1x55mm Smart Tip, we have expanded the treatment possibilities,” says Jeff Gold, CEO of myoscience. “The current 3x6.9mm Smart Tip is excellent for superficial nerves and now, with the 1x55mm, we are able to reach a wide range of deep nerves, making the iovera° system a must-have treatment option for any physician specializing in pain.”

 

The iovera° treatment is powered by the Focused Cold TherapyTM delivery system, a patented miniaturization of traditional cryotherapy. Offering patients a non-systemic, minimally-invasive treatment for pain, physicians are excited about the possibilities with the 1x55mm Smart Tip.

 

David Smolins, MD, of Remedy Medical Group in Redwood City, CA says, "This is an exciting development for physicians and patients. The iovera° 1x55mm Smart Tip allows for cryoablative treatment of anatomy previously difficult to access. This greatly increases the conditions we can treat with this modality, benefitting the large population of patients seeking relief for their pain. iovera° is intuitive and easy to use, and its application in the treatment of lumbar conditions is very promising."

 

Over 2,000 commercial iovera° treatments have been performed to date in the U.S. Peripheral nerves treated with the iovera° system are temporarily stopped from signaling for a period of time, followed by a restoration of function. Results from the iovera° treatment can be felt immediately after treatment and last until the nerve has regenerated.

New York City Pain Specialists Introduce New Treatment for Knee Pain First Physicians in Northeast to offer iovera° treatmentRedwood City, CA – February 23, 2015   Myoscience announced today that Dr. Halland Medical, and Manhattan Spine and Pain have joined a growing number of cutting-edge medical facilities in the nation, and become the first in the Northeast, to offer the iovera° system for the treatment of anterior and interior knee pain. The iovera° system, cleared by the FDA to treat peripheral nerve pain, utilizes its patented Focused Cold Therapy™ delivery system to direct a controlled cold dosage via closed-end probes to specific nerves for precise, predictable, drug-free pain relief.

 

“The iovera° treatment provides my knee pain patients with a very effective, natural option that provides relief precisely at their point of pain allowing them, in many cases, to avoid or reduce their need for systemic painkillers,” said Sudhir Diwan, M.D., Manhattan Spine and Pain. “My patients are excited to have a minimally-invasive, drug-free treatment that enables them to walk out of my office pain-free and stay that way for up to 3 months.”

 

“Patients are relieved when they realize that there is a minimally-invasive, non-systemic option that can give them instant knee pain relief,” said Halland Chen, M.D., of Dr. Halland Medical. “There’s something familiar and comforting to patients about using the simple power of cold to eliminate pain, and with iovera° we can now use cold in a very high-tech, precise way to block specific nerve signals temporarily.”

 

Frequent knee pain limits function and mobility, and impairs quality of life for approximately 25% of adults.1 Peripheral nerves treated with the iovera° system are temporarily stopped from signalling for a period of time, followed by a restoration of function - results may vary per patient*. Because peripheral nerve function is disrupted rather than destroyed, the results are safe, effective and temporary.

 

“We are so pleased that these pain specialists have seen the unique value of the Focused Cold Therapy delivery system for patients with knee pain,” said Jeff Gold, myoscience CEO. “The iovera° treatment allows physicians to target a patient’s pain directly at the source by treating the specific peripheral nerves involved with a natural, safe dose of cold that temporarily stops the nerves from signalling and delivers immediate pain relief.”

 

The iovera° system delivers liquid nitrous oxide from a convenient and powerful handheld device to the closed-end probes of the Smart Tip during treatment. While this highly pressurized liquid travels from the handpiece to the Smart Tip, it undergoes a phase change becoming very cold, drawing in heat energy from the surrounding tissue and forming a precise zone of cold at the targeted nerve. The gaseous nitrous oxide returns into the handpiece, leaving nothing behind in the body. This precise cold treatment causes a reversible nerve block based on a process called Wallerian degeneration. Pain is relieved in sensory nerves, which send messages to the central nervous system. The nerve re-innervates 1-2 mm per day, which gives a predictable restoration of nerve function.

 

About iovera°

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the iovera° system for use in peripheral nerves in January 2013. iovera° is being used most frequently for knee pain but can be used to treat pain in any peripheral nerve. The iovera° system is specifically cleared to destroy tissue during surgical procedures by applying cold temperature. It can also be used to produce lesions in peripheral nervous tissue by the application of cold to the selected site for the blocking of pain. The iovera° system is not indicated for treatment of central nervous system tissue.

New York City Pain Specialists Introduce New Treatment for Knee Pain First Physicians in Northeast to offer iovera° treatment
February 23, 2015 - Read Press Release
Los Angeles-area Orthopedic Groups Become First in the Region to offer the iovera° treatment for Patients with Knee PainRedwood City, CA – January 22, 2015   Myoscience announced today that Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic and Podesta Orthopedic and Sports Medicine Institute have joined a growing number of cutting-edge medical facilities in the nation, and are the first in the Los Angeles area, to offer the iovera° system for the treatment of anterior and interior knee pain. The iovera° system, cleared by the FDA to treat peripheral nerve pain, utilizes its patented Focused Cold Therapy™ delivery system to direct a controlled cold dosage via closed-end probes to specific nerves for precise, predictable, drug-free pain relief.

"We are pleased these practices have seen, first hand, the value of the iovera° system for their knee pain sufferers," said Jeff Gold, myoscience CEO. "The iovera° system gives physicians and patients a unique option to address peripheral nerve pain in a very targeted, safe way harnessing the natural power of cold to temporarily stop nerves from signaling and to deliver immediate pain relief without systemic medication."

Frequent knee pain limits function and mobility, and impairs quality of life for approximately 25% of adults.1 Peripheral nerves treated with the iovera° system are temporarily stopped from signalling for a period of time, followed by a restoration of function - results may vary per patient*. Because peripheral nerve function is disrupted rather than destroyed, the results are safe, effective and temporary.

"In my practice I strive to offer my patients options that are the least invasive to their bodies and lives as possible," said Luga Podesta, M.D., of the Podesta Orthopedic and Sports Medicine Institute. "This procedure uses the simple power of cold in a very high-tech, precise way to essentially block specific nerve signals temporarily and deliver immediate pain relief."

"The iovera° treatment has been a great addition to my clinical armamentarium for patients with knee pain. I can offer them highly targeted pain relief, and in many cases, help them avoid or reduce their need for systemic painkillers," said Vernon Williams, M.D., of Kerlan Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic. "My patients are excited to have a natural, drug-free treatment that enables them to walk out of my office with reduced pain and stay that way for up to 3 months."

The iovera° system delivers liquid nitrous oxide from a convenient and powerful handheld device to the closed-end probes of the Smart Tip during treatment. While this highly pressurized liquid travels from the handpiece to the Smart Tip, it undergoes a phase change becoming very cold, drawing in heat energy from the surrounding tissue and forming a precise zone of cold at the targeted nerve. The gaseous nitrous oxide returns into the handpiece, leaving nothing behind in the body. This precise cold treatment causes a reversible nerve block based on a process called Wallerian degeneration. Pain is relieved in sensory nerves, which send messages to the central nervous system. The nerve re-innervates 1-2 mm per day, which gives a predictable restoration of nerve function.

 

About iovera°

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the iovera° system for use in peripheral nerves in January 2013. The iovera° system is being used most frequently for knee pain but can be used to treat pain in any peripheral nerve. The iovera° system is specifically cleared to destroy tissue during surgical procedures by applying cold temperature. It can also be used to produce lesions in peripheral nervous tissue by the application of cold to the selected site for the blocking of pain. The iovera° system is not indicated for treatment of central nervous system tissue.

Bay Area Pain Specialists Freeze Out Knee Pain Becoming Among the First Clinics Nationwide to Offer the iovera° treatmentiovera° harnesses cold to block nerve signals and reduce pain
 Redwood City, CA – September 24, 2014   myoscience announced today the launch of its iovera° system for the treatment of anterior and interior knee pain at three practices in the San Francisco Bay area:  Remedy Medical Group, Fremont Holistic Center and California Spine Care.  The iovera° system, cleared by the FDA to treat peripheral nerve pain, utilizes its patented Focused Cold Therapy™ delivery system to apply a controlled cold zone via a Smart Tip to specific nerves for precise and predictable pain relief.

“We are pleased that these Bay Area pain specialists are joining the growing ranks of leading facilities in the nation offering the iovera° system for knee pain sufferers,” said Jeff Gold, myoscience President and Chief Operating Officer.  “The iovera° treatment gives physicians the opportunity to safely address their patients’ peripheral nerve pain – the immediate result allows them to see the relief and the subsequent excitement first hand.”

Frequent knee pain affects approximately 25% of adults, limits function and mobility, and impairs quality of life.1 Peripheral nerves treated with the iovera° system stop signaling pain for a set period of time, usually up to 3 months, after which their function is restored.  Because peripheral nerve function is disrupted rather than destroyed, the treatment is safe, effective and temporary.

“iovera° is unique in that it offers safe, highly targeted pain relief right at the peripheral nerve involved in a patient’s pain,” said David Smolins, M.D., Remedy Medical Group.  “It’s exciting to see so many of my patients come in with debilitating knee pain and walk out of my office pain-free after their first iovera° treatment.”

“Our patients are delighted to have the option of a non-invasive, drug-free treatment that specifically targets the area of pain,” said Santi Rao, M.D., California Spine Care.  “We are finding that if patients can avoid or reduce their use of systemic medicines and their side effects, they prefer that option.”

“Our patients are achieving immediate and sustained pain relief which allows them to comfortably pursue and make progress in physical therapy, but also, and perhaps more importantly, get back to the activities that matter most to them,” said Barry Shibuya, M.D, Founder and Medical Director, Fremont Holistic Center.

May 21, 2014 - Read Press Release
Forbes Living Features iovera° by myoscience, Inc.May 20, 2014, St. Petersburg, FL – The producers of Forbes Living are excited to announce that the iovera°® health treatment, an innovative peripheral nerve pain treatment designed by myoscience, Inc., will be featured in an upcoming segment as part of their "Healthy Living" series.  The show is hosted by Forbes Riley, an award-winning TV host in the D2C industry, author, entrepreneur, mother and one of the nation’s leading health and wellness experts.

The primary function of a peripheral nerve is to transmit signals from the spinal cord to the rest of the body, and to return signals sensing things like pain from the rest of the body to the spinal cord. Damage to peripheral nerves can cause severe pain, affecting one's quality of life and emotional well-being.

The team at myoscience has harnessed the healing power of cold to treat peripheral nerves that signal pain.  The iovera° treatment utilizes myoscience’s platform technology, the Focused Cold Therapy™ delivery system, to precisely target peripheral nerves, temporarily interrupting pain signaling pathways. This precise cold treatment causes a reversible nerve block based on a process called Wallerian degeneration that is followed by a predictable restoration of nerve function.  The iovera° system offers patients a new non-habit forming treatment option, with no systemic side effects and nothing being injected into the body. Most patients experience instant pain relief after an iovera° treatment, with results that can last up to three months.

The iovera° treatment is minimally invasive and can be performed inside a physician's office. Patients benefit from an immediate reduction in pain. The average treatment time for one treatment site is approximately 20-30 minutes.

”The opportunity to work with Forbes to educate consumers about this breakthrough pain treatment will be a big step in spreading the word about how the power of cold can treat pain," said Clint Carnell, CEO of myoscience. "We are pleased to be partnering with such a respected program."

Novel pain treatment is now available: iovera° system harnesses the power of cold to block pain REDWOOD CITY, CA (May 01, 2014) – California based myoscience, inc., is pleased to announce the launch of the revolutionary iovera° health treatment, a new option to immediately block pain using the body’s natural response to cold without the use of drugs or surgery.

 

Vinod Dasa, MD, Associate Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery in New Orleans, one of the first to perform the treatment has treated over 50 patients and is excited about the possibilities. “I think this technology has the potential to change the current paradigm of acute and chronic pain management.  The patients that I have treated are all grateful to have an option that is very safe and that has allowed them to get back to functionality quickly.”

 

Clint Carnell, CEO of myoscience, has witnessed the powerful patient outcomes “It’s rewarding to provide this revolutionary treatment to patients suffering from pain. We have developed a product that delivers a treatment that is safe, effective and most importantly free of the negative systemic side effects often common with today’s therapeutic options.”

 

The iovera° health treatment utilizes myoscience’s platform technology, the Focused Cold TherapyTM delivery system, to precisely target peripheral nerves, temporarily interrupting pain signaling pathways. This precise cold treatment causes a reversible nerve block based on a process called 2nd degree degeneration that is followed by a predictable restoration of nerve function.  The iovera° system offers patients a new treatment option, with no systemic side effects and nothing being injected into the body. Most patients experience instant pain relief after an iovera° treatment, with results that can last up to three months.

Vancouverites looking for natural beauty 

New cosmetic treatment iovera° uses body’s natural response to cold to smooth forehead wrinkles
Survey reveals over half of Vancouverites would consider non-surgical cosmetic treatment
30-35 age group most concerned with looking younger


Vancouver, April 2014 - A survey conducted by new cosmetic wrinkle treatment iovera°® has found that there is a growing desire among Vancouverites for more natural beauty products and treatments.  Two thirds of respondents (67%) said that they have become more aware of the ingredients in cosmetics and beauty products in the last two years.  While quality (58%) and price (51%) are important, natural ingredients (39%) ranked highly on factors influencing purchasing decisions.

 

The iovera° treatment provides a new option for people who want to treat their dynamic forehead wrinkles but who are uncomfortable or unsuitable for existing treatments which use a toxin.  The effects of the 20 minute procedure targets forehead lines precisely using the Focused Cold TherapyTM delivery system. The Focused Cold Therapy delivery system is an advanced technology that works immediately and relaxes facial muscles that cause wrinkles without leaving any toxins or chemicals behind in the body. The effects of the treatment last up to 3 months.

 

The survey of more than 500 Vancouverites found that appearance matters with the majority (80%) of those questioned admitting they put a great deal or quite a lot of effort into looking their best.  72% of women surveyed claimed they would be unlikely to go out and meet friends without doing their hair and makeup.  They are not alone, as 62% of men would not go out without doing their hair.

 

Living and looking healthy is also important to Vancouverites. Nine out of ten (90%) of those polled said they would like to lead a healthier lifestyle and many will check the label for artificial ingredients and preservatives in foods (73%) and beauty (60%) products.

 

Ultimately people would like to look younger (72%) and healthier (86%) and just over half (54%) said they would consider a non-surgical cosmetic treatment to smooth forehead lines and wrinkles.

 

Dr. Charles Cheng, MD at Skin Matters and iovera° trained doctor said, "The iovera° system provides instant gratification for those seeking a non-toxin option for wrinkle prevention and reduction.  This technology shows incredible promise and should prove to become one of the leading choices in wrinkle treatment for doctors and patients alike.”

 

76% of respondents who would consider a cosmetic wrinkle treatment find the idea of a treatment, which uses the body’s natural response to cold more appealing, compared to one in nine (11%) that find a treatment, which uses a toxin more appealing.  Fear of looking fake, plastic or unnatural is the biggest fear among those who would not consider such a treatment.

 

Clint Carnell, CEO of myoscience who developed the iovera° treatment in California, is positive about the growing interest being shown for the treatment in Canada: “The iovera° technology enables physicians to treat using only the power of cold which is an appealing option for many.”

 

“We developed iovera˚ in partnership with some of the world’s leading physicians. There is powerful consumer demand for the treatment because it offers an immediate wrinkle solution without the use of a toxin,” says Clint.

iovera° wins Spark Design Award 
REDWOOD CITY, CA (November 20th, 2013) – Myoscience is pleased to announce that the design for the iovera° system has won top honors in the Spark International design competition. The iovera° system was awarded the highest honor (Spark!) in the category of product design, which is a general category that includes medical devices as well as consumer electronics, cookware, and even sports equipment.  Myoscience collaborated with LUNAR to design the iovera° system. “We’re honored to have worked with myoscience to design a beautiful and effective device that will help improve the quality of life for countless people,” says Jeff Salazar at LUNAR.

 

The Spark Awards are given based on two primary criteria: the design innovation and creativity, and the impact it will have on quality of life. The iovera° system is a new take on the safe and reliable use of cold in medicine; by miniaturizing and refining the delivery system to be smaller and more precise, the treatments can be tailored to specific indications. The iovera° system has already improved the quality of life for many who have been treated, immediately reducing pain and enabling people to return to their favorite activities as well as smoothing forehead wrinkles for improved appearance.

 

The iovera˚ system, developed by myoscience, inc. in California, harnesses the power of cold using Focused Cold TherapyTM, the advanced technology that powers the device. The iovera° treatment works immediately for both health and beauty applications without leaving any toxins or chemicals behind in the body. iovera° is approved in the European Union and Canada for the treatment of wrinkles, and is used for the treatment of pain in the United States.

 

“We designed the iovera° system to be sophisticated and intuitive,” says myoscience CEO Clint Carnell. “It has only one button and fits ergonomically in the physician’s hand. Our talented team of engineers and the team of designers at LUNAR who worked hard to ensure we created a product that is not only beautiful to look at, but delivers an elegant result that will immediately ease pain or reduce wrinkles. I am very proud of my team at myoscience who made this concept into a reality.”

REDWOOD CITY, CA (September 17, 2013) – myoscience is pleased to announce that the iovera° treatment is now available from the Vancouver Cosmetic Medicine and Dermatology Clinic, Doctors Alastair and Jean Carruthers and Doctor Shannon Humphrey. 

“We are so pleased to work with leading physicians who have numerous published papers on the seminal work done with neurotoxins,” says Clint Carnell, CEO of myoscience. “The Carruthers were instrumental in the development of neurotoxins for cosmetic use and now they have chosen to help bring iovera° to market in Canada and the rest of the world.” 

The iovera° treatment is a toxin-free alternative for patients that want to improve their appearance and desire immediate results with nothing left behind in their body. iovera° utilizes Focused Cold TherapyTM , a true platform technology, to stimulate the body’s natural response to cold, temporarily relaxing the muscles that cause wrinkles and block pain signals.  The treatment for dynamic wrinkles has been available in the European Union since March of 2013.

Doctor Jean Carruthers feels iovera˚ will be an important new tool for doctors that want to offer patients options, “We are all familiar with the safety and efficacy of cosmetic neuromodulation using neurotoxins. The iovera˚ technology is a totally new approach to reducing wrinkles by treating nerves with cold. After some months, the nerves recover and retreatment may be desired." Doctor Shannon Humphrey is enthusiastic to be one of the first to offer the iovera˚ treatment, “iovera provides us with a new alternative to treat forehead wrinkles in a natural way that provides immediate results, something we feel many patients will find appealing.”

Myoscience Closes $33 Million Series D FinancingFunds to commercialize first indication of platform Focused Cold Therapy for forehead wrinkles

REDWOOD CITY, CA, March 21, 2012 – Venture-backed myoscience, Inc. announced that it closed on $33 million in Series D financing and anticipates a second tranche of up to $12 million dollars due to significant interest in the investment community. Myoscience is committed to making its platform technology, focused cold therapy (FCT), the pre-eminent treatment for conditions involving nerves. The company will use the proceeds of the current financing round to commercialize the first indication in Europe, which is a treatment to reduce ‘dynamic facial lines,’ more commonly referred to as forehead wrinkles. Toxin-free FCT is uniquely positioned to expand the aesthetic market for treatment of dynamic facial lines currently addressed by neurotoxins.

Myoscience’s strategy is to establish FCT as a platform technology for multiple indications, starting with the treatment of dynamic facial lines. The company then plans to expand the technology into therapeutic indications for the focal treatment of pain and muscle disorders. The company believes the addressable aesthetic market is approximately $2 billion while the market for the focal treatment of pain and muscle disorders may be up to $9 billion.

“Our financing was significantly oversubscribed -- a marker, we believe, of our company’s significant progress this year and potential in the near future,” said Clint Carnell, myoscience President & CEO. “We look forward to commercializing our aesthetic indication in Europe, and believe that our natural, nontoxin approach will expand the entire category by pulling toxin-averse patients off the sidelines and into the doctor’s office. With the platform complete we can now work with physicians to develop nonaddictive, non-injectable treatments for various therapeutic applications in pain and muscle disorders, an equally exciting and compelling market for our unique technology.”

The Series D financing included the following existing investors: Accuitive Medical Ventures, American Equities Overseas, DeNovo Ventures, Medicis Capital, Nexus Medical Partners, Saratoga Ventures, and Valiance.

Myoscience received CE Mark clearance and its Canadian market license in December 2011 for temporary treatment of wrinkles and the treatment of pain. The company recently submitted a 510k application for the treatment of pain with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and will shortly begin to enroll subjects in a pivotal trial to support FDA clearance for treatment of wrinkles. The technology is presently cleared in the U.S. for treatment of peripheral pain syndromes and use in general tissue ablation.

The talk show will feature the iovera°® health treatment, an innovative peripheral nerve pain treatment that uses the power of cold.







Forbes Living

Forbes Living is a great opportunity to educate consumers about this breakthrough pain treatment.


Past News ReleasesRSS



St. Petersburg, FL (PRWEB)
May 20, 2014
 The producers of Forbes Living are excited to announce that the iovera°® health treatment, an innovative peripheral nerve pain treatment designed by myoscience, Inc., will be featured in an upcoming segment as part of their "Healthy Living" series. The show is hosted by Forbes Riley, an award-winning TV host in the D2C industry, author, entrepreneur, mother and one of the nation’s leading health and wellness experts.
The primary function of a peripheral nerve is to transmit signals from the spinal cord to the rest of the body, and to return signals sensing things like pain from the rest of the body to the spinal cord. Damage to peripheral nerves can cause severe pain, affecting one's quality of life and emotional well-being. 
The team at myoscience has harnessed the healing power of cold to treat peripheral nerves that signal pain. The iovera° treatment utilizes myoscience’s platform technology, the Focused Cold Therapy™ delivery system, to precisely target peripheral nerves, temporarily interrupting pain signaling pathways. This precise cold treatment causes a reversible nerve block based on a process called Wallerian degeneration that is followed by a predictable restoration of nerve function. The iovera° system offers patients a new non-habit forming treatment option, with no systemic side effects and nothing being injected into the body. Most patients experience instant pain relief after an iovera° treatment, with results that can last up to three months.
The iovera° treatment is minimally invasive and can be performed inside a physician's office. Patients benefit from an immediate reduction in pain. The average treatment time for one treatment site is approximately 20-30 minutes.
”The opportunity to work with Forbes to educate consumers about this breakthrough pain treatment will be a big step in spreading the word about how the power of cold can treat pain," said Clint Carnell, CEO of myoscience. "We are pleased to be partnering with such a respected program."  
Forbes Living features the revolutionary iovera° treatment for peripheral nerve pain developed by myoscience.  For more information about the iovera° treatment, please visit http://www.ioverahealth.com.
