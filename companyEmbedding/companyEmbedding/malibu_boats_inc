Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Our market share remains at record levels and our best-in-class operations continue to drive strong margins.




	Malibu's leadership delivering new product to market continues, led by the strength of demand for our new boats for 2017 as well as innovations and features that surpass the competition. In addition, our new product platform is generating demand and we have every confidence this trend will continue into the foreseeable future.




	Mr. Springer continued, "We are pleased to see the slight rebound in Canada this year despite currency rates being high and the oil and gas environment still soft. Demand in other parts of the world remain soft and we expect that those areas will remain flat. However, we are confident that North America will continue to grow, with the U.S. domestic market leading the way.”

	Comparison of the


	Third


	 Quarter Ended


	March 31, 2017


	 to the


	Third


	 Quarter Ended


	March 31, 2016




	Net sales for the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 increased


	$8.6 million


	, or


	12.6%


	, to


	$77.1 million


	 as compared to the three months ended


	March 31, 2016


	. Included in net sales for each of the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	March 31, 2016


	 were net sales of


	$5.5 million


	, attributable to our Australian business. Unit volume for the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 increased


	99


	 units, or


	10.4%


	, to


	1,054


	 units as compared to the three months ended


	March 31, 2016


	 driven by demand for our new models such as the Malibu Wakesetter 21 VLX and 22 and 24 MXZs. Net sales per unit increased


	2.0%


	 to


	$73,196


	 per unit for the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 compared to the three months ended


	March 31, 2016


	, primarily driven by year over year price increases and lower discount activity, offset by a mix shift to our new Response and 21 VLX models. Net sales per unit in the U.S. increased


	1.2%


	 to


	$72,749


	 for the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 compared to the three months ended


	March 31, 2016


	.




	Cost of sales for the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 increased


	$5.7 million


	, or


	11.3%


	, to


	$55.8 million


	 as compared to the three months ended


	March 31, 2016


	. The increase in cost of sales was driven primarily by increased volumes, higher labor costs per unit, and an increase in warranty expense. Included in cost of sales were $0.1 million in costs related to our engines vertical integration initiative.




	Gross profit for the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 increased


	$3.0 million


	, or


	16.1%


	, to


	$21.4 million


	 compared to the three months ended


	March 31, 2016


	. The increase in gross profit was due mainly to higher volumes. Gross margin for the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 increased 80 basis points from


	26.9%


	 to


	27.7%


	 over the same period in the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross margin was driven primarily by lower material cost per unit, offset by increases in labor and warranty expense.

	Selling and marketing expenses for the three month period ended


	March 31, 2017


	 increased


	$0.2 million


	 or


	13.7%


	, compared to the three months ended


	March 31, 2016


	. As a percentage of sales, selling and marketing expenses were flat over the same period. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 increased


	$1.5 million


	, or


	34.4%


	, to


	$6.0 million


	 as compared to the three months ended


	March 31, 2016


	, largely due to an increase in legal expenses incurred in connection with ongoing litigation matters as well as higher incentive compensation and development costs associated with our engines vertical integration initiative which we initiated in fiscal year 2017.




	Operating income for the


	third


	 quarter of fiscal


	2017


	 increased to

	Forward Looking Statements




	This press release includes forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995). Forward-looking statements can be identified by such words and phrases as “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “estimates,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “continue” and similar expressions, comparable terminology or the negative thereof, and includes the statement in this press release regarding the expected demand and outlook for our product.




	Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to: general industry, economic and business conditions, demand for our products, changes in consumer preferences, competition within our industry, our reliance on our network of independent dealers, our ability to manage our manufacturing levels and our large fixed cost base, the successful introduction of our new products, and other factors affecting us detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Many of these risks and uncertainties are outside our control, and there may be other risks and uncertainties which we do not currently anticipate because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions at the time made, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be achieved. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation (and we expressly disclaim any obligation) to update or supplement any forward-looking statements that may become untrue because of subsequent events, whether because of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. Comparison of results for current and prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.

	Use and Definition of Non-GAAP Financial Measures




	This release includes the following financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income. These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should also not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computations of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.




	We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash, non-recurring or non-operating expenses, including certain professional fees, acquisition and integration related expenses, non-cash compensation expense and certain product development costs. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of net income as determined by GAAP. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are useful because they allow management to evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods, capital structure and non-recurring or non-operating expenses. We exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures, the methods by which assets were acquired and other factors.




	We define Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income as net income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc. (i) excluding income tax expense, (ii) excluding the effect of non-recurring or non-cash items, (iii) assuming the exchange of all Units ("LLC Units") of Malibu Boats Holdings, LLC (the "LLC") into shares of Class A Common Stock, which results in the elimination of non-controlling interest in the LLC, and (iv) reflecting an adjustment for income tax expense on fully distributed net income before income taxes (assuming no income attributable to non-controlling interests) at our estimated effective income tax rate. Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure because it represents net income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc, before non-recurring or non-cash items and the effects of non-controlling interests in the LLC. We use Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. We believe Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes non-cash or non-recurring items, and eliminates the variability of non-controlling interest as a result of member exchanges of LLC Units into shares of Class A Common Stock. In addition, because Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income is susceptible to varying calculations, the Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income measures, as presented in this press release, may differ from and may, therefore, not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.




	A reconciliation of our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and of our net income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc. to Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income is provided under "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures".

	 For fiscal year 2016, we identified an immaterial error related to the understatement of deferred tax assets and paid in capital attributable to a book to tax difference in our investment in the LLC. The correction of this error resulted in an increase in deferred tax assets of $1,796 with a corresponding increase for the same amount in additional paid in capital within stockholder's equity on the audited consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.

Malibu Boats, Inc. Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Results


Feb 1, 2017

Download this Press Release ()


LOUDON, TN -- (Marketwired) -- 02/01/17 --  Malibu Boats, Inc. (NASDAQ: MBUU) today announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 ended December 31, 2016.

Highlights for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2017


Net sales increased 11.8% to $67.7 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
Unit volume increased 6.6% to 924 boats compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
Net sales per unit increased 4.9% to $73,226 and net sales per unit in the U.S. increased 4.4% to $75,710 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Gross profit increased 12.2% to $17.8 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Net income increased 35.3% to $7.7 million, or $0.39 per share compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 22.0% to $13.6 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
Adjusted fully distributed net income increased 26.5% to $7.4 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
Adjusted fully distributed net income per share increased 26.7% to $0.38 on a fully distributed weighted average share count of 19.3 million shares of Class A Common Stock as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

Jack Springer, Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Malibu had a very good quarter with all of our key metrics: units, revenue, gross profit, net income and Adjusted EBITDA performing above expectations and prior year. While we continue to face international demand challenges, our business in the United States continues to be strong and factors here indicate that strength is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
"Malibu's new product continues to be a critical driver of our success. Our new boats drive the market generating demand while our new features and innovations have made us the market leader. Together, these factors will allow us to further separate ourselves from our competition."
Mr. Springer continued, "We still believe that international demand will be a challenge due to the strength of the U.S. dollar among other reasons and do not expect to see relief in the near term. We believe demand in international markets will probably be flat for fiscal 2017 when compared to the prior year while domestic markets remain strong and continue to grow. This should be propelled by our strong product, the strength of our distribution network, the effects of continued precipitation in the Western U.S., and a business environment that we see as being better for our customers and dealers."

Comparison of the Second Quarter Ended December 31, 2016 to the Second Quarter Ended December 31, 2015

Net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2016 increased $7.2 million, or 11.8%, to $67.7 million as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015. Included in net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were net sales of $6.2 million and $5.4 million, respectively, attributable to our Australian business. Unit volume for the three months ended December 31, 2016 increased 57 units, or 6.6%, to 924 units as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015 driven by demand for our new models such as the Malibu Wakesetter 22 and 24 MXZ. Net sales per unit increased 4.9% to $73,226 per unit for the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015, primarily driven by a mix shift to Malibu, including our newer models, which carry a higher average selling price than our Axis brand, year over year price increases, and lower discount activity, offset by increased rebate expense associated with our new rebate program for model year 2017. 
Cost of sales for the three months ended December 31, 2016 increased $5.2 million, or 11.7%, to $49.8 million as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cost of sales was driven primarily by increased volumes and higher material content per unit associated with the mix shift to Malibu. Included in cost of sales were $0.1 million in costs related to our engine vertical integration initiative.
Gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2016 increased $1.9 million, or 12.2%, to $17.8 million compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015. The increase in gross profit was due mainly to higher volumes. Gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2016 increased 10 basis points from 26.2% to 26.3% over the same period in the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross margin was driven primarily by mix of new models, year over year price increases, less discounting, partially offset by higher rebate expense attributable to our new rebate program and warranty expense related to our expanded warranty period of coverage.
Selling and marketing expenses for the three month period ended December 31, 2016 were $2.2 million, slightly lower than selling and marketing expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of sales, selling and marketing expenses decreased 40 basis points to 3.2% over the same period. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2016 decreased $0.7 million, or 17.6%, to $3.5 million as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015, largely due to a decrease in the Marine Power litigation judgment following our appeal of the verdict and court ruling amending the judgment from $3.3 million to $1.9 million in December 2016. We had initially taken a charge relating to the original judgment for $3.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016. Excluding the change in the Marine Power litigation judgment, general and administrative expenses increased $0.6 million mainly due to increased legal expenses in connection with our on-going litigation matters as well as product development activities in connection with our engines vertical integration initiative, offset by lower stock compensation expense associated, in part, with share-based equity awards granted in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 increased to $11.7 million from $9.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 35.3% to $7.7 million while net income margin increased to 11.4% from 9.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 22.0% to $13.6 million from $11.2 million, while Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 20.1% from 18.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

Forward Looking Statements

This press release includes forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995). Forward-looking statements can be identified by such words and phrases as "believes," "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "estimates," "may," "will," "should," "continue" and similar expressions, comparable terminology or the negative thereof, and includes the statement in this press release regarding the expected demand and outlook for our product.
Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to: general industry, economic and business conditions, demand for our products, changes in consumer preferences, competition within our industry, our reliance on our network of independent dealers, our ability to manage our manufacturing levels and our large fixed cost base, the successful introduction of our new products, and other factors affecting us detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Many of these risks and uncertainties are outside our control, and there may be other risks and uncertainties which we do not currently anticipate because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions at the time made, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be achieved. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation (and we expressly disclaim any obligation) to update or supplement any forward-looking statements that may become untrue because of subsequent events, whether because of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. Comparison of results for current and prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.

Use and Definition of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This release includes the following financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income. These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should also not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computations of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash, non-recurring or non-operating expenses, including certain professional fees, acquisition and integration related expenses, non-cash compensation expense and certain product development costs. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of net income as determined by GAAP. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are useful because they allow management to evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods, capital structure and non-recurring or non-operating expenses. We exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures, the methods by which assets were acquired and other factors.
We define Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income as net income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc. (i) excluding income tax expense, (ii) excluding the effect of non-recurring or non-cash items, (iii) assuming the exchange of all Units ("LLC Units") of Malibu Boats Holdings, LLC (the "LLC") into shares of Class A Common Stock, which results in the elimination of noncontrolling interest in the LLC, and (iv) reflecting an adjustment for income tax expense on fully distributed net income before income taxes (assuming no income attributable to non-controlling interests) at our estimated effective income tax rate. Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income is a non-GAAP financial measure because it represents net income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc, before non-recurring or non-cash items and the effects of noncontrolling interests in the LLC. We use Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. We believe Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes non-cash or non-recurring items, and eliminates the variability of noncontrolling interest as a result of member exchanges of LLC Units into shares of Class A Common Stock. In addition, because Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income is susceptible to varying calculations, the Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income measures, as presented in this release, may differ from and may, therefore, not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
A reconciliation of our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and of our net income attributable to Malibu Boats, Inc. to Adjusted Fully Distributed Net Income is provided under "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures".
