Merrill Lynch Hedge Fund Investors Offered Opportunity To Exit The Endowment Fund With Substantial Losses
Posted: March 7th, 2014
According to recent SEC filings, the Endowment Master Fund LP, has offered investors an exit strategy from the hedge fund offering a new fund through a Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) which will be used to liquidate the Fund.  The Endowment Master Fund, LP was marketed heavily by Wall Street firms, including Merrill Lynch.  The PPM describes the Offer as a like-kind exchange of investors’ pro-rata interest of the portfolio holdings into a new PMF Fund, LP.   According to the SEC filings, dated February 20, 2014, “the PMF Fund, LP and the Endowment Master Fund, LP will be managed differently, with the PMF Fund, LP managed for purposes of orderly liquidation.”
For investors, the Offer provides little certainty because investors must choose whether to liquidate now without knowing the true value of the Fund which will be determined at a later date.  `The Offer for the like-kind exchange expires March 19, 2014 which requires more than a leap of faith for investors in a hedge fund that has languished far behind the market returns.  Investors must make an investment decision without knowledge of the value exchanged and how much will be realized during the liquidation period.  According to the New York Times article, After Weak Returns, the Endowment Fund Limits Withdrawals, the hedge fund, “began to struggle in 2011, suffering losses of about 4.1 percent, after fees, compared with a gain of 2.5 percent by the S&P 500.”
 On February 24, 2014, a Thomson Reuters article underscores the effects of the substantial hedge fund costs on the Funds dismal performance, “Even for investors who stay with the fund, there will be high costs.  They will not be permitted to ask for any money back this year.  They will also be charged a 1 percent management fee and a 1 percent servicing fee.  On top of that there will be the fund’s underlying managers’ 1.3 percent management fee and a 16 percent of profits as an incentive fee.”  The article points to the hedge fund underperformance in 2013, “with the fund earning only 2.08 percent last year, dramatically trailing the Standard & Poor’s 32 percent gain.”  For Merrill Lynch customer’s, “If investors accessed the Endowment Fund through Merrill Lynch they will have paid as much as a 2.5 percent upfront charge.”
With these costs in mind, retail investors are discovering that these fees and costs can evaporate any real or potential profits they can earn.  Retail investor liquidity concerns make investments in the Endowment Fund suitable only when they have long enough investment time horizon over multiple market cycles.  Because of the uncertainties outlined in the PMF Fund PPM, investors who were advised to invest in the hedge fund now appreciate the risks associated with illiquidity when the funds experience such under performance.  Full-service brokerage firms such as Merrill Lynch are responsible for conducting adequate due diligence concerning the investment vehicles they recommend and whether these investments are suitable for their customers.  However, with multiple layers of fees, costs and incentive bonuses, these alternative investments are quickly becoming Wall Street’s favorite investment products to sell.
The Silver Law Group has Martindale Hubbell “AV” Preeminent Peer Review™ rated lawyers committed to the advocacy of investor rights who suffered from unsuitable investment advice, including investment losses from hedge funds such as the Endowment Master Fund, LP.  If you are interested in learning more about your investment options or your legal rights, you are encouraged to contact our law firm for a free consultation.

I.
General  A. Statement of Purpose 
The Endowment Master Fund, L.P., The Endowment Registered Fund, L.P., The Endowment TEI Fund, L.P., The Endowment Institutional Fund, L.P., The
Endowment Institutional TEI Fund W, L.P., The Endowment PMF Master Fund, L.P., PMF Fund, L.P. and PMF TEI Fund, L.P. (each, a “Fund,” and, together, the “Funds”); and Salient Capital, L.P., the placement agent for each Fund (the
“Placement Agent”) (the Funds and the Placement Agent are each a “Company” and together the “Companies”) each hold their directors, general partners, officers, employees and service providers to a high standard of
integrity and business practices. The Companies strive to avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest in connection with transactions in securities for the Funds. 
The Companies recognize that the knowledge of present or future portfolio transactions and, in certain instances, the power to influence
portfolio transactions in securities that may be possessed by certain of their directors, general partners, officers and employees could place such individuals, if they engage in personal transactions in securities that are eligible for investment
by a Fund, in a position where their personal interests may conflict with the interests of the Fund.
 The Companies also recognize that The
Endowment PMF Master Fund, L.P. (the “PMF Master Fund”), PMF Fund, L.P. and PMF TEI Fund, L.P. (collectively, the “PMF Funds”) will be managed in a passive manner whereby the PMF Master Fund will hold to self-liquidation private
equity and other similarly illiquid interests in Investment Funds and oversee the liquidation of other Investment Funds that provide for redemption while managing the PMF Master Fund’s cash to ensure the Master Fund’s ability to satisfy
outstanding capital commitments relating to such portfolio holdings.  In view of the foregoing and of the provisions of Rule 17j-1 under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“1940 Act”)1 each Company has determined to adopt this Code of Ethics (“Code”) to identify and prohibit certain types of
transactions deemed to create conflicts of interest (or at least the potential for or the appearance of such a conflict) and to establish reporting requirements and enforcement procedures. This document constitutes the Code required by Rule 17j-1
for the Companies.   


1 
Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act makes it unlawful for investment company personnel and other “Access Persons” to engage in “fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative” practices in connection with their
personal transactions in securities when those securities are held or to be acquired by an investment company. The Rule also requires every investment company, the investment company’s investment adviser, and, in certain cases, the investment
company’s placement agent to adopt a Code of Ethics containing provisions “reasonably necessary to prevent” such prohibited practices. 


B. Statement of General Principles 
The following general principles should guide the actions of Access Persons (as defined below) in evaluating and engaging in personal
securities transactions:
 1. The interests of the Funds’ shareholders are paramount. Access Persons must conduct themselves and their
operations to give maximum effect to this tenet by assiduously placing the interests of the shareholders before their own.  2. All personal
transactions in securities by Access Persons must be accomplished so as to avoid even the appearance of a conflict with the interests of the Funds and their shareholders.

3. Access Persons must avoid actions or activities that allow (or appear to allow) a person to profit or benefit from his or her position with
respect to the Funds, or that otherwise bring into question the person’s independence or judgment.  This Code does not attempt to
identify all possible conflicts of interest, and literal compliance with each of the specific procedures will not shield a person from liability for personal trading or other conduct that violates any fiduciary duty to a Fund’s shareholders. In
addition to the specific prohibitions contained in this Code, each person covered by this Code is subject to a general requirement not to engage in any act or practice that would defraud a Fund’s shareholders. 
C. Applicability of Code 
The requirements of this Code are not applicable to any Access Person of a Fund who is subject to a separate code of ethics adopted by the
Adviser or a Sub-Adviser of the Fund, provided that: (1) such Code of Ethics complies with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and has been approved by the Fund’s Board; and (2) such Adviser or Sub-Adviser has certified
to the Board of the Fund that it has adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons from violating such code of ethics.   


II.
Definitions  For purposes of this Code, the following terms have the meanings set forth as follows:

A. “Access Person” means:

1. any director, officer or general partner of a Fund, and any Advisory Person of a Fund’s investment adviser (“Adviser”) or any
sub-adviser (“Sub Adviser”)2 and
  


2 
If the Adviser or Sub-Adviser’s primary business is advising funds or advisory clients, all of the Adviser’s or Sub-Adviser’s directors, officers, and general partners are presumed to be Access Persons of
the Fund. If the Adviser or a Sub-Adviser is primarily engaged in a business other than advising funds or advisory clients, “Access Person” means any director, officer, general partner or Advisory Person of the Adviser or a Sub-Adviser
who, with respect to the Fund for which such entity acts as Adviser or Sub-Adviser, makes any recommendation, participates in determining which recommendations shall be made, or whose principal function or duties relate to determining which
recommendations shall be made or who, in connection with his or her duties, obtains any information concerning securities recommendations being made by such Adviser or Sub-Adviser. 


2. any director, officer or general partner of the Placement Agent who, in

the ordinary course of business, makes, participates in or obtains information regarding a Purchase or Sale of Covered Securities for the Funds
or whose functions or duties as part of the ordinary course of business relate to the making of any recommendation to the Funds regarding any Purchase or Sale of Covered Securities.

B. “Advisory Person” means: 
1. any director, officer, general partner or employee of the Adviser or a Sub-Adviser (or of any company in a Control relationship to a Fund,
the Adviser or a Sub-Adviser) who, in connection with his or her regular functions or duties, makes, participates in, or obtains information regarding the Purchase or Sale of a Covered Security by the Fund or whose functions relate to the making of
any recommendations with respect to such Purchases or Sales; and
 2. any natural person in a Control relationship to a Fund, Adviser or
Sub-Adviser who obtains information concerning recommendations made to the Fund with regard to the Purchase or Sale of a Covered Security by the Fund.

3. For purposes of clarity, Unaffiliated Directors of a Fund are not Advisory Persons.

C. “Affiliated Person” of another person shall mean:

1. any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, 5 per centum or more of the outstanding voting
securities of such other person;  2. any person 5 per centum or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly
owned, controlled, or held with power to vote, by such other person;  3. any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or
under common control with, such other person;
 4. any officer, director, partner, copartner, or employee of such other person; and

5. with respect to a Fund, the Adviser and any Sub-Adviser.

D. “Automatic Investment Plan” means a program in which regular periodic purchases (or withdrawals) are made automatically in
(or from) investment accounts in accordance with a predetermined schedule and allocation. An Automatic Investment Plan includes a dividend reinvestment plan.

E. “Board” means a Fund’s Board of Directors. 


F. “Beneficial Ownership” is to be determined in the same manner as it is
determined for purposes of Rule 16a-1(a)(2) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This means that a person should generally consider himself or herself the beneficial owner of any securities of which he or she shares in the profits, even if he
or she has no influence on voting or disposition of the securities; but does not include securities held by limited partnerships where the person is not aware of such security holding and has no control or discretion as to its disposition.

G. “Control” shall have the same meaning as that set forth in Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act. Section 2(a)(9)
defines “control” as the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company, unless such power is solely the result of an official position with such company. Ownership of more than 25% of a
company’s outstanding voting securities is presumed to give the holder thereof control over the company.  H. “Covered
Security” has the same meaning as that set forth in Rule 17j-1(a)(4), which defines the term very broadly, but excludes direct obligations of the U.S. government, bankers’ acceptances, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper,
high quality short-term debt instruments (including repurchase agreements), and shares issued by a registered open-end investment company. 
I. “Disinterested Director” means a director of a Fund who is not an “interested person” of the Fund within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act.  J. “Initial Public Offering” means an offering of securities registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), the issuer of which, immediately before the registration, was not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  K. “Investment Fund” has the same meaning as set forth in a Fund’s private
placement memorandum.  L. “Investment Personnel” means:

1. Any employee of a Fund, the Adviser or a Sub-Adviser (or of any company in a Control relationship to the Fund, the Adviser or a Sub-Adviser)
who, in connection with his or her regular functions or duties, makes or participates in making recommendations regarding the purchase or sale of securities by the Fund.

2. Any natural person who controls a Fund, the Adviser or a Sub-Adviser and who obtains information concerning recommendations made to the Fund
regarding the purchase or sale of securities by the Fund.
 3. For purposes of clarity, Unaffiliated Directors of a Fund are not Investment
Personnel.
 M. “Limited Offering” means an offering that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to
section 4(2) or 4(6) or pursuant to rule 504, rule 505, or rule 506 under the Securities Act.
 N. “Purchase or Sale of a Covered
Security” means obtaining or disposing of Beneficial Ownership of that Covered Security and includes, among other things, the writing of an option to purchase or sell a Covered Security.



P. “Review Officer” shall mean the Fund’s Chief Compliance Officer
(“CCO”), or any other person charged with the responsibility, at any given time, to pre-clear trades, grant exceptions to prohibitions under the Code, receive reports and notices required by this Code to be generated, and to accomplish any
other requirement of this Code.  1. A person may be designated by a Board or the CCO as a Review Officer of a Fund (or the CCO may
undertake the responsibility of serving as the Review Officer) for purposes of this Code without otherwise formally carrying that title or the responsibility for functions otherwise generally associated with the responsibilities of a compliance
officer.
 2. The Review Officer may delegate certain functions as appropriate.

Q. “Security held or to be Acquired by a Fund” shall mean

1. Any Covered Security which, within the most recent 15 days:

(a) Is or has been directly held by the Fund; or

(b) Is being or has been considered by the Fund or the Adviser for purchase by the Fund; and

2. Any option to purchase or sell, and any security convertible into or exchangeable for, a Covered Security.

3. Specifically excluded from this definition are any Covered Securities in which the Fund has no investment discretion and that the Fund has
no current knowledge are being held on its behalf (i.e., an investment by the Fund in an Investment Fund) for which the manager of the Investment Fund has full discretion to buy or sell securities without consultation or input from the Fund).
 R. “Unaffiliated Director” means a director of a Fund that is a Disinterested Director or a person that is not an
affiliated person of the Adviser or the Placement Agent.
 The CCO of the Funds may provide the Boards with a list of each Security held or
to be Acquired by a Fund on not less than a quarterly basis. The Boards, Access Persons and Advisory Persons are entitled to rely on this list in conducting their personal and business affairs in compliance with the Code. In the event that any such
person breaches the Code due to a misstatement or omission with respect to such list, such person shall not be deemed responsible for such breach, unless he or she had actual knowledge that his or her actions would result in a breach (i.e.,
knew that the security transaction being conducted by such person was a breach of the Code).
  


III.
Approval, Adoption and Administration of Code of Ethics  A. Each Company must:

1. adopt a written Code containing provisions reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons from violating the Code;

2. provide the written Code and any amendments thereto to the Boards; and

3. provide a written certification to the Boards that it has adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons from violating
the Code.



B. The Boards, including a majority of the Disinterested Directors, must approve this Code, as
well as the applicable code of ethics of the Adviser and any Sub-Adviser to a Fund. The Boards must base their approval on a determination that the relevant Code contains provisions reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons from violating the
Code.
 C. Following initial approval of this Code and the code of ethics of the Adviser or any Sub-Adviser to a Fund, any material change
to a Code must be approved by the Board of the Fund, including a majority of the Disinterested Directors thereof and, in the case of the PMF Master Fund, unanimously, within six months of such amendment.

D. No less frequently than annually, each Fund, the Adviser, each Sub-Adviser and the Placement Agent must furnish to the Boards, and the
Boards must consider, a written report that:
 1. Describes any issues arising under the Code or a code of ethics applicable to the Adviser
or Sub-Adviser since the last report to the Boards, including, but not limited to, information about material violations of the code or procedures and sanctions imposed in response to the material violations, summarizes any changes in the procedures
made during the past year, and identifies any recommended changes in existing restrictions or procedures based upon the Funds’, the Adviser’s, the Sub-Adviser’s and the Placement Agent’s experience, evolving industry practice, or
developments in applicable laws and regulations; and  2. Certifies that the Fund, the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser and the Placement Agent, as
applicable, has adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons from violating the Code or a code of ethics applicable to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser (as applicable).

 


IV.
Legal Requirements  A. General Prohibitions 
It is the policy of the Companies that no Access Person, any Affiliated Person of a Fund, or any Affiliated Person of the Adviser or the
Placement Agent, shall engage in any act, practice or course of conduct that would violate the provisions of Rule 17j-1.
 Rule 17j-1(b)
under the 1940 Act provides that the Placement Agent, any Affiliated Person of a Fund, and any Affiliated Person of the Adviser or the Placement Agent, in connection with the purchase or sale, directly or indirectly, by such person of a Security
Held or to be Acquired by the Fund shall not:  1. employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud a Fund;

2. make to the Fund any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state to the Fund a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;



3. engage in any act, practice or course of business that would operate as a fraud or deceit upon
the Fund; or
 4. engage in any manipulative practice with respect to the Fund.

B. Reporting Obligations 
Each Access Person shall file the following reports with the Review Officer. Please note that special provisions apply to Unaffiliated
Directors, as detailed in paragraph B.5 below.
 1. Initial Holdings Report. No later than ten (10) days after the person
becomes an Access Person under this Code, each Access Person (other than a Fund’s Unaffiliated Directors) must provide to the Review Officer an initial holdings report, which is current as of a date no more than 45 days prior to the date the
reporting person becomes an Access Person, containing the following information:  a. The title, number of shares and principal amount of
each Covered Security in which the Access Person had any direct or indirect beneficial ownership when the person became an Access Person;

b. The name of any broker, dealer or bank with whom the Access Person maintained an account in which any securities were held for the direct or
indirect benefit of the Access Person as of the date the person became an Access Person; and
 c. The date that the report is submitted by
the Access Person.
 2. Quarterly Reports. Each Access Person (subject to paragraph B.5 with respect to a Fund’s Unaffiliated
Directors) must provide to the Review Officer, on a quarterly basis, not later than thirty (30) days after the end of the calendar quarter, a report containing the following information: 
a With respect to any transaction during the quarter in a Covered Security in which the Access Person had any direct or
indirect beneficial ownership:
 i. The date of the transaction, the title, the interest rate and maturity date (if applicable) and the
number of shares and the principal amount of each Covered Security involved;
 ii. The nature of the transaction (i.e., purchase, sale or
any other type of acquisition or disposition);
 iii. The price at which the transaction was effected;

iv. The name of the broker, dealer or bank with or through whom the transaction was effected; and

v. The date the report was submitted by the Access Person.

b. With respect to any account established by the Access Person in which any securities were held during the quarter for the direct or indirect
benefit of the Access Person:
 i. The name of the broker, dealer or bank with whom the Access Person established the account;



ii. The date that the report is submitted by the Access Person.

iii. The date the account was established; and

3. Annual Holdings Report. Each Access Person (other than a Fund’s Unaffiliated Directors) must annually provide to the Review
Officer a complete listing of all Covered Securities owned by the Access Person, no later than February 14 of each year, which report must be current as of a date no more than 45 days before the report is submitted. The listing must contain the
following information:  a. The title, number of shares and principal amount of each Covered Security in which the Access Person had any
direct or indirect beneficial ownership;
 b. The name of any broker, dealer or bank with whom the Access Person maintains an account in
which any securities are held for the direct or indirect benefit of the Access Person; and
 c. The date that the report is submitted by
the Access Person.
 4. Annual Certification. All Access Persons shall be required to certify annually that they have received, read
and understand the Code. Further, all Access Persons are required to certify annually that they have complied with the requirements of the Code and that they have disclosed or reported all personal securities transactions required to be disclosed or
reported pursuant to the Code.
 5. Unaffiliated Directors. An Unaffiliated Director is required to complete a quarterly report
only if (i) the Unaffiliated Director knew, or in the ordinary course of fulfilling his or her official duties as a Fund director should have known, that during the 15-day period immediately before or after his or her transaction,
such Covered Security was Purchased or Sold, or considered for Purchase or Sale, by the Fund,3 or (ii) during the relevant quarter, the Unaffiliated Director has engaged in what he or she
believes may be construed as short-term trading in the securities of a registered open-end investment company that is advised by the Adviser or an affiliate of the Adviser. The “should have known” standard implies no duty of inquiry, does
not presume there should have been any deduction or extrapolation from discussions or memoranda dealing with tactics to be employed in meeting any of a Fund’s investment objectives, or that any knowledge is to be imputed because of prior
knowledge of the Funds’ portfolio holdings, market considerations, or the Funds’ investment policies and objectives or investment restrictions. 
C. Exceptions from Reporting Requirements 
An Access Person need not submit:

1. Any report with respect to Covered Securities held in accounts over which the Access Person had no direct or indirect influence or control;
  


3 
This reporting requirement shall not be applicable to securities traded by passively managed index funds 


2. A quarterly report if the report would duplicate information contained in broker trade
confirmations or account statements received by the Funds, the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser or the Placement Agent no later than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter and/or information contained in the Adviser’s, SubAdviser’s,
Placement Agent’s and/or the Funds’ records.  3. Reports otherwise required by this Section, if the Access Person is also an
Access Person of the Adviser or a Sub-Adviser to the Funds, provided that either:
 a. such person submits to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser
forms prescribed by the code of ethics of such Adviser or Sub-Adviser containing substantially the same information as called for in the forms required by this Section; or

b. the information is such report would duplicate information required to be recorded under Rule 204-2(a)(13) under the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940.
 4. A quarterly report with respect to transactions effected pursuant to an Automatic Investment Plan.

 


V.
Pre-Clearance of Securities Transactions  Investment Personnel must obtain approval from the CCO or the
Review Officer before directly or indirectly acquiring Beneficial Ownership of any Covered Security as part of an Initial Public Offering or Limited Offering. Investment Personnel who are subject to the code of ethics of the Adviser or a Sub-Adviser
need not submit to this procedure provided that such person is subject to a similar procedure under such other code of ethics.
  


VI.
Confidentiality  All reports of securities transactions and any other information filed with a Fund
pursuant to this Code shall be treated as confidential. Any such report may contain a statement that the report shall not be construed as an admission by the person making such report that he or she has any direct or indirect beneficial ownership in
the security to which the report relates.
 No Access Person shall reveal to any other person (except in the normal course of his or her duties on behalf
of a Fund) any information regarding securities transactions made or being considered by or on behalf of the Funds.
  


VII.
Review and Enforcement  A. The Review Officer for each Fund, in consultation with other
Review Officers, shall compare all reported personal securities transactions with completed portfolio transactions of each Fund and a list of securities being considered for purchase or sale by each Fund to determine whether a violation of this Code
may have occurred. One test that may be applied in determining whether a violation of the Code has occurred will be to review the securities transactions of Access Persons for patterns of transactions. For example:

1. Any pattern involving parallel transactions (for the Fund and the individual both buying or both selling the same Covered Security) or
opposite transactions (buy/sell or sell/buy) may be analyzed to determine whether the individual’s transaction may have violated the Code. 


2. Among the other factors that may be considered in the analysis are:

a. the number and dollar amount of the transactions;

b. the trading volume of the Covered Security in question;

c. the length of time the Covered Security has been held by the individual; and

d. the individual’s involvement in the investment process. 
It should be noted, however, that a violation could be deemed to have resulted from a single transaction if the circumstances warrant a finding
that the underlying principles of fair dealing have been violated. Before making any determination that a violation has been committed by any person, the Review Officer shall give such person an opportunity to supply additional explanatory material.
 B. If the Review Officer determines that a violation of this Code may have occurred, the Review Officer shall submit his or her written
determination, together with a confidential report and any additional explanatory material provided by the individual, to the CCO (if different from the Review Officer) or the CCO’s delegate and outside counsel to the Funds, who shall make an
independent determination as to whether a violation has occurred.  C. If the CCO (or delegate) and outside counsel to the Funds find that a
violation has occurred, the CCO, in consultation with the Fund’s President, shall impose upon the individual such sanctions as he or she deems appropriate and shall report the violation and the sanction imposed to the Funds’ Boards. 
D. No person shall participate in a determination of (1) whether he or she personally has committed a violation of the Code, or
(2) the imposition of any sanction in the event he or she committed a violation of the Code. If a Covered Securities transaction of the CCO is under consideration, the President of the Funds shall act in all respects in the manner prescribed in
this Code for the CCO.   


VIII.
Records  Each Fund shall maintain records in the manner and to the extent set forth below, which may be
maintained on microfilm or by such other means permissible under the conditions described in Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act or under no-action letters or interpretations under that rule, and shall be available for examination by representatives of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 A. A copy of this Code shall be preserved in an easily accessible place (including for five
(5) years after this Code is no longer in effect).  B. A record of any violation of this Code and of any action taken as a result of
such violation shall be preserved in an easily accessible place for a period of not less than five (5) years following the end of the fiscal year in which the violation occurs. 


C. A copy of each report to the Board and each report, including any information provided in lieu
of the report, made by an Access Person pursuant to this Code shall be preserved for a period of not less than five (5) years from the end of the fiscal year in which it is made, the first two years in an easily accessible place. 
D. A list of all Access Persons who are, or within the past five (5) years have been, required to make reports pursuant to this Code shall
be maintained in an easily accessible place.  E. A record of any decision, and the reasons supporting the decision, to approve the
acquisition by Investment Personnel of securities under Section V of this Code shall be preserved for at least five years after the end of the fiscal year in which the approval is granted, the first two years in an easily accessible place.

 


IX.
Approval, Amendment and Interpretation of Provisions  A. This Code may be amended as
necessary or appropriate with the approval of the Boards including a majority of Disinterested Directors thereof and, in the case of the PMF Master Fund, unanimously.

B. This Code is subject to interpretation by the Boards in their discretion.

Dated: January 16, 2004, as amended July 13, 2010, January 14, 2014 and February 18, 2014.
