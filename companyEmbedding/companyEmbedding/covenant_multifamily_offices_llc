SAN ANTONIO, Feb. 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Covenant Multifamily Offices, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, today announced it has opened its first Oklahoma City location. The announcement comes as the wealth management firm officially closed on the acquisition of Covenant Financial Services, LLC's wealth management practice on February 10. 
Following the acquisition, Covenant expands its growing wealth management company to four locations, with current offices in Dallas, San Antonio, Austin and now Oklahoma City. 
"We are excited to expand into the Oklahoma City marketplace," said John Eadie, Covenant Founder and Managing Director. "The team in Oklahoma City is fantastic and brings additional depth and technical capabilities to Covenant. The acquisition allows Covenant to continue its vision of becoming an enduring wealth management firm." 
Prior to the acquisition, Covenant Financial Services, LLC in Oklahoma City had no working relationship with Covenant Multifamily Offices, LLC – which will obtain exclusive rights to the Covenant name and brand.  
As part of the partnership, Scott Duncan, Founder of Covenant Financial Services, will join Covenant as a Senior Wealth Advisor. 
"From our first conversations a shared passion to meet our clients' financial management objectives based on customized financial planning was evident," said Duncan. "Joining Covenant as the Oklahoma City office, my team becomes part of a deep pool of talent with a broad perspective offering enhanced service opportunities. I'm excited to continue our 35 years of service to our clients as part of Covenant."
Joining Duncan at the Oklahoma City office will be Wealth Advisor Raquel Lopez, Wealth Advisor Oliver Norman along with Senior Client Service Associates Donna Herndon and Executive Assistant Clair Neeley. 
Covenant and its team of veteran wealth advisors passionately invest in each individual client through a goals-based planning approach. The process is rooted in building wealth that leads to a fuller, more meaningful life. Covenant advisors provide insightful, tailored guidance that is unique in the wealth management industry.  
Covenant has experienced significant growth in the previous 12 months as the firm in November opened its third office located at 100 Congress Ave. in Austin, Texas. For more information on Covenant and its services visit www.covenantmfo.com. 
About Covenant Multifamily Offices, LLC
Covenant's promise is in its name. The wealth management firm exists to provide personally tailored financial guidance rooted in the key tenants of lifestyle, legacy and philanthropy.
