Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to Chrysler Capital 
      Auto Receivables Trust (CCART) 2016-B:
    

      --$168,000,000 class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$260,000,000 class A-2 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$220,000,000 class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$82,030,000 class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$29,380,000 class B asset-backed notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$47,460,000 class C asset-backed notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$33,910,000 class D asset-backed notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Limited Performance History: Chrysler Capital (CC) was founded in 2013; 
      thus, performance data are limited and were not utilized by Fitch to 
      determine the base case loss proxy. Fitch utilized conservative 2006 - 
      2008 vintage securitization loss data from the DaimlerChrysler Auto 
      Trust (DCAT) platform to derive a loss proxy for this portion of the 
      pool. The loss proxy has increased relative to 2016-A due to weaker 
      performance observed on outstanding CCART transactions.
    

      Performance Weakening: The Santander Consumer USA Inc. (SC) and CC 
      portfolios, along with CCART securitizations, recorded rising 
      delinquencies and cumulative net losses (CNL) year-over-year (YoY) 
      through 2015 and the second quarter of 2016. Fitch took this into 
      account when deriving the 2016-B proxy. CCART pools have certain prime 
      borrower characteristics, but Fitch classifies the platform as midprime 
      based on historical loss performance to date and, thus, applied midprime 
      loss multiples in its analysis.
    

      Stable CC/SC Receivables Mix: CC originations total 88% of the pool, 
      while core SC nonprime originations total 12%, consistent with recent 
      pools. Fitch utilized conservative nonprime core SC loss data to derive 
      a loss proxy for the core SC portion of the pool.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement (CE): Initial hard CE totals 19.5% for the 
      class A notes, down from 20.0% in 2016-A. CE for the class B through D 
      notes is also marginally lower versus 2016-A. Excess spread is 4.89%, 
      consistent with 2016-A. CE is sufficient to cover Fitch's 5.50% base 
      case proxy and modeled net loss levels for all the notes.
    

      Consistent Collateral Pool: The collateral is fairly consistent with 
      prior pools. The weighted average (WA) FICO score is 712, WA 
      loan-to-value (LTV) is 106% and new vehicles total 73.3%. Commercial 
      contracts, which typically perform stronger than retails contracts, 
      total 9.0% of the pool. The pool's collateral characteristics comprise 
      elements of prime and nonprime consumer credits.
    

      Increasing Extended-Term Loans: Loans with terms of 60-plus months total 
      80.8%, down from 2016-A and prior transactions. However, 73 to 75 month 
      contracts total 21.6% of the pool, the highest level observed to date 
      for the platform. Fitch applied a stress to the loss proxy to account 
      for the risk posed by these loans due to limited performance history and 
      weaker loan attributes and credit quality.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: SC has been profitable each year since 2007, 
      including recent years. Fitch rates Santander, majority owner of SC via 
      Santander Holding USA, Inc. (SHUSA), 'A-/F2'/Stable Outlook.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Along with its CC 
      division, SC demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter 
      and servicer, as evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization 
      performance. Fitch deems SC capable to service this series.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of SC would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions 
      on the notes.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 2016-B to 
      increased credit losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's 
      analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and credit losses. We saw a potential downgrade of 
      one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario, 
      especially for the subordinate bonds. The notes could experience 
      downgrades of up to two rating categories, potentially leading to 
      distressed ratings, under Fitch's severe (2x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or re-computing certain information with respect to 145 retail 
      and 30 commercial receivables from the statistical data file. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis, and the findings did not 
      have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link at the bottom of the related rating action commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in the reports titled 'Chrysler Capital Auto 
      Receivables Asset Trust 2016-B -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated May 31, 2016.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

warranties of the Seller made to the Depositor pursuant to
Section 4.01 or 4.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
The Depositor hereby represents and warrants to the Issuing Entity
that the Depositor has taken no action which would cause such
representations and warranties of the Seller to be false in any
material respect as of the Closing Date. The Depositor further
acknowledges that the Issuing Entity and its permitted assignees
rely on the representations and warranties of the Depositor under
this Agreement and of the Seller under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement in accepting the Receivables and executing and delivering
the Notes and the Certificates. The foregoing representation and
warranty speaks as of the Closing Date, but shall survive the sale,

(b) Covenant with respect to the
Asset Representations Reviewer . The Depositor shall promptly
deliver to the Seller any Asset Representations Review Notice. Each
of the Depositor and the Issuing Entity agrees to cooperate with
the Asset Representations Reviewer, the Servicer and the Seller
with respect to any Asset Representations Review commenced in
accordance with Section 5.17 of the Indenture. Upon receipt of
a final report from the Asset Representations Reviewer, the
Depositor shall review the findings of the Asset Representations
Reviewer and determine whether a breach of a representation or
warranty set forth in Section 4.01 of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement has occurred with respect to any Receivable
tested by the Asset Representations Reviewer and whether a
repurchase or substitution of such Receivable is required pursuant
to Section 2.05(a) .

Section 2.05 Repurchase or
Substitution of Receivables .

(a) Repurchase or Substitution of
Receivables Upon Breach of Warranty .

(i) Upon discovery by the Seller,
the Depositor, the Servicer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee, any Note Owner or any Noteholder of a breach of any of the
representations and warranties in Section 4.01 or
Section 4.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or in
Section 2.04(a) or Section 3.01(b) of this
Agreement that materially and adversely affects the interests of
the Noteholders or the Certificateholders taken as a whole in any
Receivable and which results in any of the Noteholders or the
Certificateholders not being made whole, the party discovering such
breach shall give prompt written notice thereof (each, a “
Repurchase Request ”) to the others; provided
that in the case of a Repurchase Request from the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee, any Note Owner or any Noteholder, such
Repurchase Request shall set forth (i) each Receivable that is
subject to a Repurchase Request, (ii) the specific
representation or warranty contained in Section 4.01 or
Section 4.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement it alleges
was breached, (iii) the loss that occurred as a result of such
breach and (iv) the material and adverse effect of such breach
on the interests of the Noteholders or the Certificateholders taken
as a whole; provided further that with respect to a
Repurchase Request from a Noteholder or a Note Owner, such
Repurchase Request shall initially be provided to the Indenture
Trustee.

(ii) As of the last day of the
second Monthly Period following its discovery or its receipt of
notice of such breach (or, at the Depositor’s election, the
last day of the first Monthly Period following such discovery or
receipt of notice), unless such breach shall have been cured in all
material respects, in the event of a breach of the representations
and warranties made by the Depositor in Section 2.04(a)
or Section 3.01 , the Depositor shall (x) if the
Seller would be required to substitute a Substitute Receivable
pursuant to Section 5.04(a) of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, substitute a Substitute Receivable in exchange for the
related Warranty Receivable, (y) if the Seller would be
required to repurchase the Warranty Receivable pursuant to
Section 5.04(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
repurchase the related Warranty Receivable, or (z) in the
event of a breach of a representation and warranty under Sections
4.01 or 4.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Depositor
and the Servicer shall use reasonable efforts to enforce the
obligation of the Seller under Section 5.04(a) of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement to repurchase or substitute such
Receivable from the Issuing Entity on the related Distribution
Date.
 
4



(iii) The repurchase price to be
paid by the breaching party (the “ Warranty Purchaser
”) shall be an amount equal to the Warranty Payment
calculated as of the last day of the related Monthly
Period.

(iv) With respect to each Substitute
Receivable, the Depositor shall deliver to the Issuing Entity, the
Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee (a) a Second Step
Receivables Assignment related to such Substitute Receivable and
(b) an Officer’s Certificate in the form set forth in
Exhibit C . The Depositor shall have satisfied each of the
following conditions prior to the substitution of a Substitute
Receivable in exchange for a Warranty Receivable:

(1) the Depositor shall agree to
deposit into the Collection Account all collections with respect to
the related Substitute Receivable received since the related
Substitute Cutoff Date within two Business Days after the related
Substitution Date (or such later date as may be permitted under the
Indenture);

(2) as of the Substitution Date,
neither the Seller nor the Depositor is insolvent, nor will either
of them have been made insolvent by the sale of the Substitute
Receivable, nor is either of them aware of any pending insolvency
relating to either of them;

(3) the Schedule of Receivables
shall have been amended to reflect the Substitute Receivable and
the Schedule of Receivables as so amended shall be true and correct
as of the Substitution Date; and

(4) after giving effect to the
substitution of the related Substitute Receivable for the related
Warranty Receivable, the aggregate Principal Balance of all
Substitute Receivables sold to the Issuing Entity shall not exceed
10% of the Initial Aggregate Receivables Principal
Balance.

(v) It is understood and agreed that
the obligation of the Warranty Purchaser to repurchase or
substitute any Receivable as to which a breach has occurred and is
continuing, and the obligation of the Depositor and the Servicer to
enforce the Seller’s obligation to repurchase or substitute
such Receivables pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
shall, if such obligations are fulfilled, constitute the sole
remedy against the Depositor, the Servicer or the Seller for such
breach available to the Issuing Entity, the Financial Parties, the
Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee. The Servicer also
acknowledges its obligations to repurchase Administrative
Receivables from the Issuing Entity pursuant to
Section 3.08 of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.

(b) Unfulfilled Repurchase
Demands . In the event the Depositor fails to, or fails to
cause the Seller to, repurchase or substitute a Receivable pursuant
to Section 2.05(a) within 180 days of the delivery of a
Repurchase Request and such Repurchase Request has not been
resolved, the alleged breach has not otherwise been cured or the
related Receivable has not otherwise been repurchased or
substituted with a Substitute Receivable, the party that provided
the Repurchase Request pursuant to Section 2.05(a) (the
“ Requesting Party ”) may refer the Repurchase
Request to an ADR Proceeding, at its discretion, pursuant to
Section 2.05(c) by
 
5


filing in accordance with AAA Rules and
providing a notice to the Depositor; provided ,
however , that any such referral of a Repurchase Request
shall be made (i) within the applicable statute of limitations
period and (ii) within 30 days of the delivery of the
Repurchase Response Notice indicating that the related Repurchase

customary practices, policies and procedures as it follows with
respect to comparable motor vehicle related receivables that it
services for itself or others, which customary practices, policies

recourse to Dealers, selling the related Financed Vehicle at public
or private sale and the taking of other actions by the Servicer in

procedures that such repair or repossession shall increase the
proceeds of liquidation of the related Receivable by an amount
greater than the amount of such expenses. The Servicer shall be
entitled to receive Liquidation Expenses with respect to each
Liquidating Receivable at such time as the Receivable becomes a

“ Collection Account ”), bearing an additional
designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are
held for the benefit of the Financial Parties.

(ii) The Servicer, for the benefit
of the Noteholders, shall establish and maintain in the name of the
Indenture Trustee an Eligible Deposit Account known as the Capital

additional designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited
therein are held for the benefit of the Noteholders.

(b)

(i) Each of the Designated Accounts
shall be initially established with the Indenture Trustee as the
Account Holder. Funds deposited in each of the Designated Accounts
(including amounts, if any, which the Servicer is required to remit
daily to the Collection Account pursuant to
Section 5.02 ) shall be invested in (a) Investment
Fund A from the period beginning with (and including) the second
Business Day of each calendar month and ending with (and including)

definition of “Eligible Investments”; provided
that neither the Servicer nor the Indenture Trustee shall have the
power or right to change or alter the particular Eligible
Investments identified in the definitions of “Investment Fund
A” or “Investment Fund B” with respect to which
such funds are invested; and provided further that
the Servicer shall provide written notice to the Indenture Trustee,

shall be maintained with an Account Holder even if the short-term
debt obligations of such Account Holder do not have the Required
Deposit Rating, if such Account Holder maintains such Designated
Account in its corporate trust department), the Servicer shall then
provide written notice to the Indenture
 
21


Trustee or other Account Holder instructing the
Account Holder to transfer the Designated Accounts to another
Account Holder that is an Eligible Institution; and provided
further that should the Account Holder inform the Servicer
or Indenture Trustee that no further investments may be made with

Investment in accordance with the definitions of “Investment
Fund A” and “Investment Fund B.” Investments in
Eligible Investments shall be made in the name of the Indenture
Trustee or its nominee, and such investments shall not be sold or
disposed of prior to their maturity, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary provided in this Agreement. Investment Earnings on
funds deposited in the Designated Accounts shall be payable to the
Servicer. Each Account Holder holding a Designated Account as
provided in this Section 5.01(b)(i) , shall be a

Intermediary shall be a Person other than the Indenture Trustee,
the Servicer shall obtain the express agreement of such Person to
the obligations of the Securities Intermediary set forth in this
Section 5.01 and an Opinion of Counsel that such Person
can perform such obligations.

(ii) With respect to the Designated
Account Property, the Account Holder agrees, by its acceptance
hereof, that:

(A) Any Designated Account Property
that is held in deposit accounts shall be held solely in Eligible
Deposit Accounts. The Designated Accounts are accounts to which
Financial Assets will be credited.

underlying any Financial Assets credited to the Designated Accounts
shall be registered in the name of the Securities Intermediary,
indorsed to the Securities Intermediary or in blank or credited to
another securities account maintained in the name of the Securities
Intermediary and in no case will any Financial Asset credited to
any of the Designated Accounts be registered in the name of the
Issuing Entity, the Servicer or the Depositor, payable to the order
of the Issuing Entity, the Servicer or the Depositor or specially
indorsed to the Issuing Entity, the Servicer or the Depositor
except to the extent the foregoing have been specially indorsed to
the Securities Intermediary or in blank.

treated as a “financial asset” within the meaning of
Section 8-102(a)(9) of the New York UCC.

(E) If at any time the Securities
Intermediary shall receive any order from the Indenture Trustee
directing transfer or redemption of any Financial Asset relating to
the Designated Accounts, the Securities Intermediary shall comply
with such order without further consent by the Issuing Entity, the
Servicer, the Depositor or any other Person.
 
22



(F) The Designated Accounts shall be
governed by the laws of the State of New York, regardless of any
provision in any other agreement. For purposes of the UCC, New York
shall be deemed to be the Securities Intermediary’s
jurisdiction and the Designated Accounts (as well as the Security
Entitlements related thereto) shall be governed by the laws of the
State of New York.

(G) The Securities Intermediary has
not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement will
not enter into, any agreement with any other Person relating to the
Designated Accounts or any Financial Assets or other property
credited thereto pursuant to which it has agreed to comply with
entitlement orders (as defined in Section 8-102(a)(8) of the
New York UCC) of such other Person and the Securities Intermediary
has not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement
will not enter into, any agreement with the Issuing Entity, the
Depositor, the Servicer, the Account Holder or the Indenture
Trustee purporting to limit or condition the obligation of the
Securities Intermediary to comply with entitlement orders as set
forth in Section 5.01(b)(ii)(E) hereof.

(H) Except for the claims and
interest of the Indenture Trustee in the Designated Accounts, the
Securities Intermediary has no actual knowledge of claims to, or
interests in, the Designated Accounts or in any Financial Asset
credited thereto. If any other Person asserts any Lien, encumbrance
or adverse claim (including any writ, garnishment, judgment,
warrant of attachment, execution or similar process) against the
Designated Accounts or in any Financial Asset carried therein, the
Securities Intermediary will promptly notify the Indenture Trustee,
the Servicer and the Issuing Entity thereof.

(I) The Securities Intermediary will
promptly send copies of all statements, confirmations and other
correspondence concerning the Designated Accounts and any
Designated Account Property simultaneously to each of the Servicer
and the Indenture Trustee, at the addresses set forth in
Appendix B to this Agreement.

(J) The Account Holder shall
maintain each item of Designated Account Property in the particular
Designated Account to which such item originated and shall not
commingle items from different Designated Accounts.

(iii) The Servicer shall have the
power, revocable by the Indenture Trustee (or by the Owner Trustee
with the consent of the Indenture Trustee) to instruct the
Indenture Trustee to make withdrawals and payments from the
Designated Accounts for the purpose of permitting the Servicer or
the Owner Trustee to carry out its respective duties hereunder or
permitting the Indenture Trustee to carry out its duties under the
Indenture.

(iv) The Indenture Trustee shall
possess all right, title and interest in and to all funds on
deposit from time to time in the Designated Accounts and in all
proceeds thereof (except Investment Earnings). Except as otherwise
provided herein or in the Indenture, the Designated Accounts shall
be under the exclusive dominion and control of the Indenture
Trustee for the benefit of the Securityholders and the Indenture
Trustee shall have sole signature power and authority with respect
thereto.
 
23



(v) The Servicer shall not direct
the Account Holder to make any investment of any funds or to sell
any investment held in any of the Designated Accounts unless the
security interest granted and perfected in such account shall
continue to be perfected in such investment or the proceeds of such
sale, in either case without any further action by any Person, and,
in connection with any direction to the Account Holder to make any
such investment or sale, if requested by the Indenture Trustee, the
Servicer shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel, acceptable to the Indenture Trustee, to such
effect.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, neither the Servicer nor any agent of
the Servicer shall be authorized or empowered to acquire any other
investments or engage in activities other than specifically
provided herein, and, in particular, neither the Servicer nor any
agent of the Servicer shall be authorized or empowered to do
anything that would cause the Issuing Entity to fail to qualify as
a grantor trust for United States federal income tax
purposes.

(d) The Indenture Trustee, the Owner
Trustee, the Securities Intermediary, the Account Holder and each
other Eligible Institution with whom a Designated Account is
maintained waives any right of set-off, counterclaim, security
interest or bankers’ lien to which it might otherwise be
entitled.

Obligors on the Receivables and all Liquidation Proceeds within two

foregoing, if a Monthly Remittance Condition is unsatisfied, the
Servicer may utilize an alternative remittance schedule (which may
include a remittance schedule utilized by the Servicer at a time
when the Monthly Remittance Conditions were satisfied), if the
Servicer provides to the Indenture Trustee written confirmation
from the Rating Agencies that such alternative remittance schedule
will not result in the downgrading or withdrawal by the Rating
Agencies of the ratings then assigned to the Notes or the
Certificates. At all times when all Monthly Remittance Conditions
are satisfied, the Servicer shall remit collections received during
a Monthly Period to the Collection Account in immediately available
funds on or before the related Distribution Date.

Earnings and Supplemental Servicing Fees . The Servicer shall
be entitled to receive all Investment Earnings and Supplemental

any account established hereunder. To the extent that any such
amount shall be held in any account held by the Indenture Trustee
or the Owner Trustee, or otherwise established hereunder, such
amount will be withdrawn therefrom and paid to the Servicer upon
presentation of a certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of

interests) of which is owned directly or indirectly by General
Motors or Ally Financial and which is otherwise servicing the
Depositor’s receivables, which corporation, limited liability
company or other entity in any of the foregoing cases executes an
agreement of assumption to perform every obligation of the Servicer
under this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, shall
be the successor to the Servicer under this Agreement and the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement without the execution or filing of
any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties to
this Agreement, anything in this Agreement or in the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding. The Servicer
shall provide notice of any merger, consolidation or succession
pursuant to this Section 6.02 to the Rating
Agencies.

Section 6.03 Limitation on
Liability of Servicer and Others .

(a) Neither the Servicer nor any of
the directors or officers or employees or agents of the Servicer
shall be under any liability to the Issuing Entity, the Noteholders
or the Certificateholders, except as specifically provided in this
Agreement and in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, for any
action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action
pursuant to this Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
the Indenture or the Trust Agreement or for errors in judgment;
provided , however , that this provision shall not
protect the Servicer or any such Person against any liability that
would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance, bad
faith or negligence (except errors in judgment) in the performance
of duties or by reason of reckless disregard of obligations and
duties under this Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
the Indenture, the Trust Agreement or any other Basic
 
26


Document. The Servicer and any director, officer
or employee or agent of the Servicer may rely in good faith on the
advice of counsel or on any document of any kind prima facie
properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any
matters arising under this Agreement or the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.

(b) The Servicer and any director or
officer or employee or agent of the Servicer shall be reimbursed by
the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, as applicable, for any
contractual damages, liability or expense (including any obligation
of the Servicer to the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, as
applicable, pursuant to Section 6.01(a)(iv)(x) or
(y) ) incurred by reason of such trustee’s willful
misfeasance, bad faith or negligence (except errors in judgment)
(gross negligence in the case of the Owner Trustee) in the
performance of such trustee’s duties under this Agreement,
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture or the Trust
Agreement or by reason of reckless disregard of its obligations and
duties under this Agreement. In no event, however, shall the
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee be liable to the Servicer
for any damages in the nature of special, indirect or consequential
damages, however styled, including lost profits.

(c) Except as provided in this
Agreement or in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Servicer
shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend
any legal action that is not incidental to its duties to service
the Receivables in accordance with this Agreement and the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement and that in its opinion may involve it in
any expense or liability; provided , however , that
the Servicer may undertake any reasonable action that it may deem
necessary or desirable in respect of this Agreement or the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties to
this Agreement or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the
interests of the Noteholders and the Certificateholders under this
Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the interests of
the Noteholders under the Indenture and the interests of the
Certificateholders under the Trust Agreement. In such event, the
legal expenses and costs for such action and any liability
resulting therefrom shall be expenses, costs and liabilities of the
Issuing Entity and the Servicer shall be entitled to be reimbursed
therefor.

(d) The Applicable Trustee shall
distribute out of the Collection Account on a Distribution Date any
amounts permitted for reimbursement pursuant to
Section 6.03(c) not therefor reimbursed;
provided , however , that the Applicable Trustee
shall not distribute such amounts if the amount on deposit in the
Reserve Account (after giving effect to all deposits and
withdrawals pursuant to Sections 4.06(b) and (c) , on
such Distribution Date) is greater than zero but less than the
Specified Reserve Account Balance for such Distribution
Date.

Section 6.04 Delegation of
Duties . So long as Ally Financial acts as Servicer, the
Servicer may, at any time without notice or consent, delegate any
duties under this Agreement or under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement to any corporation or other Person 25% or more of the
voting stock (or, if not a corporation, other voting interests) of
which is owned, directly or indirectly, by General Motors or Ally
Financial. The Servicer may at any time perform specific duties as
Servicer through sub-contractors who are in the business of
servicing motor vehicle related receivables; provided, however,
that no such delegation or sub-contracting shall relieve the
Servicer of its responsibility with respect to such
duties.
 
27



Section 6.05 Servicer Not to
Resign . Subject to the provisions of Section 7.02
, the Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties
imposed on it by this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement as Servicer except upon determination that the
performance of its duties under this Agreement or under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, as the case may be, is no longer
permissible under applicable law. Any such determination permitting
the resignation of the Servicer shall be evidenced by an Opinion of
Counsel to such effect delivered to the Indenture Trustee and the
Owner Trustee. If, at the time of resignation, a successor Servicer
has not accepted appointment as Servicer, the Indenture Trustee
shall assume the responsibilities and obligations of the Servicer
in accordance with Section 7.02 .

ARTICLE VII

DEFAULT

Section 7.01 Servicer
Defaults . Each of the following shall constitute a
“Servicer Default”:

(a) any failure by the Servicer to
deliver to the Indenture Trustee for deposit in any of the
Designated Accounts any required payment or to direct the Indenture
Trustee to make any required distributions therefrom, which failure
continues unremedied for a period of five (5) Business Days
after written notice is received by the Servicer from the Indenture
Trustee or the Owner Trustee or after discovery of such failure by
an officer of the Servicer;

(b) failure on the part of the
Servicer to duly observe or perform in any material respect any
other covenants or agreements of the Servicer set forth in this
Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture or
the Trust Agreement which failure (i) materially and adversely
affects the rights of Noteholders or Certificateholders, and
(ii) continues unremedied for a period of ninety
(90) days after the date on which written notice of such
failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given
to the Servicer by the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, or
to the Servicer and to the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee
by Noteholders whose Notes evidence not less than 25% of the
Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Class as of the close of the
preceding Distribution Date or if no Notes are Outstanding, by
Certificateholders whose Certificates evidence not less than 25% of
the Voting Interests as of the close of the preceding Distribution
Date;

(c) the entry of a decree or order
by a court or agency or supervisory authority having jurisdiction
in the premises for the appointment of a conservator, receiver or
liquidator for the Servicer, in any insolvency, readjustment of
debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings,
or for the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the
continuance of any such decree or order unstayed and in effect for
a period of ninety (90) consecutive days; or

(d) the consent by the Servicer to
the appointment of a conservator or receiver or liquidator in any
insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and
liabilities, or similar proceedings of or relating to the Servicer
or of or relating to substantially all of its property; or the
Servicer shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts
generally as they become due, file a petition to take advantage of
any applicable insolvency or reorganization statute, make an
assignment for the benefit of its creditors or voluntarily suspend
payment of its obligations.
 
28



Notwithstanding the foregoing, there
shall be no Servicer Default where a Servicer Default would
otherwise exist under clause (a)  above for a period of
an additional ten (10) Business Days or under clause
(b)  for a period of an additional sixty (60) days if
the delay or failure giving rise to the Servicer Default was caused
by an act of God or other similar occurrence. Upon the occurrence
of any of these events, the Servicer shall not be relieved from
using its best efforts to perform its obligations in a timely
manner in accordance with the terms of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and this Agreement, and the Servicer shall provide the
Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Depositor and the
Securityholders prompt notice of the failure or delay by it,
together with a description of its efforts to so perform its
obligations.

Section 7.02 Consequences of
a Servicer Default . If a Servicer Default shall occur and be
continuing, either the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders whose
Notes evidence not less than a majority of the Outstanding Amount
of the Controlling Class as of the close of the preceding
Distribution Date (or, if the Notes have been paid in full and the
Indenture has been discharged in accordance with its terms, by the
Owner Trustee or the Majority Certificateholders as of the close of
the preceding Distribution Date) by notice then given in writing to
the Servicer and the Owner Trustee (and to the Indenture Trustee if
given by the Noteholders or the Certificateholders) may terminate
all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer under this
Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. On or after the
receipt by the Servicer of such written notice, all authority and
power of the Servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, whether with respect to the Notes, the
Certificates or the Receivables or otherwise, shall pass to and be
vested in the Indenture Trustee pursuant to and under this
Section 7.02 . The Indenture Trustee is hereby
authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the
Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents
and other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or
things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such
notice of termination, whether to complete the transfer and
endorsement of the Receivables and related documents, or otherwise.
The Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Indenture Trustee and the
Owner Trustee in effecting the termination of the responsibilities
and rights of the Servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, including the transfer to the Indenture
Trustee or the Owner Trustee for administration by it of all cash
amounts that shall at the time be held by the Servicer for deposit,
or that shall have been deposited by the Servicer in the Collection
Account, or the Note Distribution Account or thereafter received
with respect to the Receivables that shall at that time be held by
the Servicer.

Section 7.03 Indenture
Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor . On and after the
time the Servicer receives a notice of termination pursuant to
Section 7.02 , the Indenture Trustee shall be the
successor in all respects to the Servicer in its capacity as
servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and the transactions set forth or provided for in this
Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and shall be
subject to all the responsibilities, restrictions, duties and
liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms
and provisions of this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement. As compensation therefor, the Indenture Trustee shall be
entitled to such compensation (whether payable out of the
Collection Account or otherwise) as the Servicer would have been
entitled to under this Agreement if no such notice of termination
had been given including the Basic Servicing Fee, Investment
Earnings and Supplemental Servicing Fees. Notwithstanding the
above, the Indenture Trustee may, if it shall be unwilling so to
act, or shall, if it is legally unable so to act, appoint, or
petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, a successor
(i) having a
 
29


net worth of not less than $100,000,000,
(ii) which has a long term unsecured debt rating that falls
within an investment grade category by S&P Global Ratings and
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or is otherwise acceptable to
S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.
and (iii) whose regular business includes the servicing of
motor vehicle related receivables, as the successor to the Servicer
under this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement in the
assumption of all or any part of the responsibilities, duties or
liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement and the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement. In connection with such appointment and
assumption, the Indenture Trustee may make such arrangements for
the compensation of such successor out of payments on Receivables
as it and such successor shall agree; provided, however, that no
such compensation shall be in excess of that permitted the Servicer
under this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The
Indenture Trustee and such successor shall take such action,
consistent with this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession.
Costs associated with the resignation of the Servicer and the
appointment of a successor Servicer will be paid by the Indenture
Trustee from amounts in the Trust Estate.

Section 7.04 Notification to
Noteholders and Certificateholders . Upon any termination of,
or appointment of a successor to, the Servicer pursuant to this
Article VII, the Indenture Trustee shall give prompt written notice
thereof to the Noteholders and the Depositor, who promptly shall
provide such notice to the Rating Agencies, and the Owner Trustee
shall give prompt written notice thereof to the
Certificateholders.

Section 7.05 Waiver of Past
Defaults . Noteholders whose Notes evidence not less than a
majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Class as of
the close of the preceding Distribution Date (or, if all of the
Notes have been paid in full and the Indenture has been discharged
in accordance with its terms, the Majority Certificateholders as of
the close of the preceding Distribution Date) may, on behalf of all
Noteholders and Certificateholders, waive any default by the
Servicer in the performance of its obligations hereunder and its
consequences, except a default in making any required deposits to
or payments from any of the Designated Accounts in accordance with
this Agreement. Upon any such waiver of a past default, such
default shall cease to exist, and any Servicer Default arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose
of this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. No such
waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair
any right consequent thereon.

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION

Section 8.01 Optional
Purchase of All Receivables; Insolvency of the Depositor;
Termination of Trust .

(a)

(i) The Servicer shall have the
option to purchase the assets of the Issuing Entity (other than the
Designated Accounts) as of any date (the “ Optional
Purchase Date ”) which is the last day of any Monthly
Period as of which the Aggregate Receivables Principal Balance is
the Optional Purchase Percentage or less of the Initial
Aggregate
 
30


Receivables Principal Balance. To exercise such
option, the Servicer shall (A) furnish to the Issuing Entity
and the Indenture Trustee notice of its intention to exercise such
option and of the Optional Purchase Date (such notice to be
furnished not later than twenty-five (25) days prior to the
Distribution Date related to such Optional Purchase Date) and
(B) deposit in the Collection Account when required pursuant
to clause (ii)  below an amount equal to the greater of
(a) the remaining unpaid Principal Balance of the Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, and any accrued and unpaid Basic
Servicing Fee payments, and (b) the unpaid Aggregate
Receivables Principal Balance plus accrued and unpaid
interest.

(ii) The Servicer shall make such
deposit set forth in clause (i)(B) above in immediately
available funds on the Distribution Date related to the Optional
Purchase Date, except that if any Monthly Remittance Condition is
not satisfied on the Optional Purchase Date, such deposit shall
instead be made on the Optional Purchase Date.

Fitch to Rate Chrysler Capital Auto Receivables Trust 2016-B
Tweet


Print



      Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings to Chrysler 
      Capital Auto Receivables Trust (CCART) 2016-B (2016-B):
    

      --$168,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$260,000,000 classes A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$220,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$82,030,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$29,380,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$47,460,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$33,910,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Limited Performance History: CC was founded in 2013; thus, performance 
      data are limited and were not utilized by Fitch to determine the base 
      case loss proxy. Fitch utilized conservative 2006 - 2008 vintage 
      securitization loss data from the DaimlerChrysler Auto Trust (DCAT) 
      platform to derive a loss proxy for this portion of the pool. The loss 
      proxy has increased relative to 2016-A due to weaker performance 
      observed on outstanding CCART transactions.
    

      Performance Weakening: The SC and CC portfolios, along with CCART 
      securitizations, recorded rising delinquencies and cumulative net losses 
      (CNL) year-over-year (YoY) through 2015 and the second quarter of 2016. 
      Fitch took this into account when deriving the 2016-B proxy. CCART pools 
      have certain prime borrower characteristics, but Fitch classifies the 
      platform as midprime based on historical loss performance to date and, 
      thus, applied midprime loss multiples in its analysis.
    

      Stable CC/SC Receivables Mix: CC originations total 88% of the pool, 
      while core SC nonprime originations total 12%, consistent with recent 
      pools. Fitch utilized conservative nonprime core SC loss data to derive 
      a loss proxy for the core SC portion of the pool.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement (CE): Initial hard CE totals 19.5% for the 
      class A notes, down from 20.0% in 2016-A. CE for the class B through D 
      notes is also marginally lower versus 2016-A. Excess spread is expected 
      to be 4.73%, consistent with 2016-A. CE is sufficient to cover Fitch's 
      5.50% base case proxy and modeled net loss levels for all the notes.
    

      Consistent Collateral Pool: The collateral is fairly consistent with 
      prior pools. The WA FICO score is 712, WA LTV is 106% and new vehicles 
      total 73.3%. Commercial contracts, which typically perform stronger than 
      retails contracts, total 8.8% of the pool. The pool's collateral 
      characteristics comprise elements of prime and nonprime consumer credits.
    

      Increasing Extended-Term Loans: Loans with terms of 60-plus months total 
      80.6%, down from 2016-A and prior transactions. However, 73-75 month 
      contracts total 21.2% of the pool, the highest level observed to date 
      for the platform. Fitch applied a stress to the loss proxy to account 
      for the risk posed by these loans due to limited performance history and 
      weaker loan attributes and credit quality.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: SC has been profitable each year since 2007, 
      including recent years. Fitch rates Santander, majority owner of SC via 
      SHUSA, 'A-'/'F2'/Stable Outlook.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Along with its CC 
      division, SC demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter 
      and servicer, as evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization 
      performance. Fitch deems SC capable to service this series.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of SC would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions 
      on the notes.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 2016-B to 
      increased credit losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's 
      analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and credit losses. We saw a potential downgrade of 
      one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario, 
      especially for the subordinate bonds. The notes could experience 
      downgrades of up to two rating categories, potentially leading to 
      distressed ratings, under Fitch's severe (2x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or re-computing certain information with respect to 145 retail 
      and 30 commercial receivables from the statistical data file. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis, and the findings did not 
      have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link at the bottom of the related rating action commentary 
      (RAC).
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in the reports titled 'Chrysler Capital Auto 
      Receivables Asset Trust 2016-B -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated May 31, 2016.

      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may
