Helga Houston Named Huntington’s Chief Risk Officer




Replaces retiring Kevin Blakely at year end






August 18, 2011 06:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Huntington Bank (NASDAQ: HBAN; www.huntington.com) 
      announced today that Helga Houston is joining the bank as chief risk 
      officer, replacing Kevin Blakely when he retires at year end. She will 
      join Huntington’s leadership team and report to Stephen D. Steinour, 
      chairman, president and chief executive officer of Huntington.
    


      Houston has 30 years of diversified banking experience in risk 
      management, business development and client relationships. She currently 
      serves as a partner with Phoenix Global Advisors in Charlotte, NC. Prior 
      to that, she held executive positions with Bank of America for 20 years, 
      most recently as its global consumer and small business risk and 
      compliance executive. She brings Huntington additional risk management 
      experience in wealth and investment management, corporate and investment 
      banking and commercial real estate finance. Earlier in her career, 
      Houston held positions in real estate with Crocker National Bank and 
      Home Federal Savings and Loan.
    

      “Strong risk management is key to creating a long-term financial 
      performance culture. Over the last three years, we have made significant 
      investments in people and technology that have strengthened our risk 
      identification and management policies and processes. Helga brings us 
      broad-based experience in a variety of risk management roles that allows 
      us to continue to promote a strong risk management culture. Her 
      leadership will support our disciplined growth strategy and enhance our 
      executive team,” said Steinour.
    

      Houston earned her bachelor’s degree from Westmont College and her MBA 
      from the University of Southern California. She has served as a board 
      member and then the vice chair of the Risk Management Association.
    

      Houston will succeed Kevin Blakely, who will retire at year end after 
      almost 40 years in banking and three years at Huntington during which he 
      led the building of a strong risk management culture and helped return 
      the bank to a solid footing.
    

      “Kevin played an integral role in helping to turn the bank around. His 
      hard work and leadership leave us well prepared for long-term growth and 
      success,” said Steinour.

I’ve been in my current role as Chief Risk Officer for four years. I lead a 380-member team responsible for enterprise risk management, compliance and legal and work closely with the business segment leaders in their strategy execution. In my role, I interact regularly with the Board of Directors and bank regulators.
I’ve been in the financial services industry for 33 years, including 22 years with Bank of America serving as risk executive for global consumer and small business banking and for global wealth and investment management.
I was first introduced to RMA in 2005 when I was a risk executive at Bank of America and have had the privilege of serving on the RMA board during two timeframes – 2005 to 2009 and from 2012 to present. 
RMA plays an invaluable role in the continued development of risk management professionals, providing members with current in-depth reviews and analyses of risk-related legislation, regulatory actions, and industry activities.
Without a doubt, RMA has been instrumental in my career development. Through the round table discussions, I have gained valuable insights from industry peers, which has helped me bring best practices to my company and team. In addition, RMA welcomes and encourages participation, and, as a result, I have been able to serve in leadership roles as well as join committees where expertise and ideas are exchanged. The RMA board meetings and council meetings have been important resources for staying connected with peers on industry issues while also moving forward the agenda for RMA.
RMA is a respected advocate for the financial services industry. RMA’s strong credibility with the regulators enables it to be a meaningful voice on behalf of the industry. 
The relationships I’ve made through RMA and the knowledge and insights I’ve gained through my RMA involvement have enabled me to learn from others to strengthen the risk management practices in my current role at Huntington.
