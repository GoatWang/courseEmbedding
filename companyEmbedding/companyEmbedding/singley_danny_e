Danny Singley
Psychologist, Dads
Official "Ask the Expert"

Danny is a consultant and licensed clinical psychologist specializing in men’s issues as well as a father of two young children. Teaching classes for new fathers is a natural fit for him because Danny loves teaching, working with men in a “guy-friendly” way, and was a new dad just a few years ago. Danny lives in San Diego and his professional duties include a private practice involving psychotherapy with individuals, couples, and groups as well as research consulting with a variety of organizations. He is also the Past Chair of the San Diego Psychological Association’s Men’s Issues Committee and the current Chair of the American Psychological Association’s Section on Positive Psychology. In his free time, Danny enjoys surfing, scuba diving, reading, and taking his kids on hikes to places where they can get dirty and throw rocks.
