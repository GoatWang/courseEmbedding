  What type of case do you have? The most common cases are listed below. Call toll-free 877.333.6675 to confirm that you qualify.







Auto Accident


Workers Comp


Civil Rights


Construction Negligence


FELA (Railroad)


General Negligence 


Jones Act (Maritime)


Motor Vehicle and  Passenger Injury


Pedestrian Injury


Premises Negligence  (Slip and Fall)


Workplace Negligence


Wrongful Death













Auto Accident
Many auto accident claims do not settle quickly. Being injured is bad enough, but if you’re unable to work, life becomes that much harder. As bills pile up, people often feel pressure to settle their cases early for less than the fair value. An Oasis Financial cash lifeline gives you and your attorney breathing room, so you’re not forced to take the defendant’s first offer. 




Workers Comp
Almost half of all work place injuries are serious enough to cause the employee to miss work or require ongoing medical care. Worker’s Compensation laws were created to protect injured workers by providing for medical care, compensation for lost wages related to the injury and rehabilitation and/or retraining if necessary. 

Because paying these claims can be costly, employers don’t always believe they are legitimate, creating undue delays in resolving them. In addition, defendants often don’t even make an initial offer. They want to pay zero—more reason than ever to give your attorney time to win a fair settlement.*

 
*Oasis does not work with Workers Compensation cases in Alaska, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, or Wyoming.




Civil Rights
These claims can result from a wide variety of discriminatory misconduct, including misconduct regarding age, disability, pregnancy, race and religious discrimination—as well as different types of harassment charges. While the actions prompting these claims may not leave a person with a physical injury, they can cause significant stress for the claimant and their family—negatively impacting the family’s financial situation. Civil rights cases often take years to settle.




Construction Negligence
The reality of construction litigation is that even with an experienced lawyer and a well-documented case, the legal process can move slowly. Defendants aren’t likely to step up and provide a quick resolution with a fair award. More commonly, the defendant will offer a small amount, hoping the claimant is financially needy enough to take it.




FELA (Railroad)
Similar to Workers Comp, the Federal Employer’s Liability Act (FELA) provides compensation for railroad workers injured on the job. Almost any worker employed by a railroad company, even those whose primary responsibilities are not performed in or around trains, is protected under the FELA. 

The degree of negligence the plaintiff must show under the FELA (usually due to the railroad, its employees or an equipment manufacturer) is actually less than “no fault” Workers Comp. However, FELA requires a higher burden of proof by the courts than Workers Comp, so FELA litigation can last much longer.




General Negligence 
Negligence lawsuits cover a broad range of specific complaints including: animal bites, amusement park injuries, bicycle and pedestrian accidents, plus homeowner and nursing home negligence. Since these cases are expensive and time-consuming to defend, the defendant will probably want to settle quickly, but that rarely means the amount offered will be fair.




Jones Act (Maritime)
Like FELA described above, the Jones Act was signed into law to protect maritime workers involved in accidents while at work. As you would expect, claimants must prove that their employers were negligent or “at fault.” 

However, “comparative fault” is involved here. if the employer can prove that the plaintiff’s actions contributed to or caused the accident, the amount of the award can be reduced accordingly. This clause is why nearly all employers will immediately blame plaintiffs for their own accidents—and why these cases can take so long to settle.




Motor Vehicle and  Passenger Injury
See Auto Accident




Pedestrian Injury
Did you know that, on average, a pedestrian is injured every seven minutes?** Collisions with motor vehicle or bicycles, or injuries due to unsafe conditions, can happen anytime. If you’ve sustained injuries through another party’s negligence, you may already know that the legal process moves slowly, even with a strong case.
 
**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 2012, Pedestrian Safety, “How big is the problem.”





Premises Negligence  (Slip and Fall)
If you were injured on another’s property and the property owner failed to warn you of the possible hazard, the owner may be found negligent and liable. Premise liability lawsuits encompass a wide range of accidents, but “slip and fall” cases are the most common. 

This type of injury can occur on private or public property and can be caused by uneven or cracked sidewalks, poorly lit pathways, slippery or unbalanced floors, potholes, ripped carpet or rugs, and even bad weather.




Workplace Negligence
A job-related injury is typically covered by Workers Comp insurance. However, if the injury involved negligence on the part of the employer, a fellow employee or a product, tool or machine produced by a third party, a workplace negligence lawsuit may be filed. These are often handled outside of the state-specific Workers Comp “no-fault” claims process.

Since these cases are not considered “no fault,” it is the claimant’s burden to prove that the other party is liable. This can lead to a long, contentious fight.




Wrongful Death
There are no words to describe the loss of a loved one, especially due to a senseless accident caused by the actions or negligence of someone else. In addition to taking a terrible emotional toll on those left behind, the wrongful death of a loved one can also create significant financial hardships.













 If you lose, you don’t have to pay us back.
 Our share of the case's potential proceeds varies according to several factors. Pay nothing out of pocket—payment comes out of the award or settlement amount. Owe nothing if you don't win your case. 













  How to Qualify Checklist Say “yes” to the 2 statements below and you’ve met the initial requirements. Final approval is subject to our underwriting standards. We tend to fund 5-10% of the value of your claim (this is part part of the approval process).

Oasis is the premier operator in the Williston Basin, possessing both coveted assets and creative people that drive the success of the Company.  We are on the forefront of technology deployment, operational efficiencies, and infrastructure development.  Our 333,000 net acres in the Williston Basin are highly concentrated and are prospective for the Bakken, Three Forks and other potential horizons.   As we develop this acreage position that is in the heart of the play, we expect to increase long-term shareholder value while maintaining a conservative balance sheet.  We have a long history of acquiring and exploiting oil and gas assets; which has been characterized by capital discipline coupled with differential views of the market.  While we have a great track record of rapidly growing production and reserves, we do not subscribe to the idea of growth at any cost.

Operations

We are an independent exploration and production company focused on the acquisition and development of unconventional oil and natural gas resources. We have accumulated approximately 506,000 net leasehold acres in the Williston Basin. We are currently focused on exploiting what we have identified as significant resource potential from the Bakken and Three Forks formations, which are present across a substantial majority of our acreage. A report issued by the United States Geologic Survey, or USGS, in April 2008 classified these formations as the largest continuous oil accumulation ever assessed by it in the contiguous United States. We believe the location, size and concentration of our acreage creates an opportunity for us to achieve cost, recovery and production efficiencies through the large-scale development of our project inventory.

Current operations[edit]
The company develops unconventional oil and natural gas oilfields in the Bakken formation and Three Forks Shale of Montana and North Dakota.[2]
As of December 31, 2016, the company had 305 million barrels of oil equivalent (1.87×109 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 78% was petroleum and 22% was natural gas.[1]
History[edit]
In 2007, the company was founded by Thomas B. Nusz and Taylor L. Reid and bought 175,000 net acres and 1 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (6,100 GJ) per day of production in Williston, North Dakota for $83 million. In 2008, the company bought an additional 131,000 net acres and 1.1 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (6,700 GJ) per day of production nearby for $54 million.[3]
In 2010, the company became a public company via an initial public offering which raised over $400 million. [2]
The company raised additional equity and debt in 2012-2015 to expand operations.[3]
Controversies[edit]
Employee death[edit]
An employee on one of the company's oilfields, hired via a contractor named Carlson Well Service, died due to an accident. The company paid an undisclosed amount in a settlement to his family.[4]

(NYSE:OAS) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Oasis Petroleum: 15% Production Growth At $55 OilFeb.28.17 | About: Oasis Petroleum (OAS) Elephant Analytics Long/short equityMarketplaceDistressed Value InvestingSummaryOasis' exit rate is expected to grow by around 16% in 2017 and 15% in 2018 while spending within cash flow.Oil production growth is expected to be a couple percent lower, but still strong.Oil differentials should narrow due to the completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline.Strong Wild Basin performance allows Oasis to be a lower-cost producer.Value estimate increases by $1 to $14 to $18 per share. Oasis Petroleum's (OAS) 2017 guidance shows a company with positive momentum as the strong performance of its Wild Basin wells helps it raise its projected 2017 exit rate from 70,000 BOEPD to 72,000 BOEPD and its projected 2018 exit rate from over 80,000 BOEPD to over 83,000 BOEPD. This production growth is expected to be achieved with neutral to positive cash flow at current strip prices. As well, Oasis expects to benefit from the completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline, resulting in its oil differential decreasing from $4.76 per barrel in 2016 to around $3 to $4 in 2017 and perhaps $3 or under in 2018. I have bumped up my estimate of Oasis's value by a dollar, putting it now at $14 to 18 per share. Oasis's Projected 2017 Results The midpoint of Oasis' 2017 guidance is for 68,000 BOEPD in production while it mentioned that 78% of that production should be oil. Oasis' oil percentage is slowly decreasing as it adds Wild Basin wells, which have excellent results but are closer to 71% oil. Oasis should end up with an estimated $1.126 billion in revenue at current strip prices (roughly $54.50 oil and $3 natural gas) including the net contribution from Oasis Well Services and Oasis Midstream Services. Oasis' hedges have currently negative value in 2017 since it has 19,000 barrels per day in oil swaps at $49 to $50 per barrel. Oasis expects that its oil differential will fall to around $3 to $4 per barrel due to the assumption that the Dakota Access Pipeline will come online later in 2017. Oasis is a two-stream reporting company, so NGLs get lumped in with natural gas, and with NGL prices improving plus the effect of its Wild Basin infrastructure, I expect Oasis's natural gas differentials to be improved from 2016.    Barrels/Mcf $ Per Barrel/Mcf $ Million   Oil 19,359,600 $51.00 $987   Natural Gas 32,762,400 $3.25 $106   Net Well Services And Midstream   $65   Hedge Value     $-32   Total   $1,126   Based on Oasis' cost guidance, it should have roughly $1.125 billion in cash expenditures in 2017, including $590 million in capital expenditures (I've included an estimated $15 million in capitalized interest under interest instead). Thus Oasis should be roughly cash flow neutral at current strip prices.     $ Million   Lease Operating Expenses $180   Marketing, Transportation and Gathering $51   Production Taxes $97   Cash G&A $68   Interest $139   Capital Expenditures $590   Total $1,125    Oasis in 2018 For 2018, Oasis has increased its estimated exit rate to over 83,000 BOEPD (from a previous estimate of over 80,000 BOEPD). This should allow Oasis to produce around 78,000 BOEPD on average while I estimate that its oil percentage may decrease slightly to 76%. This would result in Oasis generating around $1.341 billion in revenue at current strip prices. Oasis' oil differential is likely to narrow a little more, while some modest continued improvements in NGL prices may offset lower natural gas prices to bring Oasis' realized price for natural gas to the same level as in 2017.    Barrels/Mcf $ Per Barrel/Mcf $ Million   Oil 21,637,200 $52.00 $1,125   Natural Gas 40,996,800 $3.25 $133   Net Well Services And Midstream   $85   Hedge Value   -$2   Total   $1,341   Oasis' capital expenditure plans for 2018 are currently unknown except that it is aiming for roughly 15% production growth and that it expects to generate positive cash flow at current strip prices while doing so. This indicates that Oasis' capital expenditure budget (including capitalized interest) should be at or under $750 million.    $ Million   Lease Operating Expenses $206   Marketing, Transportation and Gathering $60   Production Taxes $119   Cash G&A $75   Cash Interest $139   Total Before CapEx $599   Conclusion The increased production growth (while spending within cash flow) and the narrowing oil differentials are serving to boost Oasis' value. I estimate that Oasis' value should be approximately $14 to $18 per share now, up from my previous $13 to $17 estimate. Oasis' high-quality Wild Basin inventory makes it a fairly low cost player, allowing it to do well even if oil prices decrease. While I am wary about effect of rising US production on oil prices, I believe that Oasis at under $14 per share is a reasonable value.

  What type of case do you have? The most common cases are listed below. Call toll-free 877.333.6675 to confirm that you qualify.







Auto Accident


Workers Comp


Civil Rights


Construction Negligence


FELA (Railroad)


General Negligence 


Jones Act (Maritime)


Motor Vehicle and  Passenger Injury


Pedestrian Injury


Premises Negligence  (Slip and Fall)


Workplace Negligence


Wrongful Death













Auto Accident
Many auto accident claims do not settle quickly. Being injured is bad enough, but if you’re unable to work, life becomes that much harder. As bills pile up, people often feel pressure to settle their cases early for less than the fair value. An Oasis Financial cash lifeline gives you and your attorney breathing room, so you’re not forced to take the defendant’s first offer. 




Workers Comp
Almost half of all work place injuries are serious enough to cause the employee to miss work or require ongoing medical care. Worker’s Compensation laws were created to protect injured workers by providing for medical care, compensation for lost wages related to the injury and rehabilitation and/or retraining if necessary. 

Because paying these claims can be costly, employers don’t always believe they are legitimate, creating undue delays in resolving them. In addition, defendants often don’t even make an initial offer. They want to pay zero—more reason than ever to give your attorney time to win a fair settlement.*

 
*Oasis does not work with Workers Compensation cases in Alaska, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, or Wyoming.




Civil Rights
These claims can result from a wide variety of discriminatory misconduct, including misconduct regarding age, disability, pregnancy, race and religious discrimination—as well as different types of harassment charges. While the actions prompting these claims may not leave a person with a physical injury, they can cause significant stress for the claimant and their family—negatively impacting the family’s financial situation. Civil rights cases often take years to settle.




Construction Negligence
The reality of construction litigation is that even with an experienced lawyer and a well-documented case, the legal process can move slowly. Defendants aren’t likely to step up and provide a quick resolution with a fair award. More commonly, the defendant will offer a small amount, hoping the claimant is financially needy enough to take it.




FELA (Railroad)
Similar to Workers Comp, the Federal Employer’s Liability Act (FELA) provides compensation for railroad workers injured on the job. Almost any worker employed by a railroad company, even those whose primary responsibilities are not performed in or around trains, is protected under the FELA. 

The degree of negligence the plaintiff must show under the FELA (usually due to the railroad, its employees or an equipment manufacturer) is actually less than “no fault” Workers Comp. However, FELA requires a higher burden of proof by the courts than Workers Comp, so FELA litigation can last much longer.




General Negligence 
Negligence lawsuits cover a broad range of specific complaints including: animal bites, amusement park injuries, bicycle and pedestrian accidents, plus homeowner and nursing home negligence. Since these cases are expensive and time-consuming to defend, the defendant will probably want to settle quickly, but that rarely means the amount offered will be fair.




Jones Act (Maritime)
Like FELA described above, the Jones Act was signed into law to protect maritime workers involved in accidents while at work. As you would expect, claimants must prove that their employers were negligent or “at fault.” 

However, “comparative fault” is involved here. if the employer can prove that the plaintiff’s actions contributed to or caused the accident, the amount of the award can be reduced accordingly. This clause is why nearly all employers will immediately blame plaintiffs for their own accidents—and why these cases can take so long to settle.




Motor Vehicle and  Passenger Injury
See Auto Accident




Pedestrian Injury
Did you know that, on average, a pedestrian is injured every seven minutes?** Collisions with motor vehicle or bicycles, or injuries due to unsafe conditions, can happen anytime. If you’ve sustained injuries through another party’s negligence, you may already know that the legal process moves slowly, even with a strong case.
 
**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 2012, Pedestrian Safety, “How big is the problem.”





Premises Negligence  (Slip and Fall)
If you were injured on another’s property and the property owner failed to warn you of the possible hazard, the owner may be found negligent and liable. Premise liability lawsuits encompass a wide range of accidents, but “slip and fall” cases are the most common. 

This type of injury can occur on private or public property and can be caused by uneven or cracked sidewalks, poorly lit pathways, slippery or unbalanced floors, potholes, ripped carpet or rugs, and even bad weather.




Workplace Negligence
A job-related injury is typically covered by Workers Comp insurance. However, if the injury involved negligence on the part of the employer, a fellow employee or a product, tool or machine produced by a third party, a workplace negligence lawsuit may be filed. These are often handled outside of the state-specific Workers Comp “no-fault” claims process.

Since these cases are not considered “no fault,” it is the claimant’s burden to prove that the other party is liable. This can lead to a long, contentious fight.




Wrongful Death
There are no words to describe the loss of a loved one, especially due to a senseless accident caused by the actions or negligence of someone else. In addition to taking a terrible emotional toll on those left behind, the wrongful death of a loved one can also create significant financial hardships.













 If you lose, you don’t have to pay us back.
 Our share of the case's potential proceeds varies according to several factors. Pay nothing out of pocket—payment comes out of the award or settlement amount. Owe nothing if you don't win your case. 













  How to Qualify Checklist Say “yes” to the 2 statements below and you’ve met the initial requirements. Final approval is subject to our underwriting standards. We tend to fund 5-10% of the value of your claim (this is part part of the approval process).

Holiday/FL Attorney


“Oasis is the most upfront company. They made sure I understood everything.”
Richard/Vidalia LA

She needed funds before the weekend, and we were able to get her the money in less than two hours. She was so grateful and impressed at how quickly it happened."
Beckly/WV Attorney


"James desperately needed to pay his light bill and his mortgage. He was very happy when I told him he was approved. With the money left over he was going to take his ‘little ones’ to McDonald's as a treat. He said it'd been a long time."
Tampa/FL Attorney

Oasis is the premier operator in the Williston Basin, possessing both coveted assets and creative people that drive the success of the Company.  We are on the forefront of technology deployment, operational efficiencies, and infrastructure development.  Our 333,000 net acres in the Williston Basin are highly concentrated and are prospective for the Bakken, Three Forks and other potential horizons.   As we develop this acreage position that is in the heart of the play, we expect to increase long-term shareholder value while maintaining a conservative balance sheet.  We have a long history of acquiring and exploiting oil and gas assets; which has been characterized by capital discipline coupled with differential views of the market.  While we have a great track record of rapidly growing production and reserves, we do not subscribe to the idea of growth at any cost.
