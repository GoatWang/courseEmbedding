Education and background[edit]
Sloan was born in Coleman, Texas, and grew up in Abilene, Texas. He earned his B.A. from Baylor University in 1970, and his M.Div from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1973. After post-graduate research at the University of Bristol, he earned his Ph.D. from the University of Basel in 1978.[1][2] After serving as an adjunct at Hardin-Simmons University and on the faculty of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Sloan joined the Department of Religion faculty at Baylor University in 1983, and would eventually become the founding dean of the George W. Truett Theological Seminary.[2] He succeeded Herbert H. Reynolds as president of the university in 1995.[1]
Baylor 2012[edit]
In 2002, Sloan unveiled a 42-page plan titled "Baylor 2012," outlining his strategy to transform into a national university with Ph.D. programs and research professors, allowing it "to enter the top tier of American universities while reaffirming and deepening its distinctive Christian mission."[3] His plan included twelve imperatives that were "necessary for Baylor to fulfill the Vision".[4] Opposition to the plan, as well as several controversial financial moves, resulted in Sloan narrowly escaping a 2004 vote to oust him as president,[5] and eventually resigning in 2005.[6] The saga is chronicled in the 2007 book The Baylor Project: Taking Christian Higher Education to the Next Level (ISBN 1587310627).
Houston Baptist University: The Ten Pillars[edit]
Following a brief stint as Baylor's Chancellor in 2005–2006,[7] Sloan served as visiting scholar at the University of St Andrews in 2006,[2] before beginning his tenure as president of Houston Baptist University on September 1, 2006.
In 2008 Sloan, along with the Board of Trustees, approved a 12-year vision document titled "The Ten Pillars: Faith and Reason in a Great City". The purpose of this plan is to enable the university to "fulfill its responsibility for the renewal of Christian Higher Education."[8]
Other roles[edit]
Sloan serves on the Board of Directors for the Houston Symphony and the Greater Houston Partnership in addition to leadership roles on the boards of Memorial Hermann Healthcare Systems - Community Relations, Houston Christian High School, Market Place Chaplains USA, and Orphan Outreach.[citation needed] He is also the publisher of the academic journal, The City.[9][10] Sloan published his first young adult fantasy book in 2016 and its sequel in February 2017.[11][12]
Sloan has pastored churches throughout Texas and beyond.[citation needed] He has also held membership in the Society of Biblical Literature, the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, the National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion, and Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas.[citation needed]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Education and background[edit]
Sloan was born in Coleman, Texas, and grew up in Abilene, Texas. He earned his B.A. from Baylor University in 1970, and his M.Div from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1973. After post-graduate research at the University of Bristol, he earned his Ph.D. from the University of Basel in 1978.[1][2] After serving as an adjunct at Hardin-Simmons University and on the faculty of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Sloan joined the Department of Religion faculty at Baylor University in 1983, and would eventually become the founding dean of the George W. Truett Theological Seminary.[2] He succeeded Herbert H. Reynolds as president of the university in 1995.[1]
Baylor 2012[edit]
In 2002, Sloan unveiled a 42-page plan titled "Baylor 2012," outlining his strategy to transform into a national university with Ph.D. programs and research professors, allowing it "to enter the top tier of American universities while reaffirming and deepening its distinctive Christian mission."[3] His plan included twelve imperatives that were "necessary for Baylor to fulfill the Vision".[4] Opposition to the plan, as well as several controversial financial moves, resulted in Sloan narrowly escaping a 2004 vote to oust him as president,[5] and eventually resigning in 2005.[6] The saga is chronicled in the 2007 book The Baylor Project: Taking Christian Higher Education to the Next Level (ISBN 1587310627).
Houston Baptist University: The Ten Pillars[edit]
Following a brief stint as Baylor's Chancellor in 2005–2006,[7] Sloan served as visiting scholar at the University of St Andrews in 2006,[2] before beginning his tenure as president of Houston Baptist University on September 1, 2006.
In 2008 Sloan, along with the Board of Trustees, approved a 12-year vision document titled "The Ten Pillars: Faith and Reason in a Great City". The purpose of this plan is to enable the university to "fulfill its responsibility for the renewal of Christian Higher Education."[8]
Other roles[edit]
Sloan serves on the Board of Directors for the Houston Symphony and the Greater Houston Partnership in addition to leadership roles on the boards of Memorial Hermann Healthcare Systems - Community Relations, Houston Christian High School, Market Place Chaplains USA, and Orphan Outreach.[citation needed] He is also the publisher of the academic journal, The City.[9][10] Sloan published his first young adult fantasy book in 2016 and its sequel in February 2017.[11][12]
Sloan has pastored churches throughout Texas and beyond.[citation needed] He has also held membership in the Society of Biblical Literature, the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, the National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion, and Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas.[citation needed]

After post-graduate research at the University of Bristol, he earned his Ph.D. from the University of Basel in 1978.[1][2] After serving as an adjunct at Hardin-Simmons University and on the faculty of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Sloan joined the Department of Religion faculty at Baylor University in 1983, and would eventually become the founding dean of the George W. Truett Theological Seminary.[2] He succeeded Herbert H. Reynolds as president of the university in 1995.[1]
Baylor 2012[edit]
In 2002, Sloan unveiled a 42-page plan titled "Baylor 2012," outlining his strategy to transform into a national university with Ph.D. programs and research professors, allowing it "to enter the top tier of American universities while reaffirming and deepening its distinctive Christian mission."[3] His plan included twelve imperatives that were "necessary for Baylor to fulfill the Vision".[4] Opposition to the plan, as well as several controversial financial moves, resulted in Sloan narrowly escaping a 2004 vote to oust him as president,[5] and eventually resigning in 2005.[6] The saga is chronicled in the 2007 book The Baylor Project: Taking Christian Higher Education to the Next Level (ISBN 1587310627).
Houston Baptist University: The Ten Pillars[edit]
Following a brief stint as Baylor's Chancellor in 2005–2006,[7] Sloan served as visiting scholar at the University of St Andrews in 2006,[2] before beginning his tenure as president of Houston Baptist University on September 1, 2006.
In 2008 Sloan, along with the Board of Trustees, approved a 12-year vision document titled "The Ten Pillars: Faith and Reason in a Great City". The purpose of this plan is to enable the university to "fulfill its responsibility for the renewal of Christian Higher Education."[8]
Other roles[edit]
Sloan serves on the Board of Directors for the Houston Symphony and the Greater Houston Partnership in addition to leadership roles on the boards of Memorial Hermann Healthcare Systems - Community Relations, Houston Christian High School, Market Place Chaplains USA, and Orphan Outreach.[citation needed] He is also the publisher of the academic journal, The City.[9][10] Sloan published his first young adult fantasy book in 2016 and its sequel in February 2017.[11][12]
Sloan has pastored churches throughout Texas and beyond.[citation needed] He has also held membership in the Society of Biblical Literature, the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, the National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion, and Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas.[citation needed]

Education and background[edit]
Sloan was born in Coleman, Texas, and grew up in Abilene, Texas. He earned his B.A. from Baylor University in 1970, and his M.Div from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1973. After post-graduate research at the University of Bristol, he earned his Ph.D. from the University of Basel in 1978.[1][2] After serving as an adjunct at Hardin-Simmons University and on the faculty of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Sloan joined the Department of Religion faculty at Baylor University in 1983, and would eventually become the founding dean of the George W. Truett Theological Seminary.[2] He succeeded Herbert H. Reynolds as president of the university in 1995.[1]
Baylor 2012[edit]
In 2002, Sloan unveiled a 42-page plan titled "Baylor 2012," outlining his strategy to transform into a national university with Ph.D. programs and research professors, allowing it "to enter the top tier of American universities while reaffirming and deepening its distinctive Christian mission."[3] His plan included twelve imperatives that were "necessary for Baylor to fulfill the Vision".[4] Opposition to the plan, as well as several controversial financial moves, resulted in Sloan narrowly escaping a 2004 vote to oust him as president,[5] and eventually resigning in 2005.[6] The saga is chronicled in the 2007 book The Baylor Project: Taking Christian Higher Education to the Next Level (ISBN 1587310627).
Houston Baptist University: The Ten Pillars[edit]
Following a brief stint as Baylor's Chancellor in 2005–2006,[7] Sloan served as visiting scholar at the University of St Andrews in 2006,[2] before beginning his tenure as president of Houston Baptist University on September 1, 2006.
In 2008 Sloan, along with the Board of Trustees, approved a 12-year vision document titled "The Ten Pillars: Faith and Reason in a Great City". The purpose of this plan is to enable the university to "fulfill its responsibility for the renewal of Christian Higher Education."[8]
Other roles[edit]
Sloan serves on the Board of Directors for the Houston Symphony and the Greater Houston Partnership in addition to leadership roles on the boards of Memorial Hermann Healthcare Systems - Community Relations, Houston Christian High School, Market Place Chaplains USA, and Orphan Outreach.[citation needed] He is also the publisher of the academic journal, The City.[9][10] Sloan published his first young adult fantasy book in 2016 and its sequel in February 2017.[11][12]
Sloan has pastored churches throughout Texas and beyond.[citation needed] He has also held membership in the Society of Biblical Literature, the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, the National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion, and Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas.[citation needed]

Hamelin Stoop Series





The Hamelin Stoop series is a fantasy for young adult and adult readers, and involves strange creatures, worlds, and battles of good and evil.
Robert B. Sloan has written non-fiction for many years, but writing fiction has been a life-long ambition. Work on this fantasy series began 11 years ago in St. Andrews, Scotland. It has been an experience that is intertwined with the larger story arc of his own experiences of teaching, leading, and envisioning.











The Eagle, the Cave, and the Footbridge
Guided by the Great Eagle through a mysterious cave, eleven-year-old Hamelin must pass a dangerous test of courage before he can find his parents. Hamelin’s failures, fears, and hopes become part of a larger story, a story of a great struggle between worlds and kingdoms where the old myths of magic, evil contracts, and enslaved children turn out to be real.


Buy Book 1









The Lost Princess and the Jewel of Periluna
In this volume, Hamelin faces an enchanting deception that leads him to the Land of Gloaming. There, on the other side of the Atrium of the Worlds, he meets friends whose quests to find a lost sister and recover a stolen jewel of light and life result in daring and dangerous adventures for all of them.

Baylor University President Robert B. Sloan Jr. has announced the designation of Master Teacher - the highest honor granted to Baylor faculty members - on Rachel Moore, senior lecturer of English; Dr. J. William Petty, holder of The W.W. Caruth Chair of Entrepreneurship and professor of finance; Dr. Alden Smith, chair of the classics department and director of the Honors Program; Dr. William Thomas, The J.E. Bush Professor in Accounting; and William Underwood, The Leon Jaworski Professor of Practice and Procedure at Baylor Law School.
The five will be introduced at the beginning of Pigskin Review performances at 7 p.m and 10:30 p.m. Friday, Oct. 22, and 7 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 23, in Waco Hall. 
"I am pleased to announce the Master Teacher designation for these five outstanding faculty members who have distinguished themselves in Baylor classrooms," Sloan said. "I am confident that every student who has had the privilege of studying under these exceptional professors will testify to the positive impact they have had on their lives. It is an honor that these faculty members have earned and deserve."
Moore received her bachelor's degree from Mississippi College and her master's degree from Baylor. She began teaching in the university's English department in 1966. She is a member of the South Central Language Association and the Central Conference of Teachers of English. Her research and teaching interests include British poetry and American literature, especially Southern writers Eudora Welty, William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor.
Selected as a Piper Professor for 2003 by the Minnie Stevens Piper Foundation, Moore is a past recipient of numerous teaching awards, including 1999 Collins Outstanding Professor award, the Most Outstanding Baylor Teacher award, Mortar Board's Top Prof Award, Gamma Beta Phi Teacher Appreciation Award and the Student Congress Outstanding Teaching Award. In 1986, the Baylor chapter of Chi Omega sorority established The Rachel Hunter Moore Award for Outstanding Teaching, which is awarded to women faculty members at Baylor.
Petty, who has taught at Baylor since 1990, earned a bachelor's degree from Abilene Christian University and an MBA and doctorate from the University of Texas. Prior to beginning his tenure at Baylor, he served as dean of the College of Business Administration at Abilene Christian, professor of finance at Texas Tech University and assistant professor at Virginia Tech.
Petty's research interests include valuation and acquisitions of privately held companies, the financing of entrepreneurial firms, and shareholder value-based management. 
He has served as the co-editor for the Journal of Financial Research and as the editor of The Journal of Entrepreneurial and Small Business Finance. He is the co-author of two leading corporate finance textbooks, Basic Financial Management and Foundations of Finance, and a widely used text, Small Business Management. He also has co-authored a book, Value-Based Management: Corporate America's Response to the Shareholder Revolution. 
Petty has served as a subject matter expert on a best-practices study by the American Productivity and Quality Center on shareholder value-based management. He served on a research team for the Australian Department of Industry to study the feasibility of establishing a public equity market for small- and medium-sized enterprises in Australia. Petty also serves on the board of directors of Harken Energy Corp., a publicly traded oil and gas firm.
A Pennsylvania native, Smith studied for two years at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome before receiving his bachelor's degree magna cum laude from Dickinson College in 1981. He earned a master's degree from the University of Vermont in 1983 and his doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania in 1990. Smith's teaching career began at Vermont, followed by appointments at Penn and Rutgers University, where he was an assistant professor from 1990-94. He joined the Baylor classics faculty in 1994 and has served as chair of the classics department since 1999 and director of the University Scholars program since 2000. He also serves as director of the Baylor in Italy summer study-abroad program. He was named director of the honors program and associate dean in the Honors College in September.

He is the author of a textbook in auditing, as well as many articles in auditing, financial accounting and reporting, taxation and accounting education. His article, "The Rise and Fall of Enron," was selected by Encyclopaedia Britannica for inclusion in its online version of Annals of America, a 22-volume collection of primary documents covering various subjects and perspectives in American history.
In 2003, Thomas was elected by the Texas Society of Certified Public Accountants as the Outstanding Educator in Texas. He has developed a nationally renowned Intensive CPA Examination Review Course, and regularly teaches the auditing and taxation components of that course to CPA candidates across Texas.

Underwood also has represented Baylor in proceedings before the NCAA Committee on Infractions and was a member of and spokesperson for a committee that recently spearheaded an investigation into allegations of misconduct arising out of the death of men's basketball player Patrick Dennehy.
At Baylor, Underwood directs the Practice Court program, which was recently described by the Princeton Review as  "arguably the best training ground in the nation for practical lawyering."
