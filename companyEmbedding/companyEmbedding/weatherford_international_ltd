	Why Weatherford



	We may be a large company, but we empower our team to create fresh ideas that challenge convention and break the status quo. Our employees are the key to driving our growth and success. Everywhere we operate, they are inspired to develop new and efficient ways of raising the bar to meet the needs of an evolving industry and solve our clients’ toughest challenges.

	Our entrepreneurial spirit is evident in how we approach challenges and how we share resources with co-workers. While everyone at Weatherford is empowered to innovate and create new solutions, by collaborating with their colleagues across groups and across borders, these ideas are made stronger and brought to reality sooner.

Here are a few ways you can become engaged in our dynamic culture: 









Field Engineers and Technicians – We look for individuals with backgrounds in science, technology, and engineering to support our key field and technical roles. You receive focused training relative to products, services, and solutions that will support continued career growth and personal development as you work side-by-side with fellow employees and our clients. We also offer rotational career paths that foster technical, business, and leadership skills and provide soft skills training to further develop your strengths.







					 



Experienced Professionals –We enhance the skillsets of our people and value the experience, knowledge, and different perspectives you bring to our business. We want to take that to the next level.
					 If you have experience in one or more of our many product lines, or in the oil and gas industry in general, and would like to be part of our team, your skill set could be a good match for our continued growth.







					 



Research and Development Engineers and Scientists – Do you enjoy solving complex challenges? The top-notch technical personnel in our R&D facilities around the world are responsible for sustaining our leading technology portfolio and developing new ways of doing things to continue developing the advanced and highly reliable equipment that our field teams run.







					 



Functional and Support Positions – Every role in Weatherford plays a key part in our continued success. We are looking for hard working, flexible people within the fields of Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Legal, Finance, Information Technology, Marketing, and Human Resources that have a strong focus on collaborative teamwork and will enjoy supporting something much larger than what they can see at hand. At Weatherford, you will find many opportunities for growth and advancement.




				  



				 

				 




	No experience in the oilfield? Just graduated?

	Weatherford offers the individuals with diverse backgrounds the opportunity to transfer and develop their skillsets into a successful career in the oil and gas industry. 

Below are a few of our focused global initiatives. 







.



University Graduates and NextGen – As a university graduate, you will be given the knowledge, tools and mentorship needed to create a successful career through a variety of talent development programs, including formal training to develop and enhance technical and non-technical, individual and business acumen skill sets.  For example, graduate engineers may qualify for our NextGen program, a global rotational leadership development program designed to accelerate technical and soft-skill development to prepare them for future leadership positions. No matter the program, you will be challenged to expand upon what you learned at university and contribute to our forward thinking team as we challenge convention in all areas of our industry. 









Building a Globally Diverse Workforce – We understand the value of diverse perspectives and put an emphasis on nationalization and representation across the globe. We strategically hire in key markets, including Saudi Arabia, to build a workforce that is well positioned to meet the needs of an ever-evolving industry.









Military Veterans – As a military veteran, you have experience, skills, and leadership abilities that fit in perfectly with a multitude of roles – including operational, technical, or management positions. We need individuals that embrace team work, safety, and dedication to the mission. Weatherford wants to assist you in your transition to the energy industry, and help you make this next career move a success.

                                METALSKIN SOLID EXPANDABLE SYSTEMS MINIMIZE DRILLING HAZARDS
            


            May 22, 2007
        




Weatherford International Ltd. launched its new MetalSkin Solid Expandable Systems for open and cased hole applications.As a result of intensive market research to determine the industry’s needs, Weatherford has developed four distinct MetalSkin systems: 1) open-hole liner; 2) monobore open-hole liner; 3) cased-hole liner; and 4) monobore open-hole clad. Most of these systems can be used for multiple applications, to address both pre-planned and remedial well construction challenges. “Solid tubular expansion is considered to be one of the most important enabling technologies for the future of the oil and gas industry,” stated Pat York, Director of Commercialization and Marketing for Weatherford’s Solid Expandables business unit. “We could have come into the market pretty quickly after acquiring the rights for a cone-based expandable system; but the industry had some concerns, and first we wanted to make some refinements to address those concerns – whether real or perceived.” Significant downhole testing has been completed to date. On February 14, 2007, approximately 1,000 feet of the 11 3/4-inch by 13 3/8-inch MetalSkin monobore open-hole liner was successfully installed in a test well. This installation proves that Weatherford’s monobore technology has become a reality, allowing for new ways to solve drilling challenges without losing hole size. “Our ultimate goal is to move solid ex-pandables from being a risky contingency into the mainstream, where operators actually plan a system into their well,” commented York.

PLM has enabled the world’s oil and gas-producing giants to increase their well productivity.













Design anywhere, build anywhere is an ambitious goal for any global manufacturer, but especially so for Weatherford, one of the world's largest providers of oilfield equipment and services.
"Wherever there is oil, Weatherford is represented," says Bill Droke, an IT director responsible for the company's integrated enterprise resource planning (ERP) and product lifecycle management (PLM) systems. Weatherford is a multi-national organization headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland with operations in over 100 countries. The company operates 16 technology and training centers, approximately 1,000 service and manufacturing facilities. Over 59,000 Weatherford employees are dedicated to helping the world's oil and gas-producing giants increase their well productivity.
Oil and gas companies apply Weatherford's technology across the span of a well's lifecycle – from drilling and evaluation through completion and production. Intervention systems are another Weatherford specialty; they help oil and gas producers remedy problems and optimize yields from underperforming wells worldwide.
About a decade ago, Weatherford committed to taking the "design anywhere, build anywhere" concept from an industry ideal to a company imperative. They resolved to reorganize their operations around a global ERP platform, with integrated PLM as a mission-critical component. 
Why PLM? "Simple," says Droke. "We needed to get control over our product data. More than ever, we began to think of our parts designs as critical company assets. Our investments in ERP and PLM are entirely aimed at improving inventory and asset management throughout our global supply chain." 
Layers of complexity
From the ERP/PLM initiative's start, Weatherford set out to build a single, centralized database of their product information. They envisioned the system to be comprehensive in scope, with parts consistently identified and extensively attributed. Users should be able to access the data quickly and easily – at any time, from any place.
Given the company's worldwide operations, delivering these capabilities would be no simple task. But that was only one complicating factor. 
"Product engineering in the oilfield industry may be like nowhere else," says Lewis Lawrence, Weatherford's PLM process owner. "While there are standard products that we design and manufacture, there are critical products we provide that are specifically engineered to the well conditions they will be used in. They're designed, configured, and built to order."
Weatherford's parts – especially those for downhole uses – are generally machined from raw bar stock, and they may use materials that other industries would view as exotic. An example is inconel, a super-alloy primarily based on nickel and chromium. 
Production is limited, but a product's lifecycle may be very long. "Repeat orders are often 10 years or more apart," Lawrence says. "With designs for parts coming from so many sources, it can be easy to lose track. The original data may be hard to find."
What Weatherford has especially aimed to avoid, notes Lawrence, is the need to re-engineer parts that already exist. This adds time and cost to product development. 
Bottom-line impact
Another PLM challenge has been organizational. Over the years, Weatherford has grown through acquisitions. The firm is today a melding of more than 250 acquired companies. "And for every new engineering team we've brought on board," says Lawrence, "we've taken on another set of legacy systems for numbering and describing parts."
The supply chain adds layers of complexity. "Weatherford's biggest customer," Lawrence notes, "is Weatherford." That is, most production in the company's plants is to fulfill internal sales to their own service organization. Weatherford's service sites then rent and operate the equipment when performing services for the oil and gas companies under service contracts.
Weatherford also relies on thousands of third-party manufacturers to produce short runs of specialized parts. The company's suppliers are mostly small companies. "Many," says Lawrence, "are in way-out-of-the-way places close to our customers' wells. This makes for a lot of additional – and a lot of different – product data to coordinate."
On top of all that, delivery deadlines are tight. If Weatherford delays getting equipment to a site, the customer may waste precious drilling time and fall behind on production.
"There's a huge bottom-line impact from being on time," says Lawrence. "We can't be held up by problems with product data. For our customers, it's a matter of productivity. For us, it can be the difference between getting the next service contract – or not." 
Quality in, quality out
Weatherford uses an Oracle ERP system, with PTC's Windchill system as the PLM front end. Users create parts with computer-aided design (CAD) tools, and Weatherford's PLM-driven Release To Production (RTP) process tightly controls approvals before transferring the parts information to ERP.
Key engineering and manufacturing personnel automatically receive notification when a new or updated part design reaches "released" status. "The systems are so intertwined," says Droke, "that ERP users interact with our PLM tools and data without really knowing it."
Weatherford's ongoing acquisition of companies means that adoption of the integrated ERP/PLM systems remains a work in process. Yet there is no doubt it has firmly taken hold. There are now more than 2,000 day-to-day PLM users at Weatherford. The product database holds nearly a million part masters and over a million secondary part numbers.
Each month Weatherford users add nearly 6,000 new part numbers, nearly 2,000 part revisions, and over 1,000 engineering change requests to the system. By Droke's estimate, approximately 85% of Weatherford's business transactions now occur through the ERP/PLM systems. As he puts it: "If Windchill is unavailable, our ability to respond to business demand is severely impacted."
Quality of product data is all-important, says Lawrence. "Here's my philosophy: Live like there is no tomorrow; manage data like it will live forever." He elaborates: "I may be stating the obvious here, but the information contained in PLM is what gives the system value. Bad data is worse than no data. Inconsistent data is bad data. The system doesn't create data, nor does it fix data. Quality in, quality out."
Lawrence adds, "With apologies to the credit card commercials – good data: priceless."
Classification is crucial
Careful parts classification helps to eliminate duplicate part designs and ensure the high quality of Weatherford's product data. The company's classification team engages with subject matter experts to comb data throughout the many legacy systems and find equivalences in part designs. They then create "new" part numbers and where possible map the existing legacy number to existing parts in the system, with descriptions in standard formats for consistent use in bills of materials and other applications.
Up to 40 attributes per part aid in distinguishing items. Geometrically identical parts can be described from the same drawing. This attribute-driven approach, says Lawrence, helps to "de-skill" part variant creation. "Often, generating a new repeated part from different materials can be a clerical function. No CAD license is required."
Classification helps Weatherford's users quickly search for and retrieve required parts. "In an organization as widespread and diverse as ours," Droke says, "just having a PLM system isn't enough. It's the classification of data that truly breaks down the silos of information. It's what makes easy search and retrieval a part of our everyday work life."
Parts classification also enhances cross-team collaboration. Asserts Lawrence: "It gets everyone on the same page, both internally and throughout the supply chain. Our teams work better and faster when they can have confidence that their product data is complete, accurate, and up to date. We can meet our customers' needs more efficiently."
Classification even creates synergies across business disciplines. "Our integration of classified data structures, product templates, attributes and allowed values is interwoven into all aspects of our business process and supply chain," says Droke.
With engineering, finance, marketing, and other Weatherford departments sharing consistent product data, they can perform sophisticated business analyses to find new opportunities for growth.
Having classification and attribute data available in reports linked to ERP data has enabled some groups to perform detailed business analysis looking at revenues for certain product lines or specific product models by geographic region, customer and well types. This type of reporting has sometimes led to more targeted marketing, internally to Weatherford staff and externally to customers.
Data analysis showed, for example, that Weatherford customers commonly needed certain sets of peripheral equipment. This led the company to create companion parts kits linked to main assemblies – a valuable new tool for customer services helping ensure that orders contain everything the customer needs to use equipment. Prior to this capability customer services would often have to consult engineering directly, or rely on product catalogues to ensure the required accessories were available to the customer.
"The data thus helped us anticipate our customers' needs and meet them innovatively," says Droke.
The Trade Compliance organization also depends heavily on product classification to make license and customs determinations for the company's international shipments.
Droke points to Weatherford's upfront commitment to classification launched as a "phase-one task" in their ERP/PLM initiative – as a key to successful implementation. Yet, as he makes clear, companies must approach classification fully aware of its challenges. "It's not a magic wand you can simply wave over your data and get everyone right in line," he says. "Classification is hard work. It's a major investment." 
Resistance overcome
PLM, per Lawrence, makes engineering change management a "closed-loop process" at Weatherford. "The system strictly enforces what users need to do," he says.
Access controls prevent unauthorized design changes. Yet the system also steadily advances the process. "The whole purpose of engineering change management is to make the change," says Lawrence. "Our customers can't put their oil rigs on hold waiting for an approved design change to be implemented."
Lawrence notes that Weatherford's PLM system met some internal resistance at first. "Some in the company," he says, "were inclined to view it as a nuisance – something 'the man' was forcing them to do. But as good data was added, and users began to access it regularly, they saw the value and became champions of the system."
Droke adds, "Today 'design anywhere, build anywhere' is more than just a slogan at Weatherford. It's reality. The quality of our product data helps to make it so."

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1941 in Weatherford, Texas as the Weatherford Spring Company by Jesse E. Hall Sr.[3][4] In 1948, the company was renamed Weatherford Oil Tool Company (WOTCO) with ownership by Jesse Hall, his son, Elmer, James E. Berry, and Juan A. Perea.[5] From its inception, the company pioneered an innovative technique and equipment for the cementing of cased-hole oil wells.[5] Originally marketed to U.S. well owners, Weatherford drilling and casing equipment was soon being used in the oil fields of Venezuela by the Gulf Oil Company.[5]
In 1972, the separate company of Energy Ventures, Inc. was founded as an offshore gas and oil exploration and production company.[6] In 1987, Energy Ventures was liquidated and re-established, and by 1990, had acquired Grant Oil Country Tubular Company.[7]
In 1991, Weatherford acquired Petroleum Equipment Tools Company (PETCO).[7] Weatherford and HOMCO later merged operations to create Weatherford Services, the largest oil fishing/rental company in the world. In 1995, Weatherford merged with Enterra, becoming Weatherford Enterra Inc.[7]
In May 1998 Energy Ventures, since renamed EVI, Inc. and Weatherford Enterra, Inc. merged, creating the current company now known as Weatherford.[7][8] In the next two years, Weatherford added a number of well-organized brands to its expertise, including Dailey, Orwell, Energy Rentals, Whiting, Williams, BBL and ECD Northwest. Weatherford also created a stronger completion competence with the addition of well-known brands in the sector such as Petroline, Cardium, Nodeco, McAllister, Johnson Screens, Houston Well Screens, Arrow, and CIDRA.
In 2005, Weatherford acquired Precision Drilling Corporation’s Precision Energy Services and International Contract Drilling divisions.
In July 2007, the company was featured in news media reports questioning operations of the company's foreign subsidiary, Weatherford Oil Tool Middle East, which had offices and equipment in the nation of Sudan.[9] Since 1997, U.S. companies were forbidden by law to operate in Sudan, though foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies could still legally operate in that country if there was no involvement by the U.S. parent or any other U.S. person.[10] Nevertheless, in response to media and investor criticism, the company announced that it would divest itself of any foreign subsidiary operations in countries sanctioned by the United States.[10][11][11] The next year, Weatherford withdrew from activities in Sudan and donated its in-country equipment as well as providing additional equipment, supplies, and funding to Thirst No More, a humanitarian organization operating in Sudan.[12][13]
In 2008, the company announced that it was shifting its place of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland.[14] That same year, Weatherford completed its acquisition of V-Tech International, a pioneer in the development of mechanical power tong systems in the North Sea to improve rig safety.[15]
In May 2010, Weatherford's Leetsdale, Pennsylvania, facility accidentally released a cloud of ammonium persulfate that resulted in the evacuation of 500 workers from the surrounding industrial park.[16] In April 2014, Weatherford announced that its board of directors approved the relocation of its legal domicile to Ireland from Switzerland. The company will continue to maintain its operational office in Houston, Texas. [17]
On November 9, 2016, Weatherford announced the departure of Bernard J. Duroc-Danner, Chairman of the Board, President, and CEO. It also announced the appointment of Robert Rayne as Chairman of the Board and Krishna Shivram as Chief Executive Officer.[18]
On March 6, 2017, Weatherford announced the appointment of Mark A. McCollum as President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a member of the Board of Directors of Weatherford. In addition, the Company announced that Mr. William E. Macaulay has been appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors.[19]
Company focus[edit]
As an oil and natural gas drilling services company, Weatherford produces a variety of products and services for the oil and gas industry.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1941 in Weatherford, Texas as the Weatherford Spring Company by Jesse E. Hall Sr.[3][4] In 1948, the company was renamed Weatherford Oil Tool Company (WOTCO) with ownership by Jesse Hall, his son, Elmer, James E. Berry, and Juan A. Perea.[5] From its inception, the company pioneered an innovative technique and equipment for the cementing of cased-hole oil wells.[5] Originally marketed to U.S. well owners, Weatherford drilling and casing equipment was soon being used in the oil fields of Venezuela by the Gulf Oil Company.[5]
In 1972, the separate company of Energy Ventures, Inc. was founded as an offshore gas and oil exploration and production company.[6] In 1987, Energy Ventures was liquidated and re-established, and by 1990, had acquired Grant Oil Country Tubular Company.[7]
In 1991, Weatherford acquired Petroleum Equipment Tools Company (PETCO).[7] Weatherford and HOMCO later merged operations to create Weatherford Services, the largest oil fishing/rental company in the world. In 1995, Weatherford merged with Enterra, becoming Weatherford Enterra Inc.[7]
In May 1998 Energy Ventures, since renamed EVI, Inc. and Weatherford Enterra, Inc. merged, creating the current company now known as Weatherford.[7][8] In the next two years, Weatherford added a number of well-organized brands to its expertise, including Dailey, Orwell, Energy Rentals, Whiting, Williams, BBL and ECD Northwest. Weatherford also created a stronger completion competence with the addition of well-known brands in the sector such as Petroline, Cardium, Nodeco, McAllister, Johnson Screens, Houston Well Screens, Arrow, and CIDRA.
In 2005, Weatherford acquired Precision Drilling Corporation’s Precision Energy Services and International Contract Drilling divisions.
In July 2007, the company was featured in news media reports questioning operations of the company's foreign subsidiary, Weatherford Oil Tool Middle East, which had offices and equipment in the nation of Sudan.[9] Since 1997, U.S. companies were forbidden by law to operate in Sudan, though foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies could still legally operate in that country if there was no involvement by the U.S. parent or any other U.S. person.[10] Nevertheless, in response to media and investor criticism, the company announced that it would divest itself of any foreign subsidiary operations in countries sanctioned by the United States.[10][11][11] The next year, Weatherford withdrew from activities in Sudan and donated its in-country equipment as well as providing additional equipment, supplies, and funding to Thirst No More, a humanitarian organization operating in Sudan.[12][13]
In 2008, the company announced that it was shifting its place of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland.[14] That same year, Weatherford completed its acquisition of V-Tech International, a pioneer in the development of mechanical power tong systems in the North Sea to improve rig safety.[15]
In May 2010, Weatherford's Leetsdale, Pennsylvania, facility accidentally released a cloud of ammonium persulfate that resulted in the evacuation of 500 workers from the surrounding industrial park.[16] In April 2014, Weatherford announced that its board of directors approved the relocation of its legal domicile to Ireland from Switzerland. The company will continue to maintain its operational office in Houston, Texas. [17]
On November 9, 2016, Weatherford announced the departure of Bernard J. Duroc-Danner, Chairman of the Board, President, and CEO. It also announced the appointment of Robert Rayne as Chairman of the Board and Krishna Shivram as Chief Executive Officer.[18]
On March 6, 2017, Weatherford announced the appointment of Mark A. McCollum as President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a member of the Board of Directors of Weatherford. In addition, the Company announced that Mr. William E. Macaulay has been appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors.[19]
Company focus[edit]
As an oil and natural gas drilling services company, Weatherford produces a variety of products and services for the oil and gas industry. These include drilling services, electronic well measurement and monitoring, completion, production, and evaluation products and services. In particular, the company has developed directional drilling services that can extend through miles of bedrock with great precision, and tubular running services that are used on almost half of the world’s deepwater drilling projects. The company has more sand screen systems installed worldwide than any other company, and production optimization systems in more than 100,000 wells around the world. Weatherford also offers intervention, completion, and decommissioning services for well owners, in addition to pipeline precommissioning, commissioning operations, and one of the world's most diverse fleets of inline inspection tools.[20][21]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.31      Net Money Flow ($)  2.43 M    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1941 in Weatherford, Texas as the Weatherford Spring Company by Jesse E. Hall Sr.[3][4] In 1948, the company was renamed Weatherford Oil Tool Company (WOTCO) with ownership by Jesse Hall, his son, Elmer, James E. Berry, and Juan A. Perea.[5] From its inception, the company pioneered an innovative technique and equipment for the cementing of cased-hole oil wells.[5] Originally marketed to U.S. well owners, Weatherford drilling and casing equipment was soon being used in the oil fields of Venezuela by the Gulf Oil Company.[5]
In 1972, the separate company of Energy Ventures, Inc. was founded as an offshore gas and oil exploration and production company.[6] In 1987, Energy Ventures was liquidated and re-established, and by 1990, had acquired Grant Oil Country Tubular Company.[7]
In 1991, Weatherford acquired Petroleum Equipment Tools Company (PETCO).[7] Weatherford and HOMCO later merged operations to create Weatherford Services, the largest oil fishing/rental company in the world. In 1995, Weatherford merged with Enterra, becoming Weatherford Enterra Inc.[7]
In May 1998 Energy Ventures, since renamed EVI, Inc. and Weatherford Enterra, Inc. merged, creating the current company now known as Weatherford.[7][8] In the next two years, Weatherford added a number of well-organized brands to its expertise, including Dailey, Orwell, Energy Rentals, Whiting, Williams, BBL and ECD Northwest. Weatherford also created a stronger completion competence with the addition of well-known brands in the sector such as Petroline, Cardium, Nodeco, McAllister, Johnson Screens, Houston Well Screens, Arrow, and CIDRA.
In 2005, Weatherford acquired Precision Drilling Corporation’s Precision Energy Services and International Contract Drilling divisions.
In July 2007, the company was featured in news media reports questioning operations of the company's foreign subsidiary, Weatherford Oil Tool Middle East, which had offices and equipment in the nation of Sudan.[9] Since 1997, U.S. companies were forbidden by law to operate in Sudan, though foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies could still legally operate in that country if there was no involvement by the U.S. parent or any other U.S. person.[10] Nevertheless, in response to media and investor criticism, the company announced that it would divest itself of any foreign subsidiary operations in countries sanctioned by the United States.[10][11][11] The next year, Weatherford withdrew from activities in Sudan and donated its in-country equipment as well as providing additional equipment, supplies, and funding to Thirst No More, a humanitarian organization operating in Sudan.[12][13]
In 2008, the company announced that it was shifting its place of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland.[14] That same year, Weatherford completed its acquisition of V-Tech International, a pioneer in the development of mechanical power tong systems in the North Sea to improve rig safety.[15]
In May 2010, Weatherford's Leetsdale, Pennsylvania, facility accidentally released a cloud of ammonium persulfate that resulted in the evacuation of 500 workers from the surrounding industrial park.[16] In April 2014, Weatherford announced that its board of directors approved the relocation of its legal domicile to Ireland from Switzerland. The company will continue to maintain its operational office in Houston, Texas. [17]
On November 9, 2016, Weatherford announced the departure of Bernard J. Duroc-Danner, Chairman of the Board, President, and CEO. It also announced the appointment of Robert Rayne as Chairman of the Board and Krishna Shivram as Chief Executive Officer.[18]
On March 6, 2017, Weatherford announced the appointment of Mark A. McCollum as President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a member of the Board of Directors of Weatherford. In addition, the Company announced that Mr. William E. Macaulay has been appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors.[19]
Company focus[edit]
As an oil and natural gas drilling services company, Weatherford produces a variety of products and services for the oil and gas industry. These include drilling services, electronic well measurement and monitoring, completion, production, and evaluation products and services. In particular, the company has developed directional drilling services that can extend through miles of bedrock with great precision, and tubular running services that are used on almost half of the world’s deepwater drilling projects. The company has more sand screen systems installed worldwide than any other company, and production optimization systems in more than 100,000 wells around the world. Weatherford also offers intervention, completion, and decommissioning services for well owners, in addition to pipeline precommissioning, commissioning operations, and one of the world's most diverse fleets of inline inspection tools.[20][21]

On November 9, 2016, Weatherford announced the departure of Bernard J. Duroc-Danner, Chairman of the Board, President, and CEO. It also announced the appointment of Robert Rayne as Chairman of the Board and Krishna Shivram as Chief Executive Officer.[18]
On March 6, 2017, Weatherford announced the appointment of Mark A. McCollum as President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a member of the Board of Directors of Weatherford. In addition, the Company announced that Mr. William E. Macaulay has been appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors.[19]
Company focus[edit]
As an oil and natural gas drilling services company, Weatherford produces a variety of products and services for the oil and gas industry. These include drilling services, electronic well measurement and monitoring, completion, production, and evaluation products and services. In particular, the company has developed directional drilling services that can extend through miles of bedrock with great precision, and tubular running services that are used on almost half of the world’s deepwater drilling projects. The company has more sand screen systems installed worldwide than any other company, and production optimization systems in more than 100,000 wells around the world. Weatherford also offers intervention, completion, and decommissioning services for well owners, in addition to pipeline precommissioning, commissioning operations, and one of the world's most diverse fleets of inline inspection tools.[20][21]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1941 in Weatherford, Texas as the Weatherford Spring Company by Jesse E. Hall Sr.[3][4] In 1948, the company was renamed Weatherford Oil Tool Company (WOTCO) with ownership by Jesse Hall, his son, Elmer, James E. Berry, and Juan A. Perea.[5] From its inception, the company pioneered an innovative technique and equipment for the cementing of cased-hole oil wells.[5] Originally marketed to U.S. well owners, Weatherford drilling and casing equipment was soon being used in the oil fields of Venezuela by the Gulf Oil Company.[5]
In 1972, the separate company of Energy Ventures, Inc. was founded as an offshore gas and oil exploration and production company.[6] In 1987, Energy Ventures was liquidated and re-established, and by 1990, had acquired Grant Oil Country Tubular Company.[7]
In 1991, Weatherford acquired Petroleum Equipment Tools Company (PETCO).[7] Weatherford and HOMCO later merged operations to create Weatherford Services, the largest oil fishing/rental company in the world. In 1995, Weatherford merged with Enterra, becoming Weatherford Enterra Inc.[7]
In May 1998 Energy Ventures, since renamed EVI, Inc. and Weatherford Enterra, Inc. merged, creating the current company now known as Weatherford.[7][8] In the next two years, Weatherford added a number of well-organized brands to its expertise, including Dailey, Orwell, Energy Rentals, Whiting, Williams, BBL and ECD Northwest. Weatherford also created a stronger completion competence with the addition of well-known brands in the sector such as Petroline, Cardium, Nodeco, McAllister, Johnson Screens, Houston Well Screens, Arrow, and CIDRA.
In 2005, Weatherford acquired Precision Drilling Corporation’s Precision Energy Services and International Contract Drilling divisions.
In July 2007, the company was featured in news media reports questioning operations of the company's foreign subsidiary, Weatherford Oil Tool Middle East, which had offices and equipment in the nation of Sudan.[9] Since 1997, U.S. companies were forbidden by law to operate in Sudan, though foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies could still legally operate in that country if there was no involvement by the U.S. parent or any other U.S. person.[10] Nevertheless, in response to media and investor criticism, the company announced that it would divest itself of any foreign subsidiary operations in countries sanctioned by the United States.[10][11][11] The next year, Weatherford withdrew from activities in Sudan and donated its in-country equipment as well as providing additional equipment, supplies, and funding to Thirst No More, a humanitarian organization operating in Sudan.[12][13]
In 2008, the company announced that it was shifting its place of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland.[14] That same year, Weatherford completed its acquisition of V-Tech International, a pioneer in the development of mechanical power tong systems in the North Sea to improve rig safety.[15]
In May 2010, Weatherford's Leetsdale, Pennsylvania, facility accidentally released a cloud of ammonium persulfate that resulted in the evacuation of 500 workers from the surrounding industrial park.[16] In April 2014, Weatherford announced that its board of directors approved the relocation of its legal domicile to Ireland from Switzerland. The company will continue to maintain its operational office in Houston, Texas. [17]
On November 9, 2016, Weatherford announced the departure of Bernard J. Duroc-Danner, Chairman of the Board, President, and CEO. It also announced the appointment of Robert Rayne as Chairman of the Board and Krishna Shivram as Chief Executive Officer.[18]
On March 6, 2017, Weatherford announced the appointment of Mark A. McCollum as President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a member of the Board of Directors of Weatherford. In addition, the Company announced that Mr. William E. Macaulay has been appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors.[19]
Company focus[edit]
As an oil and natural gas drilling services company, Weatherford produces a variety of products and services for the oil and gas industry. These include drilling services, electronic well measurement and monitoring, completion, production, and evaluation products and services. In particular, the company has developed directional drilling services that can extend through miles of bedrock with great precision, and tubular running services that are used on almost half of the world’s deepwater drilling projects. The company has more sand screen systems installed worldwide than any other company, and production optimization systems in more than 100,000 wells around the world. Weatherford also offers intervention, completion, and decommissioning services for well owners, in addition to pipeline precommissioning, commissioning operations, and one of the world's most diverse fleets of inline inspection tools.[20][21]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
