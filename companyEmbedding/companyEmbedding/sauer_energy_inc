Sauer Energy


Its VAWT systems are especially designed to attach to buildings. Their wind turbine
    products are designed to reduce power consumption and backup power shortages at home.
    
Sauer Energy Inc.
 Sauer Energy Inc. is a development stage firm that manufactures wind turbines for
    residential and commercial uses. The company is a leading developer and manufacturer
    in the renewable energy industry. It revealed its first ever prototype last May 2011
    at the WindPower Conference and Exhibition, the grandest wind energy trade show in
    the North American continent. 

The company’s WindPower model is aimed at providing a solution using wind capture
    for domestic and small building utilization. In a matter of four years, the firm’s
    vision of wind turbines for the home is now a reality. The company is committed to
    bring this innovative system to homeowners and small business owners to help them
    lower energy cost. 
Sauer Energy Wind Turbine
 The three blade wind turbine is made from resin, plastic and a UV protecting composite
    and expected to last for around twenty years. They offer wind turbines made from
    state of the art materials and even offer a ten year guarantee. 

The Sauer Energy concave and convex design takes advantage of the optimum wind power.
    Its vertical design reduces the weight and the gear box producing more energy with
    low/high speed capture. The vertical axis turbine can be easily installed by a single
    person, having only a few moving parts with it. Unlike the classic horizontal blade
    turbines, the WindCharger has the ability to generate energy even at 5 mph wind velocities.
    Moreover, the product is also able to capture winds blowing from any direction. It
    also has relatively low impact on bird populations and features a quiet operation.
    
Sauer Energy Stock
 Sauer Energy was transformed into a public company last 2010. This important milestone
    made the company open to new shareholders who are willing to invest in the selling
    and production of windmills for electricity. The firm is now known with its ticket
    symbol (SENY). With energy prices soaring higher, homes and small businesses are
    looking for ways to cut energy cost and minimize their carbon footprint. In the year
    2009, many investors poured a record of $155B in the alternative energy industry.
    In the next ten years, the wind energy is expected to grow 4x its current size. 

Sauer Energy Review
 Sauer Energy features promising products that will make use of an alternative energy
    source, the wind. As a developer and maker of enterprise scale and home scale wind
    turbine systems, the company has already secured its third patent from the USPTO
    for the next generation of vertical axis wind turbines. 

The company aims to a be an industry leader by concentrating their efforts on developing
    proprietary designs that will capture wind more efficiently with the less cost as
    possible. As a new public firm, the SENY has raised its visibility and enhanced its
    opportunities for growth. 



Sauer Energy
 Sauer Energy is a revolutionary home and enterprise scale wind turbine firm that
    addresses an unmet market demand. 

It is a cost effective and consumer friendly firm that capitalizes on a growing patent
    portfolio of vertical axis wind turbines.

Our expertise and finest quality products in the renewable energy arena are a testament to this as well. Let us never forget to respect and make the most positive use of nature’s  gifts to us. It’s time we all do our share.
WHY WE BELIEVE IN THE VERTICAL-AXIS WIND TURBINE (VAWT)
With energy prices spiraling out of control, many businesses are searching for ways to reduce and control energy costs. It is a trend that is also fostering a great deal of interest in renewable-energy options. Wind power is the fastest growing alternative energy segment.  It provides an attractive cost structure relative to other alternative energy and distributed generation solutions, such as co-generation and solar power.
The wind power market has been dominated by large horizontal wind turbines.  They have the traditional blade design that looks like a giant fan clustered mostly on “wind farms” located in rural areas. These large systems seriously compromise the ability of many companies to take advantage of wind power right at their building or plant. This is due to the economics of horizontal wind turbines that favor large units, multiple-megawatt installations and current technology dynamics.
However, new advancements have come on line in recent years related to the VAWT.  Advancements, which include small wind inverters utilizing MPPT, blade construction and permanent magnet generator (PMG) design.  VAWTs address a number of the large horizontal wind turbine technology's known shortcomings, such as noise pollution, minimum blade speed threshold, bird endangerment and space limitation, which further enhances its own advantages.
System Design
The vertical-axis design is a compact turbine design that can be sited on location without being intrusive and has been designed to be integrated directly into existing buildings. This size advantage allows for structures as small as an office building or as large as a hospital to utilize the benefits of a VAWT.
Economically, onsite installations dramatically improve the return on investment of wind power, not to mention the rebates now in the offering. Power generated offsite, such as at wind farms, is still subject to transmission and distribution charges. Conversely, onsite solutions take a portion of the organizational power requirements "off the grid."
Blade Speed
A traditional horizontal blade design turbine of similar size requires a greater level of wind speed to generate power. The vertical axis turbine design also provides omni-directional wind collection.  The torque produced allows it to make power while turning at slower blade speeds.
It only takes a 8 mph wind to turn the blades. One benefit of this feature is obvious: It can work at locations with lower average wind speeds. Therefore, the geographic option for using wind energy is greatly expanded; a company may not need to be located on a hilltop or in coastal locations to reap the benefits. Plus, it reduces wind direction limitations, because it can collect wind power on a 360-degree basis. Horizontal blade technology must spend time and energy turning into the wind when the wind changes direction.
Environmental Impact
The slower blade tip speed has environmental improvements as well. First, it is very quiet when operating. Unlike traditional wind turbines, the vertical axis turbine has the blades connected at both ends, and the blades do not swing by the tower and create noise. Also, with no high-speed wing tips exposed, the vertical axis turbine has a relatively low impact on bird populations.

Our passion is to provide the most innovative energy technology without a negative impact to our planet. This is our earth and we cherish its resources. We believe our environment is the hope for the future and Sauer Energy’s philosophy supports this belief. Our expertise and finest quality products in the renewable energy arena are a testament to this as well. Let us never forget to respect and make the most positive use of nature’s  gifts to us. It’s time we all do our share.
WHY WE BELIEVE IN THE VERTICAL-AXIS WIND TURBINE (VAWT)
With energy prices spiraling out of control, many businesses are searching for ways to reduce and control energy costs. It is a trend that is also fostering a great deal of interest in renewable-energy options. Wind power is the fastest growing alternative energy segment.  It provides an attractive cost structure relative to other alternative energy and distributed generation solutions, such as co-generation and solar power.
The wind power market has been dominated by large horizontal wind turbines.  They have the traditional blade design that looks like a giant fan clustered mostly on “wind farms” located in rural areas. These large systems seriously compromise the ability of many companies to take advantage of wind power right at their building or plant. This is due to the economics of horizontal wind turbines that favor large units, multiple-megawatt installations and current technology dynamics.
However, new advancements have come on line in recent years related to the VAWT.  Advancements, which include small wind inverters utilizing MPPT, blade construction and permanent magnet generator (PMG) design.  VAWTs address a number of the large horizontal wind turbine technology's known shortcomings, such as noise pollution, minimum blade speed threshold, bird endangerment and space limitation, which further enhances its own advantages.
System Design
The vertical-axis design is a compact turbine design that can be sited on location without being intrusive and has been designed to be integrated directly into existing buildings. This size advantage allows for structures as small as an office building or as large as a hospital to utilize the benefits of a VAWT.
Economically, onsite installations dramatically improve the return on investment of wind power, not to mention the rebates now in the offering. Power generated offsite, such as at wind farms, is still subject to transmission and distribution charges. Conversely, onsite solutions take a portion of the organizational power requirements "off the grid."
Blade Speed
A traditional horizontal blade design turbine of similar size requires a greater level of wind speed to generate power. The vertical axis turbine design also provides omni-directional wind collection.  The torque produced allows it to make power while turning at slower blade speeds.
It only takes a 8 mph wind to turn the blades. One benefit of this feature is obvious: It can work at locations with lower average wind speeds. Therefore, the geographic option for using wind energy is greatly expanded; a company may not need to be located on a hilltop or in coastal locations to reap the benefits. Plus, it reduces wind direction limitations, because it can collect wind power on a 360-degree basis. Horizontal blade technology must spend time and energy turning into the wind when the wind changes direction.
Environmental Impact
The slower blade tip speed has environmental improvements as well. First, it is very quiet when operating. Unlike traditional wind turbines, the vertical axis turbine has the blades connected at both ends, and the blades do not swing by the tower and create noise. Also, with no high-speed wing tips exposed, the vertical axis turbine has a relatively low impact on bird populations.

					THE OPPORTUNITY			

 

 

 





“Wind power led all technologies in new power generation in 2015”, said GWEC Secretary General Steve Sawyer. Wind energy is now the world’s fastest growing source of energy. The forecast in the next twenty years is that it will expand at exorbitant rates.
The United States Department of Energy (DOE), the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have all stated that 20% of the nation’s total consumable electricity can come from renewable wind energy within the next twenty years. This would result in cumulative wind turbine sales of over $250 billion to $500 billion.
The growth is driven from numerous factors in which realization that oil, natural gas and coal supplies are diminishing while the world demand is increasing. Taken into further consideration is that currently the use of these contribute to pollution and global warming, not to mention that the cost to produce and the rising prices have exploited the end user. The use of nuclear power has a substantial risk for large scale side effects. Currently, the world has refocused on renewable energy resources, of which wind energy is in the forefront.
One of the most compelling reasons wind turbines are expected to continue their strong growth rate for decades to come is that the cost per kWh of energy produced is expected to be the cheapest source of energy.
Like many other alternative energies, wind energy does not require any fuel. Therefore, it can generate electricity as long as the wind blows. Wind energy is also one of the cleanest forms of alternative energy. In fact, according to the United States Department of Energy's Wind Energy Program, a single utility scale wind turbine (500 kW) displaces approximately 500 tons of CO2 emissions annually, based on the current U.S. energy mix's average emissions.
According to the AWEA, clean wind energy avoids significant carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions annually by displacing generation from fossil fuel power plants. In 2015, the 191 million megawatt-hours (MWh) generated by wind energy avoided an estimated 132 million metric tons of CO2, the equivalent of reducing power sector CO2 emissions by 6%, or the equivalent emissions of 28.1 million cars.
Sauer Energy’s VAWT systems intend to be among the lowest cost wind energy producers. Our turbines can be produced and manufactured on a large scale in fabrication factories throughout the world. The installation cost of our turbines will be considerably less the cost of horizontal axis wind turbines. Because of their direct-drive system, they are less expensive to maintain and repair. Their key parts are few and at ground level.
The world over, governments are taking action to advance renewable wind energy. More and more states are mandatorily commissioning renewable energy. At the local government level, utility companies are being obligated to provide renewable energy to meet escalating demand. An international trading program has begun for carbon and renewable energy credits, thus providing the full support of wind energy. Lucrative incentives in the form of rebates and tax credits are being offered to offset the initial expense and demonstrate how committed our government is to renewable energy.
The availability and reliability of wind energy will expand the use where and when it is needed. Present technological trends will likely lend to a long-term future where wind provides the majority of the primary power resources for the planet. Sauer Energy is planning to be instrumental in providing a significant percentage of fulfilling this output.
We cannot forget the one and only fact that we must take care of our earth and the earth will take care of us.
