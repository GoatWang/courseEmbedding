The Security, Class, and CUSIP columns in the table below are shown exactly as filed by the investor.
        We do our best to track continuity of investments through acquisitions, and this will be reflected in
        the table as changes in names and cusips.
In addition to descriptive data, performance of the investment
        is shown over time. To calculate quarterly performance, we first calculate cost basis of the shares purchased during the quarter, then use
            that to calculate gross profit. Quarterly return is Gross Profit / Starting Portfolio value.
Note that cost basis is calculated and stored in thousands, so small quarterly changes in shares frequently
            result in a cost basis of zero.

Flannery said he is embarking on an in-depth review of the entire company and its numerous business lines — an array of manufacturing operations ranging from MRI machines to train engines to wind turbines.
Meanwhile, Bornstein, the CFO, has been promoted to vice chairman.The Long: However, Immelt, in an interview, said the transition had been in the works for several years, with a long-established goal of picking a successor by this summer.
Flannery said he is embarking on an in-depth review of the entire company and its numerous business lines — an array of manufacturing operations ranging from MRI machines to train engines to wind turbines.
Flannery still needs to ensure a smooth integration of GE’s recently acquired Alstom energy business and complete the merger of GE’s oil-and-gas equipment operations with Baker Hughes, a deal that won approval from the Justice Department on Monday.
GE’s announcement about the leadership change comes about one month after Immelt joined with Governor Charlie Baker and Mayor Martin J.

In March, GE agreed to deepen cost cuts after discussions with the activist investor.The Long: In a sign of just how great opposition to Immelt had become in the investing community, the stock soared the most in 20 months.
The new boss was seen as a big thinker who could guide GE into the digital age and do so with a lighter touch than his cutthroat predecessor.
Immelt hasn’t shied away from major acquisitions to sharpen the focus on making jet engines, medical scanners and gas turbines, including the $10 billion purchase of Alstom SA’s energy business.
In March, GE agreed to deepen cost cuts after discussions with the activist investor.
Immelt will retire with at least $112 million, mostly from supplemental pension plans at the industrial giant, according to a Bloomberg analysis.Jeff Immelt stepping down as CEO of GEJeff Immelt is stepping down as CEO of GE - Image from CNNMoneyThe Short: Jeff Immelt stepping down as CEO of GE

"Immelt's vision has positioned GE for the future and greatly strengthened the GE culture." Shareholders, though, have not been happy with the company's financial performance over the past decade under Immelt's leadership, Barclays' Davis told CNBC.
The CEO was struggling to connect with investors, and now many are expecting "fairly dramatic changes" under Flannery, he said.
"And he has done so with unflinching integrity and a commitment to executing on a bold vision for future success."

When Mr Immelt became CEO, his biggest challenge was escaping the shadow of Mr Welch, a man under whom GE was regularly named "the world's most admired company" and who was described by The Economist, no less, as "the Princess Diana of business".The Long: When Mr Immelt became CEO, his biggest challenge was escaping the shadow of Mr Welch, a man under whom GE was regularly named "the world's most admired company" and who was described by The Economist, no less, as "the Princess Diana of business".
During his two decades at the top, Mr Welch - nicknamed "Neutron Jack" for the way he could leave buildings intact while removing the employees in them - took GE's annual sales from $25bn to $111bn and its annual profits from $1.4bn to $11bn, while somehow managing to keep GE's unusual spread of businesses together at a time when its rivals were having to focus or break themselves up.
Mr Welch was a brutal boss, firing the bottom 10% of GE's managers each year regardless of how well the company was performing as a whole, but he got results.
When Mr Immelt took the helm, he was almost immediately forced to manage the business through the shocking aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks, which not only cost the company's insurance division an estimated $600m but also battered demand for the company's jet engines.
Taking their place as having greater strategic value was healthcare, which was pumped up by the 2003 acquisition of British healthcare technology company Amersham for £5.7bn and energy, on which Mr Immelt spent getting on for $25bn in acquisitions.General Electric picks a new bossJohn Flannery will have more room to provide positive surprises - Image from The EconomistThe Short: General Electric picks a new boss
First, Mr Immelt was slow to recognise just how dangerous GE’s financial arm was.The Long: Tall, affable and energetic, he was picked to run General Electric in 2001 after an interminable and mildly sadistic selection process run by GE’s then CEO, Jack Welch, at the time America’s most celebrated boss.
GE was not in nearly as good a shape as Mr Welch liked to pretend.
First, Mr Immelt was slow to recognise just how dangerous GE’s financial arm was.
Mr Immelt deserves plaudits for shutting most of it down in 2015, but by then the damage was done.
Mr Immelt’s reshuffling of it was huge, with disposals and acquisitions equivalent to 167% of its current capital employed.General Electric 44 W Tantalum Light Bulb - Graphite/Charcoal 5.5" x 11.5"READ MORE FROM READ MORE FROM General Electric 44 W Tantalum Light Bulb - Graphite/Charcoal 5.5" x 11.5"
