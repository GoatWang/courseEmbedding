Frank H. Merlotti Jr.
President, Premium Group
 Frank Merlotti Jr. is the president, Premium Group, for Steelcase Inc., the global leader in the office furniture industry. Steelcase delivers a better work experience to its customers by providing products, services and insights into the ways people work. Its portfolio includes architecture, furniture and technology products.
Appointed to this role in October 2006, Frank is responsible for leading the development of a new high-design brand that includes the offerings of three Steelcase companies: Brayton International, Designtex and Metro Furniture.
Previously, Frank was president of Steelcase North America (September 2002 – October 2006). In that role, he had total responsibility for Steelcase’s North American business and was responsible for helping to grow and advance its strategic vision. He also provided leadership for all sales and marketing activities related to Steelcase’s core business in the United States and Canada.
Frank’s prior experience with Steelcase includes eight years (1991-1999) as president and CEO of the Metropolitan Furniture Company, a Steelcase Design Partnership company in San Francisco. While at Metro, he led the development of a portfolio of user-centered products that resulted in steady top-line growth and improved profitability.
Frank’s career in business began in 1977 with Terpstra Associates, a manufacturer’s rep firm in Detroit. In 1985, Terpstra joined with G&T Industries, a leading supplier of foam and soft-surface materials to the office furniture industry. Frank took over management of G&T’s Business Furniture Division until 1991, when he left for Metro.
In 1999, Frank returned to G&T as president and CEO, a position he held until assuming his current role at Steelcase.
Born in 1950 in St. Louis, Frank grew up in Grand Rapids. He spent eight years traveling as a jazz drummer before beginning his career in business.
Frank is a member of the boards of BIFMA, Trex Co. Inc. and the Institute of Design. He is co-chair of the American Cancer Society’s Hope Lodge Capital Campaign; chair of the United Way Campaign Cabinet; and is active in programs for United Way, in mentoring programs for Grand Rapids Public Schools, and in his church. He and his wife, Susan, live in East Grand Rapids and have three children.

We calculate incremental gross margins of 90% in 2016, which are expected to normalize in the 45% to 50% range for 2017.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Trex Company (NYSE:TREX) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 3 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.50)Consensus Price Target: $67.75 (7.43% downside)
