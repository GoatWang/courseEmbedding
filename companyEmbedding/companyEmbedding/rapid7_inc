Rapid7 Stock Sees Short Interest Move 15% Lower
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 11/15/2016 settlement date, which shows a 313,562 share decrease in total short interest for Rapid7 Inc , to 1,796,463, a decrease of 14.86% since 10/31/2016. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

The Metasploit Project is a computer security project that provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in penetration testing and IDS signature development.
Its best-known sub-project is the open source[2] Metasploit Framework, a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine. Other important sub-projects include the Opcode Database, shellcode archive and related research.
The Metasploit Project is well known for its anti-forensic and evasion tools, some of which are built into the Metasploit Framework.

History[edit]
Metasploit was created by H. D. Moore in 2003 as a portable network tool using Perl. By 2007, the Metasploit Framework had been completely rewritten in Ruby.[3] On October 21, 2009, the Metasploit Project announced[4] that it had been acquired by Rapid7, a security company that provides unified vulnerability management solutions.
Like comparable commercial products such as Immunity's Canvas or Core Security Technologies' Core Impact, Metasploit can be used to test the vulnerability of computer systems or to break into remote systems. Like many information security tools, Metasploit can be used for both legitimate and unauthorized activities. Since the acquisition of the Metasploit Framework, Rapid7 has added two open core proprietary editions called Metasploit Express and Metasploit Pro.
Metasploit's emerging position as the de facto exploit development framework[5] led to the release of software vulnerability advisories often accompanied[6] by a third party Metasploit exploit module that highlights the exploitability, risk and remediation of that particular bug.[7][8] Metasploit 3.0 began to include fuzzing tools, used to discover software vulnerabilities, rather than just exploits for known bugs. This avenue can be seen with the integration of the lorcon wireless (802.11) toolset into Metasploit 3.0 in November 2006. Metasploit 4.0 was released in August 2011.
Metasploit Framework[edit]
The basic steps for exploiting a system using the Framework include:

Choosing and configuring an exploit (code that enters a target system by taking advantage of one of its bugs; about 900 different exploits for Windows, Unix/Linux and Mac OS X systems are included);
Optionally checking whether the intended target system is susceptible to the chosen exploit;
Choosing and configuring a payload (code that will be executed on the target system upon successful entry; for instance, a remote shell or a VNC server);
Choosing the encoding technique so that the intrusion-prevention system (IPS) ignores the encoded payload;
Executing the exploit.

This modular approach – allowing the combination of any exploit with any payload – is the major advantage of the Framework. It facilitates the tasks of attackers, exploit writers and payload writers.
Metasploit runs on Unix (including Linux and Mac OS X) and on Windows. The Metasploit Framework can be extended to use add-ons in multiple languages.
To choose an exploit and payload, some information about the target system is needed, such as operating system version and installed network services. This information can be gleaned with port scanning and OS fingerprinting tools such as Nmap. Vulnerability scanners such as Nexpose, Nessus, and OpenVAS can detect target system vulnerabilities. Metasploit can import vulnerability scanner data and compare the identified vulnerabilities to existing exploit modules for accurate exploitation.[9]
Metasploit interfaces[edit]
There are several interfaces for Metasploit available. The most popular are maintained by Rapid7 and Strategic Cyber LLC.[10]
Metasploit Framework Edition[edit]
The free version. It contains a command line interface, third-party import, manual exploitation and manual brute forcing. This free version of metasploit project also includes Zenmap , a well known ports-scanner and a compiler for Ruby , the language in which this version of metasploit was written. [10]
Metasploit Community Edition[edit]
In October 2011, Rapid7 released Metasploit Community Edition, a free, web-based user interface for Metasploit. Metasploit Community is based on the commercial functionality of the paid-for editions with a reduced set of features, including network discovery, module browsing and manual exploitation. Metasploit Community is included in the main installer.
Metasploit Express[edit]
In April 2010, Rapid7 released Metasploit Express, an open-core commercial edition for security teams who need to verify vulnerabilities. It offers a graphical user interface, integrates nmap for discovery, and adds smart bruteforcing as well as automated evidence collection.
Metasploit Pro[edit]
In October 2010, Rapid7 added Metasploit Pro, an open-core commercial Metasploit edition for penetration testers. Metasploit Pro adds onto Metasploit Express with features such as Quick Start Wizards/MetaModules, building and managing social engineering campaigns, web application testing, an advanced Pro Console, dynamic payloads for anti-virus evasion, integration with Nexpose for ad-hoc vulnerability scans, and VPN pivoting.
Armitage[edit]
Armitage is a graphical cyber attack management tool for the Metasploit Project that visualizes targets and recommends exploits. It is a free and open source network security tool notable for its contributions to red team collaboration allowing for shared sessions, data, and communication through a single Metasploit instance.[11]
Cobalt Strike[edit]
Cobalt Strike is a collection of threat emulation tools provided by Strategic Cyber LLC to work with the Metasploit Framework. Cobalt Strike includes all features of Armitage and adds post-exploitation tools, in addition to report generation features.[12]
Exploits[edit]
Metasploit currently has over 1613 exploits, organized in different categories like:

Firefox is a collection of (mostly) remote code execution for this browser.
Android and Apple's iOs are dedicated to mobile phone.
Linux, Windows, BSD, Irix, Solaris, … are targeting specific operating systems
Multi for exploits that aren't tied to a specific platform

Payloads[edit]
Metasploit currently has over 438 payloads. Some of them are:

Command shell enables users to run collection scripts or run arbitrary commands against the host.
Meterpreter enables users to control the screen of a device using VNC and to browse, upload and download files.
Dynamic payloads enables users to evade anti-virus defenses by generating unique payloads.

Contributors[edit]
Metasploit Framework operates as an open-source project and accepts contributions from the community through GitHub.com pull requests.[13] Submissions are reviewed by a team consisting of both Rapid7 employees and senior external contributors. The majority of contributions add new modules, such as exploits or scanners.[14]
List of original developers:

H. D. Moore (founder and chief architect)
Matt Miller (core developer from 2004–2008)
spoonm (core developer from 2003–2008)

Vulnerability management software to help you act at the moment of impact

Vulnerabilities pop up every day. You need constant intelligence to discover them, locate them, prioritize them for your business, and confirm your exposure has been reduced. Nexpose, Rapid7’s on-premise option for vulnerability management software, monitors exposures in real-time and adapts to new threats with fresh data, ensuring you can always act at the moment of impact.
If you’re looking for more advanced capabilities such as Remediation Workflow and the Rapid7 Universal Agent, check out our platform-based vulnerability management software, InsightVM.  










Verdict: For a large enterprise – really, no matter how large – this product is well worth your consideration. It brings the power of significant functionality with a history of reliability and excellent support options.
– SC Magazine







Nexpose gives me live vulnerability data that updates the second my environment changes.
– Publicly traded global technology company







Rapid7 Nexpose is simple to use and still meets the bank's security needs even after the organization doubled in size. Today Bridgehampton National Bank receives stellar audits and relies upon Nexpose to scan hundreds of workstations and a virtualized server environment.
– Thomas Simson Chief Information Officer, Bridgehampton National Bank







Nexpose's prioritization is automatic, which saves me almost 140 hours of work compared to prioritizing it manually. Rapid7 security solutions allow me to automate the scanning and reporting features, which saves me at least 10 hours in asset discovery and reporting.
– Allen Basey, Senior Security Analyst, Mass Pharma







Rapid7 Nexpose provides insight into PNRHA's security posture with automated reporting that increases efficiency and helps prioritize tasks.
– Jarvis Meier Senior Security Analyst, Prairie North Regional Health Authority
























Get a Real-Time View of Risk
How stale is your data? A few days? A few weeks? With Nexpose, you’ll never act on intel older than a few seconds. Our vulnerability management software collects and analyzes data in real-time, giving you a live view of your risk, 24/7.

Get a Real-Time View of Risk

Instantly access, query, and share the most up-to-date insight on your risk via dynamic dashboards called Liveboards.
Detect new devices and vulnerabilities as soon as they enter your network with Adaptive Security.
Glean data from a number of sources, including agents, Rapid7's Sonar research project, VMWare and AWS integrations, and Adaptive Security.























Know Where to Focus
Most scanners score risk using a High/Medium/Low scale or the 1-10 CVSS scale. But when you have 400 highs, where do you start? Nexpose provides a more actionable 1-1000 risk score. We look at the vulnerability’s age, what exploits are available for it, and which malware kits use it to help you prioritize the highest risk vulnerabilities. If you have time to fix only 10 things today, fix where attackers will focus.

Attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities to locate individual users' devices, and in some cases, alter geolocation data for those devices. The table below briefly summarizes the twelve vulnerabilities identified across three products. VulnerabilityDeviceR7 IDCVECleartext PasswordTrackR BravoR7-2016-18.1CVE-2016-6538Tracking ID ExposedTrackR BravoR7-2016-18.2CVE-2016-6539Unauthenticated AccessTrackR BravoR7-2016-18.3CVE-2016-6540Unauthenticated PairingTrackR BravoR7-2016-18.4CVE-2016-6541Tracking ID ExposediTrack EasyR7-2016-20.1CVE-2016-6542Duplicate RegistrationiTrack EasyR7-2016-20.2CVE-2016-6543Unauthenticated ModificationiTrack EasyR7-2016-20.3CVE-2016-6544Weak Session ManagementiTrack EasyR7-2016-20.4CVE-2016-6545Base64 Encoded PasswordiTrack EasyR7-2016-20.5CVE-2016-6546Cleartext PasswordZizai Tech NutR7-2016-22.1CVE-2016-6547Session Token LeakedZizai Tech NutR7-2016-22.2CVE-2016-6548Unauthenticated PairingZizai Tech NutR7-2016-22.3CVE-2016-6549 Credit These issues were discovered by Deral Heiland and Adam Compton of Rapid7, Inc. and disclosed in accordance with Rapid7's disclosure policy. Product Description Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device trackers are small hardware tokens that are designed to be attached to personal items such as keyrings, wallets, or purses. These devices pair with the user's smartphone via Bluetooth, and can alert the user when the device moves out of range. The tracking hardware tokens themselves do not maintain network connections, but rely on associated smartphone apps to report geolocation data. The devices examined were the TrackR Bravo from TrackR, the iTrack Easy from KKMCM.com, and the Nut from Zizai Tech. The Tile from TILE, Inc. was also examined, but none of these issues were discovered with this product, aside from a minor screenshot caching issue which does not appear to reveal private information. Vulnerability Details For each product, vulnerability details and possible mitigations are discussed below. Users concerned about these issues should reach out to their respective vendors using their normal support mechanisms, and update their mobile applications when fixes are released. Until vendor-supplied fixes are available, the risks associated with these vulnerabilities should be weighed against the benefits of continuing to use these tracker devices and applications. Most of the vulnerabilities described are only exploitable by an adversary who is in close physical proximity to the affected devices; the effective range of an exploit is noted on the summary table for each vendor.R7-2016-18: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Trackr Bravo VulnerabilityR7 IDCVERangeCleartext PasswordR7-2016-18.1CVE-2016-6538Local DeviceTracking ID ExposedR7-2016-18.2CVE-2016-6539BluetoothUnauthenticated AccessR7-2016-18.3CVE-2016-6540InternetUnauthenticated PairingR7-2016-18.4CVE-2016-6541Bluetooth The TrackR mobile app also caches screenshots when minimized; while no critical information appears to be exposed in this way, it is a best practice to clear unique data and use a generic application image for context switching.R7-2016-18.1: Cleartext Password (CVE-2016-6538)Examination of the TrackR Bravo mobile application running on an iPad revealed that the account password used to authenticate to the cloud API was stored in cleartext in the cache.db. Examining the cache.db file reveals the cleartext password as shown in Figure 1.Given typical user habits of password reuse, this sort of password disclosure can impact other online services. Mitigation for R7-2016-18.1A vendor-supplied patch should configure the mobile app to prevent storing potentially sensitive information such as passwords in cleartext. While some local storage is likely necessary for normal functionality, such information should be stored in an encrypted format that requires device authentication. Users are strongly advised to avoid reusing passwords between services whenever possible in order to limit the damaging effects of accidental or intentional exposure of account credentials. R7-2016-18.2: Device Tracking ID Exposed (CVE-2016-6539)The TrackR device ID can be obtained by being in close proximity to a TrackR device and utilizing a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) application to monitor for BLE devices. The TrackR ID is the manufacturer device ID, which is constructed of a manufacture identifier of four zeroes (0000), followed by the BLE MAC address in reverse (0f7c-XXXXXXd9) for a combined TrackR ID of 00000f7c-XXXXXXd9. This is shown in Figure 2. Mitigation for R7-2016-18.2A vendor-supplied patch should change the tracker ID so that is not directly related to the manufacturer device ID, nor the device's BLE MAC address. Absent a vendor-supplied patch, users should be mindful of when they use the TrackR device in public spaces, as this ID can be reused on the cloud-hosted service to track devices (and therefore, the user) remotely as described in R7-2016-18.3. R7-2016-18.3: Unauthenticated Access (CVE-2016-6540)Unauthenticated access to the cloud-based service maintained by the vendor is allowed for querying or sending GPS data. Authentication appears to only be used to sync data back to the mobile application during application install or reinstall. An adversary can access GPS data for any TrackR device from any web browser without authentication by using the tracker ID number (Figure 3), which can be discovered while being in Bluetooth range, as described above as R7-2016-18.2. The URL format is https://phonehalocloud.appspot.com/rest/tracker/00000f7c-XXXXXXd9. Mitigation for R7-2016-18.3A vendor-supplied patch to the cloud service should enable authentication before GPS data can be queried or written to the via the cloud service API. Absent a vendor-supplied patch, users should be mindful of when they use the TrackR device in public which will expose the device ID, as described in R7-2016-18.2. R7-2016-18.4: Unauthenticated Pairing (CVE-2016-6541)TrackR Bravo device allows unauthenticated Bluetooth pairing, which allows unauthenticated connected applications to write data to various device attributes. In the below example, this vulnerability allowed the device's advertised name to be changed via BLE - Generic Access 0x1800 Device name 0x2A00 as shown in Figure 4:This lack of write access authorization also allows an adversary to enable the device's remote alarm, triggering the alarm to both cause annoyance and drain the device's battery. Figure 5 describes this access via "BLE - Generic Access 0x1802 Device name 0x2A06."  Mitigation for R7-2016-18.4While the device is designed to pair with any nearby application to perform crowd-sourced, opportunistic geolocation services, a vendor-supplied patch should enable proper authenticated pairing for write access so only the authorized user's mobile application can pair and alter data on the device. Absent a vendor-supplied patch, users should be mindful using the TrackR device in public spaces. R7-2016-20: Multiple Vulnerabilities in iTrack Easy VulnerabilityR7 IDCVERangeTracking ID ExposedR7-2016-20.1CVE-2016-6542BluetoothDuplicate RegistrationR7-2016-20.2CVE-2016-6543InternetUnauthenticated ModificationR7-2016-20.3CVE-2016-6544InternetWeak Session ManagementR7-2016-20.4CVE-2016-6545WLAN The iTrack mobile app also caches screenshots when minimized; while no critical information appears to be exposed in this way, it is a best practice to clear unique data and use a generic application image for context switching. R7-2016-20.1: Tracking ID Exposed (CVE-2016-6542)The iTrack device tracking ID number, also called "LosserID" in the web API, can be obtained by being in range of an iTrack device. The tracker ID is the device's BLE MAC address, as shown in Figure 6.  Mitigations for R7-2016-20.1A vendor-supplied patch should change the tracker ID so that is not directly related to the manufacturer device ID, nor the device's BLE MAC address. Absent a vendor-supplied patch, users should be mindful of when they use the iTrack device in public spaces, as this ID can be reused on the cloud-hosted service to track devices (and therefore, the user) remotely as described in R7-2016-20.2 and R7-2016-20.3. R7-2016-20.2: Duplicate Registration (CVE-2016-6543)A captured device MAC/losserid can be registered under multiple user accounts, as seen in Figure 7, allowing shared access to the cmd:getgps data. This getgps data value is set when an iTrack device comes into detection range of another user's iTrack mobile application. The mobile application then sets the getgps GPS data for that detected device's losserID with the cmd:setothergps. This vulnerability can be exploited by an adversary to register the authorized user's device, and therefore gain access to GPS data any time the device comes in proximity of a running instance of the iTrack mobile application. Mitigations for R7-2016-20.2A vendor-supplied patch should prevent the duplicate registration of devices. Absent a vendor-supplied patch, users should be mindful of using the iTrack device in public spaces, as described in R7-2016-20.1. R7-2016-20.3: Unauthenticated Modification (CVE-2016-6544)The getgps data can be written without authentication by setting the data using the parametercmd:setothergps. An example of this is shown in Figure 8. This vulnerability can be exploited by an adversary to alter the GPS location data of a lost device. Mitigations for R7-2016-20.3A vendor-supplied patch should require authentication before allowing write access for the data stored for getgps. R7-2016-20.4: Weak Session Management (CVE-2016-6545)Session cookies are not used for maintaining valid sessions. The user's password is passed as a POST parameter over HTTPS using a base64 encoded passwd field on every request. An example of this is shown in Figure 9, collected using standard man-in-the-middle (MitM) techniques.It is a best practice to manage web service sessions with session cookies, rather than resending the user's password. Session cookies can be expired or invalidated upstream after a timeout period or in the event of a compromise. In this implementation, sessions can only be terminated when the user changes the associated password. Mitigations for R7-2016-20.4A vendor-supplied patch should enable proper session management. Absent a vendor-supplied patch, users should be mindful of when they use the iTrack device in public spaces and avoid connecting their mobile device to an unknown or open, public WiFi access point. R7-2016-20.5: Cleartext, Base64-Encoded Password (CVE-2016-6546)Examination of the iTrack Easy mobile application running on an iPad revealed that the account password used to authenticate to the cloud API was stored in a cleartext format in the cache.db. Examining the cache.db file reveals the base64-encoded password as shown in Figure 10.Given typical user habits of password reuse, this sort of password disclosure can impact other online services. Mitigation for R7-2016-20.5A vendor-supplied patch should configure the mobile app to prevent storing potentially sensitive information such as passwords in cleartext. While some local storage is likely necessary for normal functionality, such information should be stored in an encrypted format that requires device authentication. Users are strongly advised to avoid reusing passwords between services whenever possible in order to limit the damaging effects of accidental or intentional exposure of account credentials. R7-2016-22: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Zizai Tech Nut VulnerabilityR7 IDCVERangeCleartext PasswordR7-2016-22.1CVE-2016-6547Local DeviceSession Token LeakedR7-2016-22.2CVE-2016-6548WLANUnauthenticated PairingR7-2016-22.3CVE-2016-6549Bluetooth R7-2016-22.1: Cleartext Password (CVE-2016-6547)Examination of the Zizai Tech Nut mobile application running on an iPad revealed that the account password used to authenticate to the cloud API was stored in cleartext in the cache.db. Examining the cache.db file reveals the cleartext password as shown in Figure 11.Given typical user habits of password reuse, this sort of password disclosure can impact other online services. Mitigation for R7-2016-22.1A vendor-supplied patch should configure the mobile app to prevent storing potentially sensitive information such as passwords in cleartext. While some local storage is likely necessary for normal functionality, such information should be stored in an encrypted format that requires device authentication. Users are strongly advised to avoid reusing passwords between services whenever possible in order to limit the damaging effects of accidental or intentional exposure of account credentials. R7-2016-22.2: Session Token Leaked (CVE-2016-6548)Examination of the Nut mobile application running on an iPad revealed three requests which communicated without encryption (HTTP, rather than HTTPS). These requests contained the user's authenticated session token within the URL. Examples of these URLs are shown in the table below.  Feebackhttp://api.find.nutspace.com/api/v1/ios/feedback/create/6e105971003e5b0d8aefa8d7 524831eab347f6078e597755Noticeshttp://api.find.nutspace.com/notices?accessToken=6e105971003e5b0d8aefa8d7524831e ab347f6078e597755Storehttp://api.find.nutspace.com/api/v1/products?accessToken=6e105971003e5b0d8aefa8d 7524831eab347f6078e597755 An adversary can capture these requests and reuse the session token to gain full access to the user's account. An example of this technique is shown in Figure 12. Mitigation for R7-2016-22.2A vendor-supplied patch should configure the mobile app to always communicate over HTTPS, rather than the cleartext HTTP protocol. In addition, the mobile application should pass session tokens only via HTTP headers or as part of a POST request, rather than embedding the token in the URL. Absent a vendor-supplied patch, users should be mindful of when they use the Nut mobile application in public spaces and avoid connecting their mobile device to an unknown or open, public WiFi access point. R7-2016-22.3: Unauthenticated Pairing (CVE-2016-6549)The Nut device allows unauthenticated Bluetooth pairing, which allows unauthenticated connected applications to write data to the device name attribute. In the below example, this vulnerability allowed the device's advertised name to be changed via BLE - Generic Access 0x1800 Device name 0x2A00 as shown in Figure 13:  Mitigation for R7-2016-22.3While the device is designed to pair with any nearby application to perform crowd-sourced, opportunistic geolocation services, a vendor-supplied patch should enable proper authenticated pairing for write access so only the authorized user's mobile application can pair and alter data on the device. Absent a vendor-supplied patch, users should be mindful using the Nut device in public spaces. Disclosure TimelineThis vulnerability is being disclosed in accordance with Rapid7's disclosure policy. Thu, Aug 25, 2016: Attempted contact with vendors.Fri, Sep 09, 2016: Disclosed details to CERT/CC as VU#617567, VU#974055, and VU#402847Fri, Sep 09, 2016: CVEs assigned by CERT/CCMon, Oct 17, 2016: Disclosed R7-2016-18 to TrackR as issue #295585.Tue, Oct 25, 2016: Public Disclosure.OutcomesThis content has been marked as final. 0 CommentsNameEmail AddressWebsite AddressName(Required)Email Address(Required, will not be published)Website Address Related ContentRetrieving data ...Recommended ContentInsightIDR AD Event Source - "Unable to get the time"Rapid7 acquires Komand for security orchestration and automationShiny Old VxWorks VulnerabilitiesNew VxWorks Vulnerabilitiessite schedule syntax with nexpose apiIncoming Links12 Days of HaXmas: 2016 IoT Research RecapResearch Lead (IoT)

The History of Rapid7
In 2000, Rapid7 founders, Alan Matthews, Tas Giakouminakis, and Chad Loder, were executives of a software company. Even then, they paid close attention to the challenges customers face, always looking for simple, innovative solutions. What they consistently heard from customers was that security was a huge and complex challenge for their organizations. Tas, Chad and Alan realized that good security starts with visibility - visibility into what’s on your network, your assets, the vulnerabilities and the prevalent threats. They saw that the industry lacked solutions for comprehensive security assessments that enabled smart decisions and the ability to act effectively. No single solution could identify vulnerabilities across the entire IT environment of network, hardware, software, web, and database components, while vulnerabilities abounded across all these areas. They decided to do something about it and Rapid7 was born. So how did we get our name? When the Company first launched, it was based in Midtown, New York. Alan, Tas and Chad traveled daily into the city on New York’s Rapid Transit system’s "Rapid7" train (you might notice our logo looks a bit like a bullet-train). With much of the planning and development for the Company discussed on that commute, it seemed only right to name the Company Rapid7. It was perfect! Today, the name embodies our Company's commitment to rapidly responding to our customers’ needs, their evolving IT environments, and the emerging threats they face, so we can help them keep moving forward. Our mission is to solve complex security challenges with simple, innovative solutions.

We estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of 6,450,000 shares
of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $93.1 million, or
approximately $107.5 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full, based on the initial public offering price of $16.00 per share,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. Our net proceeds from the concurrent private placement
will be $5.0 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock, and facilitate our
future access to the capital markets. Although we have not yet determined with
certainty the manner in which we will allocate the net proceeds of this
offering, we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering and the
concurrent private placement for working capital and other general corporate
purposes, including investments in sales and marketing in the United States and
internationally and in research and development. We also intend to use $18.6
million of the net proceeds to pay all remaining outstanding principal and
interest, together with a termination fee, under our term loan with Silicon
Valley Bank, which carries a current interest rate of 12% and expires in
December 2017. We may also use a portion of the proceeds from this offering for
acquisitions or strategic investments in complementary businesses or
technologies, although we do not currently have any plans for any such
acquisitions or investments. We have not allocated specific amounts of net
proceeds for any of these purposes.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private
placement represents our intentions based upon our present plans and business
conditions. We cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the
proceeds of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses
set forth above. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility
in applying the net proceeds of this offering. The timing and amount of our
actual expenditures will be based on many factors, including cash flows from
operations and the anticipated growth of our business. Pending their use, we
intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in a variety of
capital-preservation investments, including short- and intermediate-term,
interest-bearing investment-grade securities.


The market for cyber security solutions is highly fragmented, intensely
competitive and constantly evolving. We compete with an array of established and
emerging security software and services vendors. With the introduction of new
technologies and market entrants, we expect the competitive environment to
remain intense going forward. Our competitors include: vulnerability management
and assessment vendors, including Qualys and Tenable Network Security;
diversified security software and services vendors, including McAfee (a
subsidiary of Intel), IBM and HP; security services specialists, including
Mandiant (a subsidiary of FireEye); and providers of point solutions that
compete with some of the features present in our solutions.

We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including:

. product functionality;

. breadth of offerings;

. performance;

. brand name, reputation and customer satisfaction;

. ease of implementation, use and maintenance;

. total cost of ownership; and

. scalability, reliability and security.

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors and
that we are well positioned as a leading provider of cyber security and data
analytics products and professional services.


Company Description
Rapid7 is a leading provider of security data and analytics solutions that
enable organizations to implement an active, analytics-driven approach to cyber
security. Our security data and analytics platform was purpose built for today’s
increasingly complex and chaotic IT environment. We combine our


 extensive
experience in security data and analytics and deep insight into attacker
behaviors and techniques to make sense of the wealth of data available to
organizations about their IT environments and users. There has been an explosion
of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks as the proliferation of mobile
devices, cloud-based applications and solutions relying on user credentials has
eliminated the boundaries that previously defined an organization’s network
perimeter and expanded the threat surface that organizations must now defend.
Our powerful and proprietary analytics enable organizations to contextualize and
prioritize the threats facing their physical, virtual and cloud assets,
including those posed by the behaviors of their users. Leveraging our security
data and analytics platform, our solutions enable organizations to strategically
and dynamically manage their cyber security exposure. Our solutions empower
organizations to prevent attacks by providing visibility into vulnerabilities
and to rapidly detect compromises, respond to breaches and correct the
underlying causes of attacks. This balanced and analytics-focused approach
ultimately better secures organizations’ environments and reduces the likelihood
of, and risks associated with, cyber attacks. We believe our technology and
solutions revolutionize the practice of cyber security and are central and
critical to implementing a modern security program.

With our security data and analytics platform at our core, we are pioneering
active, analytics-driven solutions to cyber security that enable organizations
to find and eliminate critical weaknesses and detect attacks in their IT
environments. Our threat exposure management offerings include our
industry-leading vulnerability management products, which we enhance with deep
security analytics capabilities to quickly deliver contextual risk
prioritization, critical threat awareness and impactful remediation guidance.
Similarly, we added analytics and automation to traditional manual penetration
testing to be able to deliver robust ongoing attack simulation solutions that
provide organizations with visibility into real-world threats. By providing and
combining analytics and actionable insights related to both an organization’s
attack surface and the dynamic threat landscape, our security data and analytics
platform enables organizations to manage their threat exposure above and beyond
traditional vulnerability management products on the market. Further leveraging
our technology platform and analytics capabilities, we recently introduced our
incident detection product to provide organizations with the ability to rapidly
detect and respond to cyber security incidents and breaches. To complement our
incident detection product, we also recently introduced our incident response
services, which provide our customers with critical access to our security
experts and experience, enabling them to accelerate incident response and
containment. We also offer security advisory services that help organizations
develop a holistic approach to their cyber security programs and advance their
cyber security program maturity. All of our products have been designed with an
intuitive user interface, focused on ease-of-use and fast time-to-value for our
customers.

Cyber security has become a strategic imperative for organizations globally,
driven by increased focus by boards of directors and senior management in the
wake of numerous recent high profile breaches and data thefts. Organizations are
increasingly at risk of being compromised, with the number of reported security
incidents within enterprises increasing 48% in 2014 over the prior year,
according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. There are three converging
macro drivers that are changing the cyber security landscape for organizations
and driving the increase in cyber breaches. First, mobile and connected devices,
cloud-based applications and more open and interconnected networks have
increased IT complexity, expanding the exploitable attack surface across an
organization and resulting in more sources of potential vulnerability. Second,
there has been a dramatic change in the tools available to cyber attackers.
Attackers can now purchase highly effective and easy-to-use software at very low
cost that is designed to circumvent traditional prevention-based tools, thereby
lowering the bar for nearly anyone to launch advanced cyber attacks. Third, the
economic motives for attackers are more compelling, with new, vibrant markets
providing attackers an efficient and effective way to monetize stolen customer
information and employee data.

The confluence of these factors has rendered the old model of “block and
protect” prevention-based cyber security programs ineffective. These traditional
“block and protect” approaches to cyber security typically rely
disproportionately on network perimeter protection tools such as firewalls and
antivirus software to stop attackers. However, as the network perimeter rapidly
disappears, the effectiveness of these legacy solutions diminishes greatly.
Further, preventative solutions are generally not able to identify or deter
attacks that involve stolen or weak credentials, which are used in 76% of cyber
attacks according to the 2013 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report. When an
attacker gains access to an organization’s network through compromised
credentials or otherwise, the attacker can freely exploit assets within the
breached environment until they are detected, which took a median of 205 days in
2014 according to a report by Mandiant. The decreasing effectiveness of a
traditional prevention-focused approach to cyber security is causing a
significant shift to a new model that uses an active, analytics-driven approach
to reduce and manage risks to the organization. This new model disrupts the
historical focus on “block and protect” solutions and balances organizations’
investments in prevention, detection and correction to reduce the likelihood of,
and risks associated with, cyber attacks. Effective implementation of this new
model demands data and analytics to assess the effectiveness of tools and
programs, identify attacker behaviors and prioritize and remediate exposures.
Rapid7 empowers organizations to better secure their dynamic IT environments by
providing the security data and analytics that are at the core of a holistic and
active, analytics-driven approach to cyber security.

We were initially incorporated in July 2000 in Delaware. Rapid7 LLC, a limited
liability company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
was formed in January 2004. In August 2004, pursuant to an exchange agreement
among Rapid7 LLC and the stockholders of Rapid7, Inc., the stockholders
exchanged their shares in Rapid7, Inc. for equity interests in Rapid7 LLC, after
which Rapid7, Inc. was dissolved. In August 2008, Rapid7 LLC was merged with and
into Rapid7 LLC, a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company. Rapid7, Inc.
was reincorporated in Delaware in October 2011. In a series of transactions in
November 2011, equity holders of Rapid7 LLC exchanged their equity interests in
Rapid7 LLC for capital stock in Rapid7, Inc. and Rapid7 LLC became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Rapid7, Inc.
