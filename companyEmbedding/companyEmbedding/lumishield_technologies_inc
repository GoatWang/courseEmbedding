Biomedical
Specialized versions of LumiShield coatings could replace toxic chromium on wear-resistant surfaces in joint replacement implants.







Automotive
LumiShield coatings offer an elegant solution to galvanic corrosion issues arising from the use of steel fasteners in aluminum-framed vehicles.







Aerospace
LumiShield coatings are a less expensive alternative to vapor deposited aluminum coatings currently used in the aerospace industry.







Infrastructure
The ability to apply LumiShield coatings in open environments may substantially reduce the costs of placing protective layers on existing metallic structures.








Electronics
LumiShield technology will ultimately be adaptable to the production of transition metal alloy coatings, which have many applications in electronics manufacture.







Manufacturing
Once anodized, LumiShield coatings provide a strong, wear-resistant surface, which will see application in a variety of machine components and tools.







Marine
LumiShield coatings will show excellent resistance to saline environments, making them ideal for corrosion protection in maritime applications.







Consumer Goods
With a variety of finishes possible through co-plating and anodizing, LumiShield coatings offer a new look in consumer markets.




Metal corrosion costs the US economy $276 billion each year.
LumiShield can change that.
LumiShield’s technology has the potential to change the way the world handles metal corrosion. Commercialization of the LumiShield process will have impacts on many industries, including biomedical, automotive, aerospace, infrastructure, marine, electronics and consumer goods. LumiShield’s simplified process and lower metal costs will likely result in a decreased cost to the end user, which will allow LumiShield to rapidly create a place in the $6 billion metal coatings market.
In addition to its lower costs, LumiShield’s technology has already sparked interest from major manufacturing corporations for its potential to improve worker safety and reduce environmental impact. Cadmium and chromium – two of the most common anti-corrosion coatings – are harmful to the environment, and regulations on their use continue to become more restrictive. While some aluminum plating options already exist, those currently on the market require substantial operating costs to mitigate toxic vapor emissions and exclude atmospheric water which interferes with plating.
LumiShield’s technology has none of these limitations. Our company is leveraging advanced sciences to create electroplated aluminum products that will be safe for workers, better for the environment, and cheaper for companies.

        ﻿LumiShield has devised a solution to the challenge of corrosion of steel components. In our proprietary electroplating system, aluminum films in a variety of thicknesses may be deposited on steel. The electroplated aluminum layer created by the LumiShield process forms a hard, self-healing aluminum oxide layer upon contact with air, protecting the surface.
This process represents a major advance over current technology in a number of respects. It may be conducted in open vessels without production of organic vapors or interference from atmospheric water, meaning it can be conducted in existing electroplating equipment. Additionally, the large electrochemical window of the electrolyte grants greater freedom in operational parameters, and hence improved process flexibility.
Because the process can be conducted with full exposure to air, it can also be adapted to brush plating, which allows the fabrication of large and irregularly shaped components without the need for major capital equipment installations. Taken together, these technical advantages translate into improved versatility, diminished environmental impact, and reduced cost for LumiShield products.

Mission
LumiShield will create a world in which metal coatings need not be expensive or environmentally harmful. Advanced materials and processes can create solutions to technological problems, which produce superior results without increasing cost or environmental impact. LumiShield was founded to develop these improved solutions in the area of corrosion-resistant metal products. Existing coatings, such as chromium and cadmium, are both expensive and environmentally harmful. LumiShield technology uses a relatively harmless metal, aluminum, and a process which can be conducted in open vessels at ambient conditions without creating toxic vapors. These qualities allow LumiShield products to be produced less expensively without the historic environmental impacts of metal plating.
LumiShield’s mission is to revolutionize the metal plating industry by creating anti-corrosion products that are cost-effective and environmentally responsible. LumiShield aims to do this by using advanced materials and processes to develop aluminum electroplating technologies that can replace the harmful and expensive coating options currently on the market.

Release Date: February 21, 2017
Commercialization Success Recognized with Excellence in Technology Transfer Award


 Photo courtesy of LumiShield Technologies Inc. All rights reserved.  A technology developed by  researchers at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) and Carnegie  Mellon University (CMU) has been recognized with a prestigious Excellence in Technology Transfer Award from the Federal  Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer (FLC). The award, presented  annually, recognizes outstanding work by laboratory employees in transferring  technology developed in federal laboratories to the commercial marketplace.  The award-winning  technology is a revolutionary, cost-effective coating process to protect metal  products from corrosion. The process creates a protective barrier by  electrodepositing aluminum in place of heavy metals, such as chromium and  cadmium, which are expensive and environmentally harmful. The  new, “green” process represents a major advancement over current technology,  improving versatility, diminishing environmental impact, and reducing cost for  corrosion-resistant coatings.  LumiShield  Technologies, a Pittsburgh-based startup company, was established to advance  the technology into a commercial process. NETL’s Technology Transfer Program  Manager Jessica Sosenko praised LumiShield’s efforts. “The success of the technology  transfer process was directly related to the ability of LumiShield to secure  foundational seed funding from AECOM, one of NETL’s site support contractors,”  said Sosenko. “These funds were instrumental in advancing the technology  towards commercial readiness, allowing Lumishield representatives to  successfully negotiate separate exclusive licenses with CMU and NETL.” This novel fabrication technology has the potential to  change the way the world handles metal corrosion. Commercialization of the LumiShield  process will benefit many industries, including biomedical, automotive,  aerospace, infrastructure, marine, electronics, and consumer goods. The  simplified process and lower costs will likely result in a decreased cost to  the end user, which will allow LumiShield to rapidly carve out a place in the  $10 billion metal-coatings market. The potential of the technology has been  recognized by the local investment community, which has provided LumiShield  with financial support and business-development services. In addition, the  National Science Foundation has awarded LumiShield a $150,000 Small Business  Innovation Research Phase I award.  Commercialization of  technologies developed with stakeholder support will translate into job  creation and improved products for America’s citizens. The transfer of this  technology to the energy marketplace aligns with NETL’s mission to discover,  integrate, and mature technology solutions to enhance the nation’s energy  foundation and protect the environment for future generations.  FLC is a nationwide network of federal laboratories that  promotes the rapid transfer of laboratory research results and technologies  into the marketplace. NETL is one of more than 250 federal laboratories and  centers that comprise the FLC. Applications for this prestigious award were  reviewed by a panel of technology transfer experts representing industry, state and  local government, academia, and the federal laboratory system.  The award will be presented at a ceremony on Wednesday,  April 26, 2017, at the FLC National Meeting in San Antonio, Texas.
