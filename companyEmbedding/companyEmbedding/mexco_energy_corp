Oil and Gas Royalties
Mexco Energy Corporation has been engaged in the purchase  and development of oil and gas properties for over 38 years. Mexco's common stock is listed and trades on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol MXC.  Financial and other information regarding MXC can be found here and at www.sec.gov.
Mexco seeks to acquire proved oil and gas properties through the purchase of royalty, mineral and non-operated working interests. We focus primarily on acquiring natural gas reserves. We offer value to owners interested in selling their oil and gas interests based on independent engineering estimates.
Why would I sell my royalty, mineral or working interests?

Convert ordinary income of up to 40% in 2011 into lower federal capital gains rate taxes of 15% by selling before year end 2010 when capital gains taxes are scheduled to increase to 20% maximum under existing tax law. (Please consult your tax specialist.)
Provide a lump sum cash payout for an immediate need or other cash investment opportunity instead of periodic payments.
Eliminate  the extensive financial record keeping associated with owning oil and gas  properties.
Create opportunity to invest in assets that appreciate instead of depreciate in value and with more stability. Since oil and gas  production depletes the natural resource, the reserves are constantly depreciating. Market prices of oil and gas fluctuate resulting in fluctuating revenue checks.
Eliminate excessive property tax burdens that come with  the appraised value of oil and gas properties.
Simplify estate and/or trust management by eliminating  financial record keeping as stated above. Oil and gas interests divided among heirs of an estate in several ways may eventually become so trivial that maintaining the interests doesn't justify the work involved.
If you own a working interest, eliminate sometimes costly monthly operating expenses and the financial burden to eventually plug the well.

How do I receive an offer for my royalty, mineral or working  interests?
In order to make you an offer, we must first determine the current value of your interests. If you would like to request an offer, please  fill out the form linked below and Tammy McComic, our President and Chief Financial Officer will make contact with you. You may also contact Ms. McComic directly at (432)682-1119.
How is the value of my royalty, mineral or working interests determined?
A registered professional petroleum engineer paid for by Mexco performs an engineering and economic evaluation on your interests to determine a fair sales price. This includes analyzing historical production data and calculating production decline rates. This information is used to forecast future well performance, calculate remaining oil and gas reserves, and  predict future revenues and any asset retirement obligations. The NYMEX futures pricing also is used to help determine the current value of those reserves.
Requesting an offer or receiving an offer does not in any way obligate you to sell your interests.
If you do decide to sell your royalty, mineral or working interests after receiving our offer, we will finish our due diligence and  prepare the mineral deeds. We will assume all the costs associated with completing the sale including filing fees.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
