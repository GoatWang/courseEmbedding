What are analysts saying about TPI Composites stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about TPI Composites stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "TPI Composites, Inc. is the manufacturer of composite wind blades for the wind energy market. It operates primarily in the U.S., Mexico, China and Turkey. TPI Composites, Inc. is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona.   " (7/19/2017)
2. Canaccord Genuity analysts commented, "We continue to believe that ExOne gives investors a very compelling way to play the additive manufacturing space, and we think that shares are at quite attractive levels following the 4Q16 earnings report on March 16. The company has a significant opportunity within the industrial production space, and we think that global adoption of ExOne’s technologies is poised to expand. Moreover, we estimate that the company has a dominant market share within the sand binder jetting market, so the competitive threats do not appear that significant. As volumes rise —and we think they will—the company should have opportunity for expanded margins and eventually positive EBITDA. That could be a key catalyst for shares, as full-year adjusted EBITDA have been negative since the company became public." (3/20/2017)
3. J P Morgan Chase & Co analysts commented, "We are initiating coverage of TPIC at Overweight with a 2017 price target of $22.00. TPI Composites, a differentiated US-listed wind energy pure-play, is winning share of the growing market for outsourced wind-blade manufacturing. We believe the stock can appreciate significantly – earn a growth-multiple – based on solid execution of previously contracted revenues and further production-line expansion. New contract wins, with new and existing customers, could introduce upside to our estimates." (8/16/2016)
