History[edit]
Until 2005, SkyWest, Inc. was the holding company of SkyWest Airlines, its sole subsidiary at the time. This changed on August 15, 2005, when SkyWest, Inc. agreed to acquire Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA) from Delta amidst Delta's bankruptcy proceedings for $425 million.[2] The bankruptcy judge approved the all-cash transaction, which helped Delta improve its liquidity; the deal closed on September 8, 2005.[3]
SkyWest Airlines and ASA have maintained separate hub feeder operations at their respective hubs. The FAA classifies SkyWest, Inc. as a major airline carrier with operating revenues of U$D 3.5 billion.[4] On August 4, 2010, the parent company, SkyWest, Inc., announced that its subsidiary ASA would acquire ExpressJet Airlines, whose feeder network is built up in the East Coast, the South and Midwest[5] The merger closed on November 12, 2010, and ASA and ExpressJet integrated their operations, and was granted a single operating certificate on December 31, 2011. The combined airline rebranded as ExpressJet.
On July 11, 2012, SkyWest, Inc. signed an agreement with Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation to purchase 100 Mitsubishi Regional Jets with an option for up to 100 more. Deliveries are slated to begin in 2017. This order may be split between SkyWest, Inc's. two subsidiaries, SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet, and the airline is keeping the door open to leasing some aircraft to other carriers.[6]
On May 21, 2013, SkyWest, Inc. came to an agreement with Embraer to purchase 100 E-175 Regional Jets, with an option for up to 100 more.[7] Deliveries are slated to begin in April 2014. The first 40 aircraft will be flown by SkyWest, Inc.'s wholly owned subsidiary, SkyWest Airlines, under a 12-year capacity purchase agreement with United Airlines in a 76-seat, dual class configuration.[8]

Until 2005, SkyWest, Inc. was the holding company of SkyWest Airlines, its sole subsidiary at the time. This changed on August 15, 2005, when SkyWest, Inc. agreed to acquire Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA) from Delta amidst Delta's bankruptcy proceedings for $425 million.[2] The bankruptcy judge approved the all-cash transaction, which helped Delta improve its liquidity; the deal closed on September 8, 2005.[3]
SkyWest Airlines and ASA have maintained separate hub feeder operations at their respective hubs. The FAA classifies SkyWest, Inc. as a major airline carrier with operating revenues of U$D 3.5 billion.[4] On August 4, 2010, the parent company, SkyWest, Inc., announced that its subsidiary ASA would acquire ExpressJet Airlines, whose feeder network is built up in the East Coast, the South and Midwest[5] The merger closed on November 12, 2010, and ASA and ExpressJet integrated their operations, and was granted a single operating certificate on December 31, 2011. The combined airline rebranded as ExpressJet.
On July 11, 2012, SkyWest, Inc. signed an agreement with Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation to purchase 100 Mitsubishi Regional Jets with an option for up to 100 more. Deliveries are slated to begin in 2017. This order may be split between SkyWest, Inc's. two subsidiaries, SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet, and the airline is keeping the door open to leasing some aircraft to other carriers.[6]
On May 21, 2013, SkyWest, Inc. came to an agreement with Embraer to purchase 100 E-175 Regional Jets, with an option for up to 100 more.[7] Deliveries are slated to begin in April 2014. The first 40 aircraft will be flown by SkyWest, Inc.'s wholly owned subsidiary, SkyWest Airlines, under a 12-year capacity purchase agreement with United Airlines in a 76-seat, dual class configuration.[8]

History[edit]
Until 2005, SkyWest, Inc. was the holding company of SkyWest Airlines, its sole subsidiary at the time. This changed on August 15, 2005, when SkyWest, Inc. agreed to acquire Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA) from Delta amidst Delta's bankruptcy proceedings for $425 million.[2] The bankruptcy judge approved the all-cash transaction, which helped Delta improve its liquidity; the deal closed on September 8, 2005.[3]
SkyWest Airlines and ASA have maintained separate hub feeder operations at their respective hubs. The FAA classifies SkyWest, Inc. as a major airline carrier with operating revenues of U$D 3.5 billion.[4] On August 4, 2010, the parent company, SkyWest, Inc., announced that its subsidiary ASA would acquire ExpressJet Airlines, whose feeder network is built up in the East Coast, the South and Midwest[5] The merger closed on November 12, 2010, and ASA and ExpressJet integrated their operations, and was granted a single operating certificate on December 31, 2011. The combined airline rebranded as ExpressJet.
On July 11, 2012, SkyWest, Inc. signed an agreement with Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation to purchase 100 Mitsubishi Regional Jets with an option for up to 100 more. Deliveries are slated to begin in 2017. This order may be split between SkyWest, Inc's. two subsidiaries, SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet, and the airline is keeping the door open to leasing some aircraft to other carriers.[6]
On May 21, 2013, SkyWest, Inc. came to an agreement with Embraer to purchase 100 E-175 Regional Jets, with an option for up to 100 more.[7] Deliveries are slated to begin in April 2014. The first 40 aircraft will be flown by SkyWest, Inc.'s wholly owned subsidiary, SkyWest Airlines, under a 12-year capacity purchase agreement with United Airlines in a 76-seat, dual class configuration.[8]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

 Share this article




























































ST. GEORGE, Utah, April 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- SkyWest, Inc. (NASDAQ:    SKYW) ("SkyWest") today reported financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2017, including net income of $35 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, compared to net income of $27 million, or $0.52 per diluted share for Q1 2016. The improvement in pre-tax income over Q1 2016 was primarily due to SkyWest's continued fleet transition, including the addition of 45 new E175s, and the removal of 45 ERJ145s and 16 CRJ200s since Q1 2016.  Additionally, since Q1 2016 SkyWest has transitioned 38 CRJ700s it previously operated under agreements with other major airline partners to American Airlines, Inc. ("American") under a multi-year agreement, further reducing fleet risk. 








Commenting on the results, Chip Childs, SkyWest, Inc. Chief Executive Officer said, "Despite the weather challenges we faced at the beginning of the quarter, our dedicated teams worked hard to minimize passenger disruption. The solid operating performance, combined with continued execution on our fleet transition, delivered a stronger than expected March which is reflected in our improved profitability this quarter.  Our first quarter results reflect the outstanding work our professionals do each day to provide an excellent product to our customers."  
Q1 2017 Financial Highlights
Revenue was $765 million in Q1 2017, up from $762 million in Q1 2016. The increase in revenue included the net impact of adding 45 new E175 aircraft since Q1 2016 (of which seven were delivered in Q1 2017), partially offset by the removal of unprofitable or less profitable aircraft over the same period, including 45 ERJ145s, 16 CRJ200s and eight CRJ700s.  
Operating expenses were $689 million in Q1 2017, down from $700 million in Q1 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower direct operating costs from 24 fewer aircraft in service and a 7% reduction in block hour production, partially offset by higher fuel costs and crew training costs associated with the new E175 aircraft deliveries.  
Net income for Q1 2017 included a $3 million income tax benefit related to accounting rule changes around equity compensation adopted January 1, 2017, resulting in an effective tax rate of 34% for the quarter. SkyWest expects an effective tax rate of approximately 38-39% for each of the next three quarters, and an effective tax rate for the 2017 year of approximately 37-38%.  Diluted shares used in SkyWest's earnings per share calculation also increased by approximately 350,000 shares related to the same accounting rule changes.  
Q1 2017 Operational Update 
Dual-Class Aircraft (E175s, CRJ700s and CRJ900s):
SkyWest Airlines, Inc. ("SkyWest Airlines") took delivery of seven E175s during Q1 2017.  SkyWest's scheduled deliveries of its remaining E175 firm orders are below:

The 49 CRJ700s scheduled for service with American were previously operated by SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet with other major airline partners.
50-seat Aircraft (CRJ200s and ERJ145/135s):
As of March 31, 2017, SkyWest had 208 CRJ200s and 137 ERJ145/135s in scheduled service. SkyWest anticipates it will reduce its CRJ200s by approximately 30 aircraft and its ERJ145/135s by approximately 37 aircraft by the end of 2017. As previously announced, ExpressJet anticipates it will transition to flying primarily dual-class aircraft in its CRJ operation by removing its CRJ200 aircraft from service by the end of 2017.

SkyWest issued $158 million in long-term debt during Q1 2017 to finance seven E175s delivered during the quarter. Total debt increased by $69 million during the first quarter from the new E175 aircraft acquired, net of scheduled principal payments.

In addition to historical information, this release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as "forecasts", "expects," "intends," "believes," "anticipates," "estimates", "should," "likely" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about SkyWest's future financial and operating results, plans, objectives, expectations, estimates, intentions and outlook, and other statements that are not historical facts. All forward-looking statements included in this release are made as of the date hereof and are based on information available to SkyWest as of such date. SkyWest assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Readers should note that many factors could affect the future operating and financial results of SkyWest, SkyWest Airlines or ExpressJet, and could cause actual results to vary materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements set forth in this release. These factors include, but are not limited to, the prospects of entering into agreements with existing or other carriers to fly new aircraft, ongoing negotiations between SkyWest, SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet and their major partners regarding their contractual obligations, uncertainties regarding operation of new aircraft, the ability to attract and retain qualified pilots, the impact of regulatory issues such as pilot rest rules and qualification requirements, and the ability to obtain aircraft financing.  
Actual operational and financial results of SkyWest, SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet will likely also vary, and may vary materially, from those anticipated, estimated, projected or expected for a number of other reasons, including, in addition to those identified above: the challenges and costs of integrating operations and realizing anticipated synergies and other benefits from the acquisition of ExpressJet; the challenges of competing successfully in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry; developments associated with fluctuations in the economy and the demand for air travel; the financial stability of SkyWest's major partners and any potential impact of their financial condition on the operations of SkyWest, SkyWest Airlines, or ExpressJet; fluctuations in flight schedules, which are determined by the major partners for whom SkyWest's operating airlines conduct flight operations; variations in market and economic conditions; significant aircraft lease and debt commitments; realization of manufacturer residual value guarantees on applicable SkyWest aircraft; residual aircraft values and related impairment charges; labor relations and costs; the impact of global instability; rapidly fluctuating fuel costs, and potential fuel shortages; the impact of weather-related or other natural disasters on air travel and airline costs; aircraft deliveries; the ability to attract and retain qualified pilots and other unanticipated factors. Risk factors, cautionary statements and other conditions which could cause SkyWest's actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations are contained in SkyWest's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
