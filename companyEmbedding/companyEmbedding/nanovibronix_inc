NG-Shield™ Kit





Nasogastric tube related pain and injury (soft tissue trauma and related complications) causes unnecessary patient suffering and morbidity, may prolong hospitalization and add to the cost of medical care.
Nasogastric intubation can result in nasal septal trauma, nasal ulceration, painful swallowing, sinusitis and esophagitis.
The NG-Shield employs our proprietary acoustic technology onto the Nasogastric tube in such a manner that it markedly reduces the trauma and effective friction of the tube and blocks tube associated pain and discomfort. A recent clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated significant improvement in the pain and discomfort associated with NG Tube usage.
In-Vitro studies have shown that our NG-Shield technology is effective in preventing biofilm formation. Therefore, NG-Shield may also be helpful in preventing biofilm and bacterial related complications of Nasogastric tube usage.
NG-ShieldTM, is composed of the NG-ShieldTM device and a disposable clip-on accessory that may be placed on the external portion of any available Nasogastric tube providing pain relief and turning the catheter into an active therapeutic device. 







Prof. Sam Adler
			Head of Gastroenterology Unit, Bikur Cholim Hospital, Jerusalem, ISRAEL
			Today, the NG Shield appears to be a very promising device that can bring relief to patients requiring NG tubes.
Many of our patients require the insertion of a Naso - Gastric tube (NG tube) for various reasons. All of them have pain or discomfort from the indwelling NG tube. Unfortunately, there was no solution, that is, until now.
Recently I carried out a clinical study with the NG Shield in order to determine if the acoustic vibrations of the NG Shield could reduce the pain and discomfort related to NG tubes. The results showed significant reduction in these parameters.
Today, the NG Shield appears to be a very promising device that can bring relief to patients requiring NG tubes.

Dr. Ofer Shenfeld
			Head, Dept. of Urology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, ISRAEL
			Patients treated with the UroShield have less catheter related pain and discomfort, require less anti-pain and anti-spasmotic medications and require less nursing attention.
We used the UroShield in our department and out patient clinic in patients that required an indwelling urinary catheter due to various conditions such as urological procedures and urinary retention. Patients treated with the UroShield have less catheter related pain and discomfort, require less anti-pain and anti-spasmotic medications and require less nursing attention. This results in enhanced patient comfort and lower overall costs. The product is simple to use and maintain. It is a great new tool in our arsenal to help our patients.

STANDARD UROSHIELD FOR INDWELLING URINARY CATHETERS; UroShield is the first medical device on the market that is intended to prevent bacterial biofilm, increase antibiotic efficacy and decrease pain and discomfort associated with urinary catheter use. It can be used with any type of indwelling urinary catheter regardless of the material or coating. The UroShield consists of a disposable UroShield clip-on element that is placed onto the external portion of the Foley catheter in addition to a driver unit, to which the disposable connects.
The UroShield family of products has been expended to include two active stabilization patches. The Z-Shield for Percutaneous Nephrosotmy catheters and the S-Shield for Suprapubic Cystostomy catheters.
UroShield has been shown to be safe in clinical trials and has been shown to prevent urinary catheter related injury. UroShield has received CE Mark and is used in clinical trials in Germany* and Israel.




 



Modifications of UroShield have been made enabling placement on the entire spectrum of indwelling urinary catheters including supra-pubic cystostomy and percutaneous nephrostomy catheters. These two devices consist of the ultrasound transducer embodied in an adhesive stabilization patch, especially designed to fit the anatomy of each site.
Z-SHIELD FOR PERCUTANEOUS NEPHROSTOMY; The Z-Shield patch is an acoustically active stabilization patch designed for percutaneous nephrostomy catheters and applies low frequency ultrasound to the nephrostomy tube to decrease biofilm and maintain patency. At the same time the Z-Shield patch administers low frequency ultrasound to the puncture site to decrease pain and discomfort associated with percutaneous tubes (e.g. nephrostomy) These tubes cause a marked decrease in quality of life for patients as well as frequently precipitate urgent medical need to maintain tube patency or to exchange the tube for a new one.

         OFFER ENDS JULY 31           
 
       


Dr. Adahan, Head pain rehabilitation, Sheba Medical Center
73% of the subjects experienced complete or near complete pain relief. In nearly all cases, there was a delay of 1-2 weeks before the onset of relief followed by a gradual improvement, in pain relief, over the following 2-6 weeks.

Review scientific poster
 
  
PainShield® treatment to replace drugs and surgical intervention
Treatment can take place anytime and anywhere even during overnight sleep.
PainShield® unique advantages over existing treatment alternatives:

Treating trigeminal neuralgia with the PainShield® allows reduction in medication dosage and eliminates related adverse drug effects.
The PainShield® patch is applied on a bony surface in the face allowing the surface acoustic ultrasound waves to travel across the entire skull and reach the root of the trigeminal nerve to promote healing of nerve origin (currently under clinical research).
No limitation in treatment duration.
The treatment may help avoiding Trigeminal Neuralgia surgery.

Trigeminal Neuralgia background and testimonials
Trigeminal neuralgia is severe spastic, lancinating facial pain due to a disorder of the 5th cranial nerve. Diagnosis is clinical.
 
Trigeminal Neuralgia etiology
Trigeminal neuralgia is usually caused by an intracranial artery or, a venous loop that compresses the Trigeminal nerve at its root entry zone into the brain stem. Other less common trigeminal neuralgia causes include compression by a tumor and occasionally a multiple sclerosis plaque at the root entry zone, but these are distinguished usually by accompanying sensory and other deficits. The mechanism is suggested to be a nerve compression which causes local demyelination, which may result in ectopic impulse generation and/or disinhibition of central pain pathways involving the spinal trigeminal nucleus.
Trigeminal Neuralgia symptoms and signs
Pain occurs along the distribution of one or more sensory divisions of the trigeminal nerve, most often the maxillary (upper jaw). The pain is paroxysmal (spastic), lasting seconds up to 2 min, but attacks may recur rapidly. It is lancinating, excruciating, and sometimes incapacitating. Trigeminal neuralgia pain is often precipitated by stimulating a facial trigger point (eg. by chewing, brushing the teeth, or smiling). Sleeping on that side of the face is often intolerable.
Trigeminal Neuralgia diagnosis
Trigeminal neuralgia symptoms are almost pathognomonic. Neurologic examination is normal in trigeminal neuralgia. Thus, neurologic deficits (usually loss of facial sensation) suggest that the TN-like pain is caused by another disorder (e.g. tumor, stroke, multiple sclerosis plaque, vascular malformation, other lesions) that compress the trigeminal nerve or disrupt its brain stem pathways.
Conventional Trigeminal Neuralgia treatment
Drugs - usually anticonvulsants or painkillers that may become ineffective with disease progression and carry various adverse effects.
Surgical intervention - If pain is severe despite the pharmacologic treatment, a surgical treatments are considered; however, efficacy may be temporary, and improvement may be followed by recurrent pain that is more severe than the preceding episodes.

				61 years old female, Borås, Sweden
				Since 1995 I am suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia as a complication from my Multiple Sclerosis.
Since starting using the instrument, the pain levels have gradually diminished, by jumping down in steps both in intensity and in duration of the pain. I gradually stopped using the morpheme injections.
Today, about 5 weeks since I started using Painshield®, I can say that I am as good as pain free.

                NanoVibronix, Inc. engages in the development of noninvasive biological response-activating devices that target wound healing and pain therapy and can be administered at home, without the assistance of medical professionals. Its products include WoundShield, PainShield, and UroShield. The WoundShield product is a  patch-based therapeutic ultrasound device intended to facilitate tissue regeneration and wound healing by using ultrasound to increase local capillary perfusion and tissue oxygenation. The PainShield product refers to a disposable patch-based therapeutic ultrasound technology to treat pain, muscle spasm and joint contractures by delivering a localized ultrasound effect to treat pain and induce soft tissue healing in a targeted area. The UroShield product is an ultrasound-based product that is designed to prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm in urinary catheters, increase antibiotic efficacy and decrease pain and discomfort associated with urinary catheter use. The company was founded by Harold Jacob and Jona Zumeris in September 2003 and is headquartered in Melville, NY.

NanoVibronix, Inc. Key Developments

NanoVibronix Announces Successful Interim Trial Results for UroShield(TM)
Jul 12 17
NanoVibronix, Inc. announced successful interim trial results for UroShield™. UroShield™ is an ultrasound-based product that is designed to prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm on indwelling urinary catheters, increase antibiotic efficacy and decrease pain and discomfort associated with urinary catheter use. The trial was conducted at two skilled nursing facilities near Buffalo, NY, in which 22 subjects were evaluated. In the trial, 11 patients had active UroShield devices and 11 patients were treated with placebo devices. At the start of the trial, all 22 subjects exhibited significant colonization of multiple microorganisms in both the catheter device as well as retained urine from the bladder. Of the 22 samples analyzed, most were counted at greater than 100,000 Colony Forming Units (CFU). At the 30-day evaluation, all 11 subjects in the control group still exhibited greater than 100,000 CFUs in both the catheter and urine samples. The 11 subjects in the UroShield™ treatment group exhibited a significant reduction in both the number and types of CFUs exhibited in the samples. The live CFU count in most of the catheter and urine samples in the UroShield™ treatment group were less than 10,000, and in many of the samples, they were measured at less than 1,000, which represents a greater than 90% reduction in CFUs. In addition, at the 60-day follow up, none of the subjects in the UroShield™ treatment arm developed a clinical infection. In the control arm 2 out of 11 patients developed signs of a clinical infection that required either antibiotic therapy or hospitalization.

NanoVibronix Inc.


            
            NanoVibronix, Inc. engages in the development of noninvasive biological response-activating devices that target wound healing and pain therapy and can be administered at home, without the assistance of medical professionals. Its products include WoundShield, PainShield, and UroShield. The WoundShield product is a  patch-based therapeutic ultrasound device intended to facilitate tissue regeneration and wound healing by using ultrasound to increase local capillary perfusion and tissue oxygenation. The PainShield product refers to a disposable patch-based therapeutic ultrasound technology to treat pain, muscle spasm and joint contractures by delivering a localized ultrasound effect to treat pain and induce soft tissue healing in a targeted area. The UroShield product is an ultrasound-based product that is designed to prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm in urinary catheters, increase antibiotic efficacy and decrease pain and discomfort associated with urinary catheter use. The company was founded by Harold Jacob and Jona Zumeris in September 2003 and is headquartered in Melville, NY.

NanoVibronix Inc.


            
            NanoVibronix, Inc. engages in the development of noninvasive biological response-activating devices that target wound healing and pain therapy and can be administered at home, without the assistance of medical professionals. Its products include WoundShield, PainShield, and UroShield. The WoundShield product is a  patch-based therapeutic ultrasound device intended to facilitate tissue regeneration and wound healing by using ultrasound to increase local capillary perfusion and tissue oxygenation. The PainShield product refers to a disposable patch-based therapeutic ultrasound technology to treat pain, muscle spasm and joint contractures by delivering a localized ultrasound effect to treat pain and induce soft tissue healing in a targeted area. The UroShield product is an ultrasound-based product that is designed to prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm in urinary catheters, increase antibiotic efficacy and decrease pain and discomfort associated with urinary catheter use. The company was founded by Harold Jacob and Jona Zumeris in September 2003 and is headquartered in Melville, NY.
