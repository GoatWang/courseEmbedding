But there are some standard coverages included in most homeowners policies, such as protection for your dwelling and personal property for certain natural disasters and personal liabilities. It's important to know exactly what is and isn't covered by your policy and to understand your coverage limits. If you'd like to talk through your current policy or get coverage tailored to life in CA, I'd be happy to help.Learn More More Than Just An Auto PolicyIf you're a safe driver, Allstate thinks you should enjoy some extra perks. That's why we're using Drivewise® technology to measure things like speed, mileage and braking and rewarding you for your safe driving behavior. It won't increase your rates, and you get rewarded just for signing up. I'd love to talk to you about Drivewise® and how you can earn Allstate Rewards℠ points.Learn More Comparing Renters Insurance QuotesWhen comparing renters insurance quotes from different insurers, it's important to take more than price into consideration. Understanding what the policy covers and making sure it fits your needs may help give you the peace of mind that comes from knowing you have certain protections in place while you're living in a rented home or apartment.Learn More Term Life Insurance 101Term life insurance can be an affordable way to help protect your loved ones for a set amount of time - typically anywhere from one to 30 years. You'll be covered for the length of the selected term, and your beneficiaries will receive the policy benefit if you should pass away during that time. If you're interested in term insurance, this brief overview is a great place to start. I know that buying life insurance can be a difficult decision, but it is an important one. That's why I’m here to help you choose the best options for you.Learn More Is Your Office Rental Covered?Renting an office for your business makes sense - you have the space you need without the costs or maintenance of owning the building. But relying on the landlord's insurance to cover your business if a fire or break-in should occur is not a savvy decision. The landlord's policy typically covers the building but not your company's equipment or the business if there is an accident in the office. Whether it's making sure your computers would be replaced or recouping potential losses after a disaster, let's talk about insuring your business before you sign that lease.Learn More Safety Vs. StyleThe choice between stylish riding gear and truly protective gear should be easy - whatever makes it more likely you'll walk away from an accident safely. Thankfully there is a lot of gear that is both safe and stylish these days. And while I certainly hope you're never in an accident, choosing your protective wear wisely can make a big different if you are. From helmet guidelines to leather jackets to armor, here are some helpful tips on choosing the right gear for your ride.Learn More Fire Damage To Your CondoLiving in a condominium has its perks, especially if the condo board manages upkeep of the building. But you're still at risk when things go wrong in common areas or neighboring units, especially when it comes to a fire. The damage can be hard enough to deal with, but you could also be left wondering whose insurance will cover the costs of repairs and replacing your belongings. While you hopefully never experience a fire in or near your condo, it is important to be familiar with not only your condo insurance's fire coverage but also with the association's coverage.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it. And that makes paying more than you need to that much more uncomfortable.With a policy from Allstate, you can help keep your insurance costs low with the wide variety of discounts we offer. Keep in mind, not all discounts are available in every state. The best way to get all that you qualify for is to get an insurance quote specific to San Jose.You can get a rough "ballpark" insurance quote from many companies online, but talking with an agent allows you to ask questions and get a quote for coverage that matters most to you. As an Allstate agent, I can prepare a quote that details the coverage, deductibles (your portion of a loss) and cost (premium) of your insurance policy.Insurance products and services offered at my Allstate agency include:Auto InsuranceCar InsuranceFlood InsuranceInsuranceLife InsuranceMotorcycle InsuranceHome InsuranceInsurance QuoteInsurance AgencyBusiness InsuranceContactPhone(408) 979-7980(408) 979-7980Fax(408) 979-7983(408) 979-7983Email:manjitsingh@allstate.commanjitsingh@allstate.comAddress:5725 Camden AveSan Jose, CA 95124Get DirectionsAreas Served:Proud to serve the areas of San Jose.

This is in contrast to previous sprints in which we averaged 60-70% story point completion.”Matt M., Freddie Mac
