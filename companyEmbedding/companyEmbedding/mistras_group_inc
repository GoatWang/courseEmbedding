Acoustic Emission Sensors


















SENSOR MANUFACTURING

Acoustic Emission (AE) SensorsOur AE Sensor manufacturing facilities consist of full time sensor technicians, who assemble and test our AE sensors.  We manufacture over 100+ types of standard sensors.
            
            In the manufacture of sensors we have several ultrasonic cleaners, 5 curing ovens, many in-house developed sensor fixtures to aid in precision assembly, epoxy dispensers, soldering tools (using no-Lead solder), welders, finishing equipment including a capping machine, sanders, buffing and polishers, and many fine tools.  We also have a laser engraving machine for engraving the product name, part number and serial number on each sensor.
            
            For AE Calibration, we have multiple calibration stations, using two different AE sensor calibration techniques including a NIST equivalent and Traceable velocity calibration standard (which provides the same calibration result as the Primary Calibration station at NIST), per ASTM E-1106 and E-1781.  In addition we also use a pressure calibration technique, reference ASTM E-976.   We have developed our own Calibration Systems and software.  Our calibration systems contain some of the same AE boards that we sell and support in the market.  For example, our PCI-2, AE board is the main data acquisition board in our calibration station.  Also, our ARB-1410 Arbitrary Waveform Generator board is used in each calibration system.  We have also developed our own AE Sensor calibration software in order to automatically inspect and calibrate our sensors, providing a printout result of the calibration response curve for the sensor.
            
Vibration Sensors (Accelerometers)Just as we fabricate our own AE sensors, we also manufacture a very complete line of vibration accelerometers.  Our accelerometer manufacturing center is located right next to our AE sensor area since many of the assembly techniques and tools are very similar to one another.   In addition, as we have done for the AE sensors, we use our own accelerometer calibration station using our own automated test software, the end result being that a calibration certificate is printed for each premium sensor we sell.

ELECTRONIC DEVELOPMENT

In electronic development, our engineering staff designs 100% of the circuitry used in our systems.  We design and develop each circuit board in the system and all the components on them.   Each electronic design function along with design tools are described below.

Printed Circuit Board Design (PCB) and Development:
In our Electronic designs, we carry out the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design utilizing Altium Designer and PCAD.  Specifically in Printed circuit board design, we perform Schematic Capture in Altium Designer, or PCAD.  In Printed Circuit layout designs we use Altium and PCAD.  In automated circuit routing, we use Altium Designer, PCAD or Spectra Autorouter and for semiautomatic routing we use DFM.  For Printed Circuit CAM (Computer Automated Manufacturing) we use Altium Designer, CAMtastic, CAM350 and for translating our PCB's into files for our surface mount machine in manufacturing, our software group has developed a translator that automatically reformats our designs into the Pick and Place format.


Digital Design & Simulation:
Our digital designs utilize Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA's) for high density electronic digital signal processing (DSP) functions, compacted onto small integrated circuits.  In addition, we utilize Altera lower density, Programmable Logic Devices (PLD's), CPLD's (CMOS Programmable Logic Devices) and GAL (Gate Array Logic), in cases where a specific, low cost logic function is required.  In terms of FPGA's we use XILINX devices including their, Vertix  family, and their SPARTAN 3E and 3A-DSP families of devices.  We also use Actel devices for some designs that require high speed, and low power capabilities.  The development tools we use for these devices includes; XILINX ISE 11  Altera Quartus and Actel Libero ISE for VHDL Design, Synthesis  Place and Route. We use Aldec Active HDL 8.1 for VHDL Simulation.

Microprocessor Design:
Microprocessors are incorporated into many of our designs as they offer a low cost, low power dissipation, signal processing and communications capability.  Over the years we have used the very famous 8051 family of microprocessors and are now using AVR microprocessors and ARM-9 microprocessors.  In addition, we do use the Intel Pentium Class of processors including the latest Multi-Core (dual core, quad core and low power ATOM).  These are used where an Operating system such as XP, VISTA, etc. are required for the product.   In all cases, we develop software for each of these microprocessors in C, C++ or C# (C-Sharp).

SENSOR DEVELOPMENT

We have a full time engineering staff, developing our Acoustic Emission Sensors and our Vibration accelerometers.  In each case our engineers have complete sensor development and modeling capability to be able to develop amongst the best, industry wide sensors.  These engineers utilize the same Mechanical and Electronic CAD packages in developing our sensors, Solidworks for mechanical packaging design, COSMOSworks for Finite Element Modeling & ALTIUM Designer & PCAD for electronic circuit board work.

Every sensor engineer is responsible for not only the design of our new sensors, but also responsible for maintaining and improving our existing line of sensors, responsible for development of test fixtures and automation to help reduce manufacturing fabrication time and is also responsible to support manufacturing to assure consistency and quality.

VIBRATION TECHNOLOGY

All machines generate mechanical forces as part of their normal operation.  As the machine condition deteriorates, these forces change causing an increase in vibration amplitude and frequency which can be measured and analyzed.  Therefore machinery vibration analysis can be a very good indicator of the machine's health and operating condition.



Baseline vibration signatures (graph of amplitude versus frequency) recorded on the bearings and structure of a good operating machine show low vibration energy, and are used for comparison with future vibration signatures measured over time.  If this trend shows an increase in vibration amplitude, its level or rate of change can be used to prioritize the severity of the growing problem in the machine.  Analyzing the frequency response of this growing vibration can be used to diagnose the problem in the machine by correlating these frequencies to the forces that are generated by the various components (bearings, couplings, gears, rotors, etc.) which could be wearing or failing.

Therefore vibration analysis has become a very useful tool in day to day maintenance by predicting machinery problems before they become catastrophic, and for planning inspections and maintenance actions, which minimize downtime and costs in both parts and labor.  This technology can also give you peace of mind that there are no mechanical problems in your machine and therefore can continue to operate and avoid unnecessary maintenance.  The result is that machinery reliability increases, thereby increasing production and potential profits!

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
