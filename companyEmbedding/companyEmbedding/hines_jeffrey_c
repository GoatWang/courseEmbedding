 Jeffrey C. Hines - Hines President and CEO









          Sorry for my poor english translation.



          Gerald Hines, a Texas developer, decided to bet on France. He negotiated the purchase from the shopping malls MACIF Trema and a draft tower defense.
          Hines is interested in the Texan Trema and Defence
          Les Echos No. 17042 of December 11, 1995 • page 17
The Texas developer Gerald Hines, crowned as "Man of the Year" in March 1995 by the International Market for real estate professionals (MIPIM), is preparing to invest heavily in the French market. The American negotiating two important cases: the redemption from MACIF promoter malls and Trema acquisition from the Public Establishment for Installation of Defense (EPAD) land charges PB6 tower.
Founder and president of Hines Interests Limited Partnership based in Houston, Gerald Hines in the United States employs 1,700 people and claims to have developed since the inception of the company in 1957, nearly 9 million square meters of offices, malls, homes, etc.., throughout the U.S.. Hines Interests also conducts projects in Mexico City, Berlin and Moscow. This year the group acquired a small French development company, Sovacim, which won the project management support to build the new headquarters of the TV channel M6 in Neuilly-sur-Seine.
          Gerald Hines in Paris today
          MACIF, which has widened its losses to 300 million in 1994 after 83 million in 1993 due to provisions made on Trema its subsidiary, wants to sell the company to promote long. But negotiations with the Land Euris stalled. The salvation could come from Texas for this company owns a dozen shopping centers in France, Spain and Italy. Founded in 1988 by Roger Flament with the support of MACIF and GMF, Trema has grown too fast.
          The rise of shopping centers takes time, and now their rates of return are still insufficient. When Mr. Flament dreamed of an annual rent of 1 billion francs in 2000, it must for now be content with about 200 to 230 million. In addition, Trema has bought into the euphoria of the disputed land in Venissieux, Manchester and Amiens, on which the sponsor has not obtained final permission to build shopping malls (which represents around 800 million francs of losses) . Finally, his last major project, the project in Marseille Grand Littoral (140,000 square meters), has become one of the favorite subjects of the regional press, as companies are accused of break the rules of safety problems after landslides. The total investments reached about 4.5 billion francs, while the value of assets was estimated by Trema in 1994 to 3 billion. Negotiating for months with Hines, MACIF do not wish to advance on the outcome of the discussions.
          Similarly, EPAD, which owns the rights to build the tower PB6 (from 50,000 to 60,000 square meters of offices), remains very secretive about the sale to Mr. Hines. But according to some real estate professionals, the operation would be almost ready, and some even claim the prize of 10,000 francs per square meter of land cost. While in Paris today, Gerald Hines is expected to unveil his intentions.

          -> Created for Jeffrey C. Hines        
The American Heinz to the rescue of MacifIl resume hypermarkets in which the mutual has invested 4.5 billion.
The prospective buyer of the business of Macif is Sir Gerald D. Hines, Heinz and not as we stated in error in Liberation on Friday. Based in Houston, his family empire of office and retail scales to date $ 6.5 billion, or 32 billion francs.
Two years ago that Jacques Vandier boss Macif, mutual commerce and industry, is grappling with the matter as perilous to its very long (35 years) career in the house. Trema folder or one of the largest real estate pans in the history of French mutualism, with its dozen shopping centers in France, Italy and Spain, its 17,000 square feet of offices in Madrid, and its founder Roger Flament , ejected from his own company in July.
Trema could be sold before the end of the family group American Heinz, led by a man of the same name. Macif Trema has invested in a total of 4.5 billion francs when all work is completed. She has already lost or provisioned in the accounts of 655 million francs. She would lose in that case still almost 1 billion francs which would be spread over an accounting decade.

          -> Site for Jeffrey C. Hines        
The case officially began in 1988. Flament, with its letters of nobility in the French mutualism (it is regarded as the spiritual son of the founder of the FMG, the mutual officials), obtained from the FMGs Macif and unconditional funding of the company that Trema based. It keeps for him 50% stake in Trema leaves in 40% and 10% Macif the GMF.
Objective: To purchase land, build hypermarkets above, and pay with commercial galleries. Good idea, given the policies of Roger Flament introductions. Bad idea, as Roger Flamand has delusions of grandeur, a lifestyle pattern of multinational with private plane, crockery and carpets with logo, and the crisis shows its face. The first business start well, just to give confidence to shareholders, without suspicion, then signed credit lines staggering. Flament and then across the Alps, enters into a transaction with Silvio Berlusconi in Turin, made a turn in jail, caught in the nets of Operation Clean Hands. He also crossed the Pyrenees, at the worst time, built with all his offices in Madrid can not find tenants (which was not in his original contract) buys land unbuildable in Venissieux (530 million investment ) idem in Nice (investment 220 million) and Amiens (50 million). The last major construction site is Marseille, the Grand Littoral project built on an old quarry, which alone accounts for 140,000 square feet on 100 acres to be developed. In all, if Trema reaches the end of his troubles, Macif will own 600,000 square meters of retail space, making it one of the largest portfolios in the matter.
In late 1993, Vandier begins to worry, by dint of writing checks. GMF also. Flament flat. Rents do not fall sufficiently. GMF wants out. She will succeed. Flament, who hunts with Claude Bebear, Axa's boss, persuaded him to return at least 10% share of the GMF. Finally, Flament lose all its shares in July Trema, Macif now with 90% of the company and Axa 10%. Since then, the group is headed by a man Vandier, Jean-Paul Moreau, charged with finding a solution to the issue before it ruins the Macif.
For the record Trema feeds contestation within Macif Vandier where Jacques, who performed faultlessly so far, is now openly criticized by representatives of employees. A recent report Syndex delivered to the Central Works Council denounces the concentrations of power within Macif. Even the timid Insurance Regulatory Commission summoned Macif to review its accounts because of Trema.
Before the summer, the financial Euris, led by Jean-Charles Naouri, is given as a buyer. Its offer will ultimately be rejected, as too low. Since then, other potential buyers come to the door, one of the latest being Robert de Balkany (Mr. Parly-2) assisted by Jean-Jacques Piette, former chairman of the Comptoir des Entrepreneurs who, incidentally, left several billion francs of losses behind it. Little hope of that side.
Heinz remains the billionaire who has toured the properties of Trema since the summer and appears ready to sign the takeover before the end of all its assets. Unless, boosted by the recent government decision to halt construction of significantly larger shops in France, management of Macif decided in a 180 $ to keep this pot that could one day become a nugget.

In New York, the quarrel reached towers Jean Nouvel
The project of the French architect for the developer Gerald D. Hines has lost 60 feet high. T o or against the towers, how high to allow them to grow? These turf battles that plague many months the future of Paris and its town planning, are now reaching New York. With Jean Nouvel for the main target. The case may seem surprising in a city known for its skyscrapers. It is played on a parking lot adjacent to the famous Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), located in the heart of Manhattan, between 53rd and 54th Streets. This is where the French architect Jean Nouvel had won in late 2007, the competition for a tower, launched by the developer Gerald D.

A tower in Manhattan signed J. New
A skyscraper designed by Jean Nouvel will soon be appearing between the 53rd and 54th Street in Manhattan. This luxury tower in steel and glass should leap into the sky in New York on 75 floors. Discover the project images.
The law firm of architect Jean Nouvel has just been appointed to design a tower of 75 floors in the heart of Manhattan. This new building will be located between 53rd and 54th Street, west of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, MoMA. It is also anticipated that the building extends to 15,240 m2 museum galleries.
Indeed, the building should rush on land sold by the museum this year for 125 million dollars in real estate developer Hines who is behind the project. On the other hand, this tower will house a seven-star hotel with 100 rooms, a swimming pool and 120 luxury residential units spread over the upper floors.
Structure of glass and steel
Architecturally, the building offer a structure of glass and steel, mimicking the shape of a spider web of metal. The tip of the skyscraper tapers in the sky in the form of an arrow distinctive. Gerald D. Hines, president of Hines, welcomes "the incredible new concept that could become an international icon in the field of architectural design."
The presale of the project should start in late 2008.
          Note that Hines and Jean Nouvel are not their first collaboration, they worked together on the residence 40 Mercer in SoHo in New York and on the C1 Tower currently under study in Paris.

Hines launches student housing operation

1 / 1


Back to Gallery
















Global real estate developer Hines has launched a new student housing platform with the acquisition of properties in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
The Houston-based company, which now has a student housing portfolio of a dozen developments, said Friday the new brand will be called Aparto. 
"The brand, which celebrates the independence of apartment living and the sense of community you are "a part of," has been unveiled at its operational sites in Ireland, and will be rolled out across all other Ireland, UK and European developments once completed," the company said in an announcement.



RELATED: In Houston real estate, it's Hines, not Heinz
Among its most recent deals, Hines purchased the Montrose student housing development adjacent to Ireland's largest university, University College Dublin. In the UK, the company acquired development sites in Lancaster and Exeter where it is planning new projects.
Hines' student housing portfolio in the UK and Ireland has a combined development value of more than $621.5 million since entering the market less than a year ago.

Experience the BeenVerified Difference
See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
