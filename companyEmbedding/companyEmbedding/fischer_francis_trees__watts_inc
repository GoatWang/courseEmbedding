BNP Paribas Asset Management





 


 On June 1, 2017, Fischer Francis Trees & Watts (FFTW) rebranded to BNP Paribas Asset Management. This is a natural step in the firm’s evolution as FFTW became fully owned by BNP Paribas in 2006. We believe our new brand is a simpler representation of who we are, the asset management arm of a prominent global banking institution; and of what we do, managing your assets. 
While our name has changed, many things have not changed as we have been integrating our business with that of BNP Paribas Asset Management over the past decade and adapting together with BNP Paribas Asset Management to the changing asset management landscape. Most importantly, what will stay the same are the following: 

Our people - we hire and maintain experienced fixed income investment personnel and our investment teams will remain managing the same assets they manage today.
Our passion and dedication to fixed income - we will continue to focus on providing capabilities where we have deep and proven expertise. We will become part of a larger fixed income team that has over 100 fixed income specialists and manages over $200 billion in fixed income assets. Fixed income is BNP Paribas Asset Management’s largest asset class. Our fixed income business is led by Dominick DeAlto, the former Chief Investment Officer of FFTW.
Our specialized investment teams - we believe that specialization leads to better informed and, ultimately, higher quality decisions. We will continue to have single-strategy investment teams specializing in one specific area and multi-strategy investment teams who focus on asset allocation within fixed income.
Our commitment to building long-term relationships with our clients - we know that our clients are the reason we are successful. We understand the importance of ensuring all relationship aspects from portfolio management and client service to operations and compliance earn our clients’ trust. We will continue to provide you with the same accessibility to our investment, operations, compliance and client service teams that we give you today.

We look forward to working with you in the future.
