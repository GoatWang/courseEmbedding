                    2017 Best in ShowAppy Awards Quartz news app by Quartz for QuartzThe Quartz app sends users messages, photos, GIFs, and links relating to particular topics, and users can tap to signal that they're interested in learning more. Quartz views the app as a publication
in itself; the app links to other publications, in addition to its own stories. The interface resembled an automated assistant, but the content is written by human editors and writers. The average
daily user checks the app twice a day and spends around three minutes inside the app.Credits:  Zach Seward: SVP of product and executive editor, Quartz

scans 300,000 products’ UPC codes, and then offers some color coding guidelines --  green represents “good”; blue, “neutral”; and red -- well, you get the picture -- not so much.
Additionally: Some there is some inspiring key messaging like: “This will make your mouth water and your heart happy." Or maybe not.

along with over 2,500 indices. The free app gathered the most commonly used functionalities from competitive products, and then simplified the user inputs and resulting output for a simple-to-use,
initiative platform. All charts are interactive, enabling users to rearrange the fund display order or to change the representation of various data within the charts. The platform was recently updated
with a refreshed user interface as well as introducing the first-of-its-kind feature to enable users to discover and explore new investment opportunities. There is no requirement to use a Putnam fund
when using the app.
