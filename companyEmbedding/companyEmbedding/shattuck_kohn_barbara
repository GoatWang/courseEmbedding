Ms. Shattuck Kohn began her career as a municipal bond analyst at Standard & Poor's Corporation. 

The Board supported and approved the nomination of Ms. Shattuck Kohn in 2016 because of her substantial experience in investment banking, capital markets and project finance. Further, she possesses the experience, financial sophistication and financial statement expertise necessary to evaluate potential acquisition and financing opportunities for the Company, and she was instrumental in evaluating both the preferred equity investment in the Company by Fortress Investment Group, LLC in 2008 and the Spin-Off in 2013. This financial background is ideally suited for Ms. Kohn's service on the Audit and Compensation Committees, and her reputation, integrity, judgment and proven leadership ability meets both the Board's high standards and the rigorous requirements of the various regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over the Company.
