Stewart Graham Lee (born 5 April 1968) is an English stand-up comedian, writer and director. In the mid-1990s he was one half of the radio duo Lee and Herring, alongside Richard Herring. He co-wrote and co-directed the mock Broadway hit Jerry Springer: The Opera, a critical success that sparked a backlash from Christian groups who staged a series of protests outside its early stagings.
After a return to the live circuit, and through BBC and Channel 4 specials and series, Lee has rebuilt an audience and a reputation as an anti-populist comedian. In December 2011 he won British Comedy Awards for best male television comic and best comedy entertainment programme for his series Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle.[4]
A 2009 article in The Times referred to him as "the comedian's comedian, and for good reason" and named him "face of the decade".[5] In June 2012 Lee was placed at number 9 in the Top 100 Most Influential People in UK Comedy.[6] His stand-up features frequent use of "repetition, call-backs, nonchalant delivery and deconstruction", a device he often self-consciously refers to on stage.[7]
Lee has written music reviews for publications including The Sunday Times.[8] Through the early 2000s he was a regular presenter on Resonance FM.[9]

Background[edit]
Lee was born in Wellington, Shropshire.[10] He was adopted as a child and grew up in Solihull in the West Midlands.[11] He attended the public school Solihull School on a part scholarship.[12] As a teenager he suffered from ulcerative colitis.[13]
He is married to fellow comic Bridget Christie, with whom he has two children.[14][15] He is a patron of the British Humanist Association,[16] an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society[17] and a member of The Arts Emergency Service.[18] His influences include Ted Chippington, Simon Munnery, Kevin McAleer and Johnny Vegas.[19][20]
Career[edit]
1989–1993: Stand-up and radio[edit]
While studying English at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in the 1980s, he wrote and performed comedy in a revue group called "The Seven Raymonds" with Richard Herring, Emma Kennedy and Tim Richardson, but did not perform in the well-known Oxford Revue, though he did write for and direct the 1989 Revue. Having moved to London and begun performing stand up comedy after university, he rose to greater prominence in 1990, winning the prestigious Hackney Empire New Act of the Year competition.
With Herring, Lee wrote material for BBC Radio 4's On the Hour (1991), which was anchored by Chris Morris and was notable for the first appearance of Steve Coogan's celebrated character, Alan Partridge, for which Lee and Herring wrote much early material. After a disagreement with the rest of the cast, Lee and Herring did not remain with the group when On The Hour moved to television as The Day Today, and their material was excised from an official release of the radio show in the mid-1990s, although it was included in a CD released in 2008.
In 1992 and 1993, he and Herring wrote and performed Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World for BBC Radio 4, before moving to BBC Radio 1, for one series of Fist of Fun (1993), followed by three series of Lee and Herring. Throughout the late nineties he continued performing solo stand-up (something that has always been a mainstay of his career – even whilst in the double act with Herring) and has collaborated with, amongst others, Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding of The Mighty Boosh. Indeed, though Barratt and Fielding had worked together in the past, the first seeds of the Boosh were sown while working as part of Lee's Edinburgh show King Dong vs Moby Dick in which Barratt and Fielding played a giant penis and a whale, respectively. Lee returned the favour by going on to direct their 1999 Edinburgh show, Arctic Boosh, which remains the template for their live work.
2000–04: Quitting stand-up[edit]
In 2001, Lee published his first novel, The Perfect Fool; it was republished in 2008.[21] In the same year he performed Pea Green Boat, a stand-up show which revolved around the deconstruction of the Edward Lear poem The Owl and the Pussycat and a tale of his own broken toilet. This would later be condensed to focus mainly on the poem itself, and a 15-minute version aired on Radio 4. In 2007, Go Faster Stripe released a 25-minute edit on CD & 10" Vinyl.
During late 2000 and early 2001, Lee "gradually, incrementally and without any fanfare – or even much thought – gave up being a stand-up comedian",[22](p2) and 2001 became the first year since 1987 that he did not perform at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.[22](p28) While Lee found himself gradually performing less and less standup and moving away from the stage, he continued his directorial duties on television. Two pilots were made for Channel 4, Cluub Zarathustra and Head Farm, but neither was developed into a series. The former featured all the ingredients that would later appear in Attention Scum, a BBC2 series fronted by Simon Munnery's League Against Tedium character, which also featured the likes of Kevin Eldon, Johnny Vegas and Roger Mann, as well as Richard Thomas and opera singer Lore Lixenberg, in their guise as "Kombat Opera".
At the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Lee directed Johnny Vegas' first DVD, Who's Ready For Ice Cream?. In 2004, he returned to stand-up comedy[23] with the show Standup Comedian, which earned him a Tap Water Award in Edinburgh and was released on DVD in October 2005.[5]
Lee was also writing music reviews and when asked in 2003 what his favourites were, he said "Most of my favourites are still going like The Fall, Giant Sand and Calexico. I listen to a lot of jazz, 60s and folk music but I really like Ms. Dynamite, and The Streets".[8]
2005: Jerry Springer: The Opera[edit]
In January 2005, Jerry Springer: The Opera, a satirical musical/opera based upon The Jerry Springer Show, was broadcast on BBC Two, following a highly successful West End run for several years, and as a prelude to the show's UK Tour. Christian Voice led a number of protest groups who claimed that the show was blasphemous and highly offensive. In particular, they were angered by the portrayal of Jesus Christ.
Disputes arose, with supporters claiming that most of the protesters had neither seen the show nor knew of its actual content. Others supported the right to freedom of speech. Several Christian groups protested at some of the venues used during the UK Tour. The show was broadcast with a record number of complaints prior to its transmission. In total, the BBC received 55,000 complaints.[24] A private court case brought by Christian Voice against Lee and others involved with the production for blasphemy was rejected by a Magistrates' Court.
2009: Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle and If You Prefer a Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One[edit]
Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle, a new six-part comedy series featuring standup and sketches, began a six-episode run on 16 March 2009. The executive producer was Armando Iannucci and the script editor was Chris Morris.[25] The first episode received positive reviews from The Independent[26] and The Daily Mirror.[27] Lee himself wrote a negative review of the show in Time Out in which he described himself as "fat" and his performance as "positively Neanderthal, suggesting a jungle-dwelling pygmy, struggling to coax notes out of a clarinet that has fallen from a passing aircraft".[28]
The Guardian named Comedy Vehicle as one of its top ten television highlights of 2009, commenting that it "was the kind of TV that makes you feel like you're not the only one wondering how we came to be surrounded by so much unquestioned mediocrity".[29] One of the show's few negative reviews came in the Sunday Mercury, which stated: "His whole tone is one of complete, smug condescension".[30] Lee subsequently used this line to advertise his next stand-up tour.[31] Lee frequently uses negative reviews on his posters in order to put off potential audience members who are unlikely to be fans of his comedy style.[32]
The first episode was watched by approximately one million viewers,[33] though the figure rose by 25% when BBC iPlayer viewings were factored in and, uncharacteristically, viewing figures rose over the series.[34] The series was the BBC's second most downloaded broadcast during its run. In May 2010, the series was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for best comedy programme.[35] The series would won a BAFTA TV Award for best comedy programme in 2012.[36] After four seasons on BBC2 the show was cancelled.[37]
Lee also had a show at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, named Stewart Lee: If You Prefer a Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One in which he performed his own version of the song "Galway Girl".[38] In December 2009 Lee was nominated for Best Live Stand-up at the British Comedy Awards.[39][40]
Style and material[edit]
Lee's stand up sets comprise topical and sometimes observational comedy, touching on religion, feminism and life in multicultural London. However, he also employs metahumour,[41] and sometimes describes the structure of the set using technical terminology such as "callback".
In an ironic manner he often criticises the audience for not being intelligent enough to understand the joke, preferring the more simplistic material, or enjoying the work of more mainstream "arena" comedians such as Michael McIntyre or Lee Mack.[42] Lee will often contrast his critical success with other comics' more commercial success.
Lee has a reputation for being "politically correct" and of the "liberal elite", and will often exploit the claims and the related trope of "political correctness gone mad" for comic effect.[citation needed]
Lee caused controversy on his If You Prefer a Milder Comedian tour with a routine about Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond. Referring to Hammond's accident while filming in 2006, in which he was almost killed, Lee joked, "I wish he had been decapitated". The Daily Mail termed this an "extraordinary attack"[43] and, having been doorstepped by a Mail journalist, Lee quoted the routine by replying "It's a joke, just like on Top Gear when they do their jokes".[44] Lee subsequently explained the joke:

The idea of what's acceptable and what's shocking, that's where I investigate. I mean, you can't be on Top Gear, where your only argument is that it's all just a joke and anyone who takes offence is an example of political correctness gone mad, and then not accept the counterbalance to that. Put simply, if Clarkson can say the prime minister is a one-eyed Scottish idiot, then I can say that I hope his children go blind.
— Stewart Lee[14]

In an Observer interview, Sean O'Hagan says of the Hammond joke that Lee "operates out in that dangerous hinterland between moral provocation and outright offence, often adopting, as in this instance, the tactics of those he targets in order to highlight their hypocrisy".[14]

Stewart Graham Lee (born 5 April 1968) is an English stand-up comedian, writer and director. In the mid-1990s he was one half of the radio duo Lee and Herring, alongside Richard Herring. He co-wrote and co-directed the mock Broadway hit Jerry Springer: The Opera, a critical success that sparked a backlash from Christian groups who staged a series of protests outside its early stagings.
After a return to the live circuit, and through BBC and Channel 4 specials and series, Lee has rebuilt an audience and a reputation as an anti-populist comedian. In December 2011 he won British Comedy Awards for best male television comic and best comedy entertainment programme for his series Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle.[4]
A 2009 article in The Times referred to him as "the comedian's comedian, and for good reason" and named him "face of the decade".[5] In June 2012 Lee was placed at number 9 in the Top 100 Most Influential People in UK Comedy.[6] His stand-up features frequent use of "repetition, call-backs, nonchalant delivery and deconstruction", a device he often self-consciously refers to on stage.[7]
Lee has written music reviews for publications including The Sunday Times.[8] Through the early 2000s he was a regular presenter on Resonance FM.[9]

Background[edit]
Lee was born in Wellington, Shropshire.[10] He was adopted as a child and grew up in Solihull in the West Midlands.[11] He attended the public school Solihull School on a part scholarship.[12] As a teenager he suffered from ulcerative colitis.[13]
He is married to fellow comic Bridget Christie, with whom he has two children.[14][15] He is a patron of the British Humanist Association,[16] an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society[17] and a member of The Arts Emergency Service.[18] His influences include Ted Chippington, Simon Munnery, Kevin McAleer and Johnny Vegas.[19][20]
Career[edit]
1989–1993: Stand-up and radio[edit]
While studying English at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in the 1980s, he wrote and performed comedy in a revue group called "The Seven Raymonds" with Richard Herring, Emma Kennedy and Tim Richardson, but did not perform in the well-known Oxford Revue, though he did write for and direct the 1989 Revue. Having moved to London and begun performing stand up comedy after university, he rose to greater prominence in 1990, winning the prestigious Hackney Empire New Act of the Year competition.
With Herring, Lee wrote material for BBC Radio 4's On the Hour (1991), which was anchored by Chris Morris and was notable for the first appearance of Steve Coogan's celebrated character, Alan Partridge, for which Lee and Herring wrote much early material. After a disagreement with the rest of the cast, Lee and Herring did not remain with the group when On The Hour moved to television as The Day Today, and their material was excised from an official release of the radio show in the mid-1990s, although it was included in a CD released in 2008.
In 1992 and 1993, he and Herring wrote and performed Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World for BBC Radio 4, before moving to BBC Radio 1, for one series of Fist of Fun (1993), followed by three series of Lee and Herring. Throughout the late nineties he continued performing solo stand-up (something that has always been a mainstay of his career – even whilst in the double act with Herring) and has collaborated with, amongst others, Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding of The Mighty Boosh. Indeed, though Barratt and Fielding had worked together in the past, the first seeds of the Boosh were sown while working as part of Lee's Edinburgh show King Dong vs Moby Dick in which Barratt and Fielding played a giant penis and a whale, respectively. Lee returned the favour by going on to direct their 1999 Edinburgh show, Arctic Boosh, which remains the template for their live work.
2000–04: Quitting stand-up[edit]
In 2001, Lee published his first novel, The Perfect Fool; it was republished in 2008.[21] In the same year he performed Pea Green Boat, a stand-up show which revolved around the deconstruction of the Edward Lear poem The Owl and the Pussycat and a tale of his own broken toilet. This would later be condensed to focus mainly on the poem itself, and a 15-minute version aired on Radio 4. In 2007, Go Faster Stripe released a 25-minute edit on CD & 10" Vinyl.
During late 2000 and early 2001, Lee "gradually, incrementally and without any fanfare – or even much thought – gave up being a stand-up comedian",[22](p2) and 2001 became the first year since 1987 that he did not perform at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.[22](p28) While Lee found himself gradually performing less and less standup and moving away from the stage, he continued his directorial duties on television. Two pilots were made for Channel 4, Cluub Zarathustra and Head Farm, but neither was developed into a series. The former featured all the ingredients that would later appear in Attention Scum, a BBC2 series fronted by Simon Munnery's League Against Tedium character, which also featured the likes of Kevin Eldon, Johnny Vegas and Roger Mann, as well as Richard Thomas and opera singer Lore Lixenberg, in their guise as "Kombat Opera".
At the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Lee directed Johnny Vegas' first DVD, Who's Ready For Ice Cream?. In 2004, he returned to stand-up comedy[23] with the show Standup Comedian, which earned him a Tap Water Award in Edinburgh and was released on DVD in October 2005.[5]
Lee was also writing music reviews and when asked in 2003 what his favourites were, he said "Most of my favourites are still going like The Fall, Giant Sand and Calexico. I listen to a lot of jazz, 60s and folk music but I really like Ms. Dynamite, and The Streets".[8]
2005: Jerry Springer: The Opera[edit]
In January 2005, Jerry Springer: The Opera, a satirical musical/opera based upon The Jerry Springer Show, was broadcast on BBC Two, following a highly successful West End run for several years, and as a prelude to the show's UK Tour. Christian Voice led a number of protest groups who claimed that the show was blasphemous and highly offensive. In particular, they were angered by the portrayal of Jesus Christ.
Disputes arose, with supporters claiming that most of the protesters had neither seen the show nor knew of its actual content. Others supported the right to freedom of speech. Several Christian groups protested at some of the venues used during the UK Tour. The show was broadcast with a record number of complaints prior to its transmission. In total, the BBC received 55,000 complaints.[24] A private court case brought by Christian Voice against Lee and others involved with the production for blasphemy was rejected by a Magistrates' Court.
2009: Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle and If You Prefer a Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One[edit]
Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle, a new six-part comedy series featuring standup and sketches, began a six-episode run on 16 March 2009. The executive producer was Armando Iannucci and the script editor was Chris Morris.[25] The first episode received positive reviews from The Independent[26] and The Daily Mirror.[27] Lee himself wrote a negative review of the show in Time Out in which he described himself as "fat" and his performance as "positively Neanderthal, suggesting a jungle-dwelling pygmy, struggling to coax notes out of a clarinet that has fallen from a passing aircraft".[28]
The Guardian named Comedy Vehicle as one of its top ten television highlights of 2009, commenting that it "was the kind of TV that makes you feel like you're not the only one wondering how we came to be surrounded by so much unquestioned mediocrity".[29] One of the show's few negative reviews came in the Sunday Mercury, which stated: "His whole tone is one of complete, smug condescension".[30] Lee subsequently used this line to advertise his next stand-up tour.[31] Lee frequently uses negative reviews on his posters in order to put off potential audience members who are unlikely to be fans of his comedy style.[32]
The first episode was watched by approximately one million viewers,[33] though the figure rose by 25% when BBC iPlayer viewings were factored in and, uncharacteristically, viewing figures rose over the series.[34] The series was the BBC's second most downloaded broadcast during its run. In May 2010, the series was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for best comedy programme.[35] The series would won a BAFTA TV Award for best comedy programme in 2012.[36] After four seasons on BBC2 the show was cancelled.[37]
Lee also had a show at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, named Stewart Lee: If You Prefer a Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One in which he performed his own version of the song "Galway Girl".[38] In December 2009 Lee was nominated for Best Live Stand-up at the British Comedy Awards.[39][40]
Style and material[edit]
Lee's stand up sets comprise topical and sometimes observational comedy, touching on religion, feminism and life in multicultural London. However, he also employs metahumour,[41] and sometimes describes the structure of the set using technical terminology such as "callback".
In an ironic manner he often criticises the audience for not being intelligent enough to understand the joke, preferring the more simplistic material, or enjoying the work of more mainstream "arena" comedians such as Michael McIntyre or Lee Mack.[42] Lee will often contrast his critical success with other comics' more commercial success.
Lee has a reputation for being "politically correct" and of the "liberal elite", and will often exploit the claims and the related trope of "political correctness gone mad" for comic effect.[citation needed]
Lee caused controversy on his If You Prefer a Milder Comedian tour with a routine about Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond. Referring to Hammond's accident while filming in 2006, in which he was almost killed, Lee joked, "I wish he had been decapitated". The Daily Mail termed this an "extraordinary attack"[43] and, having been doorstepped by a Mail journalist, Lee quoted the routine by replying "It's a joke, just like on Top Gear when they do their jokes".[44] Lee subsequently explained the joke:

The idea of what's acceptable and what's shocking, that's where I investigate. I mean, you can't be on Top Gear, where your only argument is that it's all just a joke and anyone who takes offence is an example of political correctness gone mad, and then not accept the counterbalance to that. Put simply, if Clarkson can say the prime minister is a one-eyed Scottish idiot, then I can say that I hope his children go blind.
— Stewart Lee[14]

In an Observer interview, Sean O'Hagan says of the Hammond joke that Lee "operates out in that dangerous hinterland between moral provocation and outright offence, often adopting, as in this instance, the tactics of those he targets in order to highlight their hypocrisy".[14]

Stewart Graham Lee (born 5 April 1968) is an English stand-up comedian, writer and director. In the mid-1990s he was one half of the radio duo Lee and Herring, alongside Richard Herring. He co-wrote and co-directed the mock Broadway hit Jerry Springer: The Opera, a critical success that sparked a backlash from Christian groups who staged a series of protests outside its early stagings.
After a return to the live circuit, and through BBC and Channel 4 specials and series, Lee has rebuilt an audience and a reputation as an anti-populist comedian. In December 2011 he won British Comedy Awards for best male television comic and best comedy entertainment programme for his series Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle.[4]
A 2009 article in The Times referred to him as "the comedian's comedian, and for good reason" and named him "face of the decade".[5] In June 2012 Lee was placed at number 9 in the Top 100 Most Influential People in UK Comedy.[6] His stand-up features frequent use of "repetition, call-backs, nonchalant delivery and deconstruction", a device he often self-consciously refers to on stage.[7]
Lee has written music reviews for publications including The Sunday Times.[8] Through the early 2000s he was a regular presenter on Resonance FM.[9]

Background[edit]
Lee was born in Wellington, Shropshire.[10] He was adopted as a child and grew up in Solihull in the West Midlands.[11] He attended the public school Solihull School on a part scholarship.[12] As a teenager he suffered from ulcerative colitis.[13]
He is married to fellow comic Bridget Christie, with whom he has two children.[14][15] He is a patron of the British Humanist Association,[16] an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society[17] and a member of The Arts Emergency Service.[18] His influences include Ted Chippington, Simon Munnery, Kevin McAleer and Johnny Vegas.[19][20]
Career[edit]
1989–1993: Stand-up and radio[edit]
While studying English at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in the 1980s, he wrote and performed comedy in a revue group called "The Seven Raymonds" with Richard Herring, Emma Kennedy and Tim Richardson, but did not perform in the well-known Oxford Revue, though he did write for and direct the 1989 Revue. Having moved to London and begun performing stand up comedy after university, he rose to greater prominence in 1990, winning the prestigious Hackney Empire New Act of the Year competition.
With Herring, Lee wrote material for BBC Radio 4's On the Hour (1991), which was anchored by Chris Morris and was notable for the first appearance of Steve Coogan's celebrated character, Alan Partridge, for which Lee and Herring wrote much early material. After a disagreement with the rest of the cast, Lee and Herring did not remain with the group when On The Hour moved to television as The Day Today, and their material was excised from an official release of the radio show in the mid-1990s, although it was included in a CD released in 2008.
In 1992 and 1993, he and Herring wrote and performed Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World for BBC Radio 4, before moving to BBC Radio 1, for one series of Fist of Fun (1993), followed by three series of Lee and Herring. Throughout the late nineties he continued performing solo stand-up (something that has always been a mainstay of his career – even whilst in the double act with Herring) and has collaborated with, amongst others, Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding of The Mighty Boosh. Indeed, though Barratt and Fielding had worked together in the past, the first seeds of the Boosh were sown while working as part of Lee's Edinburgh show King Dong vs Moby Dick in which Barratt and Fielding played a giant penis and a whale, respectively. Lee returned the favour by going on to direct their 1999 Edinburgh show, Arctic Boosh, which remains the template for their live work.
2000–04: Quitting stand-up[edit]
In 2001, Lee published his first novel, The Perfect Fool; it was republished in 2008.[21] In the same year he performed Pea Green Boat, a stand-up show which revolved around the deconstruction of the Edward Lear poem The Owl and the Pussycat and a tale of his own broken toilet. This would later be condensed to focus mainly on the poem itself, and a 15-minute version aired on Radio 4. In 2007, Go Faster Stripe released a 25-minute edit on CD & 10" Vinyl.
During late 2000 and early 2001, Lee "gradually, incrementally and without any fanfare – or even much thought – gave up being a stand-up comedian",[22](p2) and 2001 became the first year since 1987 that he did not perform at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.[22](p28) While Lee found himself gradually performing less and less standup and moving away from the stage, he continued his directorial duties on television. Two pilots were made for Channel 4, Cluub Zarathustra and Head Farm, but neither was developed into a series. The former featured all the ingredients that would later appear in Attention Scum, a BBC2 series fronted by Simon Munnery's League Against Tedium character, which also featured the likes of Kevin Eldon, Johnny Vegas and Roger Mann, as well as Richard Thomas and opera singer Lore Lixenberg, in their guise as "Kombat Opera".
At the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Lee directed Johnny Vegas' first DVD, Who's Ready For Ice Cream?. In 2004, he returned to stand-up comedy[23] with the show Standup Comedian, which earned him a Tap Water Award in Edinburgh and was released on DVD in October 2005.[5]
Lee was also writing music reviews and when asked in 2003 what his favourites were, he said "Most of my favourites are still going like The Fall, Giant Sand and Calexico. I listen to a lot of jazz, 60s and folk music but I really like Ms. Dynamite, and The Streets".[8]
2005: Jerry Springer: The Opera[edit]
In January 2005, Jerry Springer: The Opera, a satirical musical/opera based upon The Jerry Springer Show, was broadcast on BBC Two, following a highly successful West End run for several years, and as a prelude to the show's UK Tour. Christian Voice led a number of protest groups who claimed that the show was blasphemous and highly offensive. In particular, they were angered by the portrayal of Jesus Christ.
Disputes arose, with supporters claiming that most of the protesters had neither seen the show nor knew of its actual content. Others supported the right to freedom of speech. Several Christian groups protested at some of the venues used during the UK Tour. The show was broadcast with a record number of complaints prior to its transmission. In total, the BBC received 55,000 complaints.[24] A private court case brought by Christian Voice against Lee and others involved with the production for blasphemy was rejected by a Magistrates' Court.
2009: Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle and If You Prefer a Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One[edit]
Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle, a new six-part comedy series featuring standup and sketches, began a six-episode run on 16 March 2009. The executive producer was Armando Iannucci and the script editor was Chris Morris.[25] The first episode received positive reviews from The Independent[26] and The Daily Mirror.[27] Lee himself wrote a negative review of the show in Time Out in which he described himself as "fat" and his performance as "positively Neanderthal, suggesting a jungle-dwelling pygmy, struggling to coax notes out of a clarinet that has fallen from a passing aircraft".[28]
The Guardian named Comedy Vehicle as one of its top ten television highlights of 2009, commenting that it "was the kind of TV that makes you feel like you're not the only one wondering how we came to be surrounded by so much unquestioned mediocrity".[29] One of the show's few negative reviews came in the Sunday Mercury, which stated: "His whole tone is one of complete, smug condescension".[30] Lee subsequently used this line to advertise his next stand-up tour.[31] Lee frequently uses negative reviews on his posters in order to put off potential audience members who are unlikely to be fans of his comedy style.[32]
The first episode was watched by approximately one million viewers,[33] though the figure rose by 25% when BBC iPlayer viewings were factored in and, uncharacteristically, viewing figures rose over the series.[34] The series was the BBC's second most downloaded broadcast during its run. In May 2010, the series was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for best comedy programme.[35] The series would won a BAFTA TV Award for best comedy programme in 2012.[36] After four seasons on BBC2 the show was cancelled.[37]
Lee also had a show at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, named Stewart Lee: If You Prefer a Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One in which he performed his own version of the song "Galway Girl".[38] In December 2009 Lee was nominated for Best Live Stand-up at the British Comedy Awards.[39][40]
Style and material[edit]
Lee's stand up sets comprise topical and sometimes observational comedy, touching on religion, feminism and life in multicultural London. However, he also employs metahumour,[41] and sometimes describes the structure of the set using technical terminology such as "callback".
In an ironic manner he often criticises the audience for not being intelligent enough to understand the joke, preferring the more simplistic material, or enjoying the work of more mainstream "arena" comedians such as Michael McIntyre or Lee Mack.[42] Lee will often contrast his critical success with other comics' more commercial success.
Lee has a reputation for being "politically correct" and of the "liberal elite", and will often exploit the claims and the related trope of "political correctness gone mad" for comic effect.[citation needed]
Lee caused controversy on his If You Prefer a Milder Comedian tour with a routine about Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond. Referring to Hammond's accident while filming in 2006, in which he was almost killed, Lee joked, "I wish he had been decapitated". The Daily Mail termed this an "extraordinary attack"[43] and, having been doorstepped by a Mail journalist, Lee quoted the routine by replying "It's a joke, just like on Top Gear when they do their jokes".[44] Lee subsequently explained the joke:

The idea of what's acceptable and what's shocking, that's where I investigate. I mean, you can't be on Top Gear, where your only argument is that it's all just a joke and anyone who takes offence is an example of political correctness gone mad, and then not accept the counterbalance to that. Put simply, if Clarkson can say the prime minister is a one-eyed Scottish idiot, then I can say that I hope his children go blind.
— Stewart Lee[14]

In an Observer interview, Sean O'Hagan says of the Hammond joke that Lee "operates out in that dangerous hinterland between moral provocation and outright offence, often adopting, as in this instance, the tactics of those he targets in order to highlight their hypocrisy".[14]

Stewart Graham Lee (born 5 April 1968) is an English stand-up comedian, writer and director. In the mid-1990s he was one half of the radio duo Lee and Herring, alongside Richard Herring. He co-wrote and co-directed the mock Broadway hit Jerry Springer: The Opera, a critical success that sparked a backlash from Christian groups who staged a series of protests outside its early stagings.
After a return to the live circuit, and through BBC and Channel 4 specials and series, Lee has rebuilt an audience and a reputation as an anti-populist comedian. In December 2011 he won British Comedy Awards for best male television comic and best comedy entertainment programme for his series Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle.[4]
A 2009 article in The Times referred to him as "the comedian's comedian, and for good reason" and named him "face of the decade".[5] In June 2012 Lee was placed at number 9 in the Top 100 Most Influential People in UK Comedy.[6] His stand-up features frequent use of "repetition, call-backs, nonchalant delivery and deconstruction", a device he often self-consciously refers to on stage.[7]
Lee has written music reviews for publications including The Sunday Times.[8] Through the early 2000s he was a regular presenter on Resonance FM.[9]

Background[edit]
Lee was born in Wellington, Shropshire.[10] He was adopted as a child and grew up in Solihull in the West Midlands.[11] He attended the public school Solihull School on a part scholarship.[12] As a teenager he suffered from ulcerative colitis.[13]
He is married to fellow comic Bridget Christie, with whom he has two children.[14][15] He is a patron of the British Humanist Association,[16] an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society[17] and a member of The Arts Emergency Service.[18] His influences include Ted Chippington, Simon Munnery, Kevin McAleer and Johnny Vegas.[19][20]
Career[edit]
1989–1993: Stand-up and radio[edit]
While studying English at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in the 1980s, he wrote and performed comedy in a revue group called "The Seven Raymonds" with Richard Herring, Emma Kennedy and Tim Richardson, but did not perform in the well-known Oxford Revue, though he did write for and direct the 1989 Revue. Having moved to London and begun performing stand up comedy after university, he rose to greater prominence in 1990, winning the prestigious Hackney Empire New Act of the Year competition.
With Herring, Lee wrote material for BBC Radio 4's On the Hour (1991), which was anchored by Chris Morris and was notable for the first appearance of Steve Coogan's celebrated character, Alan Partridge, for which Lee and Herring wrote much early material. After a disagreement with the rest of the cast, Lee and Herring did not remain with the group when On The Hour moved to television as The Day Today, and their material was excised from an official release of the radio show in the mid-1990s, although it was included in a CD released in 2008.
In 1992 and 1993, he and Herring wrote and performed Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World for BBC Radio 4, before moving to BBC Radio 1, for one series of Fist of Fun (1993), followed by three series of Lee and Herring. Throughout the late nineties he continued performing solo stand-up (something that has always been a mainstay of his career – even whilst in the double act with Herring) and has collaborated with, amongst others, Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding of The Mighty Boosh. Indeed, though Barratt and Fielding had worked together in the past, the first seeds of the Boosh were sown while working as part of Lee's Edinburgh show King Dong vs Moby Dick in which Barratt and Fielding played a giant penis and a whale, respectively. Lee returned the favour by going on to direct their 1999 Edinburgh show, Arctic Boosh, which remains the template for their live work.
2000–04: Quitting stand-up[edit]
In 2001, Lee published his first novel, The Perfect Fool; it was republished in 2008.[21] In the same year he performed Pea Green Boat, a stand-up show which revolved around the deconstruction of the Edward Lear poem The Owl and the Pussycat and a tale of his own broken toilet. This would later be condensed to focus mainly on the poem itself, and a 15-minute version aired on Radio 4. In 2007, Go Faster Stripe released a 25-minute edit on CD & 10" Vinyl.
During late 2000 and early 2001, Lee "gradually, incrementally and without any fanfare – or even much thought – gave up being a stand-up comedian",[22](p2) and 2001 became the first year since 1987 that he did not perform at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.[22](p28) While Lee found himself gradually performing less and less standup and moving away from the stage, he continued his directorial duties on television. Two pilots were made for Channel 4, Cluub Zarathustra and Head Farm, but neither was developed into a series. The former featured all the ingredients that would later appear in Attention Scum, a BBC2 series fronted by Simon Munnery's League Against Tedium character, which also featured the likes of Kevin Eldon, Johnny Vegas and Roger Mann, as well as Richard Thomas and opera singer Lore Lixenberg, in their guise as "Kombat Opera".
At the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Lee directed Johnny Vegas' first DVD, Who's Ready For Ice Cream?. In 2004, he returned to stand-up comedy[23] with the show Standup Comedian, which earned him a Tap Water Award in Edinburgh and was released on DVD in October 2005.[5]
Lee was also writing music reviews and when asked in 2003 what his favourites were, he said "Most of my favourites are still going like The Fall, Giant Sand and Calexico. I listen to a lot of jazz, 60s and folk music but I really like Ms. Dynamite, and The Streets".[8]
2005: Jerry Springer: The Opera[edit]
In January 2005, Jerry Springer: The Opera, a satirical musical/opera based upon The Jerry Springer Show, was broadcast on BBC Two, following a highly successful West End run for several years, and as a prelude to the show's UK Tour. Christian Voice led a number of protest groups who claimed that the show was blasphemous and highly offensive. In particular, they were angered by the portrayal of Jesus Christ.
Disputes arose, with supporters claiming that most of the protesters had neither seen the show nor knew of its actual content. Others supported the right to freedom of speech. Several Christian groups protested at some of the venues used during the UK Tour. The show was broadcast with a record number of complaints prior to its transmission. In total, the BBC received 55,000 complaints.[24] A private court case brought by Christian Voice against Lee and others involved with the production for blasphemy was rejected by a Magistrates' Court.
2009: Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle and If You Prefer a Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One[edit]
Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle, a new six-part comedy series featuring standup and sketches, began a six-episode run on 16 March 2009. The executive producer was Armando Iannucci and the script editor was Chris Morris.[25] The first episode received positive reviews from The Independent[26] and The Daily Mirror.[27] Lee himself wrote a negative review of the show in Time Out in which he described himself as "fat" and his performance as "positively Neanderthal, suggesting a jungle-dwelling pygmy, struggling to coax notes out of a clarinet that has fallen from a passing aircraft".[28]
The Guardian named Comedy Vehicle as one of its top ten television highlights of 2009, commenting that it "was the kind of TV that makes you feel like you're not the only one wondering how we came to be surrounded by so much unquestioned mediocrity".[29] One of the show's few negative reviews came in the Sunday Mercury, which stated: "His whole tone is one of complete, smug condescension".[30] Lee subsequently used this line to advertise his next stand-up tour.[31] Lee frequently uses negative reviews on his posters in order to put off potential audience members who are unlikely to be fans of his comedy style.[32]
The first episode was watched by approximately one million viewers,[33] though the figure rose by 25% when BBC iPlayer viewings were factored in and, uncharacteristically, viewing figures rose over the series.[34] The series was the BBC's second most downloaded broadcast during its run. In May 2010, the series was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for best comedy programme.[35] The series would won a BAFTA TV Award for best comedy programme in 2012.[36] After four seasons on BBC2 the show was cancelled.[37]
Lee also had a show at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, named Stewart Lee: If You Prefer a Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One in which he performed his own version of the song "Galway Girl".[38] In December 2009 Lee was nominated for Best Live Stand-up at the British Comedy Awards.[39][40]
Style and material[edit]
Lee's stand up sets comprise topical and sometimes observational comedy, touching on religion, feminism and life in multicultural London. However, he also employs metahumour,[41] and sometimes describes the structure of the set using technical terminology such as "callback".
In an ironic manner he often criticises the audience for not being intelligent enough to understand the joke, preferring the more simplistic material, or enjoying the work of more mainstream "arena" comedians such as Michael McIntyre or Lee Mack.[42] Lee will often contrast his critical success with other comics' more commercial success.
Lee has a reputation for being "politically correct" and of the "liberal elite", and will often exploit the claims and the related trope of "political correctness gone mad" for comic effect.[citation needed]
Lee caused controversy on his If You Prefer a Milder Comedian tour with a routine about Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond. Referring to Hammond's accident while filming in 2006, in which he was almost killed, Lee joked, "I wish he had been decapitated". The Daily Mail termed this an "extraordinary attack"[43] and, having been doorstepped by a Mail journalist, Lee quoted the routine by replying "It's a joke, just like on Top Gear when they do their jokes".[44] Lee subsequently explained the joke:

The idea of what's acceptable and what's shocking, that's where I investigate. I mean, you can't be on Top Gear, where your only argument is that it's all just a joke and anyone who takes offence is an example of political correctness gone mad, and then not accept the counterbalance to that. Put simply, if Clarkson can say the prime minister is a one-eyed Scottish idiot, then I can say that I hope his children go blind.
— Stewart Lee[14]

In an Observer interview, Sean O'Hagan says of the Hammond joke that Lee "operates out in that dangerous hinterland between moral provocation and outright offence, often adopting, as in this instance, the tactics of those he targets in order to highlight their hypocrisy".[14]

Background[edit]
Lee was born in Wellington, Shropshire.[10] He was adopted as a child and grew up in Solihull in the West Midlands.[11] He attended the public school Solihull School on a part scholarship.[12] As a teenager he suffered from ulcerative colitis.[13]
He is married to fellow comic Bridget Christie, with whom he has two children.[14][15] He is a patron of the British Humanist Association,[16] an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society[17] and a member of The Arts Emergency Service.[18] His influences include Ted Chippington, Simon Munnery, Kevin McAleer and Johnny Vegas.[19][20]
Career[edit]
1989–1993: Stand-up and radio[edit]
While studying English at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in the 1980s, he wrote and performed comedy in a revue group called "The Seven Raymonds" with Richard Herring, Emma Kennedy and Tim Richardson, but did not perform in the well-known Oxford Revue, though he did write for and direct the 1989 Revue. Having moved to London and begun performing stand up comedy after university, he rose to greater prominence in 1990, winning the prestigious Hackney Empire New Act of the Year competition.
With Herring, Lee wrote material for BBC Radio 4's On the Hour (1991), which was anchored by Chris Morris and was notable for the first appearance of Steve Coogan's celebrated character, Alan Partridge, for which Lee and Herring wrote much early material. After a disagreement with the rest of the cast, Lee and Herring did not remain with the group when On The Hour moved to television as The Day Today, and their material was excised from an official release of the radio show in the mid-1990s, although it was included in a CD released in 2008.
In 1992 and 1993, he and Herring wrote and performed Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World for BBC Radio 4, before moving to BBC Radio 1, for one series of Fist of Fun (1993), followed by three series of Lee and Herring. Throughout the late nineties he continued performing solo stand-up (something that has always been a mainstay of his career – even whilst in the double act with Herring) and has collaborated with, amongst others, Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding of The Mighty Boosh. Indeed, though Barratt and Fielding had worked together in the past, the first seeds of the Boosh were sown while working as part of Lee's Edinburgh show King Dong vs Moby Dick in which Barratt and Fielding played a giant penis and a whale, respectively. Lee returned the favour by going on to direct their 1999 Edinburgh show, Arctic Boosh, which remains the template for their live work.
2000–04: Quitting stand-up[edit]
In 2001, Lee published his first novel, The Perfect Fool; it was republished in 2008.[21] In the same year he performed Pea Green Boat, a stand-up show which revolved around the deconstruction of the Edward Lear poem The Owl and the Pussycat and a tale of his own broken toilet. This would later be condensed to focus mainly on the poem itself, and a 15-minute version aired on Radio 4. In 2007, Go Faster Stripe released a 25-minute edit on CD & 10" Vinyl.
During late 2000 and early 2001, Lee "gradually, incrementally and without any fanfare – or even much thought – gave up being a stand-up comedian",[22](p2) and 2001 became the first year since 1987 that he did not perform at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.[22](p28) While Lee found himself gradually performing less and less standup and moving away from the stage, he continued his directorial duties on television. Two pilots were made for Channel 4, Cluub Zarathustra and Head Farm, but neither was developed into a series. The former featured all the ingredients that would later appear in Attention Scum, a BBC2 series fronted by Simon Munnery's League Against Tedium character, which also featured the likes of Kevin Eldon, Johnny Vegas and Roger Mann, as well as Richard Thomas and opera singer Lore Lixenberg, in their guise as "Kombat Opera".
At the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Lee directed Johnny Vegas' first DVD, Who's Ready For Ice Cream?. In 2004, he returned to stand-up comedy[23] with the show Standup Comedian, which earned him a Tap Water Award in Edinburgh and was released on DVD in October 2005.[5]
Lee was also writing music reviews and when asked in 2003 what his favourites were, he said "Most of my favourites are still going like The Fall, Giant Sand and Calexico. I listen to a lot of jazz, 60s and folk music but I really like Ms. Dynamite, and The Streets".[8]
2005: Jerry Springer: The Opera[edit]
In January 2005, Jerry Springer: The Opera, a satirical musical/opera based upon The Jerry Springer Show, was broadcast on BBC Two, following a highly successful West End run for several years, and as a prelude to the show's UK Tour. Christian Voice led a number of protest groups who claimed that the show was blasphemous and highly offensive. In particular, they were angered by the portrayal of Jesus Christ.
Disputes arose, with supporters claiming that most of the protesters had neither seen the show nor knew of its actual content. Others supported the right to freedom of speech. Several Christian groups protested at some of the venues used during the UK Tour. The show was broadcast with a record number of complaints prior to its transmission. In total, the BBC received 55,000 complaints.[24] A private court case brought by Christian Voice against Lee and others involved with the production for blasphemy was rejected by a Magistrates' Court.
2009: Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle and If You Prefer a Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One[edit]
Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle, a new six-part comedy series featuring standup and sketches, began a six-episode run on 16 March 2009. The executive producer was Armando Iannucci and the script editor was Chris Morris.[25] The first episode received positive reviews from The Independent[26] and The Daily Mirror.[27] Lee himself wrote a negative review of the show in Time Out in which he described himself as "fat" and his performance as "positively Neanderthal, suggesting a jungle-dwelling pygmy, struggling to coax notes out of a clarinet that has fallen from a passing aircraft".[28]
The Guardian named Comedy Vehicle as one of its top ten television highlights of 2009, commenting that it "was the kind of TV that makes you feel like you're not the only one wondering how we came to be surrounded by so much unquestioned mediocrity".[29] One of the show's few negative reviews came in the Sunday Mercury, which stated: "His whole tone is one of complete, smug condescension".[30] Lee subsequently used this line to advertise his next stand-up tour.[31] Lee frequently uses negative reviews on his posters in order to put off potential audience members who are unlikely to be fans of his comedy style.[32]
The first episode was watched by approximately one million viewers,[33] though the figure rose by 25% when BBC iPlayer viewings were factored in and, uncharacteristically, viewing figures rose over the series.[34] The series was the BBC's second most downloaded broadcast during its run. In May 2010, the series was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for best comedy programme.[35] The series would won a BAFTA TV Award for best comedy programme in 2012.[36] After four seasons on BBC2 the show was cancelled.[37]
Lee also had a show at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, named Stewart Lee: If You Prefer a Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One in which he performed his own version of the song "Galway Girl".[38] In December 2009 Lee was nominated for Best Live Stand-up at the British Comedy Awards.[39][40]
Style and material[edit]
Lee's stand up sets comprise topical and sometimes observational comedy, touching on religion, feminism and life in multicultural London. However, he also employs metahumour,[41] and sometimes describes the structure of the set using technical terminology such as "callback".
In an ironic manner he often criticises the audience for not being intelligent enough to understand the joke, preferring the more simplistic material, or enjoying the work of more mainstream "arena" comedians such as Michael McIntyre or Lee Mack.[42] Lee will often contrast his critical success with other comics' more commercial success.
Lee has a reputation for being "politically correct" and of the "liberal elite", and will often exploit the claims and the related trope of "political correctness gone mad" for comic effect.[citation needed]
Lee caused controversy on his If You Prefer a Milder Comedian tour with a routine about Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond. Referring to Hammond's accident while filming in 2006, in which he was almost killed, Lee joked, "I wish he had been decapitated". The Daily Mail termed this an "extraordinary attack"[43] and, having been doorstepped by a Mail journalist, Lee quoted the routine by replying "It's a joke, just like on Top Gear when they do their jokes".[44] Lee subsequently explained the joke:

The idea of what's acceptable and what's shocking, that's where I investigate. I mean, you can't be on Top Gear, where your only argument is that it's all just a joke and anyone who takes offence is an example of political correctness gone mad, and then not accept the counterbalance to that. Put simply, if Clarkson can say the prime minister is a one-eyed Scottish idiot, then I can say that I hope his children go blind.
— Stewart Lee[14]

In an Observer interview, Sean O'Hagan says of the Hammond joke that Lee "operates out in that dangerous hinterland between moral provocation and outright offence, often adopting, as in this instance, the tactics of those he targets in order to highlight their hypocrisy".[14]

Stewart Graham Lee (born 5 April 1968) is an English stand-up comedian, writer and director. In the mid-1990s he was one half of the radio duo Lee and Herring, alongside Richard Herring. He co-wrote and co-directed the mock Broadway hit Jerry Springer: The Opera, a critical success that sparked a backlash from Christian groups who staged a series of protests outside its early stagings.
After a return to the live circuit, and through BBC and Channel 4 specials and series, Lee has rebuilt an audience and a reputation as an anti-populist comedian. In December 2011 he won British Comedy Awards for best male television comic and best comedy entertainment programme for his series Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle.[4]
A 2009 article in The Times referred to him as "the comedian's comedian, and for good reason" and named him "face of the decade".[5] In June 2012 Lee was placed at number 9 in the Top 100 Most Influential People in UK Comedy.[6] His stand-up features frequent use of "repetition, call-backs, nonchalant delivery and deconstruction", a device he often self-consciously refers to on stage.[7]
Lee has written music reviews for publications including The Sunday Times.[8] Through the early 2000s he was a regular presenter on Resonance FM.[9]

Background[edit]
Lee was born in Wellington, Shropshire.[10] He was adopted as a child and grew up in Solihull in the West Midlands.[11] He attended the public school Solihull School on a part scholarship.[12] As a teenager he suffered from ulcerative colitis.[13]
He is married to fellow comic Bridget Christie, with whom he has two children.[14][15] He is a patron of the British Humanist Association,[16] an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society[17] and a member of The Arts Emergency Service.[18] His influences include Ted Chippington, Simon Munnery, Kevin McAleer and Johnny Vegas.[19][20]
Career[edit]
1989–1993: Stand-up and radio[edit]
While studying English at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in the 1980s, he wrote and performed comedy in a revue group called "The Seven Raymonds" with Richard Herring, Emma Kennedy and Tim Richardson, but did not perform in the well-known Oxford Revue, though he did write for and direct the 1989 Revue. Having moved to London and begun performing stand up comedy after university, he rose to greater prominence in 1990, winning the prestigious Hackney Empire New Act of the Year competition.
With Herring, Lee wrote material for BBC Radio 4's On the Hour (1991), which was anchored by Chris Morris and was notable for the first appearance of Steve Coogan's celebrated character, Alan Partridge, for which Lee and Herring wrote much early material. After a disagreement with the rest of the cast, Lee and Herring did not remain with the group when On The Hour moved to television as The Day Today, and their material was excised from an official release of the radio show in the mid-1990s, although it was included in a CD released in 2008.
In 1992 and 1993, he and Herring wrote and performed Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World for BBC Radio 4, before moving to BBC Radio 1, for one series of Fist of Fun (1993), followed by three series of Lee and Herring. Throughout the late nineties he continued performing solo stand-up (something that has always been a mainstay of his career – even whilst in the double act with Herring) and has collaborated with, amongst others, Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding of The Mighty Boosh. Indeed, though Barratt and Fielding had worked together in the past, the first seeds of the Boosh were sown while working as part of Lee's Edinburgh show King Dong vs Moby Dick in which Barratt and Fielding played a giant penis and a whale, respectively. Lee returned the favour by going on to direct their 1999 Edinburgh show, Arctic Boosh, which remains the template for their live work.
2000–04: Quitting stand-up[edit]
In 2001, Lee published his first novel, The Perfect Fool; it was republished in 2008.[21] In the same year he performed Pea Green Boat, a stand-up show which revolved around the deconstruction of the Edward Lear poem The Owl and the Pussycat and a tale of his own broken toilet. This would later be condensed to focus mainly on the poem itself, and a 15-minute version aired on Radio 4. In 2007, Go Faster Stripe released a 25-minute edit on CD & 10" Vinyl.
During late 2000 and early 2001, Lee "gradually, incrementally and without any fanfare – or even much thought – gave up being a stand-up comedian",[22](p2) and 2001 became the first year since 1987 that he did not perform at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.[22](p28) While Lee found himself gradually performing less and less standup and moving away from the stage, he continued his directorial duties on television. Two pilots were made for Channel 4, Cluub Zarathustra and Head Farm, but neither was developed into a series. The former featured all the ingredients that would later appear in Attention Scum, a BBC2 series fronted by Simon Munnery's League Against Tedium character, which also featured the likes of Kevin Eldon, Johnny Vegas and Roger Mann, as well as Richard Thomas and opera singer Lore Lixenberg, in their guise as "Kombat Opera".
At the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Lee directed Johnny Vegas' first DVD, Who's Ready For Ice Cream?. In 2004, he returned to stand-up comedy[23] with the show Standup Comedian, which earned him a Tap Water Award in Edinburgh and was released on DVD in October 2005.[5]
Lee was also writing music reviews and when asked in 2003 what his favourites were, he said "Most of my favourites are still going like The Fall, Giant Sand and Calexico. I listen to a lot of jazz, 60s and folk music but I really like Ms. Dynamite, and The Streets".[8]
2005: Jerry Springer: The Opera[edit]
In January 2005, Jerry Springer: The Opera, a satirical musical/opera based upon The Jerry Springer Show, was broadcast on BBC Two, following a highly successful West End run for several years, and as a prelude to the show's UK Tour. Christian Voice led a number of protest groups who claimed that the show was blasphemous and highly offensive. In particular, they were angered by the portrayal of Jesus Christ.
Disputes arose, with supporters claiming that most of the protesters had neither seen the show nor knew of its actual content. Others supported the right to freedom of speech. Several Christian groups protested at some of the venues used during the UK Tour. The show was broadcast with a record number of complaints prior to its transmission. In total, the BBC received 55,000 complaints.[24] A private court case brought by Christian Voice against Lee and others involved with the production for blasphemy was rejected by a Magistrates' Court.
2009: Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle and If You Prefer a Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One[edit]
Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle, a new six-part comedy series featuring standup and sketches, began a six-episode run on 16 March 2009. The executive producer was Armando Iannucci and the script editor was Chris Morris.[25] The first episode received positive reviews from The Independent[26] and The Daily Mirror.[27] Lee himself wrote a negative review of the show in Time Out in which he described himself as "fat" and his performance as "positively Neanderthal, suggesting a jungle-dwelling pygmy, struggling to coax notes out of a clarinet that has fallen from a passing aircraft".[28]
The Guardian named Comedy Vehicle as one of its top ten television highlights of 2009, commenting that it "was the kind of TV that makes you feel like you're not the only one wondering how we came to be surrounded by so much unquestioned mediocrity".[29] One of the show's few negative reviews came in the Sunday Mercury, which stated: "His whole tone is one of complete, smug condescension".[30] Lee subsequently used this line to advertise his next stand-up tour.[31] Lee frequently uses negative reviews on his posters in order to put off potential audience members who are unlikely to be fans of his comedy style.[32]
The first episode was watched by approximately one million viewers,[33] though the figure rose by 25% when BBC iPlayer viewings were factored in and, uncharacteristically, viewing figures rose over the series.[34] The series was the BBC's second most downloaded broadcast during its run. In May 2010, the series was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for best comedy programme.[35] The series would won a BAFTA TV Award for best comedy programme in 2012.[36] After four seasons on BBC2 the show was cancelled.[37]
Lee also had a show at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, named Stewart Lee: If You Prefer a Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One in which he performed his own version of the song "Galway Girl".[38] In December 2009 Lee was nominated for Best Live Stand-up at the British Comedy Awards.[39][40]
Style and material[edit]
Lee's stand up sets comprise topical and sometimes observational comedy, touching on religion, feminism and life in multicultural London. However, he also employs metahumour,[41] and sometimes describes the structure of the set using technical terminology such as "callback".
In an ironic manner he often criticises the audience for not being intelligent enough to understand the joke, preferring the more simplistic material, or enjoying the work of more mainstream "arena" comedians such as Michael McIntyre or Lee Mack.[42] Lee will often contrast his critical success with other comics' more commercial success.
Lee has a reputation for being "politically correct" and of the "liberal elite", and will often exploit the claims and the related trope of "political correctness gone mad" for comic effect.[citation needed]
Lee caused controversy on his If You Prefer a Milder Comedian tour with a routine about Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond. Referring to Hammond's accident while filming in 2006, in which he was almost killed, Lee joked, "I wish he had been decapitated". The Daily Mail termed this an "extraordinary attack"[43] and, having been doorstepped by a Mail journalist, Lee quoted the routine by replying "It's a joke, just like on Top Gear when they do their jokes".[44] Lee subsequently explained the joke:

The idea of what's acceptable and what's shocking, that's where I investigate. I mean, you can't be on Top Gear, where your only argument is that it's all just a joke and anyone who takes offence is an example of political correctness gone mad, and then not accept the counterbalance to that. Put simply, if Clarkson can say the prime minister is a one-eyed Scottish idiot, then I can say that I hope his children go blind.
— Stewart Lee[14]

In an Observer interview, Sean O'Hagan says of the Hammond joke that Lee "operates out in that dangerous hinterland between moral provocation and outright offence, often adopting, as in this instance, the tactics of those he targets in order to highlight their hypocrisy".[14]

"The boringly infantile Stewart Lee."
 - Peter Ould, Youtube
"I was Stage Manager for Stewart Lee. It wasn't performance art, stand up comedy or satire. It was a fucking train-wreck. That man could not read an audience 3 feet away.﻿ And yes, I got to know his act well during the rehearsals and Tech rehearsal. I also got to know the fact that the man is a functioning alcoholic, finishing nearly 12 cans to himself before going onstage, and that he is banned from the entire chain of theatres I used to work at for being rude, dismissive of staff and responding terribly to bad audience feedback.  I don't hate this man in the slightest, I pity him. Where he tries to wear the "never hitting mainstream" as a cloak (Even naming a tour after it) the cracks appear when you're one on one with him. He is angry, and I don't think he know who he's angry at.﻿"

"Stewart Lee used to one of my favorite funnymen, but I think he's lost it now. I just don't find him funny anymore. He hasn't made me laugh since 1999. I always preferred Richard Herring anyway."
 - Joskins, Leeds Music Forum
I was really looking forward to Stewart Lee ep1 (on tv) but it's the show me and Marianne Powell (live) last year, how disappointing."
 - Louise Brown, Twitter
"Genuinely can't stand him, he comes across as the sort that thinks that live comedy should just be kept to smoky art student union clubs and that any comedian that plays in arenas is destroying the so called "artistic integrity" of stand up when we all know stand-up comedy is not an art form it's a form of live entertainment.

"I think describing himself as a comedian is the only funny thing the man has ever said. Don't bother telling me that I don't get it; I don't want it. It's only possible to like right-on, lefty comedians like Stuart Lee if you're a right-on lefty yourself. Like all right-on lefties he feigns contempt of intolerance and ridicules people for the predictably, allegedly right wing intolerances ascribed to stereotypically right wing people. To me, morally or comedically this is no better than Bernard Manning or Jim Davidson both of whom were genuinely funny even if you now think their jokes were racist but neither of them were genuinely bigoted, IMHO of course, like Stewart Lee and his fans. In attempting to send up intolerance by being blatantly intolerant and bigoted, Lee falls flat on his face making any genuinely tolerant, left-of-centre, liberals so horrified that they simply could not laugh. In short, if you're a bigoted, socialist worker, civil servant, teacher, social worker or NHS employee then Stuart Lee is the comedian for you. If you actually care about tolerance for all, even those who have different political opinons from you, he's about as funny as the credit crunch."

"Lee makes pretentious lefty dickheads feel good about themselves and superior to others. Why does any fan of this guy think they are also smart, high brow, cool non-conformists with sophisticated tastes that are above unprententious people like Macintyre? I couldn't stand the guy for years just from the sound of his voice that I'd never even bothered to hear one routine from him. I thought him some soft, middle class idiot. But for me any one who can parody real life events has a better gift for comedy than when it seems contrived, as does Lee's a lot of the time. To get Lee, you have to share that same conceited, immature arrogance common to all lefties. Really, anyone talking like they are somehow smart for getting Lee and you need a higher intellect to grasp him, whereas you have to be a moron to appreciate the likes of Macintyre is just a gullible idiot who has fallen for a deliberately crafted and honed comedy act. When someone can make humour of of real life we can all relate to, it's not an act, like Lee's is, but they're just genuinely funny."

While this works to keep him a cult following of der brains who enjoy playing the game of 'I'm holier than thou', it's the reason while he'll never be mainstream (you have to be funny to do that) and why critics who like him always have to apologise for his contributions to high profile charity gigs in venues when the punters don't laugh.

"That's 15 minutes of my life wasted. How on earth Stewart Lee can equate Clarkson remarking about Gordon Brown having one eye to Clarkson mocking a blind child is ludicrous and lazy.

"Just like to say I watched Stewart Lee the other night and found it awfully smug and tedious. I like comedy that plays with the audience's expectations and attempts to subvert comedic conventions, as long as it's actually funny. I think the appeal of Stewart Lee lies in his perceived cosmopolitan exclusivity, that he's meant to be the thinking persons comedian. If you don't like him it's because you don't 'get' him, or your not quite clever enough to keep up. Which is bollocks. The last series of Limmy's show was far funnier and a damn sight more clever and original than this over-rated muffet of poo, why the BBC opted not to air it nationwide is beyond me."

"I think the difference is that Clarkson, Brand and Ross are actually funny, or at the very least entertaining. Lee just bitches about these people in a smug, juvenile and bitter way. All he does is bitch about people that are more successful than him, but wrap it up into some self-righteous, self-serving, smug diatribe. At least 75% of his "comedy" is picking on individuals from this pedestal he has placed himself upon."

"Stewart is a self deluded person, who looks into a mirror and sees great sadness . What a loser he is then. He should grow up and shut up. Hes got many problems I feel and should seek help! If he cant grow up maybe he should go a way. Because hes a posh boy he cant get a way with anything, but hes just spolit brat by the look at it."  
 - Mr Cool, Wales, Dailymail.co.uk
"George Carlin was an intelligent comedian and his delivery was great at a normal speed. This is just slow-motion man. It goes beyond any form of comedic timing. This is like watching a sloth read an essay. I think the most impressive thing is his ability to find enough middle-aged angry champagne socialists to buy tickets for a horrendously unfunny act. 
I'm sure if I watched for long enough he'd have rolled out a few tired Daily Mail comments. Comedy is about making you laugh... not about allowing you to join in a public snide-athon where one can exude moral exclusivity with our peers. It's smug, self-righteous bs."

"His style grates on me, I don't think he's as clever as he thinks he is. I see the jokes, but they're usually so drawn out that I see the punchline a mile away. If he billed it as a spoken word piece then I might have enjoyed it more. And I don't think he's very funny. I didn't laugh once.

"Consistenly dreadful. His slow lazy delivery it's not particularly funny from my point of view, for instance the rappar 'joke' a few weeks ago had some initial laughs but he dragged it on for far too long, often repeating himself after long silences. He doesn't interact with the audience, which is a major negaitve giving how close he is to them during the show, and looking straight at the camera during it to try and engage with the audience at home is needless and desperate. 
Without doubt the joke he done lying on his back was the worst, I was embarressed for him by the end. He doesn't fall into any particular categories, he is not edgy enough to shock the audience and he lacks persona and stage presence, not creative enought to preach a political mantra or try something that hasn't been done hundreds of times by different comedians and he doesn't have any angle beside the boring grumpy middle aged man. And he is not fat, he should stop saying that he is. 
The sketches actually make the show worse, sewage coming out a television, I pay a license for this? :unsure: I don't have anything against him, I've never seen him live and there are plenty of worse comedians out there but some reviewers are hailing this as the funniest thing on TV at the moment, I just don't see the attraction."

"I and by the sounds of it, many others fail to find Stewart Lee "funny". To hear the audience braying with laughter always puzzles me; it makes me think I'm too "daft" to get it. However, I really think the audience forces laughter beacuse, as fully paid up members of "the Liberal Left/Starbucks Society" demographic, they feel they have to. Mr Lee's take on the tics and foibles of humankind can be amusing but not laugh out loud funny. However if you get tickets to a Stewart Lee show or recording, you know what to expect and therefore you "know" it's going to be hilarious and you wouldn't want to be left out, would you. My, that's a lovely new suit the Emperor's wearing isn't it. He is not a genius. He is shit on a stick."

If you went out in the street and asked a hundred people about him you'd be hard pressed to find a handful who'd even heard of the miserable coconut. Never mind think he was funny.  I saw him on an old 8 out of 10 Cats repeat the other day. He hardly made a contribution, just sitting there partly looking out of his depth and embarrassed to be there exposed as talentless and partly with a smug look on his fat ugly mug. The only few people who even claim to rate him are the usual crowd who think he may in some way be "clever" and so by claiming to like the unfunny twonk somehow raises their own "status"."

"I watched this DVD after seeing a praise filled recommendation from Dara O'Briain, the Irish comic. And I usually check the Amazon reviews of something as well, especially if it evokes a strong reaction. I was surprised to see no negative reviews for this. So I'm going to add this one, in the hopes that it might be of use to like minded comedy fans. In a nutshell, it was the worst comedy show I've ever ever sat through, that I can remember anyway. What could explain it, I wondered to myself? I clearly like Dara O'Briains comedy. Why did this not appeal to me? Well, I think what's happened is this. A comedian knows comedy, so if you present A and B and C together, the comedian can probably immediately see how they fit together, even if he's never heard the joke before. We also know that laughing is a result of the unexpected. Stewart Lee seems to put together A and B and C in unexpected ways. This means comedians might find it funny. But the general public would find utterly unfunny.  To give an analogy; Picasso could actually paint really really well. Almost photographic quality. It was only when he broke all the "rules" of painting that he became famous though. And people said he was a genius. But if all you saw was his messed up paintings of women with a nose where their ear should be, you could be forgiven for saying "This guy can't paint. Why is he famous?"  
Stewart Lee, I think, might be the Picasso of comics.  He didn't make me laugh. But professional comics can probably appreciate it, and laugh or whatever.  Of course, that could all be rubbish. Maybe he's hilarious and I just don't get it.  But I don't personally see much difference between a guy who studiously and ironically pretends not to be funny and pretends to have a comedic routine fall apart on stage and pretends to restart the show... and a guy who simply is not funny and who's comedic routine falls apart and has to restart the show."

"Stewart Lee is about as funny as a car crash. He really is the most boring comedian out there. I thought he was unfunny last time I saw him. Surely a tiny requisite for being a comedian is to be at least slightly funny? A total hypocrite - he has a go at people making money from writing books - which is something he does and then goes on to make other points that he himself does. Stewart Lee is just a hypocritial, unfunny, weird looking gobshite. He'd be crap on Top Gear. 
He seems to be from the Jack Dee school of unfunny monotone comments that are just comments. Not funny comments or ones you agree with. Most of the laughter comes across as sympathy 'Wow, this fella is really boring and as funny as my cat eating whiskers'. I think Stewart Lee is a total cock, unfunny as a dose of the clap and boring as shite and therefore don't watch him. He had a go at Clarkson for making money off a book. He himself makes money off books. The 'comedian' had a go at someone else for making money off books. And he makes money off books himself. He is saying 'not good' for something he does himself. = Hypocrite. An unfunny cock. "

I wish that he would show more evidence of the fact that he read English at Saint Edmond's Hall Oxford. The evidence of this has been carefully sifted out along with his Shropshire accent as he has adopted both the speech and cognitive vocabulary and conventions which are the default position of the speakers of Estuary English with whom he presumably spends his days. ?During the Fist OF Fun days he made a darkly glamorous, if static, foil to the far more comedically gifted Richard Herring, but that was then, the glamour has long departed ( welcome to the club Mr Lee ), and he does not seem to have gained anything in the way of skill from the period working alongside his erstwhile partner. And I was able to predict his line on any subject with completely accuracy to the lady of the house."

"I think Stewart Lee has just one problem as a comedian, for all his faux intellectual affectations and his penchant for student union politics, he just isnt funny. I tried hard to like it but it all has a whiff of the emporers new clothes. For me he has just about managing to maintain his status to a level where you actually remember who he is since that awful lee and herring thing. I guess that as fringe acts/celebs, who struggle to capture the audience they are clearly desperate for, begin to fade, their act has to become more shocking to maintain their profile, rather than funny."

"Stood behind him in the queue at Forbidden Planet last year, he was reading a poor collection of Hellblazer rather than anything substantial, and anyone who buys their books at FP is a nob-ed.  I was hoping for quality comedy, but this stand up was padded out with drivel (ie the rapper thing, y'know, the thing about rappers, you know don't you, rappers, yeah, rappers, on the bannister, rappers, they slide along 'em, rappers, they do, they're called rappers etc.) I didn't laugh once despite being ripped to the t's and wanting to find it funny. His act really misses Herrring's over eager schoolboy to his aloof indie schtick, and maybe an editor to tell him 'This isn't funny, go and rewrite it till it is. I'd love to join the Stewart Lee bandwagon that all the reviewers seem to be on, but I'm going to sit on the sidelines and throw the rotten tomatoes till he starts being funny. I too have loved Stewart, but this seems more like I've met up with him through Friends reunited after years apart, had one bad shag, gone back for another just to find that he was a bad shag first time."

 - Mr Dogshit, b3ta
"I think Manning and Lee have more in common than most would care to admit, even if, for some, his politics make him almost impossible not to like (even when he doesn't crack many genuine funnies). If Manning lazily picks easy targets, then what does Lee do in relation to the supposed stupidity of Americans (implicit - 'we're better than Americans' - a cheap way to win over an audience)? And his taking the piss out of other comedians is a bit desperate (implicit - 'I'm better/ more intelligent than other comedians - and so are you for coming to see me' ). And people say he's not smug. It's this suffocatingly self congratulatory aspect of his comedy which stops me enjoying him (alongside the sparsity of genuinely funny stuff) . Then of course, there's the suffocating smugness of his fans. 'We're clever like Stu. Not like you oiks laughing at toasters'."  
 - Sam Beckett 2, Guardian.co.uk
"I've got an English Degree and I'm gonna use it! Lee reminds me of a passage in Frank Skinners book, when, after he graduated, he became impossibly pretentious pseud, until someone knocked the shit out of him in a pub (sadly this has never happened to Lee). Stewart lee is clever, not funny, stylistically boring - another Guardian favorite along with Jarvis Cocker (they can do no harm). The point is for Stewy to show all his snidey fellow Morrisey fans how smart he is, and that's it really, an almost unbearable ego-fest of 80's alternative comedy."

A smug git, who i cant work out if he's just cornered a market (in which id respect him), or if he really is that vindictive towards political incorrectness (which makes him a twat)."

"Apart from Asher D's book, he appeared to have read the first page of Chris Moyles' "Difficult Second Book" and there was no evidence that he had read anything at all of the others he mentioned (Clarkson, Brand, Brown, Rowling). Brown's literary construction lends itself to being battered (he writes as if his prose is converted from stage directions), but Lee just made up a line. 
A funny line, yes, but that doesn't make it intelligent criticism. It just makes it a sneery one-liner from a comedian who didn't bother to research his material. He didn't actually refer to the content of "My Booky Wook" (I haven't read it either, but then I'm not the one claiming intellectual superiority by dismissing it purely on the basis of its title) or the Harry Potter series... or the Clarkson books. That just leaves the Asher D book (which he did seem to have read, and on which subject he actually was quite intelligent and funny â€“ though the sausage-on-fork thing was a rather embarrassing lapse into reference-in-place-of-actual-joke) and the Chris Moyles book. 
What does Lee attack Moyles for? Not his literary construction, not his factual veracity, not his underlying political leanings, but... knowing and admitting to his own limitations. I don't buy this theory that Lee's rant is any less reactionary than those of the Grumpy Old Men. It's sneering, posturing, made from a position of ignorance, aiming at easy targets... and missing them. He really has become a lazy comedy slag."

"It's true, he is a genius. I heard him interviewed by Clive Anderson on a R4 review programme. Anderson was enthusiastic about Lee's recent gigs and upcoming new shows and Lee lapped up the attention. Then Anderson brought up a personal attack by Lee on fellow "funny man" Russell Brand during one of Lee's stand up shows. Apparently during this attack, Lee quoted Brand, the quote demonstrating that Brand is an immoral, shitty, worthless excuse for a human being, and not the intellectually and morally superior experimental kind of individual that Lee is. Unfortunately, Anderson reveals, Lee misquoted Brand, and so changed the entire meaning of what Brand had originally said. 
So far, so you've-not-done-your-research. Lee's true genius shone through moments later though when Anderson put it to him that he had deliberately misquoted Brand, and so was not just a bit lax, but actively dishonest. "Well...", squirmed Lee, "..when you're on stage...performing, I mean...you're not really being yourself. And...I...wanted to show this by quoting something that Brand didn't actually say to...say something about the nature of...performance". Throughout his passage of discomfort he didn't sound smug once, and I never laughed so much in my life. Genius."

"There is a disgusting comedy routine by Stewart Lee in which he slags Richard Hammond off, tells lies about him and says that he hopes that Richard dies.  It certainly is not funny.  I was at school with both of them and I know why Lee is so bitter about Richard.  Richard has always been a thoroughly nice chap. 
He is unbelievably kind and always stuck up for people who were being bullied. His artistic skills are fantastic and he was always way ahead of everyone else in terms of having a mature outlook.  However, the senior school we went to in 1981 was extremely old-fashioned and had an awful "macho culture".
Richard disliked it from the start.  Lee was at least two years older than Richard and a typical arrogant posh-boy.  I am certan he never knew Richard at all.  Lee always arrogantly thought he was going to be a big star and is now very bitter that an unacademic, down-to-earth character like Richard is a well-loved superstar whilst Lee is just treading the comedy circuit.
That's what happened.  Lee never knew Richard and anything Lee has said about knowing Richard is a almost certainly a complete lie. Thanks for letting me put the record straight."

"He's on 11.25 on BBC2 because he's simply not funny to anyone outside of a very small niche audience (the smug middle-class smug liberal left). That's why he's on after Newsnight. He can be as smug and unfunny as he wants, but as long as he recieves a BBC paycheque, I have the right to be critical of him. He's not funny, and he's clearly got friends in high places to have continually been promoted as a funnyman for over a decade."

"Even Mark Thomas, the Voice of the Socialist Worker, is funnier than Stewart Lee. Having said that, there's few things in the history of the world less funny than Stewart Lee- most of which are far too obvious to list. I could go on stage at the Comedy Store, die on my backside so hard I would be pelted off with broken bottles, and still be far better at comedy than him. IMO, Stewart Lee's show ranks on a level with terminal disease, the rise of China and the worst BBC comedies I ever saw: the 2000s Ardal O' Hanlon vehicle "My Hero" (and all those American family aspirational sitcoms that it was based on); and "Little Miss Jocelyn", in my personal list of comedy choices. We asked for a new Bill Hicks and got Stewart Lee."

"I had a dream last night I was beating this guy up. This fucking cunt is devastatingly unfunny. A ridiculously unfunny cunt. I was in shock for a couple of days after his last show. I am rarely shocked at stuff on TV, but I could scarcely believe my eyes or ears that what I was watching was actually happening. Political correctness seems to guarantee an unfunny, student humour cunt of a comedian. I was watching a Bernard Manning DVD recently, he was a proper funny cunt. 
He told one about 2 Jews who were best mates, one asks the other what he would do if he won the lottery, his mate says: "Well, I would share it with you for a start, you are my best friend and I would share anything with you", His mate says "That is very generous, what would you do if you had 2 houses?", "Well, of course I would give you one of them." "What about 2 cars?", "I would give one of them to you, my friend.", "What if you had 2 chickens?"' "Now fuck off, you know I've got 2 chickens." 
Press the red button, I fucking dare you. 'Stewart Lee Presents' is on, featuring some weirdo, in drag, who has just said he gets his material directly from Satan. I won't argue with you on that one, you poof. And Stewart Lee, you can stick your crisps, and your Grandad, right up your fucking arse, you boring cunt."

If only he could let it go (as is so true with Williams) and simply let people make their minds up without the immense childlike immaturity of trying to appear so cool about it he would be not only more likeable, but just a much better comedian. He would have a witty and clever reply even to this though no doubt. Poor Stu."

"Another devastatingly unfunny cunt, according to his bastard fans, anyone who doesn't find him funny aren't intelligent enough to get his humour. Since when has being smug, boring, spiteful and not to mention extremely fucking creepy been the height of hilarity? They can keep him the weirdo bastards. Solely put on this earth to condescend the absolute fuck out of anyone that's stupid enough to listen, mainly liberals who, like him, believe their smarter than everyone else.
I remember seeing this cock on 8 out 10 cats once, not a great show i know although i quite enjoy watching sean lock on it, everytime he spoke he fell flat on his arse, it was so amusing watching him be outwitted by the very type of people he regulary deems witless, he went on to say that it was one of the lowest points of his career, not because he made himself look like a prick oh no, but because he wants people to believe he's to good for a show of that nature. It pains me to say it, bit i think i'm witnessing someone who's even more undeservedly aggrandized than even Bill fucking Hicks is, he's lucky that theres people stupid enough out there that will settle for someone like him who cannot, for the life of him, muster up the main ingredient that someone in his position SHOULD have, the ability to make others laugh, instead he gives them nastiness, bitterness, huge amounts of snobbery and one great big condescension, appalling beyond belief! 
I've been unfortunate enough to pay money to watch this talentless buffoon. He had this part of his act whereby he held an vinyl record above his head repeating the title, the multitude lapped it up as insecure in their intellect as lee himself. Only a fucking moron would put up with being patronised to fuck by such a unfunny, clearly bitter, out of date prick such as this 90's fucking throw back, there's no intelligence required for this onslaught of pure cuntishness. 
He tells what he thinks is a joke, then has the nerve to turns smugly to his audience and practically ask what type of joke it is and whether it's funny, again thinking he get's something everyone else doesn't, talk about vilifying the very people that pay for his meaningless existence, it's not their job to be judged it's yours you useless fucking humour vacuum. he's a cunt."

"I know this guy... not well... but I can in fact confirm that he is a cock ! I've spoken to him several times in the past at various get-together's (although not recently) and he is a bit of a pillock!  He used to go out with my wifes' cousin. He came up a few times for Xmas and one or two other things. I found him to be a little condescending and a bit arrogant... I think it must be a thing with people who become famous, whereby they automatically think they are superior to you, just cos they've been on Telly... Anyway they've split up now and my wifes cousin seems a lot happier. I'd expect him to keep his stand-up routine seperate from day to day life, but then perhaps I'm expecting too much. I like his comedy, but as a person, he's a bit of an arse."

"You can tell that the laughing is uncomfortable laughing. They don't know when to laugh but feel they should. He thinks he's clever by explaining his own jokes and how they work. Other comedians could do the same but realise it's lazy and crap, but with a coating of Stewart's smug veneer it becomes 'intelligent' to his audience, cunts sucked into the Lee vortex of smug who think Lee is some military general of comedy who sets trap that allow him the have the last laugh as victory, when in fact he's just exploiting daft self-proclaimed comedy connoisseurs who he knows will like anything that's deemed intellectual, no matter how many times he mumbles 'crisps'."

"Ah Mr Lee is doing postmodernist comedy. Not only does he tell 'a joke' he then asks the audience whether the 'joke' is funny/offensive/ironic/slapstick/ ... or just crap. So now standup turns on its head by vilifying the audience for laughing/not laughing at a particular time during the performance. Hmm. Like prog rock which disappeared up its own arsehole or conceptual art which just relies upon the talentless flagellating the 'uneducated' so standup now moves into realm of not being funny, which (strokes beard here) is er... funny. Ladies and gentlemen and reviewers who "think he's the funniest thing on television right now" please get a grip...... or watch some vintage Les Dawson to see how it's really done."

"You do a 9 minute routine on extreme misogyny and then finish it by describe someone as a `cunt' to get a cheap laugh. Pathetic hypocrisy... and not funny. Stewart Lee is using the word cunt - which is a misogynist word. He is a witless, hypocritical prick. And he isn't funny."

"Stewart lee seems like hes stuck in a 'right on' era. Hes not as funny, cutting edge or clever as he probably thinks he is. He gets some things right but his deire to challenge modern life and society dont quite hit the spot and come over as both studenty and smug. He reminds me of that other 'protesting' comedian Mark Thomas. Allthough both are probably well intentioned."

"I sat through one episode of the Stewart Lee's "Comedy Vehicle". Half an hour thinking, "he can't be THIS bad surely? When's he going something, anything funny or even mildly interesting?....but the Guardian loves him!" Half an hour of my life wasted that I'll never get back. Oh I see, it's post modern irony - he's a comedian who ironically, doesn't make you laugh."

"Same old mis-informed deluded shite from the master of donkeys wank humour." 
 - Anon, Marublog.net
I have been watching Stewart Lee religiously for a few years but season 2 of Comedy Vehicle is awful so far. He bounds back and forth between smugly denigrating other, more commercial standups, and self-indulgently whining/bragging that he isn't himself more popular. Making "ironic" jokes about his poor audience and venue.
 I know people will insist he is 'playing a character' here, but after dozens of references it comes off as extremely bitter, sad and misanthropic. His criticisms of modern stand-up would be valid were it not for the fact that more than half of the material is recycled from his old DVDs. You can't blast other comedians for a lack of talent/imagination and then rely on decades-old tried and tested material. Half the problem is his unbearable audience, insisting on articles like this that he is a 'thinking man's comedian' while lazily bellowing with laughter at each prompted pause in his speech, like a bunch of dogs being taught to beg for a treat."

"Stewart Lee is pretty shit. He's a bog standard comedian, except he has this pseudo ironic facade, and it's all very lazy, because if he's funny then yay he's funny everybody praise the funny man and if he's not funny then oh lawdy he's not supposed to be funny that's the JOKE I can't believe you were so stupid as to expect that bit to be funny it's making a STATEMENT. It's the exact same covering-all-angles, non committal, insincere, bastardise-irony-for-your-own-self-aggrandisement approach as every 4chan acolyte who ever ruined your game of TF2, except because it's an ugly middle-aged bloke saying it to a crowd of thirty-something Londoners and making them feel clever, rather than making them feel like the superfluous sacks of skin they are, it's suddenly genius."

"To call Stewart Lee a comedian is fucking stretching it.

Watching his act, I found myself checking my phone to see if anyone had texted me, even though I knew they hadn't. Lee's audience is full of the right on sector of society, his act is feeding and reinforcing their prejudices, much the same as some of the ultra right-wing American comedians who have been around in the last few years. It's a cheap shot, which guarantees him laughs from an audience bound to agree with him, and it's much easier than having to write decent gags."

"I find Lee's deconstructionism obvious, boring, and teenage and I think his material's crap. The whole TV show struck me as hugely pompous, especially the insets with that smug twat Iannucci, and the attempts to justify weak material by having Iannucci point it out made me angry.  The fact that his "interesting" bit of format-twiddling was plagiarised from Steven Wright was just the icing on the cake. If Lee devoted less time to deconstructing things and more time to thinking up funny things to say he would be a better comedian. I do find it very hard to watch Lee. He really irritates me - when he does one of his trademark "slow  repetition" bits I get the red mist and start to have fantasies of going round his house with a sledgehammer and smashing all his Fall albums."

He's the comedian people say they like, just to appear more intelligent than the rest of us, a bit like those student union bores I remember from the '80s who seemed to think all indie music was automatically more radical than pop when it was often more conservative.

Apart from Paul Merton and Julian Clary I admit to disliking contemporary comedians as I see no reason for swearing and tasteless patter on stage, I much prefer comedians who make audiences laugh because they are funny men (or women)! 
 I would have enjoyed watching audience response to many of todays 'comedy  kings' should they have played some of the northern cabaret clubs of the 60's and early seventies......walking off to the sound of your own boots wouldn't have been in it!

Sorry I did not see what was so intelligent about his act. Sneering about other people being stupid is not in itself clever.  The basic problem is that there are not enough gags. He gets an idea, and instead of building on it and developing it into a proper routine, he just hammers home the same point until any possible humour has been drained out of it"

"Lee & Herring used to have an bright young fan base looking optimistically to the future, but I guess where he`s headed for now is small club & publand with a dwindling audience that just wants to relive the nostalgia of their student days from yesteryear. The Lee fans that I hung around with in the 90`s used to be bright & a laugh & you could debate with them in good humour. It seems what`s listening to him now is a crowd of kidults who what to regress into their past & wrap themselves up in the cosy quilt of yesteryear. Pseudo-phoney student bar talk, sitting around a table with 1/2 a pint wearing donkey-jackets, been there done it & bought the t-shirt. 
Lee's not satarizing anything here but trying to re-live old battles from the 1980s in a tired routine. Meanwhile Stu`s stuck in 1988 having a go at Littlejohn, Jim Davidson (when`d you last hear fro m HIM? - lol) & advocating the benefits of P.C. Let`s embrace the reality: Lee & Herring, Iannucci & Morris = Generation Underachievement. 
Time to look elsewhere for laughs & some insights. As for Lee not being concerned with breaking into the mainstream - show me an artist of any sort that doesn`t want as big an audience for their material as possible & I`ll show you a fibber. If Lee doesn`t create better material than this he doesn`t deserve to get to a bigger stage. I hadnt seen him for a while, & thought the "Comedy Vehicle" was good in parts, but I was alarmed by this routine as recent material. 
It`s old hat & sounds like mid 1980`s stuff. Next he`ll be having a go Thatcherism. If Lee can`t develop new material he`ll end up as a back number pretty quickly, playing only the nostalgia circuit. I like Lee, but this is out of date early leftie mid-1980`s student stuff that`s tired & anachronistic. He needs to move with the times or he`ll become an act caught in a generational rut only talking to itself like Freddie Starr ended up. With this haircut, he`s even starting to look a bit like him."

"Inane prattle. And what's with the drawn out silences he does? Normally a long silence usually means a drum roll and you get a reward at the end, in the way of a big laugh, or a triple somersault or the magician going abracadabra, not Stewart Lee though, he pushes the humour envelope to 11 with his long silences, and then says 'Cheese And Onion' at the end. To embarrassed laughter I might add. He can fuck off with that kind of bullshit and his Phil Collins short-armed jackets. He looks like someone has stuffed a bad suit full of sweaty sausage meat then squeezed it until a head has popped out of the top with a glutinous schlop sound."

"He's the comedian people say they like, just to appear cool and above the rest of us proles. I'm sure Mr Lee hasn't written 100% of his own material.

"Thank you for encouraging me to waste half an hour of my life...it was utterly, utterly crap... Lowlights included the long, long riff on Travelodges, the final punchline being that jokes about Travelodges can never be funny â€“ I suppose that a comedian deliberately telling an hackneyed, unfunny joke in order to challenge his self-satisfied audience might be quite amusing in some hands - unfortunately it just made Lee look like a smug twat... 
The final apple sketch was, I suspect, another attempt at 'subversive' comedy by deliberately extending a 'joke' that was barely amusing in the first place into an interminable, embarrassingly unfunny sketch-show parody in order to mock the BBC bigwigs who commissioned the show in the first place... Well done Stewart, very clever. Not very funny though..."

"What an unfunny cunt. He just isnt funny - hes incredibly dull. The problem with stuart lee is that he's A. He's not as clever, original or interesting as he thinks he is. B. He just isnt very funny, C. He wasnt funny to start with anyway. Just shit. What a pretentious wanker. Sixth form art schooll 'humour' which thinks its more clever than it is. Shit. He keeps doing the same tired sixth form iroinic 'liberal' shite. He doesnt even come close to Mcintyre in wit, entertainment or popularity. Pleeeeease!!!
What he does is basicly sixth form college humour that thinks its alternative, clever and a bit on the edgy/social commentary side. But its just predicatble. And just not funny. I think he thinks hes cleverer and more insightful than he actually is, very simillar to richard herring. And no i dont find al murray, roy chubby brown or jim davidson funny either. Incredibly dull sixth form humour. Not funny really is he?"

"I've given him two chances and fail to see why he's classed as comedy. I think I'm meant to have laughed but didn't. If he's trying to shock or offend he's failing at that too. It's just painfully unfunny. I just feel slightly sorry for him."

"I do not think he is as funny as he used to be in the good old days or as funny as that Chris Moyles from off Radio 1. Also, I do not trust anyone who still has the same haircut they had in 1984. Like Mark Kermode or Morrissey, by way of two more quiffular examples."

"A fun game to play is "spot Stewart Lee using 'fancy' language incorrectly in a slightly cringeworthy (and failed) attempt to sound extra clever". He does it a fair bit, often when he improvises. It wouldn't bother me, but when his routines, and fans, make proclamations about how articulate, sharp and well-read he is, it makes me wince a little." 
 - Greyztone, Youtube
"I don't hate stewart lee but i do hate his fans. he has come to represent this kind of smug superiority of the lower middle class with these strawman arguments turned into fairly poor jokes. he does seem like a very nice and quite smart guy, but there is a reason that only people who are a bit like him like him, he's incredibly pedestrian and mediocore."

"I have just returned from viewing the sensation that is Stewart Lee! Now I am being ironic and sarcastic. There is nothing sensational about Stewart Lee. The reviews I have read have put him somewhere between a comedy genius and a funny grumpy old man. To be honest he isn't and I would advise anyone who isn't a fan to not bother seeing his show on a whim. 
His innane ramblings are neither informed, funny, ironic, or angry. Everything is forced in his delivery, his jokes come at a rate of 1 every 8 mins 40 seconds, and even they are only of sniggering quality.   He specialises in a type of story that apparently reflect his intelligence and wit, instead I ended up feeling sorry for his wife and son who have to spend Sunday afternoon with someone who thinks they are funny. 
I originally thought I was being obtuse in the first 10 minutes of the show, as a couple of people around me quite literally burst with side splitting laughter to jokes that were so innane I was wondering if I was too stupid to understand. Then I started to think maybe the manager of the joint had got a Stewart Lee mask and given it to the stage hand and told him to get out there and do his best, due to the inappropriate, forced and unfunny delivery. Very disappointed."

"Lee leaves me completely cold. It's like watching Ernie Wise soldiering on decades after the funny one has died, or the bass player of a '60s pop band playing a workingmens' club in Barnsley. Life-affirming it ain't. There's more joy in a Viz knob gag or five seconds of Frankie Boyle - "Yes sir, there is a vegetarian option. You can fuck off" - than a miserable 45 minutes spent in the company of Stewart Lee. If you have to analyse comedy, it ain't comedy. It's not big; it's not clever; and it sure as shit isn't comedy."

"He came 11th in the Greatest Stand Ups of All Time poll shown on Ch4 the other month (yes I know it's a fiddle - but still). If you went out in the street and asked a hundred people about him you'd be hard pressed to find a handful who'd even heard of the miserable c*nt. Never mind think he was funny. 
The only few people who even claim to rate him are the usual crowd who think he may in some way be "clever" and so by claiming to like the unfunny tw*t somehow raises their own "status". Hs face says it all really - he's got a twat face."

"Stewart Lee is not funny. Fact. Whether I personally find him funny is neither here nor there. I could also say 'Les Dennis is unfunny' - It might be my opinion, but it's also more importantly a scientifically proven fact. A good indicator of whether something is funny is whther it makes people laugh, and considering the paying audience at his shows rarely laugh, I think that's a fair indicator that he is not funny. I saw his stand up live and you could hear a pin drop. 
He may be clever, cutting, subtle, absurd, different etc etc....but he's just not (that) funny. Reminds me of a 'comedian' called Mark Thomas, who also forgot to be funny and was more concerned with being intelligent, clever and 'different'. Stewart Lee fans don't have a sense of humour. Case, rested. Stewart Lee gives smug, tedious people hope that other people find them anything but smug and tedious."

 - Svelter, Youtube
"I've always thought of Stewart Lee's comedy as doing the opposite of what really good comedy should do. He essentially uses comedy to browbeat people in to agreeing with his rather dogmatic left wing political points of view. It's as though he's essentially taking what is the sort of prevailing politically correct dogma of his generation and aggressively ridiculing anyone who doesn't sign up to it, using comedy as an instrument to enforce conformity, not as a means of subversion. 
He's a red faced man jabbing his finger in my face because I don't agree with him. 
He may as well be playing to an empty room, for all the concessions he makes to the audience. His refusal to concede to the audience is part of an ongoing desire to be taken seriously, but someone who wants to be taken so seriously is quite hard to take seriously."  
 - Toby Young, A Good Read, BBC Radio 4, March 2011
"He seems to have spent an awful lot of time looking for negative comments about himself. As he's going through one of his most successful periods in a long time, I assume this is a desperate attempt to convince himself that he is still an 'outsider'."

"I am a middle-aged man and I take my sense of humour very seriously. Laughter is often the only real let up from embracing my deep disappointment in myself,  my loved ones and my general situation. As a result, I feel strongly engaged in the issue of who has the right to be paid to make me laugh. 
Even if they're being paid to make other people laugh. Even if other people have paid them to make them laugh. I feel that as someone who is capable of laughter I am much like a tax payer, a stakeholder in the laughter industry and have a burning sense of entitlement to express my opinions on any comedy anywhere. I will keep on doing so with more and more rage until I die, and no one will have paid attention except other men with slightly differing but no less forcefully expressed resentments. 
And when I die, then someone somewhere will be sorry. Or something."

Why I walked out of a Stewart Lee gig

Stewart Lee’s contempt for his audience is becoming a grimly unedifying 
  spectacle, says Dominic Cavendish












Stand-up comedian Stewart Lee - a 'grim spectacle' Photo: REX

 It feels quite empowering to leave a Stewart Lee gig at the first available opportunity. Lee’s latest live outing, running at Leicester Square Theatre and essentially trialling material ahead of recordings for the new series of his BBC show (Stewart Lee’s Comedy Vehicle) is called Much A-Stew About Nothing.  On Friday night, he was getting much Stewed up about his lacklustre audience, swiftly discerning that “a lot of you are not my crowd”. Despite explaining early on that he had no interest in warming us up, and just wanted to push through the 30-minute sets, the first half-hour or so was beset by his own interruptions, as he took issue with our wrong-headed laughs, our lack of responsiveness, our failure to “make connections” and our want of imagination in coming up with suggestions when asked to do so.  WATCH: The top comedy podcasts   Having started off with a theatre full of reasonably cheerful, appreciative punters – most of whom looked intelligent enough to me (what was he expecting, the sort of people who attend a TED conference?), Lee stoked an atmosphere of tension and unease. There were early laughs at the expense of that Russell Brand and Jeremy Paxman Newsnight interview (hardly Frost/Nixon... “more like a monkey throwing his own excrement against a foghorn”) but the contempt he expressed for Brand seemed as nothing to the disdain he showed towards those who’d paid to see him. “I am not interested in what you think,” he advised, suddenly. “Nothing you do tonight will make any difference.” He continued in a patronising vein: “A lot of the things you hear tonight will relate to things that exist in the real world.” What were we? He spelt it out with the c-word: “Stupid Friday night ****s”.  For some reason – too tired, too polite, too squiffy, too adoring? – the capacity crowd didn’t mutiny at this sardonic onslaught, just took it on the chin, in some cases lapped up the abuse with an agreeable chortle. Was the invective all part of Lee’s uncommon cleverness – a wind-up strategy that allows him to deconstruct his material as he goes along, thereby embellishing it further? Plainly his refusal to suffer perceived fools gladly is of a piece with his high-risk determination not to be crudely “pleasing” but even so the joke wears thin. During the Edinburgh Fringe, I turned up to see him perform at the Stand in character as “Baconface” but he abandoned the gig within about five minutes – our fault, apparently, not his. It’s as though the audience are there for his delectation, not the other way round. In comedy, sometimes a room will turn on a comedian; Lee reverses that dynamic.

19 Nov 2013



 Come the interval, I decided to take him at his word. Why stay on and risk letting him down further? Besides which, Lee had made it abundantly clear by this point that he didn’t even want a Telegraph review. He wouldn’t want any Telegraph readers in, he scoffed in disgust, as he vented on the subject of Michael Deacon (“an idiot”, apparently) whom he accuses of having plagiarised his parody of Dan Brown (as if The Da Vinci Code wasn’t an open invitation to parodists everywhere). Like a one-man National Security Agency, he monitors Deacon’s late-night Tweets to pick up references to himself.  Doubtless this piece by me will show up on his Google alerts, or however he keeps up with the ever-fascinating subject of how he’s perceived by others. Maybe I’ll get the honour of being mercilessly dissected online or on-stage. You know what? I don’t give a stuff. If Lee had a shred of interest or insight into the working lives of other people, he’d realise that those who give up an evening at the end of a week to see him deserve his thanks not his toxic scorn.
