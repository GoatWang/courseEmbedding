NRG to buy Texas Genco for $5.8 billion


TOM FOWLER, Copyright 2005 Houston Chronicle


        Published 5:30 am, Monday, October 3, 2005
    



































































The power plants that light up many of Houston's homes and businesses will have a new owner thanks to a $5.8 billion deal announced Sunday.
NRG Energy, based in Princeton, N.J., will buy Texas Genco, the operator of eight plants in and around Houston and the owner of a 44 percent stake in the South Texas Project nuclear power plant.
The deal will nearly double the size of NRG's U.S. electricity generating capacity, giving it nearly 24,000 megawatts of power plants from coast to coast.
It's too early to say how the plan will affect Texas Genco's 1,150 workers, although NRG President and CEO David Crane said the company's employees and management were considered key strengths in the deal.
NRG currently has 13,000 megawatts of power generation plants in states including California, Louisiana and Connecticut. Houston-based Texas Genco has about 11,000 megawatts of power generation, all in Texas. It is the second-largest power generator in Texas behind TXU Corp.
The fast-growing Texas power market is considered one of the country's most lucrative.
The price of natural gas sets the price for power in Texas since so many plants here use it to fire their turbines. With natural gas prices hitting new highs, plants that run on less expensive fuels — as is the case with about half of Texas Genco's capacity — can earn huge profits.
"There's nothing about being in Texas we don't like," Crane said.
Texas Genco has buyers for about 82 percent of the power it will generate over the next three to four years, making it an even more valuable and stable asset, Crane said.
Good news for investors
The power plants were at one time part of the company that was once known as Houston Lighting and Power.
That company split up as Texas deregulated its power markets and eventually became three different companies: CenterPoint Energy, which owns the local power lines and poles, as well as the local natural gas service; Reliant Energy, which sells electricity to individuals and businesses and owns power plants outside Texas; and Texas Genco.
In early 2004 Reliant had an option to buy Texas Genco but didn't exercise it. In April 2004, four private investment firms — The Blackstone Group, Hellman & Friedman LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. LP and Texas Pacific Group — announced plans to acquire Texas Genco for $3.65 billion, taking it private by buying up all its publicly traded stock.
Earlier this year, the company announced plans to issue up to $600 million in stock to the public, but that plan has been canceled.
The NRG deal will give the four firms a huge return on their investments in just more than a year. The investors initially used about $900 million of their own cash to buy the company, but will get $4 billion in cash and $1.8 billion in stock in the sale to NRG.
NRG also will take on more than $2.5 billion of Texas Genco debt.
The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2006.
More mergers expected
The power business is likely to see more mergers as the many firms with about 10,000 to 20,000 megawatts of generation capacity seek buyers or similarly sized partners.
Bruce Williamson, CEO of Houston's Dynegy, has said power companies need to combine so they have at least 40,000 megawatts of total capacity in order to compete effectively and grow in the U.S.
Dynegy has 13,000 megawatts of generating capacity and has been the subject of market speculation for many months.
NRG built or acquired more than 50 power plants in the U.S., Europe, Asia and South America. In 2003 it filed for bankruptcy protection, getting rid of about $6 billion in debt. It emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 2003.
