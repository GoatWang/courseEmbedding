					Full Description



Fuelcell Energy, Inc., incorporated on July 12, 1999, delivers fuel cell power solutions. The Company is engaged in designing, manufacturing, installing, operating and maintaining fuel cell power solutions. The Company also provides turnkey power generation solutions to the customers, including power plant installation, operations and maintenance. The Company's segment is fuel cell power plant production and research. The Company offers its services to various sectors, including utility companies, municipalities, universities, government entities and a range of industrial and commercial enterprises. The Company, by utilizing its Direct FuelCell (DFC) plants, is commercializing a tri-generation distributed hydrogen configuration that generates electricity, heat and hydrogen for industrial and/or transportation uses, as well as a fuel cell carbon capture solution for coal or gas-fired power plants. The Company is also developing and commercializing solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) plants for sub-megawatt applications to the markets for its megawatt-class DFC power plants, as well as energy storage applications utilizing hydrogen as an energy carrier. Fuel cells use an electrochemical process to convert a fuel source into electricity and heat in a process that emits virtually no pollutants as the fuel is not burned, generating power that is wholly absent of criteria pollutants, such as nitrogen oxide (NOx) that causes smog, sulfur dioxide (SOx). Its power plants provide electricity priced competitively to grid-delivered electricity in certain high cost regions.The Company's fuel cell products offer power generation for customers, including the 2.8 Megawatt (MW) DFC3000, the 1.4 MW DFC1500 and 3.7 MW DFC4000, plus derivations of this DFC product. It can provide a turnkey fuel cell project that includes project development, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services, operations and maintenance (O&M), and project finance. Its DFC carbonate fuel cell technology generates electricity directly from a fuel, such as natural gas or renewable biogas, by reforming the fuel inside the fuel cell to produce hydrogen. The DFC fuel cell produces byproduct heat that can be utilized for Combined Heat and Power (CHP) applications using hot water, steam or chiller water for facility heating and cooling.The DFC product line is a global platform based on carbonate fuel cell technology. The Company's power plants utilize a range of available fuels to produce electricity electrochemically. Thus, the plants generate more power and fewer emissions for a given unit of fuel than combustion-based power generation of a similar size, making them economical and environmentally responsible power generation solutions. In addition to electricity, the standard configuration produces heat, suitable for making steam or hot water for facility use, as well as absorption cooling.The Company competes with Ballard Power Systems, Plug Power, Intelligent Energy Holdings, Toyota, Hyundai, Honda, GM, Doosan, LG, Rolls Royce, General Electric, Bloom Energy, Ceres Power Holdings, Parker Hannifin, Toyota/Kyocera, Ceramic Fuel Cells Ltd., Caterpillar, Cummins, Wartsilla, MTU Friedrichshafen GmbH, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Detroit Diesel, Kawasaki, Proton Onsite, H2 Logic, Hydrogenics Corporation, ITM Power PLC and McPhy Energy.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

                        Company History
                    


FuelCell Energy’s international reputation for leadership in ultra-clean energy solutions has been built on a long history of innovative research and development that reflects the successes of our highly talented and creative workforce. We are the first fuel cell manufacturer to commercialize megawatt-class stationary fuel cell power plants and we believe that we are the first stationary fuel cell manufacturer to generate a quarterly gross profit.
Long history of innovation and achievement
FuelCell Energy traces its roots back to 1969 and the founding of Energy Research Corporation (ERC) by early fuel cell pioneers Bernard Baker and Martin Klein, both chemical engineers with expertise in advanced battery technologies.
In the 1970′s, with funding from the U.S. military and utility companies, the Company conducted extensive research into low-temperature fuel cells as well as silver-zinc battery cells. In the 1980′s and 1990′s the Company switched its focus to high-temperature carbonate fuel cell systems which offered greater commercial applications due to the ability to internally reform readily available fuels such as natural gas and renewable biogas within the fuel cell itself to provide the hydrogen for the power generation process.
Our first commercial power plant was installed in 2003 using a 250 kilowatt (kW) fuel cell stack. Through technology enhancements and cost reductions, we have increased the power output of the stacks by 40 percent to 350 kW and reduced product costs by more than 60 percent. Today we are installing multi-megawatt fuel cell plants and fuel cell parks globally.
The production facility in Torrington, Connecticut, USA was completed in 2001 and produced [2] megawatts (MW) of product the first year. As of the end of fiscal year 2012, the plant was producing at an annual run-rate of 56 MW. The total annual capacity of the facility is 90 MW.
FuelCell Energy began expanding globally in 2007 through its partnership with POSCO Energy , targeting markets in Southeast Asia, particularly South Korea. A European manufacturing, sales and service presence was established in 2012, with German-based FuelCell Energy Solutions, GmbH.





                        More than four decades of energy leadership
                    










                        Manufacturing
                    





State-of-the-art manufacturing facilities and processes
FuelCell Energy, Inc. employs state-of-the-art manufacturing processes and equipment to manufacture the fuel cell components that are the heart of a fuel cell power plant. The individual fuel cell components are manufactured in Torrington, Connecticut, USA using proprietary designs and processes. The production line is configured for continuous flow and continual improvement is a core aspect of the production process. The company’s quality management system is ISO 9001:2008 certified.
A fuel cell component manufacturing facility is under construction in Pohang, South Korea that is owned by partner, POSCO Energy. Manufacturing is expected to begin in early 2015 under a license agreement.  Additional production capacity for the assembly of sub-megawatt DFC plants is available at a facility located in Ottobrunn, Germany that is operated by FuelCell Energy Solutions, GmbH, a joint venture operated by FuelCell Energy, Inc. and Fraunhofer IKTS.

Modular Design ConceptIndividual fuel cell components are stacked on top of each other to build a fuel cell stack.Approximately 400 fuel cell components are used to construct each fuel cell stack.Fuel cell stacking is performed in Torrington, Connecticut, at a POSCO Energy-owned facility in Pohang, South Korea and at the FuelCell Energy Solutions facility located in Ottobrunn, Germany.For megawatt-class power plants, four fuel cell stacks of 350 kilowatts each are combined to build a 1.4 megawatt fuel cell module.
The 1.4 MW DFC1500 power plant uses one fuel cell module.
Two fuel cell modules are used for the 2.8 MW DFC3000 power plant.
The fuel cell module is combined with the electrical and mechanical balance of plant to complete the power plant. The mechanical balance of plant processes the incoming fuel for the fuel cells (i.e., clean natural gas or renewable biogas). The electrical balance of plant converts the direct current (DC) generated by the fuel cells into alternating current (AC) for use by the customer.The DFC power plants are scalable so that multiple plants can be combined to create multi-megawatt fuel cell parks. A number of multi-megawatt fuel cell parks are operating around the world including a 14.9 megawatt fuel cell park in Connecticut, USA, 10 MW and 11 MW fuel cell parks in South Korea and the world’s largest fuel cell park, a 59 megawatt facility composed of 21 DFC3000 power plants in Hwasung City, South Korea.

Company IntroServicesKey ContactsAbout CompanyFuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: FCEL) is an integrated fuel cell company that designs, manufactures, installs, operates and services stationary fuel cell power plants.As a leading global fuel cell company, we provide ultra-clean, efficient and reliable baseload distributed generation for electric utilities, commercial and industrial companies, universities, municipalities, government entities and other customers around the world.Versatile & environmentally responsible energyDirect FuelCell® (DFC®) power plants manufactured by FuelCell Energy can utilize a variety of fuels including renewable biogas from wastewater treatment and food processing, as well as clean natural gas, directed biogas and propane.Our DFC power plants produce power electrochemically — without burning fuels — making them clean, quiet and environmentally responsible alternatives to combustion-based generation.Our power plants have generated more than 3 billion kilowatt hours of ultra-clean electricity, equivalent to powering more than 245,000 average-size U.S. homes for one year.Your global ultra-clean distributed generation solutions partnerFuelCell Energy’s world headquarters are located in Danbury, Connecticut, in the USA. Our global markets are served from a state-of-the-art production facility in nearby Torrington, Connecticut.FuelCell_logo_120725Our customers in Europe are served by German-based FuelCell Energy Solutions, GmbH, a majority owned joint venture with sales and service located in Dresden, Germany and manufacturing in Ottobrunn, Germany, which is near Munich.Customers in Asia are served by our partner POSCO Energy from manufacturing facilities located in Pohang, South Korea.Comprehensive Operations, Maintenance, and Installation ServicesFuelCell Energy offers a comprehensive portfolio of services for fuel cell power plants. Specially trained technicians and engineers remotely operate and maintain virtually our entire installed base of Direct FuelCell power plants globally, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year from the state-of-the-art Global Technical Assistance Center located at our Danbury, Connecticut headquarters. Field service technicians directly employed by FuelCell Energy service the power plants on-site.Advanced TechnologiesFuelCell Energy scientists are actively researching unique applications for our versatile DFC technology including hydrogen generation and carbon capture. In addition, we are pursuing research with solid oxide fuel cells as well as hydrogen compression and storage.HistoryFuelCell Energy’s international reputation for leadership in ultra-clean energy solutions has been built on a long history of innovative research and development that reflects the successes of our highly talented and creative workforce. We are the first fuel cell manufacturer to commercialize megawatt-class stationary fuel cell power plants and we believe that we are the first stationary fuel cell manufacturer to generate a quarterly gross profit.Long history of innovation and achievementFuelCell Energy traces its roots back to 1969 and the founding of Energy Research Corporation (ERC) by early fuel cell pioneers Bernard Baker and Martin Klein, both chemical engineers with expertise in advanced battery technologies.In the 1970′s, with funding from the U.S. military and utility companies, the Company conducted extensive research into low-temperature fuel cells as well as silver-zinc battery cells. In the 1980′s and 1990′s the Company switched its focus to high-temperature carbonate fuel cell systems which offered greater commercial applications due to the ability to internally reform readily available fuels such as natural gas and renewable biogas within the fuel cell itself to provide the hydrogen for the power generation process.Our first commercial power plant was installed in 2003 using a 250 kilowatt (kW) fuel cell stack. Through technology enhancements and cost reductions, we have increased the power output of the stacks by 40 percent to 350 kW and reduced product costs by more than 60 percent. Today we are installing multi-megawatt fuel cell plants and fuel cell parks globally.The production facility in Torrington, Connecticut, USA was completed in 2001 and produced [2] megawatts (MW) of product the first year. As of the end of fiscal year 2012, the plant was producing at an annual run-rate of 56 MW. The total annual capacity of the facility is 90 MW.FuelCell Energy began expanding globally in 2007 through its partnership with POSCO Energy , targeting markets in Southeast Asia, particularly South Korea. A European manufacturing, sales and service presence was established in 2012, with German-based FuelCell Energy Solutions, GmbH.ManufacturingState-of-the-art manufacturing facilities and processesFuelCell Energy, Inc. employs state-of-the-art manufacturing processes and equipment to manufacture the fuel cell components that are the heart of a fuel cell power plant. The individual fuel cell components are manufactured in Torrington, Connecticut, USA using proprietary designs and processes. The production line is configured for continuous flow and continual improvement is a core aspect of the production process. The company’s quality management system is ISO 9001:2008 certified.A fuel cell component manufacturing facility is under construction in Pohang, South Korea that is owned by partner, POSCO Energy. Manufacturing is expected to begin in 2015 under a license agreement.  Additional production capacity for the assembly of sub-megawatt DFC plants is available at a facility located in Ottobrunn, Germany that is operated by FuelCell Energy Solutions, GmbH, a joint venture operated by FuelCell Energy, Inc. and Fraunhofer IKTS.SustainabilityHelping customers achieve their sustainability objectivesFuelCell Energy’s ultra-clean, efficient and reliable fuel cell power plants help our customers achieve their sustainability goals. These environmentally friendly products support the “Triple Bottom Line” concept of sustainability, consisting of Environmental, Social and Economic considerations.Our power plants’ many unique attributes, including high efficiency, virtually pollutant-free operation and Combined Heat & Power (CHP) capability, make it possible for our customers to dramatically improve their energy efficiency profiles while simultaneously reducing emissions and costs.Put simply, higher efficiency drives both better economics and environmental stewardship. Our ultra-clean, highly efficient and reliable distributed power generation solutions support social responsibility goals and public policy objectives.Putting sustainability concepts into practiceFuelCell Energy takes sustainability just as seriously as our customers. We continue to incorporate sustainability best practices into our corporate culture and into the design, manufacture, installation and servicing of our stationary fuel cell power plants.We strive for “cradle-to-cradle” sustainable business practices. For example, at the end-of-life for our power plants, we refurbish and re-use certain parts of the power plant and we are able to recycle most of what we cannot use. Some of the parts in the fuel cell module can be re-furbished, such as end plates, while the individual fuel cell components are sent to a smelter for recycling. The balance of plant has an operating life of twenty to twenty-five years, at which time metals such as steel and copper can be reclaimed for scrap value.We have made measurable progress with incorporating sustainable business practices throughout all aspects of our organization but we recognize that there is still more potential and more work to be done.We have a designated Sustainability Officer who promotes sustainable business practices in our manufacturing and administrative functions. For example:On the production floor, we reuse scrap from the manufacturing process, minimizing production waste.We use industrial air compressors in our manufacturing process and route excess heat from the compressor room to the main facility, reducing both our heating costs and emissions. We are working to do the same with the heat generated by our industrial ovens.Our research and development labs are continually testing a variety of fuel cell applications, generating ultra-clean electricity in the process. This clean electricity is used to power our operations.Our corporate offices and manufacturing facility have been upgraded with high efficiency lighting.In administrative functions, we strive continually to improve energy efficiency. Recycling and minimizing printing are simple acts that preserve natural resources, benefiting future generations.The team at FuelCell Energy takes pride in helping our customers solve power generation challenges in an environmentally supportive manner and we take seriously our responsibilities individually and collectively to support the Triple Bottom Line of sustainable business practices.ServicesWhen you purchase a Direct FuelCell® (DFC®) power plant from FuelCell Energy, we embark on a long-term relationship together. Our goal is to provide complete support to each of our valued customers for the life cycle of the product.

The complete line of carbonate SureSource™ products from FuelCell Energy delivers ultra-clean distributed power – efficiently and economically. These fuel cell solutions provide distinct advantages over other forms of distributed power generation, including

High efficiency with fuel conversion efficiency unsurpassed in the industry
Fuel flexibility with the ability to operate on readily available natural gas or renewable biogas
Virtually no pollution as SureSource plants emit only trace levels of nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur oxide (SOx) or particulate matter

The clean air profile of the SureSource product facilitates clean air permitting, reducing permitting costs and approval time. In fact, the SureSource 3000 and SureSource 1500 are designated as “Ultra-Clean” under 2007 California Air Resources Board (CARB) standards, reinforcing the environmental benefits of fuel cells.
These versatile power generation solutions are available in different sizes and configurations to address a customer’s specific needs. Configurations include:

Natural gas letdown station energy recovery
Fuel cell carbon capture
Distributed hydrogen
















SureSource 1500™ – 1.4 Megawatts of Clean & Affordable Power
This solution is ideal for on-site power generation for large installations requiring continuous power and value high-quality heat for facility heating and/or absorption chilling. The system is suitable for a wide range of applications, including wastewater treatment plants, manufacturing facilities, hospitals and universities.




Benefits
Featuring ultra-low emissions, quiet operation and minimal space requirements (about the size of a tennis court), the SureSource 1500 is suitable for locations where combustion-based traditional power generation technologies are not feasible or desirable such as next to buildings or in space-constrained urban locations








SureSource 1500



















SureSource 3000™ – 2.8 Megawatts of Continuous Power
Comprised of two 1.4 megawatt (MW) modules, the SureSource 3000 generates 2.8 MW of ultra-clean power. Similar to the SureSource 1500, the system is well-suited for on-site applications and caters to customers with an even greater power load requirement. Ideal applications include large universities, manufacturing facilities, wastewater treatment plants, or for multi-plant fuel cell parks to support the electric grid.




Benefits
The SureSource plants are scalable so that multiple systems can be combined to provide tens of megawatts of ultra-clean energy to meet a customer’s power demand or to supply directly to the electric grid. The clean emissions profile, quiet operation and modest space requirements make these fuel cell parks easy to site in urban areas. This high power density is exemplified in a five-unit 15 MW fuel cell park located in an urban Bridgeport, Connecticut neighborhood that occupies only 1.5 acres of land; and a 21-unit 59 MW fuel cell park located in South Korea that utilizes just over 5 acres.








SureSource 3000



















SureSource 4000™ – 3.7 Megawatts of Highly Efficient Power
The SureSource 4000 is the largest in the SureSource power plant fleet and generates 3.7 megawatts (MW) of ultra-clean power with an industry-leading electrical efficiency of approximately 60%. This enhanced-efficiency fuel cell system is designed for utilities, large industrial users, data centers, and other customers focused on clean and affordable power driven by the benefits and economics of high system electrical efficiency.




Unique Configuration
The standard 2.8 megawatt SureSource 3000 power plant is comprised of two 1.4 megawatt fuel cell modules that operate in parallel.  This 3.7 megawatt configuration adds a third module that utilizes unused fuel from the other two modules that would normally generate heat and converts this fuel to electricity to produce additional power.  The SureSource 4000 plant needs only about 10,000 square feet, or only about ¼ of an acre, providing the benefit of siting this power generation solution where the power is used.




Benefits
The value proposition for customers and ratepayers is a power plant that can compete with large-scale combined cycle gas plants in terms of both efficiency and economics, yet virtually eliminates criteria pollutants, lends easily to siting in populated and land-constrained areas, and installs relatively quickly. The versatility and scalability in siting of the SureSource 4000 promotes point-of-use installations such as next to existing electrical substations, thereby avoiding transmission and the associated line losses from transmitting the power from distant locations.
