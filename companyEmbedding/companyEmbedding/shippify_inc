ANY OTHER PRODUCT
It doesn't matter the size of your company. If you need to deliver your products we can help you with the logistic process.







HOW IT WORKS
It’s quite simple




OUR API AND DASHBOARD
Our API is easy to integrate and compatible with all the e-commerce services available on the market. The easiest and more efficient way to implement Shippify to your site.
          All the orders made in your e-commerce store go straight to our system and therefore to the closest Shipper that fits your needs. The dashboard is friendly and allows clients, that don't have an e-commerce, to use Shippify's services.
        



COMMUNITY OF SHIPPERS
All Shippers are verified to be part of our trusted community and they are rigorously evaluated. That way we keep an amazing delivery experience.

A Shipper is sent to do a delivery according to his location and vehicle. The closest and more suitable is assigned to the task.








TRACK YOUR DELIVERIES IN REAL TIME
You can track in real time the Shippers that are doing your deliveries. Check what they are about to deliver or already delivered in your desktop, tablet or smartphone.

Frequently Asked Questions





            General questions
          



Is there a setup fee?
No. There are no setup fees on any of our plans.

 
Do I need to enter my credit card details to sign up?
No. You can sign up and use Shopify for 14 days without entering your credit card details. At the end of your trial, or when you decide to launch your store, you will need to pick a plan and enter your credit card details.

 
Can I cancel my account at any time?
Yes. If you ever decide that Shopify isn’t the best ecommerce platform for your business, simply cancel your account.

 
How long are your contracts?
All Shopify plans are month to month unless you sign up for an annual or biennial plan.

 
Do you offer any discounted plans?
Yes, we offer a 10% discount on annual plans and a 20% discount on biennial plans, when they are paid upfront.

 
Can I change my plan later on?
Absolutely! You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time.

 
Is Shopify PCI Compliant or PCI Certified?
Yes. Shopify is certified Level 1 PCI DSS compliant. This means all your data and customer information is ultra secure.

 
Do I have to sell the same products in-store as I do online?
No, you can choose exactly what products to sell online, in-store, or both.

 
What is the rate if I type in a credit card?
If you chose to type in a credit card number instead of using the Shopify credit card reader, you will be charged the same rate as your online rate.



Are there any transaction fees?
Use Shopify Payments and pay no transaction fee. If you choose an
external payment gateway, there will be additional fees of 2%, 1% or
0.5% for our Basic Shopify, Shopify, and Advanced Shopify plans,
respectively.

 






            Online questions
          



Can I use my own domain name?
Yes. You can purchase a domain name within Shopify, or use an existing one that you own. We also provide a free myshopify.com domain name to all stores on sign up.



What are your bandwidth fees?
There are none. All Shopify plans include unlimited bandwidth for free.



Do I need a web host?
Shopify includes secure, unlimited ecommerce hosting on all plans except Shopify Lite. You can also use the Buy Button to add ecommerce to any existing website.

 




              POS questions
            



What does Shopify POS do?
Shopify POS is an application for iOS and Android devices that you can
use for transactions in a physical store or pop-up setting. Find
products, process orders, take payment, swipe credit cards, produce
receipts, and control it all from your iPad or mobile device. All the
background management of your store is done from your Shopify admin,
which you can access using any browser.



Can I merge my Shopify online store with Shopify POS?
Yes. Your Shopify online store automatically synchronizes with Shopify
POS, and you manage your entire business from one dashboard. Product or
inventory updates that you make in your Shopify admin will instantly
take effect in Shopify POS.



Can I use Shopify POS if I have multiple cash registers in use at the same time?
Yes. You can install Shopify POS on multiple devices, and you won’t be
charged any extra. Store activity on all devices is synchronized with
your Shopify admin.



Can I use Shopify POS if I’m outside the United States/Canada?
The Shopify POS app is available worldwide. There are just two
important considerations:

You'll have to buy the supported hardware through an external
retailer.
You'll have to use an external credit card terminal to
accept credit cards.




Where can I buy a cash register, receipt printer, and other hardware?
You can buy hardware kits and individual items of supported hardware from the Shopify
Hardware Store in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the continental United States. Outside of
these countries, supported hardware is available from authorized
resellers.

About
The first Shopify store was our own
It’s been our mission to make commerce better for everyone ever since








Nearly a decade ago we started an online
store to sell snowboard equipment directly to those who loved the
sport as much as us.
We could have listed our products on a number of marketplaces, but we
wanted to own our brand and build relationships with our customers,
along with selling our goods. Such a tool didn’t exist, so we built it
for ourselves. We soon realized a number of other stores were in need
of a hassle-free platform to build their retail business, and Shopify
was born.
We focus on making commerce better for everyone, so businesses can
focus on what they do best: building and selling their products.
Today, merchants use our platform to manage every aspect of their
business — from products to orders to customers, selling online, in
retail stores, and on the go.













                400,000
              
Active Shopify stores



                $34 Billion
              
Worth of sales








We've grown a lot since we started Shopify in 2006.
From a team of 5 working out of a local coffee shop, to a team of over
2,000 working in 5 offices across North America. We’re
really proud of our success and growth and we’ve worked hard to
nurture our company values and culture. We encourage everyone to
experiment, take risks, and push the envelope.











The opportunity to shape how retail works is in our hands.
Over the coming years, the way purchasing works will change at a
fundamental level. Customers will expect options of where and how to
buy: in-store or online, delivered or for pick-up. It’s an incredibly
exciting time for this industry, and we’re going to be right at the
centre of it.








  
Career opportunities
We’re growing, and we’re looking for talented people who can make commerce better.
