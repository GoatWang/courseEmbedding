Kinvey is the most complete, proven, easy to use, and advanced platform available today.

All of this has been made possible because we have a large and thriving global developer ecosystem that builds apps on our platform.
Our success with our customers has propelled us to a year over year growth rate of more than 100%. Almost all of our customers increase the number of apps they run on our platform every year.

Least RecentShowing 2 Kinvey reviewsRakesh B.Review SourceRakesh B.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceKinvey has faboulous features for building mobile appsUpdated On March 24, 2017Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?Kinvey provides me the opportunity to build hybrid, web and IoT apps using its platform without any need to setup and maintain a cloud based backend for the apps. It takes care of the connection to the services, and maintenance of the servers on its own. I just need to focus on what the user experience should be when using the app.It provides complete access to the enterprise applications via their service catalog and have a single protocol to query any language at the backend. Synchronized data is supported for a longer period of time so that my offline operations can be carried out without any problems or obstructions. It uses data set which can optimize the performance of the app and uses less amount of internet data for the same.What do you dislike?It lacks when it comes to running complex queries in the backend which are long scripts. The performance gets downgraded at that time when the complex queries are getting executed and the processing time is long. Also it is not an ideal tool for someone who wants to build an app having customized backend with full control.Recommendations to others considering the productIt offers a free trial to be used beforehand and decide if it suits your needs or not.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?The best thing about kinvey is that it can be instantly configured within seconds and REST APIs can be implemented in the system successfully. IT also provides a faster bug analysis so that it doesn’t take much time to analyze the root cause of the bug and fix it. Multiple versions can be created for the application’s backend using just one command and control rules can be defined on your own.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as KinveyReport a ConcernG2 Crowd User in Computer SoftwareReview SourceG2 Crowd User in Computer SoftwareValidated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceBest MbaaS solution on the market!Updated On July 23, 2016Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?Kinvey can use the existing database, as well as It can use the existing web services in their current form, so only new services will be created using Node.js.

Kinvey Announces Mobile Data Connect to Make Mobilizing SAP Simple and Performant
May 17 16
Kinvey announced Mobile Data Connect for SAP to help enterprise customers and Systems Integrator (SI) partners quickly build highly performant and secure digital applications against existing SAP systems. Kinvey uniquely addresses these challenges with an out-of-the-box solution that: Abstracts the complexities of interfacing with SAP from the mobile app developer with SDKs that are available across 13 mobile app development platforms for native, hybrid, and mobile web app delivery. Provides pre-built modules for advanced client-side caching, syncing, and encryption algorithms to meet the needs of demanding offline field workforce mobile use cases. Equips SAP application owners with a fast, simple, and secure way to make SAP data available to mobile applications. Accelerates data delivery for sub-second, mobile-friendly speeds. Secure cloud caching enables sub-second screen performance of the app even when the SAP system response is in the 10s of seconds.


Kinvey Collaborates with Google to Launch HIPAA Compliant Mobile Backend as A Service on Google Cloud Platform
Apr 4 16
Kinvey launched a HIPAA compliant mBaaS on Google Cloud Platform. The service delivers a very affordable and timely solution as the demand for mobile health solutions is dramatically increasing and the U.S. Federal Government is gearing up for the next phase of HIPAA compliance audits in the second quarter of 2016. Kinvey’s HIPAA Compliant mBaaS addresses all three aspects of this perfect storm. It provides healthcare providers, payers and pharmaceutical and life sciences companies with a secure, compliant and complete platform for all of their mobile and responsive web apps. Given that it’s delivered as a fully-managed service, running on Google Cloud Platform, customers can focus on delivering their apps instead of building, managing, securing, and patching infrastructure - significantly reducing IT CAPEX and OPEX costs and dramatically reducing app time to market.
