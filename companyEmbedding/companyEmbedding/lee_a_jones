5.0 out of 5 starsBuy This Album.  It's Still Great After All These Years.ByMichael Mankinon July 17, 2015I owned this CD when it was released in 1984 and by that time I was a dedicated Rickie Lee Jones fan.  Wel;l, as time passed, I became interested in other genres and artist and moved on from Rickie Lee.  Then a few months ago, one of her lyrics got stuck in my head so I looked that up on Spotify, and much to my pleasure, Rickie Lee's music has held up to the years.  I logged onto my Amazon account and ordered copies of three CDs from my past all by Rickie Lee.  Everything I liked about her music earlier was still true all these years later.  The lyrics were smart and well written and the music had a timeless quality to me.  So, in many ways, my love affair with Rickie Lee Jones was rekindled.  No doubt a bit of nostalgia comes into play here as it was from a time when I was young and just beginning to experience life for myself.  I look back on that time with the tinted lenses of time so the edges are softer and the angst and confusion of those days don't occupy the forefront of my memories.I can remember the good times and old friends from school when I listen to this CD, but I think the recording itself has held up over the years.  I have a different interpretation of her poetry as a middle-aged adult, but it's good solid writing.Did I expect to have such an emotional reaction from hearing the sounds of my youth?  It hit me right in every way possible and was like being reunited with an old friend.  I hadn't realized how much I had missed her.So now it's 2015 and there is a new recording from Rickie Lee on the horizon.  I'm looking forward to its release and imagine I will be listening to her music for a long time to come.

Top critical reviewSee the critical review› 1.0 out of 5 starsHorrible! I cannot recommend this album.ByJimOfOakCreekon April 8, 2016Rickie's first album was incredible, a classic. Rickie's second album, PIRATES was very good. PIRATES was an enjoyable listen. THE MAGAZINE is Rickie's third album. This was the period where she cleaned up from her heroin and cocaine addiction. THE MAGAZINE is a horrid album. The compositions and arrangements are one dimensional. The entire album feels pretentious and strained. I hate this album and would never recommend it. I am stunned that there are 5 star reviews of this album on Amazon.

GrindleTOP 1000 REVIEWERon June 24, 2013Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseWhile her self titled debut and the follow up Pirates were major successes,as was her follow up tour of 1982 she began to follow a similar creative path to one of her musical forebears: Joni Mitchell. Commercially she appeared mildly self sabotaging  as she settled in France following the tour and began to write material for a third full length album. Likely tiring of the tendency of many to see music solely as a commodity to be bought and sold, she decided she wanted to explore the jazz side of her musical expression. It had always been there. And from the beginning her musical personality was always very left of center. So for this 1984 release Jones decided to follow solely her muse,not her bankbook.  On "Prelude To Gravity",Jones introduces the album with a spiralingly melodic solo piano before getting into the song itself, which is a stop-and-start rhythmic type pop/fusion jazz number incorporating this light air of contemporary synthesizers into the instrumentation. "Juke Box Fury","The Real End" and "Runaround" are actually somewhat more 80's style productions built around a sound based on the chorus of "Chuck E's In Love",actually pointing to a more commercially friendly uptempo jazz/funk sound out of the Donald Fagan school. One of my favorites here is "It Must Be Love",a very spare and melodic jazzy pop number on the upper end of the mid tempo with a very strong melody and vocal performance.  The title song,"Deep Space as well as the thematically oriented "Rorschachs",with the solo piano rendering of "Theme For The Pope" and ending with "The Unsigned Painting/ The Weird Beast" all point to Jones' new direction for much of the decade-that of a somewhat eccentric torchy balladeer of standard type songs. These songs take on her traditional ballad style and mix them with more lyrical abstraction than one might expect from her usually humanistic tales. Featuring the talents of Nathan East,Lenny Castro and Jerry Hey this album is primarily (if not just over half) uptempo/upbeat songs that are contemporary in production while also somehow able to keep this album from aging a day on that level up to this point. Having heard her entire 80's album output with this, I'd have to rate this as her finest overall release of the decade.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsAn Aural LandscapeByJ. Lawrenceon January 10, 2014Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseI bought this because I used to listen to it on cassette  incessantly in my twenties, and I wanted to hear it again as a more...uh...mature woman!  Even though I'm not a jazz fan, or even an enormous Ricki Lee fan, I just love this record. It's really so emotionally powerful. I'm not sure any other musician evokes this sort of aural "movie", for lack of a better way of putting it. It takes you up and down, and you're not even sure WHY some songs just bring you to your knees.  It creates an entire aural landscape that you inhabit...that's all I can say. I just LOVE it.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsMagazineByFloToon November 30, 2010Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseThis is not a new album for me. I have the record but wanted a CD copy of this amazing record. The Magazine was my very first introduction to Rickie Lee Jones (after Chuck E's In Love) music. I loved it instantly. When I went to college I didn't have a lot of money; but, when I got my student loan I marched down to the local record store and bought everything they had by her. Rickie Lee is not for everyone but I am still amazed at the storytelling that is heard in her songs. I can see each scene being played out as if I were watching it on a screen rather than hearing it on a record. I recommend The Magazine and anything by Rickie Lee Jones to that individual who is NOT easily impressed by sophomoric writing and/or digitally-aided vocals. Rickie Lee Jones is a true artist and singer.0Comment|

C.on February 17, 2008Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseLike some of my favorite books, I had to buy it yet AGAIN, because it's so good that people ask to borrow it and "forget" to return it. It is haunting and after 23 years since it came out in 1984, It's still pretty hard to find anything so evocative. It's raw and emotional, and in my opinion, her best work. In terms of creative genius, lyrics and melody combined, a beautiful album!!0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsFresh and ModernBynotacriticjusta fanon January 3, 2007Format: Audio CD|Verified Purchasethis album (from a time when they were still albums) is still fresh and modern and listening to it again makes you aware of how many artists have been influenced by this music, some of the musical chords amazingly poignant and others so exciting and energy-filled.  If you haven't sat still and listened to this from one end to the other in years (while re-reading the lyrics), you owe yourself a treat to do so, you won't regret a moment of it.0Comment|

I ended up buying her previous albums too. I recently heard "It must be love" and decided I had to have the cd.  (My record player is long gone).  I got it yesterday and it is still one of the greatest albums/cds ever.  Rickie Lee Jones is a poet and a musician unlike any other.  From "Gravity" to "Juke Box Fury" to "Deep Space" she is both diverse, moving and original.0Comment|

Vintage Robin Watercolour
Set One
Summer Porch Collection
Lazy lounging on cool summer porches surrounded by beauty and comfort. 
Soft and dreamy water soaked peach, orange sherbert and blush pink. This Summer Porch Collection was inspired by a robin I created in the style of vintage watercolour and ink on parchment with the effect of water damage and foxing. Foxing is a term describing the age-related speckles and browning seen on vintage paper. This Summer Porch Collection inspired a second set of patterns found here:http://crtv.mk/aY4Y

Includes
•	PNG & JPG File formats
•	3 pattern digital images, each 20.73 cm x 20.73 cm, 300 ppi, jpg format.

https://creativemarket.com/Jenniferlee/39486-Candy-Wraps-Milano-1963-Pattern

Dolce Confezione Milano 1963 Collection
This collection of textured patterns is inspired by the individually hand wrapped sweets papers of yesteryear. I adore Italy, the Italy of decades long ago and all of the beauty, pleasure and creativity it inspires. Each graphic collection reflects the vibe, location, arts and culture of the time period. These illustrations are light, modern, translucent ink & wash designs with a vintage aged feeling of papers discarded and left to fade in the hot sun.

Includes
•	4 digital images, each 20.73 cm x 20.99 cm, 300 dpi, jpg format.
•	Watermark will be removed. 
•	Note: Patterns are not seamless unless otherwise noted.
•	Wonderful for graphic and web design, editorials, wedding and event invitations, special projects, scrap booking, crafts, card making, product tags and packaging, gift wrap, print and frame for one of a kind art.

Take part in a legend with our diverse selection of Lee Jeans for women—they’ve been making fine denim for over a hundred years, so they know exactly what they’re doing. From the fabric to the construction, Lee jeans are made with longevity and style in mind. Do yourself a favor and check out the results of this hard-earned heritage, including pants, shorts, and all types of denim that come in every style and wash under the sun!

Grab a pair of classic-fit jeans that both flatter your figure while keeping you comfy all day long. If you’re wanting to give those new boots a whirl around town, be sure to pick up a pair of dark indigo bootcut jeans to complement them. For looking hip and edgy, there’s nothing quite like a pair of skinny cut jeans with just the right amount of distressing for that lived-in look—then wear them with one of your sweet new infinity scarves and a pair of aviator sunglasses to complete your outfit!

Lee collection doesn’t stop a jeans. They have an exciting selection of cargo pants, trousers, and chinos. Their trousers and essential chinos are flattering cuts that will look great on any shape. They are the both work well for numerous occasions. The chinos in particular are excellent for casual events too!

Lee has over 100 years of stylish excellence under their belt. You won’t regret getting yourself a pair of Lee pants for women!

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
