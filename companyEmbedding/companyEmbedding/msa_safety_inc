Retractables


        A Retractable Lifeline works a lot like a seat belt.  Pull it out slowly, and it will follow you.  If you run, you'll end up on your ass.  These self retracting lifelines come in various sizes, lengths, material.  Use a web retractable for concrete, and steel retractable for welding.

Fall Protection Retractable Lifelines & Fall Limiters

Retractable Lifelines

What Are Retractable Lifelines?
A Retractable Lifeline is a viable alternative to shock-absorbing lanyards. These devices are specifically designed for professionals who work high to stop free-fall within inches, allowing greater mobility.
How a Retractable Lifeline Works to Protect You from Falls
They don’t call it a lifeline for nothing.  Retractable Lifelines save thousands of lives each year. A Retractable Lifeline is ideally vertically mounted to a suitable overhead anchorage point. The Lifeline is coiled in a protective housing and, under constant tension, retracts or extends as you move up or down.
A Retractable Lifeline works like a seatbelt in that the sudden jolt from a fall will instantly activate the fall-arresting mechanism which causes the lifeline to lock and stop your fall after a short distance, between 16” and 18”. In other words, pull it out slowly and steadily, it will follow you. If you run, you'll end up with a serious case of whiplash.
What We've Got
We carry a wide selection of Retractable Lifelines in various sizes, lengths and materials to cater to your specific needs. Whether for commercial or residential purposes, we’ve got it. Need a web retractable that won’t damage your roof? Check out the Miller MightyLite Web Retractable. Available in various lengths up to 50ft, the Miller MightyLite Web Retractable is lighter than cable versions, making it particularly ideal for hard- to-mount locations.
Need steel retractable that won’t corrode? We’ve got you covered. The Guardian Edge Stainless Steel Retractable may be just what you’re looking for. The compact and lightweight design makes it easy to carry while stainless steel and non-corrosive components make it extremely durable and long-lasting giving you more value for your money.
Not what you need? Browse our impressive inventory of retractable lifelines and fall limiters. We have a wide selection from an extensive list of manufacturers to accommodate your every need. If someone makes it, we can get it!
Exceptional Customer Service
Availability is one of the biggest complaints customers have about sales teams, but ours is always available to help guide you through the process and get you what you need. From our huge selection of retractable lifelines and other fall protection products, to a simple ordering process to fast and flexible shipping times, we’ve got you covered.

Safety Harnesses

What are Fall Protection Safety Harnesses?
A fall protection safety harness is a piece of equipment designed to keep you safe and secure when working high, so you don’t end up flying off the top of a building or other tall structure you’re working on. If you happen to slip and fall, a harness will distribute the force and provide support while you are suspended in the air, making you feel more like a superhero than workplace fall victim.
How Safety Harnesses Work
A worker wears a harness that is attached to a lanyard or retractable and secured to an anchor for support. Harnesses are specifically designed that in the event of a fall, a worker will remain suspended upright while they await rescue and fall forces will be distributed throughout the body, significantly reducing the chances of injury.
Harnesses are also designed to be comfortably worn for long periods. Harnesses can also be used in a fall restraint system to prevent workers from reaching a point where a fall could occur.
What We've Got
The Roofing Fall Protection Harness is your everyday harness. Available in different models ranging from basic to deluxe, our selection will accommodate your specific needs and budget.
For a harness that is super comfortable, check out the DBI-SALA Exofit Universal Harness. The lightweight design makes it super portable and the polyester webbing prevents uncomfortable rubbing or chafing. This harness also incorporates an ergonomic design, including shoulder, hip and leg padding for maximum comfort.
Looking for something a bit more on the economical side? We've got you covered. The Guardian Velocity Universal Harness is cost- effective but still high quality. Chest, should and leg straps are adjustable for the perfect fit and a damage indicator will let you know when the harness has been damaged and should be removed from service.
Not what you need? Browse our impressive inventory of Harnesses from the most trusted brands such as DBI-SALA, Miller, Guardian, French Creek and Fall Tech. You’ll be sure to find what you need from our wide selection. And if it isn’t in stock or we don’t currently carry it, as long as someone makes it, we can get it!
Combining a Huge Selection with Exceptional Customer Service
Whether you’re an electrical contractor, commercial construction worker, roofer, miner or steel worker, if you work high for a living then you deserve the best in fall protection equipment. Our selection combined with our sales, ordering and delivery processes make FallProtectionPros.com the only name you need to remember when it comes to fall protection.

        A Retractable Lifeline works a lot like a seat belt.  Pull it out slowly, and it will follow you.  If you run, you'll end up on your ass.  These self retracting lifelines come in various sizes, lengths, material.  Use a web retractable for concrete, and steel retractable for welding.

Fall Protection Retractable Lifelines & Fall Limiters

Retractable Lifelines

What Are Retractable Lifelines?
A Retractable Lifeline is a viable alternative to shock-absorbing lanyards. These devices are specifically designed for professionals who work high to stop free-fall within inches, allowing greater mobility.
How a Retractable Lifeline Works to Protect You from Falls
They don’t call it a lifeline for nothing.  Retractable Lifelines save thousands of lives each year. A Retractable Lifeline is ideally vertically mounted to a suitable overhead anchorage point. The Lifeline is coiled in a protective housing and, under constant tension, retracts or extends as you move up or down.
A Retractable Lifeline works like a seatbelt in that the sudden jolt from a fall will instantly activate the fall-arresting mechanism which causes the lifeline to lock and stop your fall after a short distance, between 16” and 18”. In other words, pull it out slowly and steadily, it will follow you. If you run, you'll end up with a serious case of whiplash.
What We've Got
We carry a wide selection of Retractable Lifelines in various sizes, lengths and materials to cater to your specific needs. Whether for commercial or residential purposes, we’ve got it. Need a web retractable that won’t damage your roof? Check out the Miller MightyLite Web Retractable. Available in various lengths up to 50ft, the Miller MightyLite Web Retractable is lighter than cable versions, making it particularly ideal for hard- to-mount locations.
Need steel retractable that won’t corrode? We’ve got you covered. The Guardian Edge Stainless Steel Retractable may be just what you’re looking for. The compact and lightweight design makes it easy to carry while stainless steel and non-corrosive components make it extremely durable and long-lasting giving you more value for your money.
Not what you need? Browse our impressive inventory of retractable lifelines and fall limiters. We have a wide selection from an extensive list of manufacturers to accommodate your every need. If someone makes it, we can get it!
Exceptional Customer Service
Availability is one of the biggest complaints customers have about sales teams, but ours is always available to help guide you through the process and get you what you need. From our huge selection of retractable lifelines and other fall protection products, to a simple ordering process to fast and flexible shipping times, we’ve got you covered.

MSA Safety Inc. Earnings Edge Higher on Strong Product Sales
The leading global manufacturer of safety products was rescued by strong sales to the fire safety market. 











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Oct 24, 2015 at 8:30AM
            
            





MSA Safety (NYSE:MSA) is facing three very stiff headwinds from the strong dollar, along with weaknesses in emerging and energy markets pushing against business growth. While each put downward pressure on revenue and earnings in the third quarter, the company was able to overcome much of this pressure thanks to a revolutionary new product. That product, the G1 SCBA, pushed sales in its breathing apparatus segment up more than 80% over last year's third quarter, helping it to eke out single digit year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings.

Data source: MSA Safety.
What happened with MSA Safety this quarter? Even with a trio of challenges, MSA Safety delivered fairly solid results.

While revenue was down 1% on a reported basis, on a constant currency basis revenue increased 8% year over year. This shows just how strongly foreign currency fluctuations are blowing against MSA Safety.
The big driver, of course, were sales of its new G1 SCBA, which pushed sales of within the breathing apparatus segment up 83% year over year on a constant currency basis, driven by a 163% sales increase in North America. 
The backlog of future sales within the breathing apparatus segment also remained strong at $68 million. However, on a net basis the backlog is down $9 million sequentially.
Also strong were sales within the company's fire and rescue helmet segment, which were up 32% worldwide, again on a constant currency basis.
The rest of the company's segments were under pressure due to weaknesses in emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil, as well as continued weakness in sales to energy-related customers.

What management had to say CEO William Lambert noted this pressure in his commentary on the quarter in the company's earnings press release. According to him:






The third quarter presented us with several challenges, including a stronger U.S. dollar, softer business conditions in emerging markets, and continued weakness in the energy market. Despite these headwinds, the results we continue to see in the fire service market provide a sense of optimism in an otherwise challenging macro environment.

Sales to the fire service market really rescued MSA Safety this quarter with those customers driving both breathing apparatus and fire and rescue helmet segment sales.
MSA Safety isn't the company seeing its sales rescued by the fire service market. Honeywell (NYSE:HON), noted on its third-quarter conference call that it saw a good performance in its security and fire segment, which helped push energy, safety, and security sales up 4% on a core organic basis. Furthermore, Honeywell CFO Tom Szlosek commented on the call that its "security and fire business is well positioned for continued growth" due in part to positive fire service market conditions. 
Looking forward MSA Safety expects the impact from currencies, emerging markets, and energy to last into 2016. Because of this, it is now undergoing a restructuring to reduce its costs by $10 million next year. These steps to pare down its cost structure will position the company to better weather the weakness ahead while still positioning it to capture growth over the long term. In the near term, that growth will likely continue to be driven by the fire service market, where, like Honeywell, it is banking on strong sales growth to persist.

Retractables


        A Retractable Lifeline works a lot like a seat belt.  Pull it out slowly, and it will follow you.  If you run, you'll end up on your ass.  These self retracting lifelines come in various sizes, lengths, material.  Use a web retractable for concrete, and steel retractable for welding.

Fall Protection Retractable Lifelines & Fall Limiters

Retractable Lifelines

What Are Retractable Lifelines?
A Retractable Lifeline is a viable alternative to shock-absorbing lanyards. These devices are specifically designed for professionals who work high to stop free-fall within inches, allowing greater mobility.
How a Retractable Lifeline Works to Protect You from Falls
They don’t call it a lifeline for nothing.  Retractable Lifelines save thousands of lives each year. A Retractable Lifeline is ideally vertically mounted to a suitable overhead anchorage point. The Lifeline is coiled in a protective housing and, under constant tension, retracts or extends as you move up or down.
A Retractable Lifeline works like a seatbelt in that the sudden jolt from a fall will instantly activate the fall-arresting mechanism which causes the lifeline to lock and stop your fall after a short distance, between 16” and 18”. In other words, pull it out slowly and steadily, it will follow you. If you run, you'll end up with a serious case of whiplash.
What We've Got
We carry a wide selection of Retractable Lifelines in various sizes, lengths and materials to cater to your specific needs. Whether for commercial or residential purposes, we’ve got it. Need a web retractable that won’t damage your roof? Check out the Miller MightyLite Web Retractable. Available in various lengths up to 50ft, the Miller MightyLite Web Retractable is lighter than cable versions, making it particularly ideal for hard- to-mount locations.
Need steel retractable that won’t corrode? We’ve got you covered. The Guardian Edge Stainless Steel Retractable may be just what you’re looking for. The compact and lightweight design makes it easy to carry while stainless steel and non-corrosive components make it extremely durable and long-lasting giving you more value for your money.
Not what you need? Browse our impressive inventory of retractable lifelines and fall limiters. We have a wide selection from an extensive list of manufacturers to accommodate your every need. If someone makes it, we can get it!
Exceptional Customer Service
Availability is one of the biggest complaints customers have about sales teams, but ours is always available to help guide you through the process and get you what you need. From our huge selection of retractable lifelines and other fall protection products, to a simple ordering process to fast and flexible shipping times, we’ve got you covered.

Safety Harnesses

What are Fall Protection Safety Harnesses?
A fall protection safety harness is a piece of equipment designed to keep you safe and secure when working high, so you don’t end up flying off the top of a building or other tall structure you’re working on. If you happen to slip and fall, a harness will distribute the force and provide support while you are suspended in the air, making you feel more like a superhero than workplace fall victim.
How Safety Harnesses Work
A worker wears a harness that is attached to a lanyard or retractable and secured to an anchor for support. Harnesses are specifically designed that in the event of a fall, a worker will remain suspended upright while they await rescue and fall forces will be distributed throughout the body, significantly reducing the chances of injury.
Harnesses are also designed to be comfortably worn for long periods. Harnesses can also be used in a fall restraint system to prevent workers from reaching a point where a fall could occur.
What We've Got
The Roofing Fall Protection Harness is your everyday harness. Available in different models ranging from basic to deluxe, our selection will accommodate your specific needs and budget.
For a harness that is super comfortable, check out the DBI-SALA Exofit Universal Harness. The lightweight design makes it super portable and the polyester webbing prevents uncomfortable rubbing or chafing. This harness also incorporates an ergonomic design, including shoulder, hip and leg padding for maximum comfort.
Looking for something a bit more on the economical side? We've got you covered. The Guardian Velocity Universal Harness is cost- effective but still high quality. Chest, should and leg straps are adjustable for the perfect fit and a damage indicator will let you know when the harness has been damaged and should be removed from service.
Not what you need? Browse our impressive inventory of Harnesses from the most trusted brands such as DBI-SALA, Miller, Guardian, French Creek and Fall Tech. You’ll be sure to find what you need from our wide selection. And if it isn’t in stock or we don’t currently carry it, as long as someone makes it, we can get it!
Combining a Huge Selection with Exceptional Customer Service
Whether you’re an electrical contractor, commercial construction worker, roofer, miner or steel worker, if you work high for a living then you deserve the best in fall protection equipment. Our selection combined with our sales, ordering and delivery processes make FallProtectionPros.com the only name you need to remember when it comes to fall protection.

Fall Protection Retractable Lifelines & Fall Limiters

Retractable Lifelines

What Are Retractable Lifelines?
A Retractable Lifeline is a viable alternative to shock-absorbing lanyards. These devices are specifically designed for professionals who work high to stop free-fall within inches, allowing greater mobility.
How a Retractable Lifeline Works to Protect You from Falls
They don’t call it a lifeline for nothing.  Retractable Lifelines save thousands of lives each year. A Retractable Lifeline is ideally vertically mounted to a suitable overhead anchorage point. The Lifeline is coiled in a protective housing and, under constant tension, retracts or extends as you move up or down.
A Retractable Lifeline works like a seatbelt in that the sudden jolt from a fall will instantly activate the fall-arresting mechanism which causes the lifeline to lock and stop your fall after a short distance, between 16” and 18”. In other words, pull it out slowly and steadily, it will follow you. If you run, you'll end up with a serious case of whiplash.
What We've Got
We carry a wide selection of Retractable Lifelines in various sizes, lengths and materials to cater to your specific needs. Whether for commercial or residential purposes, we’ve got it. Need a web retractable that won’t damage your roof? Check out the Miller MightyLite Web Retractable. Available in various lengths up to 50ft, the Miller MightyLite Web Retractable is lighter than cable versions, making it particularly ideal for hard- to-mount locations.
Need steel retractable that won’t corrode? We’ve got you covered. The Guardian Edge Stainless Steel Retractable may be just what you’re looking for. The compact and lightweight design makes it easy to carry while stainless steel and non-corrosive components make it extremely durable and long-lasting giving you more value for your money.
Not what you need? Browse our impressive inventory of retractable lifelines and fall limiters. We have a wide selection from an extensive list of manufacturers to accommodate your every need. If someone makes it, we can get it!

From our huge selection of retractable lifelines and other fall protection products, to a simple ordering process to fast and flexible shipping times, we’ve got you covered.

Product Description

The MSA 10107602 Altair 4X Multiple Gas Detector (LEL, O2, CO, H2S) surpasses industry standards in several crucial areas. Its four-year sensor life is 60% longer than the industry average, while its 24-hour run time exceeds the industry average by 71%. This versatile portable detector is a perfect match for industries ranging from fire fighting to welding, and its digital sensor output makes it less likely to suffer from RF interference. The unit features exclusive MotionAlert, which lets others know if the user has become immobile, and InstantAlert, a manual alarm that alerts others of potentially dangerous situations. This rugged unit is designed to withstand a drop of up to 20 feet and uses less than half as much calibration gas as the industry average.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
