Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

AAA Insurance


                                            I submitted a claim for a burglary in April. The beginning of this joke is that the girl that answered the 800 number didn't know where claims were sent. She had me send my claim to the Walnut Creek, California office. When I contacted the adjuster IN OKLAHOMA CITY, he said...show more

                                            In a word: horrible. Stay far, far away from this nightmare of an experience from the website to the customer service line to the joke of a mobile app. Overdraft fees are insane at $37, sometimes more if they cover it.

                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees. I purchased 1400 dollars worth of stuff, and believing I had 12 months to pay off, I didn't worry about it for the first two months. The next time I looked they had hit me with 100$...show more

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

The Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN


                                            Approached at airport to sign up for this card. Already had a few. Signed up anyway as some pressure applied. Did a status check to see where I sat with the promotion 80% at the spending goal and was told there was no promotion. So I closed all AMEX cards but this one and plan...show more

                                            WalletHub is by far my favorite credit monitoring tool and has made it really easy for me to gain an understanding of my score. Signing up was a very simple process and there were no extra strings attached.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.
