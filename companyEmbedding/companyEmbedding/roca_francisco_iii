 Educational Background



Graduate 
Class of 1989 


Florida State University

                  The Florida State University (commonly referred to as Florida State or FSU)[9] is a space-grant and sea-grant public research university located in the state capital city of Tallahassee, Florida, United States. It is a comprehensive doctoral research university with medical programs and very high research activity as determined by the Carnegie Foundation.[10] The university comprises 16 separate colleges and more than 110 centers, facilities, labs and institutes that offer more than 300 programs of study, including professional programs.[11] Florida State is home to Florida's only National Laboratory – the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and is the birthplace of the commercially viable anti-cancer drug Taxol. Florida State University also operates The John & Mable Ringling Museum of Art, the State Art Museum of Florida and one of the largest museum/university complexes in the nation.[12] Florida State University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools as a Level VI public institution.[13]

Florida State was officially established in 1851 and is located on the oldest continuous site of higher education in the state of Florida.[2][3] In 1905 Florida State earned Florida's first Rhodes Scholar.[14][15] In 1935 Florida State University was awarded the first chapter of Phi Beta Kappa in Florida and is among the ten percent of American universities to have earned a chapter of the national academic honor society.[16][17] In 1977 Florida State University earned the first female Rhodes Scholar in Florida.[18] In 2007, the Florida Legislature permitted Florida State and the University of Florida to charge 40% higher tuition than other institutions in the State University System of Florida.[19] In 2010 Florida State University was named a "Budget Ivy" university by the Fiske Guide to Getting into the Right College.[20] In 2012 U.S. News & World Report ranked Florida State the most efficient National University in the United States.[21]

Florida State University is one of two Florida public universities to immediately qualify as a "preeminent university" by law under Florida Senate Bill 1076, signed by Governor Rick Scott in 2013.[22][23] As a result of this legislation, preeminent universities receive additional funding that is intended to improve the academics and national reputation of higher education within the state of Florida.[24] As one of Florida's primary graduate research universities,[25] Florida State University awards approximately 3,000 graduate and professional degrees each year.[26]

The Florida State University is also home to nationally ranked programs in many academic areas, including the sciences, engineering, social policy, film, music, theater, dance, visual art, business, political science, psychology, social work, medicine, and law.[27] The university is also known for its undergraduate study abroad options: according to Uni in the USA, "the large numbers of students that study abroad nicely compliment the students that study here from abroad."[28]

Florida State University athletics programs are favorites of passionate students, fans and alumni across the United States, which often appear in conjunction with the Marching Chiefs of the FSU College of Music. Florida State is a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference and has won thirteen national athletic championships as well as multiple individual competitor NCAA championship awards
