These shares were sold by the reporting person pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 Sales Plan entered into on August 9, 2016, which provided for the sale of shares of the issuer's Class A Common Stock. With the sale of the shares reported herein, the Plan has been completed and no future sales may occur pursuant to the Plan.
Rule 10b5-1, promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, allows executives of a company who are not in possession of material non-public information to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell a specified number of shares of such company's stock. Once a plan is established, the executive does not retain or exercise any discretion over sales of stock under the plan and the pre-planned trades may be executed at later dates as set forth in the plan, without regard to any subsequent material non-public information related to the company that the executive may receive.
Includes 500 shares held jointly with spouse.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
