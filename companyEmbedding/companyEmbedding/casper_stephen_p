My wife and I are so happy we hired Casper & Casper.
We were rear-ended while riding a motorcycle and tried to handle the claim 
		  ourselves with no success. It got so bad dealing with the insurance company 
		  that we couldn't even get the adjuster to return our calls... and the statute of 
		  limitations was running out on our claim.
That's when we called Casper & Casper attorney William Allen. He took our case 
		  at the last minute and filed suit to protect our rights. We are very satisfied 
		  with the results.
We truly appreciate Will, and his assistant Heather, who helped us through the 
		  frustrating process of dealing with insurance companies and their defense attorneys. 
		  I only wish we had contacted them sooner.
~ George R.
Dear Mr. Casper, I just wanted to thank you once again from the bottom of 
            my heart for all that you and your staff have done on my behalf. You stated 
            at the onset of this case that you did not think we would win, but obviously 
            you made that happen. The odds were against us, and the amount of money was 
            minimal, but you graciously agreed to take it on because you said it was the 
            right thing to do. You have been so gracious and kind, and made the legal 
            system work for me. I truly know that without all of your time and trouble that 
            I would have been (as the saying goes), left out in the cold.
~ Jay D.
I'm so pleased with how attorney Barb Strady is handling my Personal 
            Injury suit. She is pleasant and knowledgeable, and always answers my calls 
            in a timely fashion. But the most important quality she has is that she 
            always makes me feel like I'm her only client.
~ Dara R.
Casper & Casper was instrumental in helping us through a really difficult time. 
            They were thorough, kept us informed, and told us what to expect ahead of time. 
            We were not only pleased with the outcome of our case, but also with the personal 
            touch that attorney Rhys Richards provided. He and his paralegal were professional 
            and seemed genuinely committed to safeguarding our best interest. We would highly 
            recommend this law firm without hesitation.
~ Anna T.
