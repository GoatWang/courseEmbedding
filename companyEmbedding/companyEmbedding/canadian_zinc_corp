Canadian Zinc’s long-term aim is to bring the 100%-owned Prairie Creek Mine in the Mackenzie Mountains of the Northwest Territories into production at the earliest possible date.  The mine, which has a fascinating history, is a silver and base metals property already in the advanced stages of development, with substantial resources of high-grade silver, zinc, and lead. Exposures of mineralized vein structures, which overlie thicker stratabound mineralization, both of which are included in the present resource, are known to occur over a distance of 16 kilometres through the property.

Central Newfoundland Projects



Beginning in 2012, Canadian Zinc focused efforts in a second area of interest in central Newfoundland. Canadian Zinc acquired Paragon Minerals and their portfolio of 10 highly prospective base and precious metal projects including the South Tally Pond Project. In 2013, Canadian Zinc acquired Messina Minerals and their Tulks South and Long Lake projects.
Canadian Zinc now controls approximately 500 km2 that represents an underexplored mining district with demonstrated potential for high-grade base and precious metal deposits. The land package includes three National Instrument 43-101 compliant deposits with excellent potential for expansion that currently total approximately five million tonnes, several historic deposits and numerous untested exploration targets in need of further exploration.

























Sustainability and Canadian Zinc


It is Canadian Zinc’s policy to achieve and maintain a high standard of environmental care in conducting its business as a resource company, and through its developments, contribute to sustaining society’s material needs. Canadian Zinc’s approach to environmental management seeks continuous improvement in performance by incorporating evolving scientific knowledge and community expectations into its operations.

											Overview									



During 2012 an opportunity presented itself and Canadian Zinc added to its mineral portfolio through the acquisition of Paragon Minerals Corporation which was primarily focused in central Newfoundland in highly prospective base and precious metal bearing terrains with the premiere project being the South Tally Pond Project. Subsequently, to further supplement the prospective base metal properties in 2013, Canadian Zinc acquired Messina Minerals Inc and their Tulks South and Long Lake projects.
Canadian Zinc now controls approximately 500 km2 that represents an underexplored mining district with demonstrated potential for high-grade base and precious metal volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits. The land package includes three National Instrument 43-101 compliant deposits with excellent potential for expansion that currently total approximately five million tonnes, several historic deposits and numerous untested exploration targets in need of further exploration.
Canadian Zinc’s key properties in central Newfoundland include:

South Tally Pond VMS Property (Lemarchant Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag-Au Deposit)
Tulks South VMS Property (Boomerang-Domino Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag-Au Deposit, Tulks East Deposit)
Long Lake VMS Property (Long Lake Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag-Au Deposit)
Victoria Mine and Lake Douglas VMS Properties.

Compared with other VMS districts in Canada, the central Newfoundland area has not received nearly the same amount of exploration effort.  This is despite hosting the world class Buchan’s deposits and the recently closed (June 2015) Duck Pond Cu-Zn Mine. The potential for additional VMS deposit discoveries in the volcanic belts of central Newfoundland remains high.

Canadian Zinc and Buchans Minerals Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Minco Plc, have agreed to jointly undertake a research program aimed at investigating the technical and economic viability of developing their respective central Newfoundland Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag-Au deposits through a central milling facility.
The central milling concept is based on the potential that collectively, the central Newfoundland deposits can be econmically mined, pre-concentrated, trucked and then milled, simultaneously or sequentially, through a central mill. As part of the collaboration agreement, both companies have undertaken to complete bench scale dense media separation ("DMS") and metallurgical studies on the deposits.
The collaboration agreement between Canadian Zinc and Buchans Minerals is focused on eight VMS deposits located in central Newfoundland including four deposits held by Canadian Zinc (Lemarchant, Boomerang-Domino, Tulks East and Long Lake).
The program is largely being funded by Research & Development Corporation of Newfoundland and Labrador. The total cost of the research project is estimated at $735,000 with Buchans and Canadian Zinc each contributing up to $100,000.

											Canadian Zinc's Vision									



Development of the Prairie Creek Mine
Prairie Creek Mine (Click to Enlarge)
"Canadian Zinc Corporation's Prairie Creek Mine is a unique opportunity - a property with a long history and a great future - a mine that is 30+ years of age but never operated."  - John Kearney, Chairman and CEO
Canadian Zinc Corporation (CZN) is committed to the responsible and sustainable development of mineral deposits throughout Canada. The Prairie Creek Mine has a high grade Proven and Probable Reserves measuring 7.6 million tonnes with an average grade 8.93% Zn, 8.33% Pb and 127.58 g/t Ag. These reserves will support a mine life for 17 years and the mine will operate in a responsible manner without compromising the ecological value or the importance of the area to First Nations, conservationists and the public in general. CZN has every intention of operating the Prairie Creek Mine with best available technology and environmental protection so that the temporary impact on the environment during operations are minimal, and long term effects after closure will be negligible.
Wherever the Company operates, Canadian Zinc believes that mineral development and conservation of ecological resources need not be mutually exclusive. The Company's vision is the development and successful operation of the Prairie Creek Mine with controlled road access, where the ecology is protected, and mineral extraction with its related economic benefits, successfully co-exist with traditional aboriginal land uses and the Nahanni National Park Reserve.
The mine will operate for a relatively short time and will bring substantial benefits to local communities in the form of business opportunities, training and jobs, and will be a catalyst for regional development, tourism and economic activity that can be sustained long after, eventual but inevitable mine closure.

Canadian Zinc Launches Summer Drilling at South Tally Pond Project, Central Newfoundland


Canadian Zinc Launches Summer Drilling at South Tally Pond Project, Central Newfoundland
Canada NewsWire
VANCOUVER, July 4, 2017



5,000 metres planned at Lemarchant Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag-Au Deposit
Ground EM geophysics in progress over three priority targets area 
CZN-TSX CZICF-OTCQB 
VANCOUVER, July 4, 2017 /CNW/ - Canadian Zinc Corporation (TSX: CZN; OTCQB: CZICF) ("the Company" or "Canadian Zinc") is pleased to announce it has resumed its diamond drilling exploration program at the Company's wholly owned South Tally Pond zinc-lead-copper-silver-gold project in central Newfoundland. 
The South Tally Pond project is host to the Lemarchant massive sulphide deposit, a significant precious metal-rich copper-lead-zinc volcanogenic massive sulphide ("VMS") resource with expansion potential as well as numerous other drill-ready targets. 
The 2017 summer drill program will consist of up to 5,000 metres in 24 diamond drillholes and is designed to continue to test for mineralized extensions to the Lemarchant massive sulphide deposit. The drill program will initially focus on further testing and defining the up-dip mineralization discovered during the 2017 winter drill program (see news release April 18, 2017) followed, by further drill testing at the Lemarchant Northwest Zone.  
Highlights of the recent 2017 winter drilling program to be followed up in this summer program include significant up-dip extensions to the Lemarchant massive sulfide deposit on section 102+50N and 101+25N including:
LM17-115 (102+50N): 10.23% zinc, 2.19% lead, 0.78% copper, 148.4 g/t silver, 2.41 g/t gold over 7.1 mLM17-116 (102+50N): 14.06% zinc, 6.27% lead, 1.88% copper, 382.9 g/t silver, 2.01 g/t gold over 6.0 m
LM17-110 (101+25N): 11.20% zinc, 0.46% lead, 0.94% copper, 46.3 g/t silver, 1.06 g/t gold over 6.9 mLM17-111 (101+25N):   2.84% zinc, 1.01% lead, 0.75% copper, 73.4 g/t silver, 0.45 g/t gold over 3.8 m
The summer drill program will also include initial drill testing of previously defined electromagnetic ("EM") geophysical anomalies at the North and South Lemarchant target areas, located approximately 500 metres along strike of the Lemarchant deposit. 
A ground EM geophysical program is also underway at the South Tally Pond project with the aim of defining new drill targets. The geophysical program is focused on three priority target areas located immediately south and east of the Lemarchant deposit. Each area is associated with airborne EM conductors that remain untested by drilling. 
At the Spencers Pond prospect, located approximately 2 km southwest of the Lemarchant deposit, initial drill testing of newly defined EM targets is also being planned.  In this area, a single, historic drillhole intersected massive sulphide (pyrite) over 0.5 metres associated with geochemically similar mudstones to that which overly the Lemarchant deposit. 
South Tally Pond Project
The South Tally Pond project covers approximately 13,700 hectares and is located in a proven mining district in the same productive volcanic belt as the past-producing Duck Pond Cu-Zn Mine, owned by Teck Resources. The Lemarchant deposit is situated 20 km southwest of Duck Pond. An initial NI43-101 mineral resource estimate completed on the Lemarchant deposit in 2012 reported an Indicated Resource of 1.24 million tonnes with an average grade of 5.45% Zn, 0.58% Cu, 1.19% Pb, 1.01 g/t Au and 59.17 g/t Ag; and an Inferred Resource of 1.34 million tonnes with average grade of 3.70% Zn, 0.41% Cu, 0.86% Pb, 1.00 g/t Au and 50.41 g/t Ag. 
About Canadian Zinc
Canadian Zinc is a TSX-listed exploration and development company trading under the symbol "CZN". The Company's key project is the 100%-owned Prairie Creek Project, a fully permitted, advanced-stage zinc-lead-silver property, located in the Northwest Territories. 
Canadian Zinc also owns an extensive land package in central Newfoundland that it is exploring for copper-lead-zinc-silver-gold deposits. These include the South Tally Pond project (Lemarchant deposit); Tulks South project (Boomerang-Domino and Tulks East deposits) and Long Lake project (Long Lake deposit). 
The Company's exploration strategy in central Newfoundland is to continue to build on its existing polymetallic resource base with the aim of developing either a stand-alone mine, similar to the past-producing base metal mines at Buchans and Duck Pond, or a number of smaller deposits that could be developed simultaneously and processed in a central milling facility. The 2016 metallurgical research program concluded that Lemarchant is a priority deposit for a potential central milling facility and should be explored aggressively for additional mineralization. 
Cautionary Statement – Forward-Looking InformationThis press release contains certain forward-looking information, including, among other things, the expected completion of acquisitions and the advancement of mineral properties. This forward looking information includes, or may be based upon, estimates, forecasts, and statements as to management's expectations with respect to, among other things, the completion of transactions, the issue of permits, the size and quality of mineral resources, future trends for the company, progress in development of mineral properties, future production and sales volumes, capital costs, mine production costs, demand and market outlook for metals, future metal prices and treatment and refining charges, the outcome of legal proceedings, the timing of exploration, development and mining activities, acquisition of shares in other companies and the financial results of the company. There can be no assurances that such statements will prove to be accurate and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that mineral resources will be converted into mineral reserves.
Michael J. Vande Guchte, P.Geo., VP Exploration NL for Canadian Zinc Corporation is a Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the contents of this press release.
Cautionary Note to United States Investors The United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") permits U.S. mining companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only those mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce. We use certain terms in this press release, such as "measured," "indicated," and "inferred" "resources," which the SEC guidelines prohibit U.S. registered companies from including in their filings with the SEC.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
