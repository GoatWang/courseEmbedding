Condolences




























FERRIS, ESQ. OBE, , WILLIAM G. C. William Gerald Cubitt Ferris, Esq., OBE (Bill), the product of a by-gone era, died on 30 October, 2006. A memorial service will be held on Friday, 10 November, 2006 at 3:00 p.m. in Cox Chapel, Highland Park United Methodist Church, 3300 Mockingbird Lane, Dallas TX, Rev. Jeff Hall officiating. Bill's ashes will be returned to England by his son Peter. Bill came from a long line of distinguished military officers and civil servants who served the British Empire. The eldest son of Col. William A.T. Ferris and Irene Lucy Cubitt Ferris, Bill was born on Monday, 18 October 1926 in Southsea, England. At age 6 months, he and his mother returned to India where his father was the commanding officer of British forces at Rawalpindi in Northern India, now Pakistan. At age 7, Bill was sent to England to begin his formal education. In 1937, at the age of 10, Bill was part of the massed children's choir singing at the coronation of King George VI. In 1943, Bill joined the Coldstream Guards, attended Sandhurst and was later assigned to the Guards Armoured Division. Following his training, he was assigned briefly to Wellington Barracks in London where he was part of the cadre of escorts for Princess Elizabeth, now Queen Elizabeth II. Upon his release from the Coldstream Guards, Bill entered Kings College, Cambridge. Upon completion of his degree in Colonial Administration, and due to his fluency in Latin, Greek, Hausa, French, German and Hindustani, Bill joined the Colonial Service choosing to be assigned to Nigeria. He arrived in 1949 and was posted as an Assistant District Officer in Northern Nigeria. During his second tour in 1952, Bill successfully quelled a disburbance between different religious factions in his district. As a result of his action, Bill received The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (Civil Division) for Meritorious Service, otherwise known as an OBE. During his private audience with Queen Elizabeth in 1954, Bill recounted his actions in Nigeria and reminisced with the Queen about their acquaintance during WWII. Realizing that the sun was setting on the British Empire, Bill left England for the United States aboard the Queen Mary in March 1955. Bill spent time in Wyoming and Montana working on ranches before settling in New Orleans, LA in 1958 selling British sports cars. He met the love of his life, Carolynn Davis, when he sold her a car. Less than a year later, they were married and eventually had three sons. An offer to be the General Manager of Overseas Motors Corporation led the family to Dallas. Bill created and developed the Rolls Royce Division of Overseas Motors and was Managing Director from 1971 until his retirement in 1991. He was named the #1 Rolls Royce Salesman in the world in 1980. Recently, Bill completed his contribution to Was It Only Yesterday which recounts the transition of Nigeria from a colony of the British Empire to an independent member of the British Commonwealth. Bill was preceeded in death by: Carolynn; his parents and; his step-brother John. He is survived by: his brother Richard and niece Caroline of Putney, England; son Peter, daughter-in-law Dessa and grandson Duncan of Dallas, TX; son Philip and grandson Alex of Garland, TX and; son Keith, daughter-in-law Cyndi and granddaughters Miranda and Emily of Austin, TX. Bill will be remembered fondly by all who had the good fortune to have known him and to have been entertained by his forthright, yet subtle, musings and wit. Donations can be made in the name of William Gerald Cubitt Ferris, Esq., OBE to the Visiting Nurse Association of Texas Hospice Services or the American Cancer Society.
