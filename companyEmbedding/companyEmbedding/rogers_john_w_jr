Where to start

Making the decision going to college, pursuing an advanced degree or obtaining an industry recognized certificate is one of the most important decisions an individual will make in their lifetime. When considering an educational institution there are numerous factors that need to be taken into account before an education decision can be made. 
Here are the main factors to consider when looking at pursuing an advanced degree or completing a certificate program:
Online VS In Person: This is the first fundamental question that prospective students need to ask themselves. If you are the kind of person that is self driven, has a tight schedule or is not in a commutable distance to an in person institution, then pursuing an online degree could be a good fit. However, if you find yourself needing to be in a physical classroom environment and learn better that way, then you should seek out in person programs that can better suite your needs. People learn in all different kinds of ways. Some are visual learners, some experiential and some need to hear things to have the information really sink in. No one knows himself or herself better than you, so listen to your gut and first determine what kind of learner you are before embarking on the next steps. Rasmssen College goes into greater depth about the plusses and minuses of online v.s. traditional educational settings. 
Career Opportunities: When exploring areas of study that you are interested in, one recommendation is to first explore the types of jobs and careers in that industry. Often times people find that after obtaining a degree that has set them back a significant amount of money, that the career field that they have their degree in is either not growing or is underpaid in relation to the cost of the degree. We suggest exploring a variety of careers and use the information contained here in conjunction with The Bureau of Labor and Statistics Data to determine if you are making a wise investment in your degree. All of the statistics we have assembled on career and degree data come from the BLS website and are intended to help students make wise decisions about their studies and career options with a degree or certificate. 



 
Time Commitment: The amount of time that you have available to apply to your studies is going to be one of the most important factors in your decision. If you are working a full time job, you will have to figure out a way of balancing your personal life, with your schoolwork. This article from US News and World Report will help you come up with a game plan for managing your time
Financial Aid, Scholarships and Student Loans: Once you have decided that you want to go to college and have a career path planned out once you obtain your degree, then it’s time to figure out how to pay for the degree. Most institutions have different financing options that you will have to do your homework on, but all usually have some form of financial aid or scholarships available. When looking for information on student aid and the resources available to students, we recommend starting at the Federal Student Aid website. This is an office of the U.S. Department of Education and here, students will find a wealth of resources and information that will help them better determine what kind of aid or grants are available to them.

Background[edit]
Rogers was raised in the Hyde Park community area of Chicago's South Side, and graduated from the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools in 1976.[9][10] At the age of 12 his father started giving him dividend-paying stocks.[9] He went to college at Princeton University, where he used his free time to glean market information at his local stock brokerage and where he was influenced by Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street.[9]
He was a college basketball teammate of Craig Robinson,[9] and he served as captain of the 1979–80 Ivy League co-champion Princeton Tigers men's basketball team.[4] He had a habit of perusing business journals and calling his broker from stadium payphones.[11] Rogers credits Pete Carril, his basketball coach, as his greatest college influence because Carril stressed precision and teamwork.[11]
Rogers studied economics at Princeton.[11][12] After graduating in 1980, he worked for William Blair & Company in Chicago. A few years later, and with the financial backing of family and friends, he opened his own firm, starting with the Municipal Employees' Annuity & Benefit Fund of Chicago as his first account.[9]
Family[edit]
He is the only son of Jewel Lafontant and John Rogers, Sr.[9] His mother Jewel was the first African American woman to graduate from the University of Chicago Law School in 1946.[13] She became a prominent Republican lawyer,[9] and she nominated Richard Nixon, who won the Republican Party Presidential Nomination, at the 1960 Republican National Convention.[11] His father was a Tuskegee airman pilot with over 100 combat missions of service during World War II and an eventual Cook County judge for twenty years.[9][11] His parents divorced in 1961 and his mother died in 1997.[9] Rogers was three years old when his parents divorced.[11] He had a daughter, Victoria, with his former wife Desirée Rogers.[9]
One of Rogers' great-grandfathers owned the Stratford Hotel in Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma, known as The Black Wall Street. The hotel was destroyed in the Tulsa race riot. Rogers helped finance Before They Die!, a documentary detailing some survivor accounts, and made a brief appearance in the film.[14]
On December 28, 2002, Rogers married Sharon Fairley who was also a divorcee.[15] At the time of her 2002 wedding announcement in The New York Times, Fairley, who is also a Princeton alumna, was the Executive Director of Consumer Marketing and Trademark Development at Pharmacia.[15] Currently, Fairley is the City of Chicago's new leader for the Independent Police Review Authority, which investigates police-involved shootings.[16] Previously, she worked for Chicago's Office of the Inspector General as First Deputy Inspector General and General Counsel and as an Assistant United States Attorney in Chicago for eight years.[17][18][19]
Personal life[edit]
Rogers has a special overnight delivery subscription with BusinessWeek that is delivered via Federal Express so it is received a day earlier than the regular public.[9] He still does not use computers or e-mail.[9] Rogers is known for wearing gray pinstripe business suits to work.[9] On the basketball court, he wears black-rimmed goggles.[11][20]
Rogers also has a publicly disclosed set of habits. He has had a diet, which includes on average more than one meal a day from McDonald's at least since college.[9] He only eats simple familiar foods and will return an order because a vegetable touched his meat.[9] His family's long-time (over 40 years) housekeeper, claims that he buys things such as shaving cream and deodorant in sixes and that he changes his toothbrush every other week.[9] He collects teddy bears (especially Winnie the Pooh).[9]
Three-on-three basketball has been a continuing part of his life. As of 2000, he had a team with the second and fourth all-time leading scorers at Princeton, Kit Mueller (class of 1991) and Robinson (1983) and the school's second leading three point shooter Sean Jackson (1992). Between 1996 and 2000 his team had won 12 of 17 tournaments that they had entered.[11] He scored the game-winning basket of Chicago's three-on-three basketball tournament on a team with Arne Duncan, Robinson, and Kit Mueller.[9] Rogers and Robinson were among those invited to practice with Michael Jordan as he prepared for his comeback.[21] He claims to be the first person to have beaten Jordan in a game of one-on-one at one of his fantasy basketball camps.[22][23] Among the witnesses to the victory, which was reported in Sports Illustrated, were John Thompson Jr., Mike Krzyzewski and fellow fantasy participant Damon Wayans.[20]
Ariel Capital Management/Ariel Investments, LLC[edit]
Rogers was one of the hot stock pickers of the 1980s.[24] Rogers uses a value investing strategy, which has been a problem at times when growth stocks have been the better-performing investment class.[9][24][25] However, his firm and its mutual funds have often been among the industry performance leaders and have on average outperformed the market.[24][25][26] He eschews investing in new companies or making investments in companies that have no track record.[22] For example, rather than invest in AIDS-related stocks, he would prefer to invest in hospitals that treat AIDS victims.[27] His typical holding period is four or five years rather than the 14-month period of the average mutual fund.[28] Mellody Hobson serves as the president of the company.[29]
The growth of his company has been steady. He founded the firm in July 1983 with $10,000, which he turned into $23,170 by the end of February 1984.[30][31] He had financial backing from his mother and other friends and relatives.[31] The Ariel fund became public on November 6, 1986.[32] In November 2000, he had 41 employees.[11] In February 2002, the company had 51 employees and more than 120 institutional clients (including United Airlines, ChevronTexaco, and the California State Teachers' Retirement System),[9] which grew to include institutional clients such as Wal-Mart and PepsiCo by April 2005.[22] The company has over 100 employees as of 2008.[30] In 2008, the company changed its name to Ariel Investments, LLC.[33]
Rogers also has served on the boards of directors of other publicly traded Chicago-based corporations, including Exelon,[34] and Bally Total Fitness Corporation, where he was named lead director.[35]
Rogers has been a regular contributor to Forbes for many years and online archives of his commentaries go back as far as 2001.[5] He provides regular personal finance commentaries in a column that has recently been appearing under the title "The Patient Investor".[36][37][38]
Public service[edit]




Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez (center) speaks at a press conference at Chicago's Center for Economic Progress. Rogers is on the far right.


On February 23, 2008, Rogers became the first African-American winner of a Woodrow Wilson Award from Princeton University for his service to the Princeton alumni community, the Chicago community, the African American community and the financial community.[39][12] In 1994, Time featured him as one of its 50 leaders under 40.[40] Rogers is co-chairman of Jesse Jackson's annual Wall Street Project minority conference, chairman of the Chicago Urban League, a member of four corporate boards and was a leading campaigner for Princeton basketball legend and United States Senator Bill Bradley's 2000 United States presidential campaign.[9] Three of the boards he serves on are for Fortune 500 companies: Aon Corporation, Exelon Corporation and McDonald's.[41] He is a trustee of the University of Chicago. He has served numerous civic, educational and arts organizations as a director or trustee, including the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the Oprah Winfrey Foundation and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.[12] At Princeton, he was a trustee of the University from 1990 to 1994 and more recently has served as a member of the Association of Black Princeton Alumni (ABPA) and the Princeton Varsity Club board of directors, as well as the Alumni Schools Committee.[12] In the early 1990s, Rogers served as a fundraising leader in Project Vote voter registration efforts led by current United States President Barack Obama.[12] He has been an advocate for greater diversity in upper-level corporate positions.[42]
Rogers and his company were part of a network of community partners that supported the Ariel Community Academy, which emphasizes financial literacy in its curriculum.[12] Rogers donates both time and money to the academy: he has designed curricula and brings students to board meetings. As a result of his money and time investment 80% of the eighth-grade graduates from the academy are accepted at elite area high schools.[28] Rogers adopted a class of 40 sixth graders at a cost of $200,000 per year through the "I Have A Dream Foundation". He expected to pay for college for about 30 of the students.[40]
He was part of the inner circle of the Barack Obama presidential campaign.[6] He is a long-time Obama associate who serves as the co-chair of Obama's Illinois finance committee and who has been a major fundraiser for Democratic Party candidates.[43] He served along with Bill Daley, Pat Ryan, Penny Pritzker and Julianna Smoot on Barack Obama 2009 presidential inauguration committee.[7] In June 2009, Rogers became chairman of the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools' board.[10]
Legacy[edit]
Since late December 2011, the basketball court in the main competition gym at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools has been named after Rogers. Rogers graduated from and played basketball himself at University High School. His name was printed on the floor during Winter Break of the 2011-12 school year, and the court's new title will officially be adopted on February 8, 2012, in a ceremony corresponding with U-High's home game against conference rival Northridge Prep.[44]

Rogers was raised in the Hyde Park community area of Chicago's South Side, and graduated from the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools in 1976.[9][10] At the age of 12 his father started giving him dividend-paying stocks.[9] He went to college at Princeton University, where he used his free time to glean market information at his local stock brokerage and where he was influenced by Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street.[9]
He was a college basketball teammate of Craig Robinson,[9] and he served as captain of the 1979–80 Ivy League co-champion Princeton Tigers men's basketball team.[4] He had a habit of perusing business journals and calling his broker from stadium payphones.[11] Rogers credits Pete Carril, his basketball coach, as his greatest college influence because Carril stressed precision and teamwork.[11]
Rogers studied economics at Princeton.[11][12] After graduating in 1980, he worked for William Blair & Company in Chicago. A few years later, and with the financial backing of family and friends, he opened his own firm, starting with the Municipal Employees' Annuity & Benefit Fund of Chicago as his first account.[9]
Family[edit]
He is the only son of Jewel Lafontant and John Rogers, Sr.[9] His mother Jewel was the first African American woman to graduate from the University of Chicago Law School in 1946.[13] She became a prominent Republican lawyer,[9] and she nominated Richard Nixon, who won the Republican Party Presidential Nomination, at the 1960 Republican National Convention.[11] His father was a Tuskegee airman pilot with over 100 combat missions of service during World War II and an eventual Cook County judge for twenty years.[9][11] His parents divorced in 1961 and his mother died in 1997.[9] Rogers was three years old when his parents divorced.[11] He had a daughter, Victoria, with his former wife Desirée Rogers.[9]
One of Rogers' great-grandfathers owned the Stratford Hotel in Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma, known as The Black Wall Street. The hotel was destroyed in the Tulsa race riot. Rogers helped finance Before They Die!, a documentary detailing some survivor accounts, and made a brief appearance in the film.[14]
On December 28, 2002, Rogers married Sharon Fairley who was also a divorcee.[15] At the time of her 2002 wedding announcement in The New York Times, Fairley, who is also a Princeton alumna, was the Executive Director of Consumer Marketing and Trademark Development at Pharmacia.[15] Currently, Fairley is the City of Chicago's new leader for the Independent Police Review Authority, which investigates police-involved shootings.[16] Previously, she worked for Chicago's Office of the Inspector General as First Deputy Inspector General and General Counsel and as an Assistant United States Attorney in Chicago for eight years.[17][18][19]
Personal life[edit]
Rogers has a special overnight delivery subscription with BusinessWeek that is delivered via Federal Express so it is received a day earlier than the regular public.[9] He still does not use computers or e-mail.[9] Rogers is known for wearing gray pinstripe business suits to work.[9] On the basketball court, he wears black-rimmed goggles.[11][20]
Rogers also has a publicly disclosed set of habits. He has had a diet, which includes on average more than one meal a day from McDonald's at least since college.[9] He only eats simple familiar foods and will return an order because a vegetable touched his meat.[9] His family's long-time (over 40 years) housekeeper, claims that he buys things such as shaving cream and deodorant in sixes and that he changes his toothbrush every other week.[9] He collects teddy bears (especially Winnie the Pooh).[9]
Three-on-three basketball has been a continuing part of his life. As of 2000, he had a team with the second and fourth all-time leading scorers at Princeton, Kit Mueller (class of 1991) and Robinson (1983) and the school's second leading three point shooter Sean Jackson (1992). Between 1996 and 2000 his team had won 12 of 17 tournaments that they had entered.[11] He scored the game-winning basket of Chicago's three-on-three basketball tournament on a team with Arne Duncan, Robinson, and Kit Mueller.[9] Rogers and Robinson were among those invited to practice with Michael Jordan as he prepared for his comeback.[21] He claims to be the first person to have beaten Jordan in a game of one-on-one at one of his fantasy basketball camps.[22][23] Among the witnesses to the victory, which was reported in Sports Illustrated, were John Thompson Jr., Mike Krzyzewski and fellow fantasy participant Damon Wayans.[20]
Ariel Capital Management/Ariel Investments, LLC[edit]
Rogers was one of the hot stock pickers of the 1980s.[24] Rogers uses a value investing strategy, which has been a problem at times when growth stocks have been the better-performing investment class.[9][24][25] However, his firm and its mutual funds have often been among the industry performance leaders and have on average outperformed the market.[24][25][26] He eschews investing in new companies or making investments in companies that have no track record.[22] For example, rather than invest in AIDS-related stocks, he would prefer to invest in hospitals that treat AIDS victims.[27] His typical holding period is four or five years rather than the 14-month period of the average mutual fund.[28] Mellody Hobson serves as the president of the company.[29]
The growth of his company has been steady. He founded the firm in July 1983 with $10,000, which he turned into $23,170 by the end of February 1984.[30][31] He had financial backing from his mother and other friends and relatives.[31] The Ariel fund became public on November 6, 1986.[32] In November 2000, he had 41 employees.[11] In February 2002, the company had 51 employees and more than 120 institutional clients (including United Airlines, ChevronTexaco, and the California State Teachers' Retirement System),[9] which grew to include institutional clients such as Wal-Mart and PepsiCo by April 2005.[22] The company has over 100 employees as of 2008.[30] In 2008, the company changed its name to Ariel Investments, LLC.[33]
Rogers also has served on the boards of directors of other publicly traded Chicago-based corporations, including Exelon,[34] and Bally Total Fitness Corporation, where he was named lead director.[35]
Rogers has been a regular contributor to Forbes for many years and online archives of his commentaries go back as far as 2001.[5] He provides regular personal finance commentaries in a column that has recently been appearing under the title "The Patient Investor".[36][37][38]

He has served numerous civic, educational and arts organizations as a director or trustee, including the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the Oprah Winfrey Foundation and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.[12] At Princeton, he was a trustee of the University from 1990 to 1994 and more recently has served as a member of the Association of Black Princeton Alumni (ABPA) and the Princeton Varsity Club board of directors, as well as the Alumni Schools Committee.[12] In the early 1990s, Rogers served as a fundraising leader in Project Vote voter registration efforts led by current United States President Barack Obama.[12] He has been an advocate for greater diversity in upper-level corporate positions.[42]
Rogers and his company were part of a network of community partners that supported the Ariel Community Academy, which emphasizes financial literacy in its curriculum.[12] Rogers donates both time and money to the academy: he has designed curricula and brings students to board meetings. As a result of his money and time investment 80% of the eighth-grade graduates from the academy are accepted at elite area high schools.[28] Rogers adopted a class of 40 sixth graders at a cost of $200,000 per year through the "I Have A Dream Foundation". He expected to pay for college for about 30 of the students.[40]
He was part of the inner circle of the Barack Obama presidential campaign.[6] He is a long-time Obama associate who serves as the co-chair of Obama's Illinois finance committee and who has been a major fundraiser for Democratic Party candidates.[43] He served along with Bill Daley, Pat Ryan, Penny Pritzker and Julianna Smoot on Barack Obama 2009 presidential inauguration committee.[7] In June 2009, Rogers became chairman of the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools' board.[10]

John Washington Rogers Jr. (born March 31, 1958) is an investor who founded Ariel Capital Management (now Ariel Investments, LLC)[1] in 1983.[2] He is chairman and CEO of the company,[3] which is the United States' largest minority-run mutual fund firm.[4] He has been a regular contributor to Forbes magazine for most of the last decade.[5] Active in the 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign, Rogers was a leader of the 2009 Inauguration committee.[6][7]
Rogers was appointed as the Board President of the Chicago Park District for six years in the 1990s.[8][9] He has also was appointed as board member to several companies, as a leader of several organizations affiliated with his collegiate alma mater, and as a leader in youth education in his native Chicago. In 2007, Rogers was honored with the Woodrow Wilson Award from Princeton University for the breadth and depth of his service to many organizations. While a student at Princeton, he was captain of the 1979–80 Ivy League co-champion Princeton Tigers men's basketball team.[4]

Background[edit]
Rogers was raised in the Hyde Park community area of Chicago's South Side, and graduated from the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools in 1976.[9][10] At the age of 12 his father started giving him dividend-paying stocks.[9] He went to college at Princeton University, where he used his free time to glean market information at his local stock brokerage and where he was influenced by Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street.[9]
He was a college basketball teammate of Craig Robinson,[9] and he served as captain of the 1979–80 Ivy League co-champion Princeton Tigers men's basketball team.[4] He had a habit of perusing business journals and calling his broker from stadium payphones.[11] Rogers credits Pete Carril, his basketball coach, as his greatest college influence because Carril stressed precision and teamwork.[11]
Rogers studied economics at Princeton.[11][12] After graduating in 1980, he worked for William Blair & Company in Chicago. A few years later, and with the financial backing of family and friends, he opened his own firm, starting with the Municipal Employees' Annuity & Benefit Fund of Chicago as his first account.[9]
Family[edit]
He is the only son of Jewel Lafontant and John Rogers, Sr.[9] His mother Jewel was the first African American woman to graduate from the University of Chicago Law School in 1946.[13] She became a prominent Republican lawyer,[9] and she nominated Richard Nixon, who won the Republican Party Presidential Nomination, at the 1960 Republican National Convention.[11] His father was a Tuskegee airman pilot with over 100 combat missions of service during World War II and an eventual Cook County judge for twenty years.[9][11] His parents divorced in 1961 and his mother died in 1997.[9] Rogers was three years old when his parents divorced.[11] He had a daughter, Victoria, with his former wife Desirée Rogers.[9]
One of Rogers' great-grandfathers owned the Stratford Hotel in Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma, known as The Black Wall Street. The hotel was destroyed in the Tulsa race riot. Rogers helped finance Before They Die!, a documentary detailing some survivor accounts, and made a brief appearance in the film.[14]
On December 28, 2002, Rogers married Sharon Fairley who was also a divorcee.[15] At the time of her 2002 wedding announcement in The New York Times, Fairley, who is also a Princeton alumna, was the Executive Director of Consumer Marketing and Trademark Development at Pharmacia.[15] Currently, Fairley is the City of Chicago's new leader for the Independent Police Review Authority, which investigates police-involved shootings.[16] Previously, she worked for Chicago's Office of the Inspector General as First Deputy Inspector General and General Counsel and as an Assistant United States Attorney in Chicago for eight years.[17][18][19]
Personal life[edit]
Rogers has a special overnight delivery subscription with BusinessWeek that is delivered via Federal Express so it is received a day earlier than the regular public.[9] He still does not use computers or e-mail.[9] Rogers is known for wearing gray pinstripe business suits to work.[9] On the basketball court, he wears black-rimmed goggles.[11][20]
Rogers also has a publicly disclosed set of habits. He has had a diet, which includes on average more than one meal a day from McDonald's at least since college.[9] He only eats simple familiar foods and will return an order because a vegetable touched his meat.[9] His family's long-time (over 40 years) housekeeper, claims that he buys things such as shaving cream and deodorant in sixes and that he changes his toothbrush every other week.[9] He collects teddy bears (especially Winnie the Pooh).[9]
Three-on-three basketball has been a continuing part of his life. As of 2000, he had a team with the second and fourth all-time leading scorers at Princeton, Kit Mueller (class of 1991) and Robinson (1983) and the school's second leading three point shooter Sean Jackson (1992). Between 1996 and 2000 his team had won 12 of 17 tournaments that they had entered.[11] He scored the game-winning basket of Chicago's three-on-three basketball tournament on a team with Arne Duncan, Robinson, and Kit Mueller.[9] Rogers and Robinson were among those invited to practice with Michael Jordan as he prepared for his comeback.[21] He claims to be the first person to have beaten Jordan in a game of one-on-one at one of his fantasy basketball camps.[22][23] Among the witnesses to the victory, which was reported in Sports Illustrated, were John Thompson Jr., Mike Krzyzewski and fellow fantasy participant Damon Wayans.[20]
Ariel Capital Management/Ariel Investments, LLC[edit]
Rogers was one of the hot stock pickers of the 1980s.[24] Rogers uses a value investing strategy, which has been a problem at times when growth stocks have been the better-performing investment class.[9][24][25] However, his firm and its mutual funds have often been among the industry performance leaders and have on average outperformed the market.[24][25][26] He eschews investing in new companies or making investments in companies that have no track record.[22] For example, rather than invest in AIDS-related stocks, he would prefer to invest in hospitals that treat AIDS victims.[27] His typical holding period is four or five years rather than the 14-month period of the average mutual fund.[28] Mellody Hobson serves as the president of the company.[29]
The growth of his company has been steady. He founded the firm in July 1983 with $10,000, which he turned into $23,170 by the end of February 1984.[30][31] He had financial backing from his mother and other friends and relatives.[31] The Ariel fund became public on November 6, 1986.[32] In November 2000, he had 41 employees.[11] In February 2002, the company had 51 employees and more than 120 institutional clients (including United Airlines, ChevronTexaco, and the California State Teachers' Retirement System),[9] which grew to include institutional clients such as Wal-Mart and PepsiCo by April 2005.[22] The company has over 100 employees as of 2008.[30] In 2008, the company changed its name to Ariel Investments, LLC.[33]
Rogers also has served on the boards of directors of other publicly traded Chicago-based corporations, including Exelon,[34] and Bally Total Fitness Corporation, where he was named lead director.[35]
Rogers has been a regular contributor to Forbes for many years and online archives of his commentaries go back as far as 2001.[5] He provides regular personal finance commentaries in a column that has recently been appearing under the title "The Patient Investor".[36][37][38]
Public service[edit]

On February 23, 2008, Rogers became the first African-American winner of a Woodrow Wilson Award from Princeton University for his service to the Princeton alumni community, the Chicago community, the African American community and the financial community.[39][12] In 1994, Time featured him as one of its 50 leaders under 40.[40] Rogers is co-chairman of Jesse Jackson's annual Wall Street Project minority conference, chairman of the Chicago Urban League, a member of four corporate boards and was a leading campaigner for Princeton basketball legend and United States Senator Bill Bradley's 2000 United States presidential campaign.[9] Three of the boards he serves on are for Fortune 500 companies: Aon Corporation, Exelon Corporation and McDonald's.[41] He is a trustee of the University of Chicago. He has served numerous civic, educational and arts organizations as a director or trustee, including the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the Oprah Winfrey Foundation and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.[12] At Princeton, he was a trustee of the University from 1990 to 1994 and more recently has served as a member of the Association of Black Princeton Alumni (ABPA) and the Princeton Varsity Club board of directors, as well as the Alumni Schools Committee.[12] In the early 1990s, Rogers served as a fundraising leader in Project Vote voter registration efforts led by current United States President Barack Obama.[12] He has been an advocate for greater diversity in upper-level corporate positions.[42]
Rogers and his company were part of a network of community partners that supported the Ariel Community Academy, which emphasizes financial literacy in its curriculum.[12] Rogers donates both time and money to the academy: he has designed curricula and brings students to board meetings. As a result of his money and time investment 80% of the eighth-grade graduates from the academy are accepted at elite area high schools.[28] Rogers adopted a class of 40 sixth graders at a cost of $200,000 per year through the "I Have A Dream Foundation". He expected to pay for college for about 30 of the students.[40]
He was part of the inner circle of the Barack Obama presidential campaign.[6] He is a long-time Obama associate who serves as the co-chair of Obama's Illinois finance committee and who has been a major fundraiser for Democratic Party candidates.[43] He served along with Bill Daley, Pat Ryan, Penny Pritzker and Julianna Smoot on Barack Obama 2009 presidential inauguration committee.[7] In June 2009, Rogers became chairman of the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools' board.[10]
Legacy[edit]
Since late December 2011, the basketball court in the main competition gym at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools has been named after Rogers. Rogers graduated from and played basketball himself at University High School. His name was printed on the floor during Winter Break of the 2011-12 school year, and the court's new title will officially be adopted on February 8, 2012, in a ceremony corresponding with U-High's home game against conference rival Northridge Prep.[44]

Background[edit]
Rogers was raised in the Hyde Park community area of Chicago's South Side, and graduated from the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools in 1976.[9][10] At the age of 12 his father started giving him dividend-paying stocks.[9] He went to college at Princeton University, where he used his free time to glean market information at his local stock brokerage and where he was influenced by Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street.[9]
He was a college basketball teammate of Craig Robinson,[9] and he served as captain of the 1979–80 Ivy League co-champion Princeton Tigers men's basketball team.[4] He had a habit of perusing business journals and calling his broker from stadium payphones.[11] Rogers credits Pete Carril, his basketball coach, as his greatest college influence because Carril stressed precision and teamwork.[11]
Rogers studied economics at Princeton.[11][12] After graduating in 1980, he worked for William Blair & Company in Chicago. A few years later, and with the financial backing of family and friends, he opened his own firm, starting with the Municipal Employees' Annuity & Benefit Fund of Chicago as his first account.[9]
Family[edit]
He is the only son of Jewel Lafontant and John Rogers, Sr.[9] His mother Jewel was the first African American woman to graduate from the University of Chicago Law School in 1946.[13] She became a prominent Republican lawyer,[9] and she nominated Richard Nixon, who won the Republican Party Presidential Nomination, at the 1960 Republican National Convention.[11] His father was a Tuskegee airman pilot with over 100 combat missions of service during World War II and an eventual Cook County judge for twenty years.[9][11] His parents divorced in 1961 and his mother died in 1997.[9] Rogers was three years old when his parents divorced.[11] He had a daughter, Victoria, with his former wife Desirée Rogers.[9]
One of Rogers' great-grandfathers owned the Stratford Hotel in Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma, known as The Black Wall Street. The hotel was destroyed in the Tulsa race riot. Rogers helped finance Before They Die!, a documentary detailing some survivor accounts, and made a brief appearance in the film.[14]
On December 28, 2002, Rogers married Sharon Fairley who was also a divorcee.[15] At the time of her 2002 wedding announcement in The New York Times, Fairley, who is also a Princeton alumna, was the Executive Director of Consumer Marketing and Trademark Development at Pharmacia.[15] Currently, Fairley is the City of Chicago's new leader for the Independent Police Review Authority, which investigates police-involved shootings.[16] Previously, she worked for Chicago's Office of the Inspector General as First Deputy Inspector General and General Counsel and as an Assistant United States Attorney in Chicago for eight years.[17][18][19]
Personal life[edit]
Rogers has a special overnight delivery subscription with BusinessWeek that is delivered via Federal Express so it is received a day earlier than the regular public.[9] He still does not use computers or e-mail.[9] Rogers is known for wearing gray pinstripe business suits to work.[9] On the basketball court, he wears black-rimmed goggles.[11][20]
Rogers also has a publicly disclosed set of habits. He has had a diet, which includes on average more than one meal a day from McDonald's at least since college.[9] He only eats simple familiar foods and will return an order because a vegetable touched his meat.[9] His family's long-time (over 40 years) housekeeper, claims that he buys things such as shaving cream and deodorant in sixes and that he changes his toothbrush every other week.[9] He collects teddy bears (especially Winnie the Pooh).[9]
Three-on-three basketball has been a continuing part of his life. As of 2000, he had a team with the second and fourth all-time leading scorers at Princeton, Kit Mueller (class of 1991) and Robinson (1983) and the school's second leading three point shooter Sean Jackson (1992). Between 1996 and 2000 his team had won 12 of 17 tournaments that they had entered.[11] He scored the game-winning basket of Chicago's three-on-three basketball tournament on a team with Arne Duncan, Robinson, and Kit Mueller.[9] Rogers and Robinson were among those invited to practice with Michael Jordan as he prepared for his comeback.[21] He claims to be the first person to have beaten Jordan in a game of one-on-one at one of his fantasy basketball camps.[22][23] Among the witnesses to the victory, which was reported in Sports Illustrated, were John Thompson Jr., Mike Krzyzewski and fellow fantasy participant Damon Wayans.[20]
Ariel Capital Management/Ariel Investments, LLC[edit]
Rogers was one of the hot stock pickers of the 1980s.[24] Rogers uses a value investing strategy, which has been a problem at times when growth stocks have been the better-performing investment class.[9][24][25] However, his firm and its mutual funds have often been among the industry performance leaders and have on average outperformed the market.[24][25][26] He eschews investing in new companies or making investments in companies that have no track record.[22] For example, rather than invest in AIDS-related stocks, he would prefer to invest in hospitals that treat AIDS victims.[27] His typical holding period is four or five years rather than the 14-month period of the average mutual fund.[28] Mellody Hobson serves as the president of the company.[29]
The growth of his company has been steady. He founded the firm in July 1983 with $10,000, which he turned into $23,170 by the end of February 1984.[30][31] He had financial backing from his mother and other friends and relatives.[31] The Ariel fund became public on November 6, 1986.[32] In November 2000, he had 41 employees.[11] In February 2002, the company had 51 employees and more than 120 institutional clients (including United Airlines, ChevronTexaco, and the California State Teachers' Retirement System),[9] which grew to include institutional clients such as Wal-Mart and PepsiCo by April 2005.[22] The company has over 100 employees as of 2008.[30] In 2008, the company changed its name to Ariel Investments, LLC.[33]
Rogers also has served on the boards of directors of other publicly traded Chicago-based corporations, including Exelon,[34] and Bally Total Fitness Corporation, where he was named lead director.[35]
Rogers has been a regular contributor to Forbes for many years and online archives of his commentaries go back as far as 2001.[5] He provides regular personal finance commentaries in a column that has recently been appearing under the title "The Patient Investor".[36][37][38]
Public service[edit]

On February 23, 2008, Rogers became the first African-American winner of a Woodrow Wilson Award from Princeton University for his service to the Princeton alumni community, the Chicago community, the African American community and the financial community.[39][12] In 1994, Time featured him as one of its 50 leaders under 40.[40] Rogers is co-chairman of Jesse Jackson's annual Wall Street Project minority conference, chairman of the Chicago Urban League, a member of four corporate boards and was a leading campaigner for Princeton basketball legend and United States Senator Bill Bradley's 2000 United States presidential campaign.[9] Three of the boards he serves on are for Fortune 500 companies: Aon Corporation, Exelon Corporation and McDonald's.[41] He is a trustee of the University of Chicago. He has served numerous civic, educational and arts organizations as a director or trustee, including the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the Oprah Winfrey Foundation and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.[12] At Princeton, he was a trustee of the University from 1990 to 1994 and more recently has served as a member of the Association of Black Princeton Alumni (ABPA) and the Princeton Varsity Club board of directors, as well as the Alumni Schools Committee.[12] In the early 1990s, Rogers served as a fundraising leader in Project Vote voter registration efforts led by current United States President Barack Obama.[12] He has been an advocate for greater diversity in upper-level corporate positions.[42]
Rogers and his company were part of a network of community partners that supported the Ariel Community Academy, which emphasizes financial literacy in its curriculum.[12] Rogers donates both time and money to the academy: he has designed curricula and brings students to board meetings. As a result of his money and time investment 80% of the eighth-grade graduates from the academy are accepted at elite area high schools.[28] Rogers adopted a class of 40 sixth graders at a cost of $200,000 per year through the "I Have A Dream Foundation". He expected to pay for college for about 30 of the students.[40]
He was part of the inner circle of the Barack Obama presidential campaign.[6] He is a long-time Obama associate who serves as the co-chair of Obama's Illinois finance committee and who has been a major fundraiser for Democratic Party candidates.[43] He served along with Bill Daley, Pat Ryan, Penny Pritzker and Julianna Smoot on Barack Obama 2009 presidential inauguration committee.[7] In June 2009, Rogers became chairman of the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools' board.[10]
Legacy[edit]
Since late December 2011, the basketball court in the main competition gym at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools has been named after Rogers. Rogers graduated from and played basketball himself at University High School. His name was printed on the floor during Winter Break of the 2011-12 school year, and the court's new title will officially be adopted on February 8, 2012, in a ceremony corresponding with U-High's home game against conference rival Northridge Prep.[44]

He founded the firm in July 1983 with $10,000, which he turned into $23,170 by the end of February 1984.[30][31] He had financial backing from his mother and other friends and relatives.[31] The Ariel fund became public on November 6, 1986.[32] In November 2000, he had 41 employees.[11] In February 2002, the company had 51 employees and more than 120 institutional clients (including United Airlines, ChevronTexaco, and the California State Teachers' Retirement System),[9] which grew to include institutional clients such as Wal-Mart and PepsiCo by April 2005.[22] The company has over 100 employees as of 2008.[30] In 2008, the company changed its name to Ariel Investments, LLC.[33]
Rogers also has served on the boards of directors of other publicly traded Chicago-based corporations, including Exelon,[34] and Bally Total Fitness Corporation, where he was named lead director.[35]
Rogers has been a regular contributor to Forbes for many years and online archives of his commentaries go back as far as 2001.[5] He provides regular personal finance commentaries in a column that has recently been appearing under the title "The Patient Investor".[36][37][38]

On February 23, 2008, Rogers became the first African-American winner of a Woodrow Wilson Award from Princeton University for his service to the Princeton alumni community, the Chicago community, the African American community and the financial community.[39][12] In 1994, Time featured him as one of its 50 leaders under 40.[40] Rogers is co-chairman of Jesse Jackson's annual Wall Street Project minority conference, chairman of the Chicago Urban League, a member of four corporate boards and was a leading campaigner for Princeton basketball legend and United States Senator Bill Bradley's 2000 United States presidential campaign.[9] Three of the boards he serves on are for Fortune 500 companies: Aon Corporation, Exelon Corporation and McDonald's.[41] He is a trustee of the University of Chicago. He has served numerous civic, educational and arts organizations as a director or trustee, including the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the Oprah Winfrey Foundation and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.[12] At Princeton, he was a trustee of the University from 1990 to 1994 and more recently has served as a member of the Association of Black Princeton Alumni (ABPA) and the Princeton Varsity Club board of directors, as well as the Alumni Schools Committee.[12] In the early 1990s, Rogers served as a fundraising leader in Project Vote voter registration efforts led by current United States President Barack Obama.[12] He has been an advocate for greater diversity in upper-level corporate positions.[42]
Rogers and his company were part of a network of community partners that supported the Ariel Community Academy, which emphasizes financial literacy in its curriculum.[12] Rogers donates both time and money to the academy: he has designed curricula and brings students to board meetings. As a result of his money and time investment 80% of the eighth-grade graduates from the academy are accepted at elite area high schools.[28] Rogers adopted a class of 40 sixth graders at a cost of $200,000 per year through the "I Have A Dream Foundation". He expected to pay for college for about 30 of the students.[40]
He was part of the inner circle of the Barack Obama presidential campaign.[6] He is a long-time Obama associate who serves as the co-chair of Obama's Illinois finance committee and who has been a major fundraiser for Democratic Party candidates.[43] He served along with Bill Daley, Pat Ryan, Penny Pritzker and Julianna Smoot on Barack Obama 2009 presidential inauguration committee.[7] In June 2009, Rogers became chairman of the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools' board.[10]
Legacy[edit]
Since late December 2011, the basketball court in the main competition gym at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools has been named after Rogers. Rogers graduated from and played basketball himself at University High School. His name was printed on the floor during Winter Break of the 2011-12 school year, and the court's new title will officially be adopted on February 8, 2012, in a ceremony corresponding with U-High's home game against conference rival Northridge Prep.[44]

Rogers was appointed as the Board President of the Chicago Park District for six years in the 1990s.[8][9] He has also was appointed as board member to several companies, as a leader of several organizations affiliated with his collegiate alma mater, and as a leader in youth education in his native Chicago. In 2007, Rogers was honored with the Woodrow Wilson Award from Princeton University for the breadth and depth of his service to many organizations. While a student at Princeton, he was captain of the 1979–80 Ivy League co-champion Princeton Tigers men's basketball team.[4]

Background[edit]
Rogers was raised in the Hyde Park community area of Chicago's South Side, and graduated from the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools in 1976.[9][10] At the age of 12 his father started giving him dividend-paying stocks.[9] He went to college at Princeton University, where he used his free time to glean market information at his local stock brokerage and where he was influenced by Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street.[9]
He was a college basketball teammate of Craig Robinson,[9] and he served as captain of the 1979–80 Ivy League co-champion Princeton Tigers men's basketball team.[4] He had a habit of perusing business journals and calling his broker from stadium payphones.[11] Rogers credits Pete Carril, his basketball coach, as his greatest college influence because Carril stressed precision and teamwork.[11]
Rogers studied economics at Princeton.[11][12] After graduating in 1980, he worked for William Blair & Company in Chicago. A few years later, and with the financial backing of family and friends, he opened his own firm, starting with the Municipal Employees' Annuity & Benefit Fund of Chicago as his first account.[9]
Family[edit]
He is the only son of Jewel Lafontant and John Rogers, Sr.[9] His mother Jewel was the first African American woman to graduate from the University of Chicago Law School in 1946.[13] She became a prominent Republican lawyer,[9] and she nominated Richard Nixon, who won the Republican Party Presidential Nomination, at the 1960 Republican National Convention.[11] His father was a Tuskegee airman pilot with over 100 combat missions of service during World War II and an eventual Cook County judge for twenty years.[9][11] His parents divorced in 1961 and his mother died in 1997.[9] Rogers was three years old when his parents divorced.[11] He had a daughter, Victoria, with his former wife Desirée Rogers.[9]
One of Rogers' great-grandfathers owned the Stratford Hotel in Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma, known as The Black Wall Street. The hotel was destroyed in the Tulsa race riot. Rogers helped finance Before They Die!, a documentary detailing some survivor accounts, and made a brief appearance in the film.[14]
On December 28, 2002, Rogers married Sharon Fairley who was also a divorcee.[15] At the time of her 2002 wedding announcement in The New York Times, Fairley, who is also a Princeton alumna, was the Executive Director of Consumer Marketing and Trademark Development at Pharmacia.[15] Currently, Fairley is the City of Chicago's new leader for the Independent Police Review Authority, which investigates police-involved shootings.[16] Previously, she worked for Chicago's Office of the Inspector General as First Deputy Inspector General and General Counsel and as an Assistant United States Attorney in Chicago for eight years.[17][18][19]
Personal life[edit]
Rogers has a special overnight delivery subscription with BusinessWeek that is delivered via Federal Express so it is received a day earlier than the regular public.[9] He still does not use computers or e-mail.[9] Rogers is known for wearing gray pinstripe business suits to work.[9] On the basketball court, he wears black-rimmed goggles.[11][20]
Rogers also has a publicly disclosed set of habits. He has had a diet, which includes on average more than one meal a day from McDonald's at least since college.[9] He only eats simple familiar foods and will return an order because a vegetable touched his meat.[9] His family's long-time (over 40 years) housekeeper, claims that he buys things such as shaving cream and deodorant in sixes and that he changes his toothbrush every other week.[9] He collects teddy bears (especially Winnie the Pooh).[9]
Three-on-three basketball has been a continuing part of his life. As of 2000, he had a team with the second and fourth all-time leading scorers at Princeton, Kit Mueller (class of 1991) and Robinson (1983) and the school's second leading three point shooter Sean Jackson (1992). Between 1996 and 2000 his team had won 12 of 17 tournaments that they had entered.[11] He scored the game-winning basket of Chicago's three-on-three basketball tournament on a team with Arne Duncan, Robinson, and Kit Mueller.[9] Rogers and Robinson were among those invited to practice with Michael Jordan as he prepared for his comeback.[21] He claims to be the first person to have beaten Jordan in a game of one-on-one at one of his fantasy basketball camps.[22][23] Among the witnesses to the victory, which was reported in Sports Illustrated, were John Thompson Jr., Mike Krzyzewski and fellow fantasy participant Damon Wayans.[20]
Ariel Capital Management/Ariel Investments, LLC[edit]
Rogers was one of the hot stock pickers of the 1980s.[24] Rogers uses a value investing strategy, which has been a problem at times when growth stocks have been the better-performing investment class.[9][24][25] However, his firm and its mutual funds have often been among the industry performance leaders and have on average outperformed the market.[24][25][26] He eschews investing in new companies or making investments in companies that have no track record.[22] For example, rather than invest in AIDS-related stocks, he would prefer to invest in hospitals that treat AIDS victims.[27] His typical holding period is four or five years rather than the 14-month period of the average mutual fund.[28] Mellody Hobson serves as the president of the company.[29]
The growth of his company has been steady. He founded the firm in July 1983 with $10,000, which he turned into $23,170 by the end of February 1984.[30][31] He had financial backing from his mother and other friends and relatives.[31] The Ariel fund became public on November 6, 1986.[32] In November 2000, he had 41 employees.[11] In February 2002, the company had 51 employees and more than 120 institutional clients (including United Airlines, ChevronTexaco, and the California State Teachers' Retirement System),[9] which grew to include institutional clients such as Wal-Mart and PepsiCo by April 2005.[22] The company has over 100 employees as of 2008.[30] In 2008, the company changed its name to Ariel Investments, LLC.[33]
Rogers also has served on the boards of directors of other publicly traded Chicago-based corporations, including Exelon,[34] and Bally Total Fitness Corporation, where he was named lead director.[35]
Rogers has been a regular contributor to Forbes for many years and online archives of his commentaries go back as far as 2001.[5] He provides regular personal finance commentaries in a column that has recently been appearing under the title "The Patient Investor".[36][37][38]

Sources
Once his father gave him shares of stock as a 12th birthday gift, John W. Rogers, Jr., was hooked on Wall Street. He secured the services of his own broker at age 18 and four years later, in 1980, became a broker himself. Raising $180,000 from family and friends, Rogers started his own investment firm, Ariel Capital Management, with one other employee in 1983. By 1992 Ariel had 16 employees, managed nearly $2 billion for individuals, corporations, university endowments, and some of the nation’s largest public and private pension funds, and was one of the largest black-owned investment firms in the country. In addition, Rogers created the only two mutual funds in the United States managed by African Americans.


Rogers was born into a prominent Chicago family in 1958. His mother, Jewel Lafontant, senior partner in a Chicago law firm and longtime figure in national Republican politics, was named ambassador-at-large and U.S. coordinator for refugee affairs by President George Bush in 1989. John Sr., a circuit court judge, instilled early business sense in his son by giving him shares of stock as Christmas and birthday gifts and allowing him a checking account where he could deposit the dividends and his allowance.
Except for one bounced check, John Jr. learned his early financial lessons well. Soon he was following the newspaper stock tables and watching the stock ticker prices race along the bottom of the television screen on Chicago’s local business channel. He also spent a lot of time after school in the office of his father’s broker, Stacy Adams, one of the first black stockbrokers in Chicago. At the age of 16, Rogers was hawking hot dogs, peanuts, and soft drinks during White Sox games at Comiskey Park, putting the earnings into more stocks and phoning Adams to check on their progress during his work breaks.
Wall Street Smarts
Rogers graduated from the highly regarded University of Chicago Laboratory School in 1976, the same year he played on the Illinois Class A, All-State Hall of Fame basketball team. Attending Princeton University as an economics major, he quickly found a local broker whose enthusiasm convinced him that he, too, could be successful in the field. While in college, Rogers flew to the West Coast to appear on the Wheel of Fortune, winning $8,600 in prizes that he immediately invested with his broker.

After graduating from Princeton in 1980, Rogers went to work as a stockbroker for William Blair & Company, a Chicago investment banking firm. Besides being the first person hired directly out of college by the company in more than four years, he was the first black professional ever to work at the 400-employee firm.
For Rogers, it was the perfect place to learn his trade. The company had everything under one roof—corporate finance, public finance, trading, money management, mutual funds, and research—and specialized in small-company stocks. With experience and omnivorous reading of financial newsletters, magazines, and investment classics like Security Analysis and A Random Walk Down Wall Street, Rogers quickly began to develop his value-oriented investment strategy.


Less than three years later, at the age of 25, he left William Blair & Company to form Ariel Capital Management, named after the fleet and nearly extinct African and Asian mountain gazelle. Starting with only one major account— $100,000 worth of Howard University’s endowment fund to invest—within six months Rogers and an employee had raised an additional $190,000 in investment capital. From then on Ariel Capital moved nearly as swiftly as its namesake, growing to $45 million in managed assets by 1986.
Family ties helped Rogers’s rapid rise in the financial world. His mother was an early investor and remains part-owner of Ariel. More importantly, her business connections helped open doors. She was a trustee of Howard University, and two other corporations where she served on the board of directors, Revlon and Mobil, later became Ariel clients. The firm also landed such accounts as the retirement funds of city employees in Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, and the District of Columbia. But, connections aside, the bottom line is results. “Our private clients can judge us by just one thing,” Rogers told Forbes, “growth of assets.”
Investing Over the Long Haul
To that end, Rogers quickly perfected a creative but conservative investment style best summed up by Ariel’s motto, borrowed from Aesop’s fable about the tortoise: “Slow and steady wins the race.” His overriding philosophy is one of patience, timing, and making the most out of a down market. Unlike many investors, he has no sophisticated computerized trading programs. Rogers avoids buying into the current “hot” stock trends of any given moment, and he does not look for potential takeover targets with share prices that might quickly jump. Instead, he seeks out lesser-known, undervalued companies that produce quality products, then invests long-term in their stock.
Intensive research is the key to finding these companies. Rogers devotes several hours a day to reading five morning newspapers, nine business magazines, and more than 80 newsletters, including his own entitled The Patient Investor. He likes to concentrate on smaller companies with market capitalization of $50 million to $1 billion and good earnings records that “do one thing very, very well, and have a well-established niche,” he told Financial World. Many of these firms are too small to be followed by the bigger Wall Street investors.
Rogers also looks for companies in currently unpopular industries, companies experiencing a temporary setback in earnings, or companies newly created by spinoffs and asset sales, and he aims to find them before they are discovered by other investors. Other criteria are effective and committed management, a clean, simple, and easily-understood balance sheet, good cash flow, and a low debt-to-capital ratio.
“A lot of our work is really tire kicking,” he explained in Black Enterprise, “going out and visiting the companies, getting to know the employees and management, and talking to the customers, competitors and suppliers. The final judgment is whether there will be long-term demand for that product.” Rogers expects the earnings of the companies he invests in to grow at a consistent 12 percent to 15 percent annually.
There are several types of companies, however, that Rogers never invests in. He stays away from cyclical industries like heavy machinery, steel, and automobiles because of their frequent ups and downs. He avoids all start-up companies, regardless of their business, because they have no track record. Commodity stocks like precious metals, gas, and oil are too volatile for his taste, while trucking, airline, banking, and other recently deregulated industries are, in his mind, still working themselves out in their new environments and, therefore, are not good buys. “We don’t make exceptions,” Rogers said in Changing Times. “We’re very rigid.”
Socially Conscious Investments
Even more important to Rogers is his strict code of socially conscious investing. He will not buy the stock of any company that does business with South Africa. Nor will he invest in defense contractors, nuclear utilities, cigarette manufacturers, and companies that make weapons or harm the environment.
“The principles just make investment sense,” he told Fortune magazine. “Many defense companies are too reliant upon big government contracts. This reliance pressures management into doing unethical things to get and keep those contracts,” he explained. “I don’t own nuclear utilities because I don’t like investing in companies that the courts might put out of business. The same goes for cigarette makers: I don’t want to invest in a business everyone is trying to outlaw.” In fact, when Kraft, one of Rogers’s corporate clients, became a part of tobacco manufacturing giant Philip Morris Companies Inc., he terminated business with them.
Documented Success


Rogers’s patient, disciplined approach has worked. Some of his earlier successes included investments in companies that manufacture toothbrushes, hospital uniforms, desktop stacking trays, plastic binders, baseball cards, and milkshake machines. And he has also been known to take advantage of a down market, investing, for instance, $9 million in Caesar’s World, the hotel and gambling casino firm, when its stock hit a low of $17 per share during the October 1987 stock market crash. By July of 1992 Caesar’s price per share had risen 80 percent.
“Ariel is one of the few managers dealing with the middle-size, unknown, basic-business type of company, and those companies are the ones that have led the [stock market] charge since the crash,” Edward G. Lloyd, former senior vice-president of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF), said in Business Week. The UNCF was one of Rogers’s early clients, joining Ariel in 1984 and seeing its initial investment grow by 140 percent over the next four years.
Rogers claims similar results for his other 50 big-money institutional clients, which have included Chrysler, Ford, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, Pillsbury, Sara Lee, and the Stroh Brewing Company. In fact, from 1987 to 1990 Rogers’s clients saw their total assets rise more than 53 percent, compared to the nearly 29 percent gain posted by Standard & Poor’s index of 500 stocks.
“We were successful during the ’80s because we picked some good, reasonably priced small stocks,” he told Black Enterprise. “We avoided the go-go, glamorous small stocks that soared in 1980 and then plunged by 1985. Instead, we stuck with low-expectation stocks that didn’t go up as much, but also didn’t suffer as much.”
Mutual Funds Attracted Smaller Investors
Ariel’s institutional clients have average investment accounts of $30 million. To attract smaller investors, Rogers organized two mutual funds distributed by Calvert Securities, a Washington, D.C., firm that markets socially responsible investments. The Calvert-Ariel Growth Fund, started in 1986, invests in small companies. From its inception to 1992 the Fund appreciated 15.1 percent annually, growing to $260 million in assets, placing it sixth among 53 small-company funds followed and ranked by Lipper Analytical Services. His newer fund, the Calvert-Ariel Appreciation Fund, buys stock in companies as large as $3 billion. It grew to $140 million and gained 10.7 percent in value annually from its start in 1989 to 1992.
But Rogers’s very success has caused problems and forced a change in the way he prefers investing. So much new money has flooded his firm and his mutual funds that he can no longer specialize in the small-company stocks that made his reputation. Back in 1986, when he managed only $45 million, Rogers could put 5 to 10 percent of Ariel’s total capital in 10 or 20 carefully targeted small companies without disturbing their share price or ending up with too large a percentage of their stock. When their share prices rose, Ariel’s total return appreciated accordingly.
However, as a multibillion-dollar money manager since the early 1990s, Rogers can no longer operate this way. His total assets are too large to permit such a concentrated investment strategy among selected small firms without severely jolting their share price. As a result, he must either scatter his investment portfolio among hundreds of small companies, diluting his overall return, or focus on much larger firms.
Rogers has tried to steer a middle course. Telling Forbes in 1991, “We can’t take on any more new cash and still preserve our focus,” he stopped seeking institutional clients and closed the Calvert-Ariel Growth Fund to new investors. This has allowed him to continue pursuing small companies while simultaneously investing in larger, more well-known firms like Clorox, Hasbro, and the Fleming Companies.
Thoughts on Minority-Owned Businesses
But the spotlight will be on Rogers as he tries to walk this investment tightrope because of the performance standards he has set and the pioneering role model Ariel has become as one of the black leaders in the financial world.


“The fortress of finance was one of the last to give way,” he told Changing Times in 1990, “but not a week goes by without the press reporting the creation of a new firm by minorities.”
Still, only a small fraction of all United States pension assets is managed by firms owned by blacks, women, Hispanics, Asian-Americans, Native Americans, and other minorities. Ariel and W. R. Lazard & Company in New York account for more than $3.2 billion of that amount, nearly half of all the assets managed by black-owned firms.
To maintain this pacesetting status, Rogers continues his workaholic six-day weeks to find the necessary time to keep up with all his managerial duties and research responsibilities. Yet people continue to underestimate him, Justin F. Beckett, senior vice president of NCM Capital Management in Durham, North Carolina, told Black Enterprise. “They see a mild-mannered, soft-spoken person, but he is a pure competitor who is out to win.”

Citation styles

									Encyclopedia.com gives you the ability to cite reference entries and articles according to common styles from the Modern Language Association (MLA), The Chicago Manual of Style, and the American Psychological Association (APA).
								

									Within the “Cite this article” tool, pick a style to see how all available information looks when formatted according to that style.  Then, copy and paste the text into your bibliography or works cited list.
								

									Because each style has its own formatting nuances that evolve over time and not all information is available for every reference entry or article, Encyclopedia.com cannot guarantee each citation it generates.

 John Rogers: Inspiring Black Investors


      by Derek T. Dingle   
      Posted: February 10, 2009 



















A-

John W. Rogers Jr. is a master wealth builder. Only 50, you might think this shrewd fund manager is unworthy of being called an investment legend. But his entrepreneurial roots run deep. In the 1910s, Rogers’ grandfather J.B. Stradford owned a 65-room hotel, a savings and loan firm, and other real estate in Tulsa, Oklahoma — a thriving community dubbed the “Black Wall Street.” During the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921, roughly 10,000 armed whites looted and burned down this early model of black affluence.
Almost a century later, his grandson is one of the most powerful blacks on Wall Street. In 1983, Rogers’ asset management firm, Ariel Capital Management, launched the first family of equity mutual funds managed by African Americans. Along the way, Rogers developed a novel brand of value investing that produced blockbuster returns for millions of institutional and individual investors. And this visionary didn’t stop there. He created the first and only survey, in partnership with Charles Schwab & Co., to compare investing habits of African Americans and whites.
Over the past two decades, Rogers has boosted his clients’ net worth through a philosophy based on an old Aesop fable: Slow and steady wins the race. That attitude and some rather astute stock picking — identifying out-of-favor or undiscovered small and mid-cap companies that became investment gems — has taken Ariel from a newsletter to the No. 1 firm on the BE ASSET MANAGERS list with more than $16 billion in assets under management. And throughout the years, Rogers has maintained his laser-beam focus on performance.
As of Oct. 31, 2004, his flagship funds, Ariel and Ariel Appreciation, received four-star ratings from Morningstar and gained recognition from Lipper Analytical Services in the areas of capital preservation and total return. As of Sept. 30, 2004, the average annual five-year returns for Ariel Fund and Ariel Appreciation Fund were 14.70% and 11.14%, respectively.
Rogers has been a student of the financial markets since the age of 12. On his birthday, his father converted him into an active investor through the gift of stock. For the next six years, while his friends received the usual birthday and Christmas presents, the budding asset manager obtained securities. By 18, he was fully managing his holdings.
After college, Rogers worked as an analyst for a Chicago brokerage for two years before launching Ariel. Only 24 at the time, he was ready to take the entrepreneurial plunge.
In 1983, he developed a newsletter, The Patient Investor, which described his stock picks, and arranged for several clients to invest $500,000 in the Ariel Fund. By 1986, it had grown to $2 million. Rogers brought on Calvert Group Inc., a financial services company, to serve as the distributor and transfer agent. But eight years later, in a bold move to gain independence, he paid $4 million as part of a separation agreement with Calvert and assumed responsibility for all of the fund’s operations. “We went from managing $2.3 billion to $1.1 billion over a short period of time, and it

John’s passion for investing began at age 12, when his father began buying him stocks as Christmas and birthday gifts. His interest in equities grew at Princeton University, where he majored in economics, and over the two-plus years he worked as a stockbroker for William Blair & Company, LLC. In 1983, John founded Ariel Investments to employ a patient, value strategy in small and medium-size companies. He strongly believes in giving back to Chicago, sitting on the corporate boards of Exelon and McDonald’s, and serving as trustee to the University of Chicago. Additionally, he is a trustee of Rush University Medical Center and a life trustee of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Nationally, John is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a director of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. In 2008, he was awarded Princeton University’s highest honor, the Woodrow Wilson Award, presented each year to the alumnus whose career embodies a commitment to national service. Following the election of President Barack Obama, John served as co-chair for the Presidential Inaugural Committee 2009, and more recently, he joined the Barack Obama Foundation’s Board of Directors. In 2013, John was featured alongside legendary investors Warren Buffett, Sir John Templeton and Benjamin Graham in the distinguished book: The World’s 99 Greatest Investors by Magnus Angenfelt. John received an AB in economics from Princeton University, where he was also captain of the varsity basketball team.

Article excerpt

  ABSTRACT    This article analyzes e-commerce business models and the costs they incur to build brand awareness and customer loyalty. In the new competitive environment of the Internet with lower availability of capital, these costs represent an important area of weakness for new e-commerce ventures. Some firms have been successful in addressing the issue with the technique of "viral marketing." This approach uses personal relationships and referrals to build affinity groups that support and promote new brands without the costly expenditure of traditional media advertising. The approach capitalizes on many of the same dynamics as direct selling and network marketing -- the leveraging of personal relationships and word of mouth recommendations to build customer awareness and loyalty. The article analyzes the parallels between the widely accepted business model of direct selling, particularly as it has been updated during the 1990s into network marketing, and the new model of e-commerce. It suggests opportunities for e-commerce to learn from and incorporate key features of this well-tested approach to building a brand through personal circles of influence.    Introduction    The collapse of the Nasdaq, beginning in the first quarter of 2000, and the subsequent failure of many dot com enterprises, has called into question the validity and substance of the business model that many of these firms used to launch what they trumpeted as the e-commerce revolution. It also raises the larger question of how businesses will realistically exploit the undeniable potential of Internet technology. Traditional retailers can profitably use the Internet as a new channel to build incremental volume.    Mass merchandisers like Walmart and Sears who operate across a broad product range, as well as focused marketers like the Pottery Barn, L. L. Bean and the Gap have all built powerful "click and mortar" business models that supplement and complement sales in stores and mail order. The Internet has also proven to be a powerful tool in supply chain management for firms selling to the corporate B2B market. But the heart of the e-commerce Revolution -- using on line sales to replace traditional marketing channels at a lower cost, with more customization and higher levels of customer convenience -- has not produced a business model that allows firms to translate Internet productivity into profits. Technology empowers consumers with a much broader range of information and gives firms access to more consumers at dramatically lower cost and higher frequency. But, until it generates profits as well as page views, the Internet will not realize its potential to improve lives. No profits, no progress. The quest for a viable e-commerce business model is in full swing.    This paper analyzes the current, first generation business models used in e-commerce, considering them from a micro-economic viewpoint. Why has the rapid growth of on line marketing -- approaching one trillion dollars in the United States and projected to double by 2004 -- generated little or no profit, even for the market leaders? It is necessary to look at the cost of attracting customers and, more importantly, of securing repeat business. The structure of the market, the experience of the first generation firms competing in this market, and the basic cost dynamics are key to uncovering the weakness of this dot com business model. By comparing the dot com experience with other industries where technology has taken off rapidly, and with other marketing plans, the paper seeks to shed light on other approaches to entrepreneurship and business building that may have relevance to e-commerce.    The market structure of the Internet economy approaches the economic model of perfect competition, characterized by low barriers to entry (and exit) with a consequent proliferation of firms and products, rapid diffusion of knowledge to both consumers and competitors, low product or service differentiation and brand loyalty. …

John W. Rogers, Jr. 
Chairman, CEO & Chief Investment Officer 
      Portfolio Manager 


Stocking up for Christmas

John’s passion for investing began at age 12, when his father started buying him stocks, instead of toys, for Christmas and birthdays. At first, John was disappointed. He wanted something he could play with right away. But months later, when the dividend checks started coming in, his obsession with investing was sparked. 
      
By the time John was majoring in Economics at Princeton University, he was an avid investor and enthusiastic follower of the market. He’d also become a skilled basketball player — playing for Princeton’s varsity team under Hall of Fame coach Pete Carril. As captain of the team his senior year, John’s views of entrepreneurship and investing were profoundly shaped by Carril’s courtside philosophy on teamwork, patience and precision. 
      
In 1983, after two-plus years as a stockbroker for William Blair & Company, John founded Ariel Investments. The firm was built on the belief that patient investors are rewarded in the long run and that wealth is best created by investing in quality companies whose true value is realized over time. Ariel's commitment to identifying and realizing long-term value led John to adopt the tortoise — the victor in Aesop's timeless fable — as Ariel's symbol, and the fable's moral — slow and steady wins the race — as its creed. 
      
John’s patient and disciplined approach has resulted in a rare long-term performance track record under a single lead portfolio manager. With time-tested experience, he has guided the firm’s flagship, Ariel Fund, through market highs and lows for the past 30 years. 
      
Knowing first-hand that a passion for investing is a gift — not a given — John wanted to introduce the concept of investing and financial literacy into classrooms. In 1989, he created the Ariel Foundation for this purpose. Today, the Ariel Foundation has evolved into the Ariel Education Initiative, and its primary focus is the Ariel Community Academy and its investment curriculum. John's vision is simple: "We want to help Ariel Community Academy be the best grade school in the city of Chicago. We want to serve as a role model for how other financial services companies can partner with Chicago Public Schools. It's important to invest in our children's futures." 
      
In 2008, John was awarded Princeton University’s highest honor, the Woodrow Wilson Award, presented each year to the alumnus whose career embodies a commitment to national service. In 2013, John was featured alongside legendary investors Warren Buffett, Sir John Templeton and Benjamin Graham in the distinguished book: The World’s 99 Greatest Investors by Magnus Angenfelt. Today, he is regularly featured and quoted in a wide variety of broadcast and print publications and is a contributing columnist to Forbes Magazine. 
      
Under John’s active leadership as CEO and CIO, Ariel Investments has grown over the last 30 years from just 2 employees to a company of 89 with over $10 billion in assets and products spanning the globe. Needless to say, it’s never a surprise to find out what John wants for Christmas.
