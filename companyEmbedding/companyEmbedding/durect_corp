Long-acting InjectablesDURECT’s long-acting injectables are designed to achieve stable delivery of small-molecule and biologic therapeutics for periods of days to months following a single subcutaneous, intramuscular, or other localized injection. Our biocompatible, bioerodible technologies employ varied and customizable sets of components, allowing the formulation to be fine-tuned to suit the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), the physiological environment, and the desired performance characteristics of the commercial product. DURECT scientists are world leaders in the development of sustained-release injectable systems.
DURECT’s long-acting injectable technologies demonstrate the following advantages:

High drug loading—Drug loading as high as 30%, permitting smaller injection volumes 
Controlled onset and release—Rapid onset and stable release of drug over time, with little to no post-injection “burst”
Stabilization—Proteins, peptides, and small molecules can be shielded from water and biologically active enzymes to prolong in vivo activity
Ease of administration—Low viscosity and small volumes for easier, less painful injections
Ease of manufacture—scalable, low-cost manufacturing
Strong patent protection—covered by U.S. and foreign patents

Expanding horizons
DURECT began life in 1998 dedicated to exploiting the benefits of enhanced drug delivery. Our goal was to optimize the physical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties of approved active agents in ways that would solve significant clinical problems. In recent years, we have built upon this significant legacy, expanding our reach to encompass the development of a family of endogenous molecules that are entirely new to pharmaceutical research and that show remarkable promise in a number of important therapeutic areas.Medicines that matter
Whether taking aim at improved drug formulations or bringing to market therapies based on completely novel molecules and avenues of research, the men and women of DURECT strive to fulfill a fundamental promise to patients, physicians, corporate partners, and investors: create best-in-class pharmaceutical products with enduring value—measured most directly by their potential to make real, palpable differences in the lives of those who need them.Restoring well-being
DURECT has now staked out important positions in areas as diverse as pain management, psychiatry, metabolic disease, and acute organ injury. As we pursue our goals, we continue to ask ourselves the following questions: Are the therapies we propose to bring to market products of which we can truly be proud? Are they worthy of the formidable effort required to advance them through the FDA and international approval processes? Will they have a meaningful impact on the outcome that ultimately matters most—the well-being of the individuals treated with them?Our vision

Advance medicine by adhering strictly to strong science
Strive to have multiple approved products on the market
Make a difference in the real world
Be a good clinical and commercial partner
Provide an environment where talented, dedicated people can deliver their best
Be ethical and honest
Aim high and persevere through challenges

Links and Resources









DURECT Corporation is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development of pharmaceutical systems based on its proprietary drug delivery platform technologies to treat chronic debilitating diseases and enable biotechnology products. These platform technologies include the SABER™ Delivery System (a patented and versatile depot injectable useful for proteins, peptides and small molecule delivery), the ORADUR® sustained release oral gel-cap technology (an oral sustained release technology with several potential abuse deterrent properties), the TRANSDUR® transdermal patch technology, the DURIN™ Biodegradable Implant (drug-loaded implant system) and the MICRODUR™ Biodegradable Microparticulates (microspheres injectable system).

		"There are good reasons to believe DURECT Corp.'s upcoming Phase III PERSIST results will be positive and finally pave the road to approval. We forecast Posimir approval/launch in 1H/19 and project FY25 peak unadjusted sales of $381M, yielding $65M in royalties to Durect. . .Posimir�s higher dose of bupivacaine and and longer duration of efficacy relative to Exparel, along with competitive pricing, will enable DURECT to carve a niche with surgeons seeking extended pain relief. We assume a price point of ~$285/treatment, in-line with Exparel. . . .based on our NPV analysis, Posimir contributes $1.18/share to our $3 Target Price valuation."

		"DURECT Corp. is a biopharmaceutical company with a rich development pipeline that includes an epigenetic regulator program and a portfolio of 505(b)(2) programs. . .the  Company  is  focused  on  the  development  of  DUR-928,  an  endogenous  epigenetic regulator  with  potential  in  chronic  liver  diseases,  acute  organ  injury,  and  inflammatory conditions. Durect is also developing Posimir, a long-acting local anesthetic based on the Company�s proprietary SABER technology, for the treatment of post-operative pain."
		
		












  
      Ed Arce, H.C. Wainwright & Co.
  

(6/28/17)

		
		"Early completion of enrollment for PERSIST, at 12% higher enrollment than targeted, has positive implications for Posimir. . .DURECT Corporation announced it has completed patient enrollment into its pivotal Phase 3 trial of Posimir, an investigational extended-release depot utilizing DURECT's patented SABER technology intended to continuously deliver bupivacaine to the surgical site for continuous pain relief for up to three days post surgery. Importantly, we note that while the expected enrollment number for PERSIST was 264 patients, actual enrollment was notably higher, at 296 patients, as a result of rapid enrollment toward the end of the trial."
		
		


















Small-Caps Rushing to Fill the NASH Treatment Pipeline
				(5/24/17)

			    		NASH is an epidemic in the U.S., with more than 100 million people believed to be affected. Yet no FDA-approved treatments are available, with the exception of liver transplantation for end-stage disease. In part two of his interview with The Life Sciences Report, Ed Arce, managing director in equity research and senior analyst covering companies in the biopharmaceuticals and specialty pharmaceuticals sectors for H.C. Wainwright, and organizer of the recent inaugural NASH Investor Conference, says that small companies are rushing to fill the pipeline, with numerous compounds in trials.

		"DURECT Corp. is a company that has an epigenetic regulator. This was something that was done in-house over a number of years. Even though this is quite early, it has a lot of potential because, unlike a lot of companies that will look at preclinical models�often a mouse model or a rat model of NASH�and use that as a basis for moving forward into clinical studies, DURECT has done a very thorough preclinical program with its compound. DURECT looked at all the available preclinical models, not only in rats and mice but, also, in several other species. It has seen very consistent results in both NASH overall, as well as anti-fibrotic effects. So we're very eager to see what the impacts of this could be in the clinic. The company also released encouraging clinical data at EASL last month, in an early Phase 1b study."

		"DURECT Corp. announced a development and commercialization agreement with Sandoz to develop and market in the United States Durect's POSIMIR. . .The company is in discussions with potential partners regarding licensing development and commercialization rights to POSIMIR, for outside the US.  . .we think this is a great deal for Durect. Sandoz has a very strong sales/marketing team and has a great presence in the US. . .Sandoz has a differentiated product portfolio including a range of state-of-the-art technologies, formulations and devices. . .The deal not only boosts Durect s balance sheet, but also validate the company's technology and clinical program."

		"DURECT Corp. announced an exclusive U.S. license and collaboration
agreement with Sandoz AG to develop and commercialize Posimir. . .this deal comes with substantial economics for DURECT as it includes an upfront payment of $20M, and aggregate potential milestone payments of $273M ($43M in development and regulatory milestones in addition to $230M in salesbased milestones) as well as tiered double digit royalties on product sales. . .this deal with a large Pharma partner with strong economics not only eliminates investor uncertainty of whether sufficient financial resources exist to support the full development of DUR-928 but it also provides critical Big Pharma validation of Posimir."

		"DURECT Corp. showed solid progress as they came to impressive terms with Sandoz for development and commercialization of Posimir. . .we don�t believe DRRX could have asked for a better partner as Sandoz has a team of dedicated institutional sales professionals with significant presence in the hospital market. We view the deal as providing important large pharma validation and enabling DRRX to get a substantial up-front non-dilutive funding to help with their other ambitious program, DUR-928. . .DRRX announced their Phase 1b data DUR-928 in NASH at EASL displaying its impressive ability to reduce levels in CK-18, hsCRP, bilirubin, and IL-18 after a single oral dose."

(5/3/17)

		
		"Among DURECT Corp.'s multiple candidates, DUR-928 may be the most promising one in our view because this compound has the potential to target multiple indications including NAFLD/NASH and acute kidney injury. . . Durect presented the updated Phase Ib data at the International Liver Congress 2017. . . DUR-928 was well tolerated overall. There was approximately a 10-30% increase in DUR-928 exposure in NASH patients compared to matched control subjects. . .we continue to be optimistic about Durect's story and reiterate our price target of $6.00 per share based on the progress the company has made in advancing its candidates."
		
		









  Francois Brisebois, Laidlaw & Company

		"DURECT Corp. is one of the many small companies developing drugs with a wide variety of approaches across the fatty liver disease spectrum that do not have partners. . .the eventual market for the complex disease, formally known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is forecast to be $20�$35B. . .estimates for the prevalence of NASH in nations with fatty diets range from 5�20% of the population with up to 15M potentially affected in the United States alone."
		
		









  
      David Sherman, LifeSci Capital
  

(4/23/17)

		
		"As part of our ongoing coverage of the 2017 International Liver Congress. . .we attended multiple poster sessions. . .DURECT Corp. focused on results of a pharmacokinetic study with DUR-928 for the treatment of NASH patients. This was an open-label Phase 1b study that assessed DUR-928 in NASH patients and matched control subjects (MCS). . .data indicate that NASH patients had 10-30% greater drug exposure as compared to MCS, and DUR-928 was well tolerated overall. . .preliminary biomarker data indicate reductions from baseline following dosing of DUR-928 in fCK-18, cCK-18, IL-18, and bilirubin. These data support the ongoing development of DUR-928 for the treatment of NASH, and investigators speculated on the plausibility of a therapeutic effect due to biomarker reductions at approximately 12 hours following dosing."

		"DURECT Corp.'s two Phase III candidates are Posimir and Remoxy. . .the company has initiated a new Phase III PERSIST trial with its clinical candidate Posimir. We estimate top line data will be available soon and the FDA approval will take place in late 2017 or early 2018. . .among the company's multiple candidates, we are especially optimistic about the company's epigenomic regulator program DUR-928, which holds great potential for multiple indications, such as NASH and acute kidney injury. . .our fair value for DURECT is $6.00 per share."
		
		












  
      Jim Molloy, Laidlaw & Company

		"It is the expectation that the Sisyphean development of DURECT Corp.'s Posimir may be drawing to a conclusion. DRRX anticipates completing enrollment in the ongoing Phase 3 trial in 3Q17, which should mean top line data by year end-2017. . .the company will continue to enroll DUR-928 kidney and liver trials and presenting early data gathered to date through 2017. . .DRRX plans to start a Phase 2 trial in an oral formulation for primary sclerosing cholangitis. . .should Posimir read out positively and DUR-928 get out of Phase 1 trials, DRRX is an undervalued story here. We maintain our Buy rating, and our $3 price target."

		"Interest has again focused on NASH, given the Allergan announcements today of its intention to buy both Tobira and privately held Akarna Therapeutics. As I have previously written, NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) is a progressive form of fatty liver disease that is estimated to affect 19 million Americans. . .I am impressed with the very early data on DURECT Corporation's endogenous small molecule, DUR-928.  It may have benefit concerning lipid accumulation, insulin sensitivity, inflammation and fibrosis."

(9/30/16)

		
		"With the recent complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA Remoxy has received its third NDA rejection. . .it would seem that the AD trials (completed years ago) may not be up to the current standards the FDA is looking for. Hopefully, should PTIE re-submit in 2018, additional concerns don�t spur yet another CRL. . .DUR-928 is still expected to read out Phase 1 data in 4Q16 for both liver (NASH) and kidney, and Posimur remains on track for 4Q17 Phase 3 data on post-surgical pain relief."

I was busy buying on Monday as I discussed in my previous letter. . .now I have a full position ahead of the important results of 928 phase 1. If they can show impressive results as they did in the animal trial, major pharma will be jumping in to partner with them big time. . .I invested in DRRX because of the 928, not the pain killer."

(9/27/16)

		
		"The complete response letter (CRL) raised concerns over the abuse-deterrent properties of REMOXY� and the proposed drug labeling, and specified additional trials and data that are needed for approval. We note that this CRL contains a different set of requirements from the previous CRL. . .Management of Pain Therapeutics has indicated a continued commitment to developing REMOXY� through regulatory approval and that a year may be needed to conduct the studies required. . .we
continue to expect positive readouts from DUR-928 trials considering
the drug�s multiple levels of mechanism of action."
		
		









  Len Yaffe, Stoc*Doc Partners 

(9/19/16)

		
		"My positive opinion of DRRX relates to its Phase 1 drug, DUR-928, which is being studied for NASH and acute kidney injury.  This is a high risk/high reward opportunity that if successful, should be worth $30 per share in incremental value (vs analyst estimates of $0.50-$1.00). . .given the current market capitalization of $225 million and the significant upside, I maintain that investment is warranted."

		"The next key catalyst for DURECT Corp. remains the 9/25/16 PDUFA date for Remoxy, an abuse-deterrent, long-acting formulation of OxyContin. DRRX also updated the Phase 3 endpoint for Posimur (post-operative bupivacaine injection), changing the endpoint to pain relief at 48 hrs. (from 72 hrs. previously), which ought to make the comparison vs. placebo easier. . .We continue to see that DRRX has a deep pipeline with multiple near-term catalysts that could drive shareholder value. . .the Remoxy royalty remains the key value driver."

		"DURECT Corporation and Pain Therapeutics announced that the FDA had determined that an Advisory Committee meeting for REMOXY. . .is unnecessary and will not be held. . .this suggests that the efficacy and safety profile of REMOXY has been well presented in the NDA package, from the FDA's perspective, and additional application material is unlikely to be requested. . .REMOXY is likely to secure regulatory approval in September. In the wake of this update and in anticipation of the product's approval near-term, we reiterate our Buy rating and $4 price target."
		
		









  
      Ram Selvaraju, Rodman & Renshaw

		"DURECT Corp.'s DUR-928 is being tested in a Phase 1b trial in NASH patients in Australia. . .a second Phase 1b study of DUR-928 in patients with impaired kidney function is to be initiated soon. . .we expect both trials to report data in 2016. Posimir, the locally-acting controlled-release formulation of bupivacaine for post-operative pain, is in a Phase 3 study. . .we continue to expect positive readouts from both the DUR-928 and the POSIMIR studies."
		
		












  
      Grant Zeng, Zacks Equity Research
  

(5/6/16)

		
		"DURECT Corp. just resubmitted NDA for Remoxy and approval expected to be in 2H/16. A new Phase III for Posimir is underway. We are optimistic about the company's epigenomic regulator DUR-928, which holds great market potential for multiple indications, including NAFLD/NASH and acute kidney injury. Multiple Phase II trials will be initiated in 2016. . . .investors should be focused on the balance sheet and advancement the company has made for its pipeline. . .we think DURECT has made great progress during the first quarter of 2016."
		
		












  
      Ram Selvaraju, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(4/25/16)

		
		"We are initiating coverage of DURECT Corp. with a Buy rating and a 12-month price target of $4/share. In our view, a significant component of the company's future upside potential could come from its epigenomic regulatory program, centered on an endogenous small molecule designated DUR-928. . .the oral formulation of DUR-928 is currently undergoing a Phase 1b trial in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients, with results potentially available by Q2/16E."
		
		












  
      Chen Lin, What Is Chen Buying? What Is Chen Selling?
(4/22/16)

		
		"I bought an initial position in a small-cap biotech today; DURECT Corp. . .the company has something that can be a major breakthrough for mankind. . .DUR-928 works like magic for liver disease and kidney injury, etc. . .DURECT's partner already filed an NDA for a painkiller called Remoxy. . .I want to get a bigger position before the potential Remoxy approval in Q4/16. . .insiders bought significant shares from the market last month at the current price."
		
		












The Life Sciences Report with George Zavoico 

(4/13/16)

		
		"Together with its partner, DURECT Corp., Pain Therapeutics developed a more effective abuse-deterring version of oxycodone, the active ingredient in OxyContin, which continues to be abused in its current form. DURECT's new formulation of oxycodone, called Remoxy (ORADUR-oxycodone), has made it very difficult for abusers to extract the active ingredient to get a concentrated hit of the pill's payload. It's poorly or not at all extracted in alcohol; it turns into a gel; you can't grind it; you can't snort it. . .if Remoxy is demonstrated to have superior abuse-deterrent properties than OxyContin, which emerging evidence suggests it does, then it's likely to capture more of the market. . .depending on sales volume, Durect stands to receive 6% to 11.5% of sales revenue as royalties from Pain Therapeutics."

The Life Sciences Report Interview with Jim Molloy 

(3/16/16)

		
		"DURECT Corp. is one of those names that has gotten caught in the derisking (market decline), and for valid reasons. . .people are looking at DURECT's past, and that is obscuring what could be a transformative 2016/early 2017. The company's key asset, Remoxy (oxycodone), represents $2.50, or more than half, of our $4/share valuation for the company. It's an abuse-deterrent opioid product. . .[Investors] are discounting this product, but perhaps too much at this point. . .it's going back to the FDA for a third time in Q1/16. Remoxy is partnered with Pain Therapeutics; our understanding is that Pain Therapeutics will get Remoxy filed in March, followed by a six-month response time. Pain Therapeutics plans to partner this product with a larger pharma. It is not going to launch Remoxy itself. . .the winds are blowing in Remoxy's favor this go-around. . .I think the increase [in DURECT's share price has been] driven by word getting out that Pain Therapeutics was going to file the Remoxy new drug application (NDA). It's a near-term event now. . ."

		"DURECT Corp. announced positive data from a Phase 1 MAD study of DUR-928 in healthy volunteers. This study evaluated the use of an injectable form of DUR-928 intended to advance as an acute therapeutic, such as acute kidney injury. . .with the completion of this early-stage study in healthy volunteers, the company is poised to move into two patient studies this year slated for commencement in Australia." 
		
		









  
      Annabel  Samimy, Stifel
  

(11/18/15)

		
		"The Phase 3 PERSIST study of DURECT Corp.'s Posimir in 300
patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) is underway. . .and positive animal data is giving hope to DUR-928. . .as partnered programs continue to advance."
		
		












  
      Jim Molloy, Laidlaw & Company
  

(11/3/15)

		
		"DURECT Corp. reported a Q3/15 last night after the close in line with our expectations. The company has begun recruiting patients for the pivotal Phase 3 trial for Posimir (formerly Posidur), which is still expected to take at least one year, with results in H1/17. Management indicates that partnering interest remains high for this product, and a licensing deal remains a very real possibility. . .REMOXY remains on track for FDA filing Q1/16." 
		
		












  Grant Zeng, Zacks Small-Cap Research 

(11/3/15)

		
		"DURECT Corp. just initiated a new Phase 3 trial with Posidur this fall designed to satisfy the U.S. FDA's request for additional information. Another late-stage candidate, REMOXY, will be filed for NDA in Q1/16 by its partner Pain Therapeutics Inc. We are especially optimistic about the company's lead epigenomic regulator program, DUR-928, which holds great market potential for multiple indications, such as for the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and acute kidney injury. We continue to be positive about the DURECT story and give the company shares a Buy rating."
		
		












  
      Jim Molloy, Laidlaw & Company
  

(9/30/15)

		
		"We recently spent time with the management of DURECT Corp. and we come away incrementally more positive on the name, as the company is sitting on two late-stage assets that both target large markets and are trading at a significant discount to fair value, in our opinion. . .we reiterate our Buy rating and our $4/share price target."
		
		












  Grant Zeng, Zacks Small-Cap Research 

(9/8/15)

		
		"DURECT Corp. will conduct a new Phase 3 trial with Posidur this fall designed to satisfy the U.S. FDA's request for additional information. Another late-stage candidate, REMOXY, will be filed for NDA in Q1/16 by its partner Pain Therapeutics Inc. . .given that the above Phase 3 trial will compare Posidur to placebo and not an active control, we believe the efficacy endpoint in the above is likely a slam-dunk." 
		
		












  
      Jim Molloy, Laidlaw & Company
  

(8/21/15)

		
		"We are initiating coverage of DURECT Corp. with a Buy rating and a $4/share price target. . .the company is developing DUR-928, a Phase 1 epigenomic regulator that has shown promising preclinical signals in acute and chronic liver injuries including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which is one of the hottest areas of investigation currently. While there's still a long way to go, DUR-928 could prove to be a 'sleeper' compound at DURECT."

					Full Description



Durect Corporation, incorporated on February 6, 1998, is a biopharmaceutical company with research and development programs. The Company's research and development programs fall into two categories: new chemical entities derived from its Epigenomic Regulator Program, in which the Company attempts to discover and develop molecules, which have not previously been approved and marketed as therapeutics, and Drug Delivery Programs, in which the Company applies its formulation expertise and technologies to active pharmaceutical ingredients whose safety and efficacy have previously been established but which the Company focuses to improve through a new formulation. The Company's products candidates include DUR-928, oral for metabolic/lipid disorders, and DUR-928, injectable for acute organ injuries. Its other product candidates include POSIMIR (controlled release injection of bupivacaine), REMOXY (oral controlled release oxycodone), ORADUR-ADHD, ELADUR (controlled release injection of bupivicane), Relday (risperidone), ORADUR-based opioid (hydromorphone) and SABER-based ophthalmic.The Company's ALZET product line consists of miniature, implantable osmotic pumps and accessories used for experimental research in mice, rats and other laboratory animals. ALZET pumps continuously deliver drugs, hormones and other test agents at controlled rates from 1 day to 6 weeks without the need for external connections, frequent handling or repeated dosing. In laboratory research, these infusion pumps can be used for systemic administration when implanted under the skin or in the body. The Company designs, develops and manufactures a range of standard and custom biodegradable polymers based on lactide, glycolide and caprolactone under the LACTEL brand for pharmaceutical and medical device clients for use as raw materials in their products. These materials are manufactured and sold by it directly from its facility in Alabama, and are used by it and its third-party customers for a range of controlled-release and medical-device applications.The Company also manufactures and sells osmotic pumps used in laboratory research and design; and develops and manufactures a range of standard and custom biodegradable polymers and excipients for pharmaceutical and medical device clients for use as raw materials in their products. Its product pipeline consists of over seven investigational drug candidates in clinical development, with one program the subject of a New Drug Application (NDA) with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Company has other programs underway in fields outside of pain management, including central nervous system disorders, acute organ injury, metabolic disorders, ophthalmic conditions, and other chronic diseases. Its bioerodible injectable depot systems include its SABER and CLOUD platform technologies.POSIMIR (SABER-Bupivacaine)The Company is developing POSIMIR, an extended-release formulation of bupivacaine, using its SABER delivery system for the treatment of post-surgical pain. Bupivacaine is an off-patent pharmaceutical agent. The physician would administer POSIMIR at the time of surgery to the surgical site. This formulation is designed to provide extended analgesia from a single dose. Its POSIMIR clinical development program has been devised to establish the safety and efficacy of POSIMIR for the treatment of post-surgical pain for over three days.REMOXY (ORADUR-Oxycodone)REMOXY is an oral, long-acting oxycodone gelatin capsule under development with Pain Therapeutics to which the Company has licensed development and commercialization rights under a development and license agreement, across the world.ORADUR-ADHD ProgramThe Company is developing ORADUR-ADHD, based on its ORADUR Technology for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This drug candidate is focused on providing once-a-day dosing with added tamper resistant characteristics to address common methods of abuse and misuse of these types of drugs.ELADUR (TRANSDUR-Bupivacaine)The Company's transdermal bupivacaine patch (ELADUR) is under development. ELADUR is focused on providing continuous delivery of bupivacaine for over three days from a single application, as compared to a wearing time limited to over 10 hours with available lidocaine patches.ReldayRelday is being developed to address unmet clinical needs in this large patient population. Relday is generally safe and well-tolerated, with results consistent with the profile of risperidone and the previous Phase I single-dose clinical trial.Additional ORADUR-Opioid ProductsThe Company also worked with Pain Therapeutics on the development of over three additional ORADUR abuse-resistant opioid drug candidates, which would address the chronic pain market. Phase I clinical trials have been conducted for over two of these ORADUR-based products (hydrocodone and hydromorphone).The Company competes with Alkermes, Pacira, Immune Pharmaceuticals, Innocoll, Nektar, Kimberly-Clark, Acorda Therapeutics, Flamel, Alexza, Mallinckrodt, Hospira, Pfizer, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals, Egalet, Acura, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Phosphagenics, Intellipharmaceutics, Collegium Pharmaceutical and Heron Therapeutics.
