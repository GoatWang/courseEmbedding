New York, NY - June 9, 2017 - InvestorsHub NewsWire - HempAmericana Inc. (OTCPK:HMPQ) is excited to announce that it has received it’s first orders through the newly developed ecommerce platform, http://www.hempamericana.net where consumers and shareholders can find several proprietary, holistic, supplements offered by HempAmericana. These hemp-based products provide an array of health benefits including blood sugar regulation, blood pressure control, pain relief and energy boosts. HempAmericana is focused on efforts to explore additional innovative hemp products in the market.

HempAmericana is actively negotiating joint ventures and licensing agreements for its unique extraction machine. Domestic CBD producers have expressed interest in developing exclusive relationships with HempAmericana to take advantage of its exceptional CO2 extraction technology. “We hope to solidify a long term partnership with a reputable producer in the extraction space” said Mr. Rosillo, HMPQ CEO. “This has been a prime focus of management over the past quarter, capitalizing on this lucrative opportunity will provide a strong boost to our top line numbers this year”.

An update from counsel on the progress of our RegA+ has reassured HempAmericana that it is in the final stages of approval with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Despite the elongated qualification process, we still have a firm indication of interest from Blackbridge Capital. They have been behind the company since the inception of this offering. In anticipation of fresh operating capital, the company is positioning itself for explosive growth and is eager to expand its footprint in the hemp arena.

The above figures represent only estimated costs for the next 24 months. If
necessary, Salvador Rosillo, our President, CEO and director, has verbally
agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. Also,
these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be
sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and
quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when/if our common stocks become
eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Salvador Rosillo
will not be repaid from the proceeds of this offering by the Company. There is
no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Salvador Rosillo.
Salvador Rosillo will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we
generate revenues to pay the obligation.


Currently, there are a number of other companies that are in the cannabis or 
hemp industry, all of which we consider to be our competition. Many of these 
companies provide hemp based products. One such competitor is “Bambu” that 
provides rolling papers made from hemp based material. In addition, the 
principal competitor that HempAmericana recognizes is Hemp Inc. Hemp Inc. is 
pursuing the potential uses of industrial hemp in much the same ways as 
HempAmericana. They also see the future possibilities of industrial hemp and 
will most likely be our primary competition for some time.

In the future HempAmericana fully expects that other companies will recognize 
the value of hemp and enter into the marketplace as competitors.


Company Description
HempAmericana, Inc. is a developmental stage company that plans to research,
develop and sell products made of industrial hemp. The company plans to make a
wide variety of products out of hemp and hemp-based materials along with
supplementary goods. This includes, but is not limited to, hempcrete


 (hemp-based
concrete), hemp bags, hemp seeds for consumption, hemp clothing and hemp rolling
paper. HempAmericana plans to fill the growing need and demand for hemp-based
products within the United States through aggressive marketing and by ensuring
that a number of major retailers stock products created by HempAmericana. The
company plans to follow all Federal regulations and statutes pertinent to the
sale of hemp-based goods. HempAmericana does not intend to import or export any
products containing THC. In the United States today the U.S. Customs Service has
a “zero tolerance standard” for the importation of industrial hemp. What this
means is that a product can not have any potentially dangerous substances
contained in it or it will be considered adulterated and unfit for human
consumption, and thus illegal to possess or use per U.S. Federal Law. In 2001
the DEA elaborated on this and clarified that any product with any quantity of
THC in it at all can not be imported into the United States. Since no hemp based
products containing THC are legally permitted in the United States such products
with THC are not allowed to be exported out of the United States either. Because
of the strict laws that exist with the U.S. importation and exportation of
industrial hemp products our business could be adversely affected and even if
our products contain no THC there exists the possibility that any hemp-based
products could be deemed illegal if a change in law were to occur. There are no
foreign countries, to our knowledge, that have laws which could negatively
effect the importation or exportation of our hemp based products since they will
not contain any THC.

Currently, the company does not have a supplier for raw materials, although it
is in communication with the Yasheng Group of China to forge an agreement for
the purchase of these materials. Regardless of the supplier HempAmericana will
be purchasing products and raw materials from overseas and subsequently selling
them throughout the United States. HempAmericana plans to either purchase or
rent storage space for excess goods. The company plans to receive orders for set
amounts of goods from the companies that will stock their products. When an
order is placed HempAmericana will acquire that specific amount of goods and
then go about having the order filled and delivered. This delivery will be
accomplished through the rental of trucks from companies such as Penske, U-Haul
and by freight when travelling overseas. At this time HempAmericana does not
have any legal obligations or definitive arrangements with any transportation or
shipping companies. Currently, the company has no product line and no products
for sale as of April 7, 2014.
