Elk Creek Project Virtual Tour
See this video of a virtual tour of NioCorp's proposed Elk Creek Superalloy Materials Project. 

 
NioCorp is developing North America's only niobium / scandium / titanium project. Located near Elk Creek, Nebraska, the Elk Creek Project is the highest grade niobium project in North America, as well as the largest prospective producer of scandium in the world.  These elements are unique and valuable superalloy materials that are strategic and critical to many industries and national defense technologies.
NioCorp has released the results of the Elk Creek Feasibility Study, which you can see here. The Feasibility Study shows anticipated production of 7,055 tonnes per annum (tpa) of Ferroniobium, 103 tpa of Scandium Trioxide, and 11,445 tpa of Titanium Dioxide over its 32-year operating life. The Elk Creek Project is estimated to have pre-tax Net Present Value (NPV) of US$2.3 billion, with a pre-tax Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 24.3%, and to generate gross Life Of Mine (“LOM”) revenue of $17.6 billion, with operating margin of $12.2 billion. These economics were calculated using an 8% discount rate.

Home / Elk Creek, Nebraska Niobium Project
















                                                            Elk Creek, Nebraska Niobium Project                                                  


NioCorp acquired the Elk Creek project in South East Nebraska on May 4th 2010. The Elk Creek project is a former Molycorp project. Molycorp left in the early 1990's when they left all of their exploration projects to focus on their Mountain Pass project in California. Over the past few decades Niobium demand and prices have increased several fold, which is why NioCorp has taken up where Molycorp left off.  WIth the limited number of niobium producers (3) and the dominant market share of CBMM Niobium prices are very stable and averaging $42 in 2013.
Based on current forecasts Niobium demand is going to surpass the supply capacity from the 3 existing producers.  All 3 (CBMM, Anglo American and IAMGOLD's Niobec) of the current producers are expanding production as they enjoy healthy profit margins from their Niobium operations. Despite this increase in production from the three producers, the possibility of demand outstripping supply by the end of the decade remains, opening the doors for additional production to fulfill market needs.
NioCorp's Elk Creek Niobium deposit is the only primary Niobium deposit in the US, and is the highest-grade, large-tonnage undeveloped deposit in North America.

NioCorp issued over 2.96mls units at 65 cents a throw and the proceeds will be used for general working capital purposes



 

Nebraska landscape








NioCorp Developments Ltd (TSE:NB) has brought in a total of  C$1,925,625 from its previously announced private placing.

	It issued over 2.96mls units at 65 cents a throw and the proceeds will be used for general working capital purposes and to advance its Elk Creek superalloy materials project in Nebraska.

	Each unit consisted  of one Niocorp share and one warrant.

	Each warrant entitles the bearer to buy one Niocorp share for 79 cents at any time 48 months following the completion of the offering.

	Niocorp's project in southeast Nebraska aims to  produce niobium, scandium and titanium. The company is valued at C$166.54mln.

	The feasibility study slated a pre-tax net present value (NPV) of Elk Creek at US$2.3bn at an 8% discount rate, with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 24.3%.

	The post-tax NPV was pitched at US$1.7bn, with an IRR of 21.7%.

	With a projected life of mine (LOM) of 32 years, the gross LOM revenue was put at US$17.6bn, with an operating margin of US$12.2bn.

	NioCorp shares in Toronto stand at 65 cents.

        [NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWSWIRES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES]
      

CENTENNIAL, Colo. (July 26, 2017) - NioCorp Developments Ltd. ('NioCorp' or the 'Company') (TSX:NB) (OTCQX:NIOBF ) (FRANKFURT:BR3) announces that it has closed its previously announced brokered private placement (the 'Private Placement') of units (the 'Units') of the Company. Under the Private Placement, a total of 2,962,500 units (the 'Units') were issued at a price per Unit of C$0.65, for total gross proceeds to the Company of approximately C$1,925,625.
      

        Each Unit issued pursuant to the Private Placement consists of one common share in the capital of the Company (a 'Common Share') and one Common Share purchase warrant (a 'Warrant'). Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one additional Common Share at a price of C$0.79 until July 26, 2021 (a 'Warrant Share').
      

        The Private Placement was led by Mackie Research Capital Corporation (the 'Agent'). In connection with the Private Placement, the Company paid the Agent an aggregate cash commission of approximately C$125,166, equal to six and a half per cent (6.5%) of the gross proceeds raised under the Private Placement. The Company also issued to the Agent 192,562 broker warrants (the 'Broker Warrants'), equal to six and a half per cent (6.5%) of the Units sold pursuant to the Private Placement. Each Broker Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Common Share at a price of C$0.79 until July 26, 2021.
      

        As promptly as practicable following the closing, the Company will prepare and file a registration statement and U.S. preliminary prospectus (collectively, the 'Registration Statement') under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the '1933 Act'), in respect of the Common Shares and Warrant Shares sold under the Private Placement.
      

        Proceeds of the Private Placement will be used for general working capital purposes and to continue to advance the Company's Elk Creek Superalloy Materials Project.
      

        All of the securities sold pursuant to the Private Placement are subject to a four month hold period, which will expire on November 27, 2017, as well as additional restrictions required by the 1933 Act.
      

This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of any of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful, including any of the securities in the United States of America. The securities have not been and will not be registered under the 1933 Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for account or benefit of, U.S. Persons (as defined in Regulation S under the 1933 Act) unless registered under the 1933 Act and applicable state securities laws, or an exemption from such registration requirements is available. Hedging transactions involving these securities may not be conducted unless in compliance with the 1933 Act.


        On Behalf of the Board of Directors,
      

'Mark Smith'

About NioCorp


        NioCorp is developing a superalloy materials project in Southeast Nebraska with an aim to produce Niobium, Scandium, and Titanium. Niobium is used to produce superalloys as well as High Strength, Low Alloy ('HSLA') steel, which is a lighter, stronger steel used in automotive, structural, and pipeline applications. Scandium is a superalloy material that can be combined with Aluminum to make alloys with increased strength and improved corrosion resistance. Scandium also is a critical component of advanced solid oxide fuel cells. Titanium is used in various superalloys and is a key component of pigments used in paper, paint and plastics and is also used for aerospace applications, armor and medical implants.

NioCorp is  advancing a superalloy materials project in southeast Nebraska which will produce chemical elements niobium, scandium and titanium.


 

The US Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), which is chaired by Rebublican Senator John McCain,  has approved legislation requesting a US Department of Defense (DoD) briefing on the potential strategic value of US produced scandium








NioCorp Developments Ltd (TSE:NB) has welcomed US government moves to potentially increase the purchase of critical metals, notably scandium, from American production companies.

	NioCorp is  advancing a superalloy materials project in southeast Nebraska which will produce chemical elements niobium, scandium and titanium.

WATCH - Niocorp's Mark Smith 'very pleased' with Elk Creek feasibility study after completion in record time



	Scandium can be combined with aluminum to make alloys with increased strength and improved corrosion resistance.

	NioCorp plans to produce around 103 tonnes of scandium a year - estimated to exceed total global scandium production by a factor of at least five, and will potentially position the US as the world's leading producer of scandium.

	The US Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), which is chaired by Rebublican Senator John McCain,  has approved legislation requesting a US Department of Defense (DoD) briefing on the potential strategic value of US produced scandium.

	The legislation also "strongly encourages" the DoD to consider entering into commitments to purchase strategic and critical materials from US domestic producers that are not yet in production but which are likely to be so within the next five years.

	Mark A. Smith, executive chairman and chief executive of NioCorp, said: "The committee clearly wants to help the U.S. Defense Department use all of the policy tools in its toolbox to encourage and strengthen supply chains for critical and strategic materials, especially those that can be produced domestically in the U.S.

	"NioCorp looks forward to initiating the first-ever production in the U.S. of ferroniobium, and the first US production of commercial scandium in decades, when our Elk Creek Project comes online."

	Shares in Toronto gained 3.33% to C$0.62 each.

Revenue:  Gross Life Of Mine (“LOM”) revenue of $17.6 billion, with operating margin of $12.2 billion.
CAPEX:  Up-front direct capital costs of $705 million, in addition to indirect costs of $189 million, pre-production capital costs of $85 million, contingency of $109 million, and pre-production net revenue credit of $79 million.
EBITDA:  Averaged Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Interest (“EBITDA”) is $389.6 million per year over LOM.  The averaged EBITDA margin (EBITDA as a percent of total revenue) for the project over LOM is 69.5%.i
Pre-Tax Payback Period Production Onset:  3.4 years (3.7 years after-tax).
Production:  On an annual averaged basis, estimated production and revenues are as follows:-  Ferroniobium (“FeNb”):  annualized production rate of 7,055 tonnes at an averaged realized price of $39.60 per kilogram (“kg”) for contained niobium (65%), yielding annual gross revenue of $183.4 million.-  Scandium Trioxide (“Sc2O3”):  annualized production rate of 103 tonnes at an averaged realized price of $3,675/kg of Sc2O3, yielding annual gross revenue of $378.3 million.-  Titanium Dioxide (“TiO2”): annualized production rate of 11,445 tonnes per year at an averaged realized price of $0.88/kg TiO2, yielding annual gross revenue of $10.1 million.
Production Costs (net of TiO2 byproduct credit):-  $12.14/kg of niobium on a niobium-equivalent basis.-  $1,127/kg of Sc2O3 on a Sc2O3-equivalent basis.
Mine Life:  32 years, producing over the LOM approximately 143,824 tonnes of payable niobium, 3,237 tonnes of Sc2O3, and 359,128 tonnes of TiO2.
Mineral Resources and Reserves:  Probable reserves of 31.7 million tonnes of ore at 0.79% niobium (Nb2O5), 71.6 grams per tonne (g/t) scandium (Sc), and 2.81% TiO2.  Total indicated mineral resources are 90.9 million tonnes at 0.66% Nb2O5, 70 g/t Sc, and 2.59% TiO2, with inferred resources of 133.6 million tonnes at 0.48% Nb2O5, 59 g/t Sc, and 2.23% TiO2.ii  Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of Mineral Reserves.  Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves have an effective date of May 15, 2017.

“After a little more than three years of intense work and detailed independent analysis by dozens of technical experts, the Elk Creek Project feasibility study significantly de-risks this project and positions us to advance to the next stages – project financing and eventual construction start,” said NioCorp Executive Chair and CEO, Mark A. Smith, P.E., Esq.
“The primary goal of any project feasibility study is to de-risk the proposed project such that financing can be obtained,” said Mr. Smith.  “This feasibility study accomplishes that core goal.  Coupled with the fact that we have commitments for 75% of our ferroniobium over the first 10 years – 50% going to ThyssenKrupp Metallurgical Products and 25% going to CMC Cometals of New Jersey – and that we have in hand a major federal government permit, this project is significantly de-risked at this stage.  In particular, it will allow us to continue ongoing discussions with potential institutional investors in Europe and elsewhere, including with the German Government’s loan guarantee program, for which the Elk Creek Project has already received in-principle eligibility.”
“I’m also very proud of the fact that Scott Honan and his team were able to complete this feasibility study in a little over three years,” Mr. Smith said.  “This is particularly impressive given that it typically takes 8-10 years for most other companies in this industry to achieve feasibility status on similar-scaled projects.”

PRODUCTION PLAN
The FS assumes that the facility will produce 7,055 tonnes per year of ferroniobium, 103 tonnes of Sc2O3, and 11,445 tonnes of TiO2, all on an annualized basis.  The following graphs show estimated annual production by commercial product.



OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PROFILE
The following table summarizes assumptions and estimated results from the FS economic model:

The following shows the cumulative LOM pre-tax free cash flow:

ECONOMIC SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The following pre-tax economic sensitivity analyses show potential impacts to NPV and IRR from changes in the pricing of niobium, scandium, and titanium, as well as changes in CAPEX and OPEX.

SUPERALLOY PRODUCTION
The Project is planned as a high-grade underground mining operation using a long-hole stoping mining method and paste backfill.  The Elk Creek mine is planned to operate with a processing rate of 2,762 tonnes per day, for a total of 31.7 million tonnes of ore processed over 32 years of mine life, producing in that period 143,824 tonnes of payable niobium, 3,237 tonnes of scandium (Sc2O3), and 359,128 tonnes of titanium (TiO2).
The process flow sheet at right illustrates a high-level summary of how the facility will convert ore to finished product.

Source: SRK, 2017.  All ﬁgures rounded to reﬂect the relative accuracy of the estimates.  Totals may not sum due to rounding.

SRK has determined that the Project is amenable to a Underground Mining using longhole stoping. Using results from metallurgical test work, suitable underground mining and processing costs, and forecast product pricing SRK has reported the Mineral Reserve at a NSR cut-off of US$180/t
NSR uses the following factors:


Nb2O5: 0.699 is conversion from Nb2O5 to Nb, 1000 is kg conversion, 85.79% is plant recovery, 96% accounts for the loss in the plant, 100% payability, assuming a US$ 38.50/kg selling price.
TiO2: 1000 is kg conversion, 59.9% Ti in TiO2, 40.31% is met recovery, assuming 100% payability, assuming a US$ 0.88/kg is selling price.
Sc: 93.14% is met recovery, 100% payability, US$ 3,500 kg is selling price per kg of scandium oxide, with a conversion of 0.652 for the amount of Sc in Sc2O3


Ore reserves have been stated on the basis of a mine design, mine plan, and cash-flow model.
Mining recovery applied ranges from 94% to 100%.
Mining dilution (internal and external). External stope dilution is 6%, and a portion of the external stope dilution is applied using grade values based on average surrounding block information. A development dilution of 5% is used at a 0% ore grade.

Source: SRK, 2017.  All figures rounded to reﬂect the relative accuracy of the estimates.  Totals may not sum due to rounding.

Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of the Mineral Reserve.  Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All figures are rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimate and have been used to derive sub-totals, totals and weighted averages. Such calculations inherently involve a degree of rounding and consequently introduce a margin of error. Where these occur, SRK does not consider them to be material. All composites have been capped where appropriate.  Historical samples have been validated via re-assay programs, and all drilling completed by Niocorp has been subjected to QA/QC. All composites have been capped where appropriate, and estimates completed using Ordinary Kriging.  The Concession is wholly owned by and exploration is operated by NioCorp Developments Ltd.
The reporting standard adopted for the reporting of the MRE uses the terminology, definitions and guidelines given in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 10, 2014) as required by NI 43-101.
SRK has determined that the Project is amenable to a variety of Underground Mining methods. Using results from metallurgical test work, suitable underground mining and processing costs, and forecast product pricing SRK has reported the Mineral Resource at a NSR cut-off of US$ 180/t.
NSR uses the following factors:


Nb2O5: 0.699 is conversion from Nb2O5 to Nb, 1000 is kg conversion, 85.5% is plant recovery, 0.96 is the loss in the plant, 100% payability, assuming a US$ 38.5 kg selling price.
TiO2: 1000 is kg conversion, 59.8% is metallurgical recovery, assuming 100% payability, assuming a US$ 0.88/kg is selling price.
Sc: 90% is metallurgical recovery, 100% payability, US$ 3,500 kg is selling price per kg of scandium oxide, with a conversion of 0.652 for the amount of Sc in Sc2O3.
Price assumptions for FeNb, Sc2O3, and TiO2 are based upon independent market analyses for each product.


SRK Completed a site inspection of the deposit by Mr. Martin Pittuck, MSc, CEng, MIMMM, an appropriate “independent qualified person” as this term is defined in NI 43-101.

NEXT STEPS

The NI-43-101 Technical Report for the Project is expected to be filed on SEDAR within the next 45 days, and also will be available at www.niocorp.com.
Acceleration of ongoing Project finance efforts, including on the Company’s application for a loan guarantee from the German Government.
Continue conducting due diligence and technical review by the Independent Technical Engineer.
Ongoing efforts to secure necessary government permits for the Project will continue.  Major permits needed prior to the onset of construction start include these:-  SECURED:  U.S. Army Corp of Engineers’ (USACE) Section 404 permit for the Project Waterline (except the outfall section).-  USACE Sections 408 and 404 permits for the Project Waterline outfall section.-  Air construction permit from the State of Nebraska.-  NPDES discharge permit from the State of Nebraska.-  Industrial waste permit from the State of Nebraska for tailings disposal.-  Other permits will be needed for completion of construction.
Continuation of detailed engineering with current firms.
Selection of firms for next phases of Project (e.g., engineering, procurement, construction, and other activities).

	NioCorp Produces High-Purity (99.9%) Scandium Product That
	Meets Purity Specifications for All of its Prospective Customers



	 




	With Elk Creek Feasibility Study Nearly Complete, Company Also
	Announces That It Expects to Release the Study’s Final Results in the Second Calendar Quarter of 2017







	CENTENNIAL, Colo.

	– March 27, 2017 – NioCorp
	Developments Ltd. (“

	NioCorp

	” or the “

	Company

	”) (

	TSX: NB

	;

	OTCQX: NIOBF

	; and

	FSE: BR3)

	is pleased to announce that it has successfully produced high-purity 99.9% commercial grade Scandium Trioxide
	(

	“Scandium”

	) from its Elk Creek, Nebraska resource and that it has finalized plans for the proposed Scandium
	purification circuit to be used at its Elk Creek Superalloy Materials Project (the “

	Project

	” or “

	Elk
	Creek

	”).


	 


	The Company also announced that it anticipates public release of
	the results of its Elk Creek Feasibility Study in the second calendar quarter of 2017. Following the release of the Feasibility
	Study, the Company intends to intensify current efforts to secure government permits and obtain project financing and to prepare
	for the launch of construction operations in Nebraska.

	NioCorp Executive Chairman Mark A. Smith

	comments

	on
	the

	Company’s success in producing a high-purity, commercial grade

	Scandium Trioxide product.


	 


	NioCorp’s successful production of a high-purity commercial grade Scandium, conducted at the SGS Mineral
	Services lab in Lakefield, Ontario,

	is a major milestone
	in its plans to become one of the world’s largest producers of this high-value metal. A 99.9% purity level, otherwise known
	as 3Ns or “three nines” Scandium, meets or exceeds the purity needed for Scandium’s use in virtually all of
	its mainstream commercial applications, including ultra-high-performance aluminum-scandium alloys for the aerospace, automotive,
	and other applications, in the solid oxide fuel cell industry, and in other defense and non-defense applications.

	NioCorp Produces High-Purity (99.9%)
	Scandium Product

	That Meets Purity Specifications for All of its Prospective Customers


	 



	Page 2



	 


	NioCorp’s Scandium product meets or exceeds the purity specifications
	of all potential customers with whom it has been in discussions. The Company will be sending samples of this Scandium product
	to those and other potential customers shortly.


	 


	Independent analysts have estimated that global demand for Scandium
	as an alloying agent in commercial aviation applications alone is potentially more than 300 tonnes/year, while Scandium demand
	by the solid oxide fuel cell industry is expected to grow to between 50-100 tonnes/year.

	1

	NioCorp plans to produce
	97 tonnes/year from its Elk Creek facility at full production, according to the Company’s October 2015 Preliminary Economic
	Assessment.


	 


	“I am very pleased that we have demonstrated
	the ability to produce a high purity, three-nines Scandium product from our Elk Creek resource, and that we have finalized the
	approach we will use to produce this very high-purity and high-value commercial product,” said Mark A. Smith, CEO and Executive
	Chairman of NioCorp. “Except for its final purification steps, Scandium essentially comes along for the ride in our facility
	as we produce our commercial Niobium product. We believe this fact will enable us to be very competitive in Scandium markets and
	will provide us with maximum flexibility in terms of when and where to sell our Scandium and at what price.”


	 


	Finalizing the planned Scandium purification process at Elk Creek
	was one of the last major components needed for NioCorp’s Elk Creek Feasibility Study. To date, feasibility study-level
	engineering design has been completed on the Elk Creek pyrometallurgical plant, mineral processing plant, wastewater treatment
	plant, and various infrastructure systems. Work continues to progress rapidly on the remaining components needed for the Feasibility
	Study, which include: (1) materials characterization for impoundment design and mine backfill purposes; (2) final hydrometallurgical
	engineering; (3) cost estimates from third parties for equipment and systems in the Project; (4) updates to existing market studies
	for planned commercial products; (5) final CAPEX/OPEX estimates for the Project; and (6) final review of the Feasibility Study
	prior to release.


	 


	The Company issued separately a letter to shareholders updating
	them on its progress with the Elk Creek Feasibility Study. This communication is available for downloading

	here

	and on

	www.sedar.ca

	.


	 


	“I am very pleased that, after a lot of hard work by Scott
	Honan and his very capable team, NioCorp is on track to complete a Feasibility Study analysis years faster than many other mining
	companies typically do,” Mark Smith said. “The extra time and attention we elected to invest in the Elk Creek Feasibility
	Study already have delivered substantial potential benefits to the Project, including a significant reduction in our environmental
	footprint, an enhanced ability to produce useful production reagents from material that was once planned for disposal in our tailings
	facility, the elimination of a costly railroad spur line, and a very significant de-risking of the Project from a permitting perspective.
	I very much look forward to detailing the results of the Feasibility Study once its final work elements are completed.”

	Fellow Shareholders –




	 




	As we

	announced earlier today

	,
	our team recently achieved a very big milestone in the Elk Creek Superalloy Materials Project: production of a high-purity (99.9%)
	commercial grade Scandium Trioxide material. This high-purity product should be able to meet the needs of virtually every use
	of Scandium of which we are aware. It meets or exceeds the purity specifications of all of the potential customers with whom we
	have been in discussions regarding future Scandium sales. We are sending samples of Elk Creek Scandium to prospective customers
	shortly.




	 




	Demonstrating our ability to produce
	a commercial Scandium product with a 99.9% purity (known in our business as 3Ns or “three nines” Scandium) is a major
	milestone in our ongoing effort to move the Elk Creek Project forward. Additionally, we have now been able to finalize our plans
	for the Scandium purification circuit to be used in the Elk Creek facility. Locking down the chemical processes we intend to use
	in this circuit was one of the final major elements necessary for completion of the Elk Creek Feasibility Study.




	 




	Now, with our high-purity Scandium
	production capacities proven, we are approaching the finish line for our Feasibility Study (FS). The volume of work that remains
	in the FS is not trivial, to be sure, and it will take a number of weeks to complete. But the most challenging elements of this
	or any mining project FS have been completed and are behind us.

	Scott Honan and his team can now
	confidently predict that we will be able to publicly release our FS results in the second quarter of this calendar year. Thus,
	after more than three years of very hard work by a lot of very experienced and dedicated professionals, we can see a completed
	Elk Creek Project FS on the near-term horizon.

	We made a conscious decision more
	than a year ago to invest extra time and resources into optimizing certain components of the Project, particularly the metallurgical
	processes that are designed to produce our commercial products. While this increased the time to complete the FS beyond our initial
	projections, past experience had shown us that extra effort in this area can yield substantial benefits.




	 




	In short, there are no roadblocks
	to completing the FS and we are engaged in wrapping up the final components now. We are on track to deliver a major mining project
	FS years faster than most exploration-stage companies seeking to develop a project of this magnitude. As you can imagine, I very
	much look forward to sharing with you the results of all of this work.





	 






	What Work Remains
	on the Feasibility Study?





	 




	While we have proceeded with our
	FS on a very rapid pace relative to most other mining companies, watching this process from the sidelines can be like watching
	water boil. Or watching paint dry. You can pick your analogy.

	To help our owners better understand
	what remains to be done in our FS, and what this works involves, I asked the team to construct a list of the final major elements
	that remain. Here is what the team is working on now and is moving to completion:




	 







	Final Remaining
	Tasks for the Elk Creek Feasibility Study







	 







	Materials Characterization for Impoundment Design and Mine Backfill
	Purposes






	 








	We are now analyzing and
	quantifying the physical, geotechnical, environmental, and geochemical properties of our plant tailings and evaluating
	their engineering properties for use as a backfill material in the mine. Testing required in this process involves the
	curing of a range of mixtures of the tailings with cement and or backfill that can take up to 28 days. The properties
	determined during these test programs will drive the capital and operating costs of the backfill system and the surface
	impoundment.







	 







	FS-Level
	Hydrometallurgical Engineering Design







	 






	We have
	now locked down hydrometallurgical process and are working to complete the FS-level process engineering, layout, and cost
	estimating for the hydrometallurgical plant (where we chemically separate and purify scandium, titanium and niobium oxides).  We
	have already completed this work for the pyrometallurgical plant, mineral processing plant, wastewater treatment plant, and
	supporting infrastructure systems.






	 







	Cost
	Estimating







	 






	We are
	securing multiple vendor cost estimates on major equipment and process systems as design engineering for those systems is
	advanced.  This involves providing an FS-level engineering specification to each vendor in order to get an FS-level
	estimate for the cost of each major piece of equipment. These quotes are important in estimating costs of construction, a
	key input to the FS.






	 







	Updates
	to Market Studies for Planned Commercial Products







	 






	Given
	that previously commissioned market studies are more than one year old, we are having these updated.  These updates
	are nearly completed.

	Final
	CAPEX/OPEX Estimates







	 






	Once all
	design engineering, cost estimates, and other inputs are finalized, this data is integrated into the FS Technical Economic
	Model, which will provide project capital expenditures (CAPEX), mining rates, production rates, and operating expenditures
	(OPEX). The model is prepared with a targeted CAPEX and OPEX accuracy of +/-15%.  The model will reflect a detailed
	construction and commissioning schedule for all aspects of the Project.






	 







	Final Remaining
	Tasks for the Elk Creek Feasibility Study


	(cont.)







	 







	Final
	Review of Feasibility Study Prior to Release







	 






	A careful
	review will be conducted of the FS documents to ensure consistency across its many elements and to conduct stress-testing
	of the economic model (which helps us prepare for the process we will go through with institutional investors).






	 







	Public
	Release of Feasibility Study Results and Global Promotion of Findings







	 






	This will
	be done via a news release.  We also will conduct an extensive series of briefings following the news release’s
	dissemination to a wide variety of audiences on the Study’s results, including to residents of southeastern Nebraska
	(via a Town Hall Meeting), existing and new investors, institutional funds and banks, the news media, elected officials and
	regulators, and many others.






	 







	Release
	of Feasibility Study Document







	 






	This is
	required within 45 days of the public release of the FS findings. Release of this document will allow us to kick our Project
	financing campaign into high gear, as these documents provide the technical details that the financial community will want
	to review as we discuss Project financing options.

	The Benefits
	of Our Intense Focus on Metallurgical Process Optimization





	 




	As you may have read in NioCorp
	press releases over the past several months, our decision to spend additional time and energy in an effort to further optimize
	the Elk Creek facility’s metallurgical processes is likely to pay off in several areas, relative to the findings of our
	October 2015 Preliminary Economic Assessment (“Oct. 2015 PEA”). These advances are likely to (1) reduce CAPEX and
	OPEX of certain components of the Project; (2) shrink the Project’s environmental footprint; and (3) streamline our permitting
	process.




	 




	The details of these advances will
	be outlined in our FS. But here is a quick recap of what we can disclose at this point:




	 







	Innovations
	Through Metallurgical Optimization







	 







	Less
	Water




	à




	Smaller Equipment







	 






	Our engineers
	discovered a way to attain high rates of Niobium recovery while using much less water that originally required.  This
	allowed us to reduce the size of a number of major pieces of equipment in our designs for the Niobium recovery and purification
	processes and water management infrastructure.  These size reductions are expected have beneficial impacts to CAPEX
	and OPEX costs for those portions of the plant.






	 







	Recycling
	Some of Our Waste Stream Into Usable Materials







	 






	The team
	engineered a pathway to take significant fractions of the neutralization and acid regeneration solids that we expected to
	produce and convert them into supplies of neutralizing agents and process reagents that we use to make commercial products.  In
	other words, we found a way to recycle some of our planned waste streams and convert them into usable material.

	TSX: NB | OTCQX: NIOBF | FSE: BR3





	 





	 





	Benefits of these Breakthroughs





	 










	ü





	A
	reduction in the size of NioCorp’s planned acid generation plant, which is designed
	to recycle chemical reagents used in the production of commercial products.







	 










	ü





	An
	estimated 60-85% reduction in certain reagent purchases from third parties.







	 










	ü





	An
	estimated 50% reduction in the volumes of neutralization solids and leaching residue
	as compared to that expected to be produced by the processes outlined in our Oct. 2015
	PEA.







	 










	ü





	Lower
	costs associated with the Project’s planned tailings storage facility.







	 










	ü





	Elimination
	of the construction and operation of approximately seven kilometers of a railroad spur
	line and associated rail transport infrastructure for the Project. That advance, coupled
	with other changes we made to the layout of the processing facility, allowed us to reduce
	the overall Project’s estimated impact on wetlands and other federally regulated
	waters to less than 0.5 acres of wetlands and less than 300 feet of contiguous stream
	channel in total. That includes impacts from our planned waterline to the Missouri River.







	 










	ü





	No
	EA or EIS. It now highly likely that the regulatory approval we will need from the U.S.
	Army Corps of Engineers will require neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental
	Impact Statement. Either of those regulatory processes can add many months or years to
	a project like this.

	Next Steps Following
	Release of the FS: Community and Investor Outreach, Project Permitting, Project Finance, and Construction Launch





	 




	Once we publicly release the detailed
	FS documents, we will continue work on and we will kick things into high gear on a number of elements of the Project:




	 








	·





	Community
	and Investor Outreach:

	Soon after we release the high-level findings of the FS, we
	will launch a number of public and investor outreach programs to communicate the results
	from the FS. These will include:






	 








	ü




	A
	conference call with investors from around the globe to walk through the FS’s findings
	and discuss next steps in moving the Project forward.






	 








	ü




	A
	southeast Nebraska Town Hall meeting (to which you certainly are invited) where we will
	walk through the FS and our plans for the Project in extensive detail.






	 








	ü




	Briefings
	to potential customers, downstream industry representatives, public policymakers and
	regulators, and many other current and future stakeholders in the Project.

	·





	Permitting

	:
	We expect to file for and obtain approval this year from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
	(USACE) for a Nationwide Permit under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act that will cover
	both our surface processing facilities and the waterline that we intend to construct
	to the Missouri River. This permitting pathway will require neither an Environmental
	Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement, which is a very big and a very positive
	change from what we had assumed in our October 2015 Preliminary Economic Assessment.
	This more streamlined permitting process was made possible by Scott’s team’s
	ability to reduce our likely impacts on wetlands and other federally regulated waters
	to such low levels that the Project does not require such reviews. This is a direct result
	of spending more time and resources in conducting our FS.





	The USACE permit is the only
	federal permit we need to secure for this Project, which is another aspect of this Project
	that differentiates it from many other mining projects. There are a number of state and
	local permits we are working to secure, and I anticipate success in all of those efforts.







	 








	·





	Project
	Finance:

	The effort to finance the Project will kick into high gear after release of the detailed FS documents. Actually,
	I have been engaged for many months in preliminary discussions with major investment groups across several continents. At this
	stage, I can report that potential investment interest in our Project is high, assuming that our FS findings, prospects for sale
	of our commercial products, and other factors are considered attractive to investors. Institutional investment funds and lenders
	will go through our FS documents in great detail, and they will challenge us on virtually every point of the FS as part of their
	due diligence process.

	Fortunately, we have been through this
	process before and we know what to expect and how to prepare. This is yet another reason
	why it is critically important that a project’s FS be done with great attention
	to detail and accuracy, and by teams who are veterans of this process.





	 












	One major element of our financing package is a potential
	low-interest loan guarantee from the German government through its Untied Loan Program. Because of the fact that we secured a
	commercial offtake agreement for up to 50% of our Ferroniobium with German-based ThyssenKrupp, the Project has received
	in-principle eligibility approval under this program. The next step in this process is to have German loan guarantee program
	officials review our detailed FS documents.






	 








	·





	Construction
	Launch:

	While the launch of construction activities in Nebraska is contingent upon
	many factors – sufficient permitting approvals and sufficient access to capital
	resources, to name two of the biggest – my hope is that we can begin construction
	activities by the end of 2017 or in calendar Q1 of 2018. The expected length of construction
	period and launch of commercial construction will be outlined in detail in our FS. But,
	believe me, I intend for us to push forward on all of these fronts as rapidly as we can.






	 





	Thank You for
	Your Patience and Support





	 




	In summary, I want to thank you
	for your continuing patience and support. 2017 promises to be a momentous year for NioCorp and for the Elk Creek Superalloy Materials
	Project. I look forward to keeping you apprised of developments as they occur. And, as always, feel free to reach out to us with

	Cautionary Note Regarding Mineral
	Resource Estimates





	 




	The Company filed a technical report
	on SEDAR dated October 16, 2015 entitled “Amended NI 43-101 Technical Report - Updated Preliminary Economic Assessment -
	Elk Creek Niobium Project – Nebraska” (the “October 15, 2015 PEA"). This Preliminary Economic Assessment
	is preliminary in nature and it includes a level of engineering precision and assumptions which are currently considered too speculative
	to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable Mineral Resources to be categorized as Mineral Reserves
	as defined in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI
	43-101”) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM”) CIM Definition Standards
	on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended. There is no certainty that the economic estimates
	and projections in the October 2015 PEA will be realized and investors should consider such estimates and projections to be highly
	speculative. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic or legal viability. NioCorp has
	classified NI 43-101 Inferred Mineral Resources and Indicated Mineral Resources at Elk Creek that are disclosed within the Preliminary
	Economic Assessment; however, Inferred Mineral Resources are not included in the mine plan for the October 2015 PEA. The Elk Creek
	Project is exploratory in nature and investors should not assume that Mineral Resources at the Project will ever be converted
	to Mineral Reserves with demonstrated economic and legal viability. The pricing of Scandium is a significant portion of the Project
	revenue, and achieving the revenue projected in the October 2015 PEA is subject to market growth in Scandium, which is a developing
	market with a risk of oversupply and/or undersupply disrupting pricing.

	The Mineral Resource estimates and
	economic assessments in this letter and contained in the October 15, 2015 PEA have been prepared in accordance with the requirements
	of NI 43-101, which differ from the requirements of United States securities laws. The definition for Mineral Reserves differ
	from the definitions in the SEC’s Industry Guide 7 under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Under SEC
	Industry Guide 7 standards, a “final” or “bankable” FS is required to report Mineral Reserves, the three-year
	historical average price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves and the primary environmental analysis
	or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority.




	 




	The terms “mineral resource,”
	“measured mineral resource,” “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource”
	are defined in, and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide
	7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Investors are cautioned
	not to assume that all or any part of a mineral deposit in these categories will ever be converted into mineral reserves. “Inferred
	mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic
	and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher
	category. Under Canadian securities laws and regulations, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility
	or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral
	resource exists or is economically or legally mineable.




	 




	Accordingly, information contained
	in this letter and contained in the October 15, 2015 PEA or incorporated by reference herein or therein contain descriptions of
	our mineral deposits that may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting
	and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.
