Gail’s appointment to the Board greatly benefits Opexa and its shareholders as we position Tovaxin toward its next clinical trial stage of development."
"Opexa is developing an innovative therapy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis that I believe has the potential to bring significant benefits to patients," commented Gail Maderis. "Opexa’s patient-specific therapy brings the power of personalized medicine to MS and has the potential to treat both relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive disease. The Company has positioned itself well as it prepares for its next clinical trial with Tovaxin, and I am looking forward to supporting the senior team and Board in their endeavors and representing the interests of shareholders."

About Opexa
Opexa Therapeutics, Inc. is dedicated to the development of patient-specific cellular therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The Company’s leading therapy, Tovaxin®, is a personalized cellular immunotherapy treatment that is in late stage clinical development for MS. Tovaxin is derived from T-cells isolated from peripheral blood, expanded ex vivo, and reintroduced into the patients via subcutaneous injections. This process triggers a potent immune respons against specific subsets of autoreactive T-cells known to attack myelin and, thereby, reduces the risk of relapse over time.

Industry Expert Brings Significant Expertise to Tovaxin® Clinical Development Program
THE WOODLANDS, TX (November 2, 2011) – Opexa Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: OPXA) today announced the election of Gail J. Maderis to its Board of Directors at its annual meeting of shareholders held on October 27, 2011. Ms. Maderis will Chair the Board’s nominating and corporate governance committee, as well as serve on the Board’s compensation committee.
"We are very pleased to welcome Gail to the Board as she brings a wealth of experience in the healthcare industry as a former senior executive in Genzyme and past CEO of Five Prime Therapeutics," commented Neil K. Warma, President and Chief Executive Officer of Opexa. "Gail’s successful leadership in these companies, including her accomplishments in corporate partnerships and clinical development, will greatly enhance our capabilities at the Board level. Along with her industry knowledge, Gail has acquired an extensive network of contacts related to financing, partnering and support services for the industry in her current position as CEO of BayBio and her advisory role to the National MS Society. Gail’s appointment to the Board greatly benefits Opexa and its shareholders as we position Tovaxin toward its next clinical trial stage of development."
"Opexa is developing an innovative therapy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis that I believe has the potential to bring significant benefits to patients," commented Gail Maderis. "Opexa’s patient-specific therapy brings the power of personalized medicine to MS and has the potential to treat both relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive disease. The Company has positioned itself well as it prepares for its next clinical trial with Tovaxin, and I am looking forward to supporting the senior team and Board in their endeavors and representing the interests of shareholders."
Gail J. Maderis Bio 
Ms. Maderis is President and CEO of BayBio (Bay Area Bioscience Association), an independent, non-profit trade association serving the life sciences industry in Northern California. She was previously President and CEO of FivePrime Therapeutics, Inc., a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of innovative protein and antibody drugs. Prior to this, Ms. Maderis held senior management positions at Genzyme Corporation, including founder and president of Genzyme Molecular Oncology, a publicly traded division of Genzyme, and corporate vice president of Genzyme Corporation. She also is a director of NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and serves on The Mayor's Biotech Advisory Council of San Francisco, as well as the HBS Healthcare Initiative board. 
Along with comprehensive experience in corporate development, Ms. Maderis brings to the Board of Directors extensive involvement in strategic management, a successful track record of working with investors and partners to finance clinical development, deep insight into regulatory and business policy trends impacting the biopharma industry, and a demonstrated understanding of governance issues facing emerging companies.

About Opexa
Opexa Therapeutics, Inc. is dedicated to the development of patient-specific cellular therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The Company’s leading therapy, Tovaxin®, is a personalized cellular immunotherapy treatment that is in late stage clinical development for MS. Tovaxin is derived from T-cells isolated from peripheral blood, expanded ex vivo, and reintroduced into the patients via subcutaneous injections. This process triggers a potent immune respons against specific subsets of autoreactive T-cells known to attack myelin and, thereby, reduces the risk of relapse over time.
