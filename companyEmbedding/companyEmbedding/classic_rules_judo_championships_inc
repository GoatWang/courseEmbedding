(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  When used in this report on Form 10-K, the words "may," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "continue," "estimate," "project," "intend," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect the Company's future plans of operations, business strategy, operating results, and financial position. Persons reviewing this report are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties and that actual results may differ materially from those included within the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Such factors are discussed under the headings "Item 1. Business" and "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and also include general economic factors and conditions that may directly or indirectly impact the Company's financial condition or results of operations.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Moreover, we do not assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of such forward-looking statements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform such statements to actual results.  The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, are based on certain assumptions and expectations which may or may not be valid or actually occur, and which involve various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risks set forth above. In addition, sales and other revenues may not commence and/or continue as anticipated due to delays or otherwise. As a result, the Company's actual results for future periods could differ materially from those anticipated or projected.  Overview  Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. ("We" or the "Company") was originally formed as Blue Ribbon Pyrocool, Inc. a Delaware corporation, on November 16, 2005, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Puritan Financial Group, Inc., a company traded on the Pink OTC Markets, Inc. On March 24, 2008 a majority of the shareholders approved the spin-off of the Company to the shareholders of record as of March, 26, 2008. Subsequent to its formation and prior to being renamed, the Company had no revenues or operations.  Our Company, Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. created a subsidiary which was incorporated in the state of Connecticut called Classic Rules World Judo Championships, Inc. There are no other subsidiaries. On July 15, 2008 the Company executed a Memorandum of Understanding entitled "Management's Global Agreement" (the "MOU") with Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. and Mr. Chris Angle. Under such MOU the Company would change its name and pursue the business of Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc.  We intended to establish and promote tournaments for the sport of classical judo and have, so far, done two tournaments, one in 2010 and one in 2011. The Company has not hosted a tournament since 2011 and has since changed its business to real estate investing and development.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The preparation of the financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Though the Company evaluates the estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, our actual results may differ from these estimates.  Certain of the Company's accounting policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and that require management's subjective judgments are described below to facilitate a better understanding of our business activities. Management bases its judgments on its experience and assumptions which it believes are reasonable and applicable under the circumstances.  Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Classic Rules World Judo Championships, Inc. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Revenue Recognition - The Company has not yet generated revenues from its planned real estate investment activities.

Our auditors have raised, in their current audit report, a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We will be unable to continue as a going concern if we are not able to raise capital and are unsuccessful in securing a business acquisition. Until such time as sufficient capital is raised, we intend to limit expenditures for capital assets and other expense categories.  The Company must currently rely on corporate officers, directors and outside investors in order to meet its budget. If the Company is unable to obtain financing from any of one of these aforementioned sources, the Company would not be able to satisfy its financial obligations. Limited commitments to provide additional funds have been made by management and other shareholders. We cannot provide any assurance that any additional funds will be made available on acceptable terms or at all.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on us.

	INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING DISCLOSURE




	 




	This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Statements in this report that are not historical facts, including statements about management’s beliefs and expectations, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections, and are subject to change based on a number of factors, including those outlined under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and any updated risk factors we include in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events.




	 




	Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following:




	 




	•     risks arising from material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, including material weaknesses in our control environment;




	 




	•     our ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients;




	 




	•     our ability to retain and attract key employees;




	 




	•     risks associated with assumptions we make in connection with our critical accounting estimates;




	 




	•     potential adverse effects if we are required to recognize impairment charges or other adverse accounting-related developments;




	 




	•     potential downgrades in the credit ratings of our securities;




	 




	•     risks associated with the effects of global, national and regional economic and political conditions, including fluctuations in economic growth rates, interest rates and currency exchange rates; and




	 




	•     developments from changes in the regulatory and legal environment for advertising and marketing and communications services companies around the world.




	 




	Investors should carefully consider these factors and the additional risk factors outlined in more detail under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.

	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements




	June 30, 2016




	(Unaudited)




	 




	NOTE A – ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS




	 




	Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 16, 2005 under the name Blue Ribbon Pyrocool, Inc. (“Blue Ribbon”). Blue Ribbon changed its name to Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. ("Classic Rules") on July 15, 2008. Classic Rules formed a subsidiary in the State of Connecticut on August 13, 2008 named Classic Rules World Judo Championships, Inc. to develop an annual judo championship tournament. Collectively the entities are referred to as “the Company”. On June 2, 2014, the Company ceased its principal activities of hosting and sponsoring judo tournaments. The Company currently operates in real estate investment activities focused in the New York City metropolitan area.




	 





	Unaudited Interim Financial Statements





	 




	The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2016, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted for interim financial statement presentation and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statement presentation. They should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management, the financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary to fairly present the financial position as of June 30, 2016 and the results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.




	  





	Principles of Consolidation





	 




	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Classic Rules Judo Championships, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Classic Rules World Judo Championships, Inc. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.







	NOTE B – GOING CONCERN




	 




	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $8,621 and an accumulated deficit of $326,768. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.




	 




	The Company needs to raise additional capital in order to fully develop its business plan. Failure to raise adequate capital and generate adequate revenues could result in the Company having to curtail or cease operations. Additionally, even if the Company does raise sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generate adequate revenues, there can be no assurance that the revenue will be sufficient to enable it to develop business to a level where it will generate profits and adequate cash flows from operations.

	NOTE C – STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT





	 





	Preferred Stock





	 




	The Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. There were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding at June 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.








	Common Stock





	 




	The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. There were 69,322,426 shares issued and outstanding at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.







	 




	NOTE D – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES







	During the third quarter of 2014, the Company identified fraudulent activities entered into by its former CEO who is also a former member of the Board of Directors. The former officer and director of the Company entered into certain employment agreements and convertible notes payable without the proper authorization of the Company or other members of its Board of Directors. The employment agreements and convertible notes payable were entered into during the three months ended June 30, 2014. The Company assessed its potential responsibility for these liabilities entered into and determined it to be remote due to the former officer not having received approval from the Company board of directors to enter into such transactions and the employment agreements and notes being entered into through a fictitious entity with which the Company has no previous or current affiliation with. As such, the impacts of these agreements are not reflected in these financial statements.




	 


	 





	NOTE E – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS







	During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued a total of 50,000,000 shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $30,000 and a subscription receivable of $30,000. Company received $30,000 on October 4, 2016 for this receivable.

	Forward-looking Information




	 




	This Form 10-Q quarterly report includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical facts, included in this Form 10-Q that address activities, events, or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof), business strategy and measures to implement strategy, competitive strength, goals, expansion and growth of our business and operations, plans, references to future success, reference to intentions as to future matters, and other such matters are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," or "continue," or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. These statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors that we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform to our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.




	 




	Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Moreover, we do not assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of such forward-looking statements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform such statements to actual results.

	Item 4.     Controls and Procedures





	 




	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.




	 




	The Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term "disclosure controls and procedures" to mean a company's controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its chief executive and chief financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company maintains such a system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under the SEC's rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to its chief executive and chief financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.




	 




	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date.




	  




	 




	Management's Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	 




	The management of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and related financial information appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The management of the Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A company's internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:




	 







	 





	●






	Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;








	 







	 





	●






	Provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and








	 







	 





	●






	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.








	 




	Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company's disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.




	 




	With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based upon the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, the Company had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, management identified the following material weaknesses at June 30, 2016:






	 





	 






	11










	 






	 








	●






	As of June 30, 2016, there was a lack of accounting personnel with the requisite knowledge of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in the US and the financial reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission.








	 








	●






	As of June 30, 2016, there were insufficient written policies and procedures to insure the correct application of accounting and financial reporting with respect to current requirements of GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.








	 








	●






	As of June 30, 2016, there was a lack of segregation of duties, in that we had only one person performing all accounting-related duties.







	 




	 







	●






	As of June 30, 2016, there were no independent directors and no independent audit committee.








	 




	As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting involving the preparation and reporting of our financial statements presented in conformity with GAAP, were not effective.




	 




	We understand that remediation of material weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls is a continuing work in progress due to the issuance of new standards and promulgations. However, remediation of any known deficiency is among our highest priorities. Our management will periodically assess the progress and sufficiency of our ongoing initiatives and make adjustments as and when practical and necessary.




	 




	This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this quarterly report.




	 




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	 




	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.






	 






	PART II - OTHER INFORMATION




	 






	Item 1.        Legal Proceedings




	 




	From time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be part of the ordinary course of our business. At present, there are no pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or in which any director, officer or affiliate of the Company, any owner of record or beneficially of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of the Company, or security holder is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company. The Company’s property is not the subject of any pending legal proceedings.





	 






	Item 1A.     Risk Factors




	 




	An investment in our shares is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Therefore, you should not invest in our shares unless you are able to bear a loss of your entire investment. You should carefully consider the following factors as well as those set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the other information contained herein before deciding to invest in our shares. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, statements or projections include the risks and uncertainties relating to our business described above. The fact that some of the risk factors may be the same or similar to our past filings, means only that the risks are present in multiple periods. We believe that many of the risks detailed here and in our SEC filings are part of doing business in our industry and will likely be present in all periods reported. The fact that certain risks are endemic to our industry does not lessen the significance of the risk. We urge you to carefully consider the following discussion of risks as well as other information regarding our common stock. This report and statements that we may make from time to time may contain forward-looking information. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations, statements or projections.
