Foamix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Announces Management Changes
Jun 29 17

Mr. Domzalski currently serves as President of Foamix's U.S. subsidiary. He succeeds Dr. Dov Tamarkin as CEO. Dr. Tamarkin will continue to be a member of the company's Board of Directors and will serve as Chief Scientific Advisor to Foamix.

Foamix Pharmaceuticals Ltd Announces Dosing of First Patient in Phase 3 Rosacea Clinical Trials for FMX103 Minocycline Foam 1.5%
Jun 12 17
Foamix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. announced that the first patient has been dosed in its Phase 3 program to evaluate the efficacy and safety of its topical Minocycline Foam 1.5%, FMX103. The Phase 3 program consists of two multi-center studies.  Each study will enroll approximately 750 patients with moderate-to-severe papulopustular rosacea into a 12-week double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase.  This will be followed by a 9-month open-label safety extension phase with the active 1.5% minocycline foam.  Both studies will be conducted at multiple sites throughout the United States.  Patients will be randomized on a 2:1 basis (1.5% minocycline foam vs vehicle) and treated once daily for 12 weeks in the initial double-blind portions of the studies. The primary efficacy endpoints are (1) the proportion of patients achieving success at week 12 based on an Investigator's Global Assessment, and (2) the mean change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts in each treatment group at week 12.  Safety evaluation will include reported adverse events, assessments of tolerability, clinical laboratory tests and vital signs. Patients who complete the 12 weeks of treatment will have the option to continue in a long-term open-label safety extension to evaluate the safety of intermittent use of FMX103 for up to an additional 9 months. Foamix expects to report top-line results from the blinded phase of the clinical trials mid-2018.

FMX102 for Impetigo
Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection that primarily affects young children. It is typically caused by staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA, and results in red sores and lesions on the face, neck, arms and legs. MRSA infections occur in hospitals and healthcare facilities, most commonly in pediatric wards. In the early 1970s, MRSA accounted for only 2% of all staphylococcus aureus hospital-acquired infections. In 2007, it accounted for as much as 70% of these infections, warranting the need for a better treatment.
Topical antibiotic therapy is considered the treatment of choice for individuals with localized impetigo, while systemic antibiotics are used for more widespread disease.  Topical mupirocin (Bactroban®) is the most commonly used product to treat impetigo, with dosing (3) three times daily for 8 to 12 days. 
 
Foamix is developing FMX102, a 1% minocycline foam product candidate for the treatment of impetigo, including cases of impetigo caused by MRSA.  We conducted a seven-day randomized, double-blind Phase II clinical trial of 32 pediatric patients ages two to fifteen with at least two impetigo lesions. Eleven patients had confirmed MRSA infection. Patients receiving FMX102 twice daily experienced an 81.3% success rate in only three days and a 100% success rate in 14 days. Moreover, all MRSA-infected patients were free of the bacteria after seven days of treatment.   FMX102 was well tolerated, with none of the trial participants experiencing any drug-related side effects. Additionally, by treating the infection in as little as three days, FMX102 may effectively limit the transfer of infection from one child to the other.
  
The company plans to initiate Phase III clinical trials with FMX102 pending FDA discussions.
  
Our lead products FMX101, FMX102 and FDX104 are covered by an issued U.S. patent, which is expected to remain in effect until 2030.

FMX103 for Rosacea
Rosacea is a chronic skin disorder that is characterized by facial redness and inflammatory lesions, afflicting an estimated 14 million people in the U.S. alone. There are several drugs currently prescribed for treating rosacea. The most commonly used topical drugs are azelaic acid, and metronidazole.  Oral antibiotics, such as doxycycline and minocycline are also routinely prescribed.  Rosacea lesions and inflammatory acne lesions are dermatologically similar in many ways.  Based on our clinical data of FMX101 for moderate-to-severe acne, we intend to conduct initial clinical trials in the belief that FMX103 will be a safe and effective treatment for rosacea. 
 
Phase II Clinical trial with FMX103 for rosacea is under way.

About Foamix

Foamix is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary, innovative and differentiated topical drugs for dermatological therapy.
 
Our clinical stage product candidates include FMX101, our novel minocycline foam for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne,FMX 103 for the treatment of rosacea,  FMX102 for the treatment of impetigo, and FDX104, our doxycycline foam for the management of acne-like rash, induced by EGFRI anticancer drugs.
 




Minocycline Foam
We are developing a topical formulation of minocycline utilizing our proprietary foam technology platform. Our development program consists of three potential indications that we are pursuing: moderate-to-severe acne, impetigo, and rosacea. 
  
Our phase II results of minocycline foam 4%, applied once-daily, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne, showed greater than a 70% reduction in inflammatory acne lesions. We intend to commence Phase III trials for minocycline foam 4% in the United States in 2016
