Until April 2015, he was the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board of IRIX Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately owned developer and manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients. In addition, Mr. Noetzli was a member of the Board of Synthetech, Inc., a fine chemicals company specializing in organic synthesis, biocatalysis and chiral technologies, from 2004 through 2010. We believe that Mr. Noetzli's extensive experience in the fine chemicals industry, and executive-level experience, as well as the valuable business knowledge he brings regarding the issues facing a board of directors and his service on the Board of the Company since 2002, give him the qualifications and skills to serve as one of our directors. In addition, his broad international experience, coupled with his fluency in 3 languages, adds to the diversity of the Board.
