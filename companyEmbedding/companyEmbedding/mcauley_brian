Listener Questions, Email, and Comments:

Christopher Pickslay – Hey guys-

Love the show and all of your respective channels. I’m planning to build a floating desk and shelves out of a round slab (something like https://www.thelumbershack.com/Tree-Slices-2447/Tree-Slices-Circle-Cut-Lumber-1533/Reclaimed-Maple-Round-Cut-Natural-Edge-Table-Top-Wood-Slab-20719-24788.html). I plan to cut 2 adjoining sides off to use as shelves, and mount the remaining (pie-shaped) piece in the corner of the room.

My question is about surfacing this thing. I don’t have a planer. I have a block plane, but haven’t really used it. The mill will flatten one side, but that adds like $100. Am I going to have trouble planing on the end grain? Maybe I could go at it with my belt sander? Just wondering if I should spring to have the mill flatten it for me.

Thanks,

Christopher

Main Topic (Suggested) – Shop safety while working alone.

Mark Shaw – Hey guys,
First off, love the podcast and each of your YouTube channels. Keep up the great work.
A few weeks ago the Making It post cast briefly touched on the topic of shop safety when working alone, and I was hoping to get your take on this.  I think the same is true for most wood workers and hobbyists that we work alone in our shops and some of us have shops in attached garages. I often worry about what would happen if I had an accident while alone in the shop or if there were to be a shop fire, especially when I am not there.  I have a 2 car attached garage shop.
Do you guys share these concerns, how does it impact the work that you do (avoiding tasks that have risk, stopping when you are tired, asking for help), and what precautions do you take.  I am thinking about first aid kits and being prepared for more than slivers and small cuts and what I should have in there , fire suppression, chemical storage, integrating smoke detectors with ones in the house for earlier warning, method to call for help, wireless IP cameras to keep an eye on the shop, etc.
Thanks!

Brodie Brickey – Really enjoyed the ‘self employed’ episode. During it Brian mentioned a client who kept changing her mind. Ultimately she wasn’t worth his time due to difficultly.

Does anyone have a contract with the client?
–Sign off design & collect x dollars for materials
–% completed collect x dollars
–Finished collect remaining

Here’s the killer:
–change made after design sign off, comes with a change charge.

You set the charge + the add on for hours that it takes.  With this method your client can keep changing their mind all they want you will still get paid.




Matt Thayer – Hey guys. Been loving the show. I still listen to it like its my job.
Anyways Sean regarding the cedar strip canoe they are not as complicated as they look.
I am a 20 year old woodworker that is in between his 1st and 2nd year at the International Yacht Restoration School in Newport Rhode Island. I am in the Wooden Boat Building and Restoration program.
I am currently building a Roubo workbench for a summer project to complete internship hours, and another student is building a cedar strip canoe for his summer project. I have been picking his brain about it knowing you wanted to build one and he has built a couple before this one.
He likes the Bear Mountain Boats plans. Like Nick Offerman and Jimmy DiResta built. They have printed out mold patterns which you just glue on and cut on the band saw.
Like most boats, there is a TON of setup. He made a big strongback to mount the molds on, then you have to make the molds. He is building a 17′ 9″ and he got 20′ western red cedar boards. and I believe he used like 4 or 5 sheets of ply. He is using the bead and cove method, and wood gluing all the edges together then after the strips are laid it gets fiber glassed over. That method is the slow method because you have to clamp each strip and let the glue dry. If you were to brad nail the strips to the molds and glue the seams, you could plank the whole boat very fast. The gunnels, sheer clamps, stems breast hooks, and thwarts are all very straight forward and I don’t think you want me to make this damn email any longer then it already is 🙂
The boat we built in the first year (a 13ish’ single mast carvel planked sail boat) was so much harder to build and a lot of the students had never even touched a hand plane or a chisel before. They are pretty straightforward boats. If you can have the patience to make the bed you made for your daughter and do that kind of inlay, a canoe is a piece of cake.
Again, sorry for the long email and love the show.

Dave Kunkle – Hi guys,

I’ve been an avid listener of your podcast from the beginning and enjoy it very much. I wanted to ask a question. Have you ever built something for a client and not been able to get it into their house or into the room the piece is going? I’m in the process of building an 84 X 48″ dining table and matching bench for a client. What design considerations do you make for fitting through doorways, around corners, etc? Do you build larger pieces of furniture in such a way that they are assembled on site?

My last project was a map cabinet and I’m thankful that I made the bottom detachable because it was about a 1/2″ too wide to fit through the doorway. I had asked the client for the width of his doorway but he measured from the inside of the frame and didn’t allow for the doorstop trim (or whatever it’s called). I don’t want a similar situation with the dining table.

Thanks for any thoughts you have about this. Keep doing what you’re doing! It’s appreciated!

Chad McKamey – 


I have recently started building furniture on the side as extra income/ shop upgrade money. I have had a few large pieces, but mostly Adirondack chairs which are quick and easy. I’m wanting to get into more custom high end pieces using hardwoods and more traditional building methods. The problem is that in my local area people are building big box store lumber pieces for ridiculously low prices (farmhouse table and benches for $500). Their quality is subpar at best, how do I find the clients that are wanting a quality piece and how do I convey my quality to clients so they understand that my product is worth my asking price? Thank you guys for entertaining me every week love the show and what you do for the community.
Many thanks
Chad McKamey

Listener Questions, Email, and Comments:
Robby Wright – Gents, In a recent show, you commented about leaving dust collectors
running because you can damage the motors by starting and stopping them too
much. In my experience as a woodworker, industrial electrician and an
electrical contractor, I suggest that you are only partly right. Most dust
collectors that are 2 HP, maybe 3 HP, and smaller have fairly lightweight
impellers on them. They can be started and stopped frequently without an
issue. Dust collectors with heavy impellers, such as the 5 HP units, have a
heavier startup load and shouldn’t be started as frequently. Frequently is
more than more than 15 times an hour.
I have a 2 HP Taiwanese dust collector that I have used for 15 years now. It
is controlled  by a current sensing circuit that turns the dust collector on
and off any time a monitored tool, such as my table saw, bandsaw, etc., is
turned on or off. In the initial stages of a project, it is not unusual to
start and stop both the table saw and dust collector many times in an hour
and it hasn’t damaged anything in the motor in those 15 years.
Remember that the only parts that can be damaged are the starting switch,
capacitor, windings and bearings in a single phase motor. The starting
switch will wear, but that is normal. The capacitor doesn’t normally wear as
it is engaged for only a few seconds unless the starting switch is welded
shut. The bearings aren’t going to be hurt from this type of starting and
stopping, leaving only the heat in the windings to do damage. As long as the
motor doesn’t overheat, you are good to go. For three phase motors, only
heat needs to be worried about.
When starting, the only real load on the motor is the inertia of the
impeller. The load of the air movement doesn’t occur until the impeller
starts to get up to speed. Even with all gates open, the motor is going to
be running at less than full rating if properly designed. I measured my
motor and it only draws about three-fourths of its rated current, even under
maximum load of my dust collection system. The more gates that are closed,
the less load on the system.
By the way, if anyone is interested in a current sensing controller for your
DC, you can find my article on it in Fine Woodworking, Aug, 2000 or the FWW
on Small Shops book by Taunton Press.
Enjoy your show – keep up the good work.



Nick Hinson – I recently broke my mini lathe (and almost died in the process). I want to get a full sized one now. I’m going to have to go used because I don’t have the moolah to get a new full sized one. This means looking up old lathe model numbers and figuring out which one has what I need and if they’re worth the price they’re listed at. The problem is, I’m not sure I know what all features are needed in a full sized lathe since I’m so used to the tiny bench top one I had. What are some must-haves for you guys in a lathe? Anything that isn’t a must but is super useful to have? Also, any of you guys wanna sell a lathe for cheap? 😉 Thanks guys!

Arron Sparrow – Hey guys,

Love your podcast.  This comment is a few weeks old, so please forgive me.  When you were talking about future builds or pieces you would like to build in the future, one of you mentioned a canoe.  I believe you also talked about how much work a cedar strip canoe would be to build.  I am also a dream builder of canoes, and here is one I might start with for the following reasons:

1. It looks good, in that the above the waterline parts are mostly cedar strips.
2. but the below the waterline parts are plywood.

This seems to be a good compromise between good looks and ease of build.

See an example in the following link:

Keep up the great podcast,

Aaron Sparrow


Stian Johannessen – Hey,
Great podcast you guys, keep up the good work. This is the podcast I look forward to the most during my week.
My question for you guys is, should I now get a cheaper band saw and then see if it works with my workflow, or wait 6-12 months and just buy the better quality one? I have been checking our equivalent of craigslist for the last 4 months, but no good deals there, only overpriced low quality stuff. Been wanting learn how to resaw and use homemade veneer and maybe even use it as a small makeshift mill, as a way to start making my own lumber.P.S:
Since i don’t live in the states, i can’t leave a review there, but here it comes:

Matthew Moore –  Hey guys! First off, I stumbled upon your podcast a couple weeks ago and haven’t been able to stop listening to it since. Keep up the good work.
I have a dilemma that I was hoping for some advice on. I am pretty new to wood working and have been making some cutting boards as well as doing some home projects. So far I have a bunch of hand-me-down stuff from my dad and grandfather which include a Craftsman circular saw, 10” Craftsman single bevel miter saw and some hand planes. I’ve also recently purchased a 13” Delta thickness planer and 6” Pioneer jointer along with some Kreg jigs and a router and table as well as various other tools. For most projects I can get by with what I have however I am a bit of a perfectionist and it kills me when there are tools that could make certain tasks easier and/or more accurate and I don’t have them. So my wife came to me a few days ago and told me that for Father’s Day and my birthday she had enlisted the help of our parents and between them I have $450 to buy some more woodworking tools. I’ve been in the market for a table saw as well as a dust collector and have been scouring Craigslist to try and find something worth buying. Also, my shop is in my basement and is pretty small. 13’ x 12’ at the moment with plans to move one wall back so it will be 13’ x 16’. Which brings me to my questions? Would my money be better spent on a Dust Deputy/Shop Vac type dust collection system rather than a dedicated dust collector and would I be able to do most things with a good track saw rather than spend the money on a table saw that would take up quite a bit of real estate in my shop? I am ripping down sheet goods in my driveway as it is to bring them into my shop through a bulk head so that is where the track saw intrigues me.
Thank you in advance and sorry for being so long winded! Stay dusty my friends!
Cheers!
-Matt

Rob Berger –  Thanks for the great shows. As a new woodworker, I really enjoy them, as well as each of your YouTube channels.
I had an epiphany as I was listening to your last show about Kyle’s veneered globe dream project: when you buy a globe, buy 3 identical globes and make sure they DON’T have any raised topography. Cut the first one like you’re slicing an orange and use it as a template for your veneer slices. Lay them on the second globe as dry fit testing. Cut the third globe in half (or quarters or whatever you want) and use the inside of it as a negative image caul to apply even pressure to the veneer pieces once glued.
Stay dusty,
-Rob Berger
Johnny Tromboukis –  Hey guys,
In reference to Kyle’s dream build (a super awesome globe!), I may have found a solution to the tricky situation of clamping the veneer glue up. What if you split the globe in half and glue on the veneers to each half in your vacuum bag? Then obviously glue the two domes together to get your sphere.
Hope this helps!
Marcin Szczepanski –  Hey dudes,
Thanks for the awesome podcast.  Appreciate your guys’ relaxed style, constant interaction with your audience and even the occasional f-bomb (and by f, I mean FUCK) Ha!
Two questions: just got commissioned to build a large dining table made of Ash (yep, it’ll be a big Ash table).  The top will be 11’L x 50″W and 2″ thick (total of 92BF).  Having always made things of reclaimed wood, this will be my first hardwood order.  With the size in mind, how much Ash would you order for the top taking into consideration waste?
Secondly, the customer wants a weathered/textured finish where you can run your fingers across the top and feel the grain. Normally, with doug-fir, this can easily be done with a wire wheel to give it that texture.  Any suggestions on how I could accomplish this with Ash?  Do any of you have experience media-blasting wood before to weather it?
Anyways, hope this isn’t too long.  Thanks for any help and keep up the great work.
Marcin (pronounced Mar-sin)

Brian McAuley (born 1941) is an American entrepreneur and co-founder of Nextel Communications.[1] [2]
In 1987, McAuley was a cellular executive when he and lawyer Morgan O'Brien founded Fleet Call, a telecom company, in New Jersey.[3] It was renamed Nextel Communications in 1993, and grew rapidly with the support of Motorola, before merging with Sprint Corporation in 2005 for $35 billion.[4] The new company became the third-largest wireless network operator in the United States. McAuley previously served as President and CEO of Nextel Communications for seven years. He also founded Boston-based mobile radio systems operator NeoWorld Communications in 1999, and served as its President and CEO. It was acquired by Nextel for $276 million in 2003.[5]
He is currently chairman of NASDAQ-listed Pacific DataVision, Inc., provider of mobile workforce management solutions.[6] He is also a director for NYSE-listed United Rentals, Inc.[7] and sits on the board for many non-profits.
Brian McAuley holds a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Adelphi University, and resides in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.[6]
