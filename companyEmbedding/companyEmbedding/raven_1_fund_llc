                Investment in film, television, or new media equity is highly speculative and inherently risky. There can be no assurance of the economic success of any motion picture, television, or new media endeavor. You may sustain a total loss of the funds you have invested.

Raven On-Purpose Butene-1 Facility Announces Capital Commitments and EPC Contract

HOUSTON, Nov. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- SBE Chemical Partners I LLC (the Company), the owner of "Raven", an on-purpose Ethylene-to-Butene-1 processing facility to be located in Baytown, Texas, today announced the execution of definitive agreements for all capital commitments, subject to certain conditions, necessary for the construction of the facility.  Additionally, the Company has entered into an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract for the project. Engineering and site preparation activities have begun, and Raven's commercial operations are currently expected to commence in 2018. 








Raven has secured long-term fee-based offtake agreements with commitments from multiple Butene-1 buyers for most of its capacity.  The Company believes that there is ample room on the Raven site for expansion, and discussions with current and potential customers are underway for additional offtake. 
Butene-1 is a linear alpha olefin (LAO) used in the manufacture of a variety of base chemical products including as a co-monomer for production of polyethylene (LLDPE and HDPE).  Most LAO products are produced by processes that result in a range of products, including Butene-1.  However, the Raven facility is designed for dedicated on-purpose Butene-1 production from the processing of ethylene (an abundantly available derivative of natural gas) to meet anticipated growth in the polyethylene and associated markets.  
Raven was developed by Evonik Industries (Evonik) and Quanta Capital Solutions, Inc. (Quanta Capital).  Stone Bridge Energy Partners also acted as a developer of the project.  Quanta Capital and funds managed and/or advised by Partners Group are partnering as co-lead financial sponsors for the project.  
About Evonik
Evonik, the creative industrial group from Germany, is one of the world leaders in specialty chemicals.  Profitable growth and a sustained increase in the value of the company form the heart of Evonik's corporate strategy.  Its activities focus on the key megatrends health, nutrition, resource efficiency, and globalization.  Evonik benefits specifically from its innovative prowess and integrated technology platforms.  Evonik is active in over 100 countries around the world.  In fiscal 2015 more than 33,500 employees generated sales of around €13.5 billion and an operating profit (adjusted EBITDA) of about €2.47 billion.
About Partners Group
Partners Group is a global private markets investment management firm with over USD 55 billion in investment programs under management in private equity, private real estate, private infrastructure and private debt.  The firm manages a broad range of customized portfolios for an international clientele of institutional investors.  Partners Group is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland and has offices in San Francisco, Denver, Houston, New York, São Paulo, London, Guernsey, Paris, Luxembourg, Milan, Munich, Dubai, Mumbai, Singapore, Manila, Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo and Sydney.  The firm employs over 850 people and is listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange with a major ownership by its partners and employees.

Forward-Looking Statements 
This press release (and any oral statements regarding the subject matter of this press release) contains forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the "safe harbor" from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the Company's plans and strategies; any expected value of offtake agreements and other contracts with customers; capital commitments; the anticipated commencement and commercial operations dates for the facility; the safety, efficiency or success of the project; the impact of the facility on its desired customer markets; and prospective growth in the demand for Butene-1 and products and related expansion opportunities; as well as statements reflecting expectations, intentions, assumptions or beliefs about future events and other statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.  Although the Company and its management believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, they can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.  These statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions and by a variety of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict or beyond the Company's control, including, among others, the effects of industry, economic or political conditions outside of the control of the Company; successful construction of the facility pursuant to the EPC contract and commencement of commercial operations; issues related to intellectual property associated with licensed technology and processes; failure to realize the anticipated value of offtake agreements and other contract commitments; the potential for claims or damages associated with schedule delays or performance shortfalls; site conditions at the proposed location of the facility; the inability of customers to pay for Butene-1; and other factors affecting the facility and the business of the Company generally.  Should one or more of these risks materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake and expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  The Company further expressly disclaims any written or oral statements made by any third party regarding the subject matter of this press release.

Risk Factors

Note: Investment in the film industry is highly speculative and inherently risky. There can be no assurance of the economic success of any motion picture since the revenues derived from the production and distribution of a motion picture depend primarily upon its acceptance by the public, which cannot be predicted. The commercial success of a motion picture also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing films released into the marketplace at or near the same time, general economic factors, and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty. You may sustain a total loss of the funds you have invested.
The entertainment industry in general, and the motion picture and television industry in particular, are continuing to undergo significant changes, primarily due to technological developments. Although these developments have resulted in the availability of alternative and competing forms of leisure time entertainment, such technological developments have also resulted in the creation of additional revenue sources through licensing of rights to such new media, and potentially could lead to future reductions in the costs of producing and distributing motion pictures. In addition, the theatrical success of a motion picture remains a crucial factor in generating revenues in other ancillary  media such as but not limited to DVD's and television. Due to the rapid growth of technology, shifting consumer tastes, and the popularity and availability of other forms of entertainment, it is impossible to predict the overall effect these factors will have on the potential revenue from and profitability of feature-length motion pictures.
Raven Fund I is in the organizational stage and is subject to all the risks incident to the creation and development of a new business, including the absence of a history of operations and minimal net worth. In order to prosper, the success of Raven Fund 1 will depend partly upon the ability of management to produce a film of exceptional quality at a lower cost, which can compete in appeal with higher-budgeted films of the same genre. In order to minimize this risk, management plans to participate as much as possible throughout the process and will aim to mitigate financial risks where possible. Fulfilling this goal depends on the timing of investor financing, the ability to obtain distribution contracts with satisfactory terms, and the continued participation of the current management.

                                                    What is the market for horror films 

The industry as a whole in North America is also thriving. According to the MPAA 2015 Theatrical Market Statistics, 69% of the U.S./Canadian population, ages 2 and over, saw at least one movie throughout 2015. This same report states, the average moviegoer buys 5.6 tickets per year and the average moviegoer will choose to see a feature film in the movie theater 49% of the time. Additionally, information below, highlights the current and future state of the industry as provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) Global Entertainment and Media Outlook 2014 – 2018 and Nielsen Q1. 2016 Total Audience reports.  Filmed entertainment revenue will surpass US$100bn in 2017 as emerging markets drive growth. Globally, filmed entertainment revenue will rise at a CAGR of 4.5% from US$88.3bn in 2013 to US$110.1bn in 2018, passing US$100bn in 2017. While some of this expansion will be driven by growing demand in emerging markets, notably China, mature markets such as the US, the UK and Japan will also continue to grow.  Box office resilience underscores the continuing popularity of the cinematic experience. Global box office revenue will exceed revenue from physical home video in 2014 and grow over the forecast period to US$45.9bn by 2018, from US$36.1bn in 2013, at a 4.9% CAGR.  Americans continue to consume more content daily. U.S. adults spent 10 hours, 39 minutes a day consuming media in the first quarter of 2016. That’s up a full hour from the first quarter of 2015, and it’s thanks to a substantial increase in Smartphone and tablet usage, according to Nielsen’s Q1 2016 Total Audience Report.  China will provide a challenge and an opportunity. China will overtake Japan to become the world’s third-largest market for filmed entertainment (behind the US and UK) in 2018. Total revenue in China will reach US$7.0bn, up from US$3.8bn in 2013, at a CAGR of 13%.  We believe the overall state of the domestic theatrical release window is healthy, with receipts on an upward swing for horror related feature films.  According to Nash Information Services 2015 Summary, $389 million at the box office was generated by horror films. That same report highlights that 24 horror related feature films were distributed in wide release (600+ screens) and over 46.1 million tickets were sold to horror seeking moviegoers.   The genre dedicated to scaring audiences has a long history of increased profits potential.  Horror genre is the last genre in which audiences do not expect lots of special effects and expensive star power.  This genre is built on low budgets and practical conventions, such as jump scares and gory content. Movies such as “The Blair Witch Project” and “Paranormal Activity” helped to bring a new spin to the genre by introducing found footage storytelling. This unique way of storytelling spawned many copycats and has even pushed into other genres.
