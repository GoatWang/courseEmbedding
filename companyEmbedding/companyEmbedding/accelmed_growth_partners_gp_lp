Merging Med-Tech innovation with global commercial platforms 
 
Accelmed is an investment firm focused on value creation for medical device companies and technologies. Accelmed was founded in 2009 by Mori Arkin and Uri Geiger and invests in small and mid-cap private and public companies.
With its proven track record and large team of accomplished investment professionals, Accelmed’s vision is to create leading med-tech players by merging commercial platforms with small innovative growth companies, predominantly from Israel.
 
 
 
 
 



 

 










         
    
 
 







 
Integrating commercial platforms with innovation and providing growth equity to foster significant value creation
 
Accelmed brings its acumen in medical devices and its dominant presence in Israel to the Platform Model, which has already been implemented with great success.
Under the Platform model, Accelmed integrates innovative and market-ready medical device technologies into existing commercial companies that are able to effectively distribute and commercialize the new products.
Accelmed makes significant equity investments – or a combination of equity and debt – of between $20M and $50M per platform. In certain cases, in combination with its co-investing partners, investment can be increased to up to $300M.
We intend to acquire a significant interest in established medical device companies (in the US, Europe and potentially in China) with revenues in excess of $30M and which have an experienced direct sales force.
 

 
Proceeds of our investments will be used for both organic and inorganic growth through the acquisition and integration of innovative market ready medical device technologies identified and selected by Accelmed and the platform company management.
The acquired Israeli start-ups will serve as ongoing sources for cost-efficient R&D as, based on Accelmed’s proven experience with Israeli R&D teams,  they are not only innovative but also operate in a faster and more efficient way than their peers overseas.
 


 

 


Platform Case Studies




Endochoice – Platform Model Case Study
The Platform Model modus operandi is best illustrated through the merger between Peer Medical, an Israeli company and developer of the Full Spectrum Endoscope, and EndoChoice, a gastroenterology (GI) player in Atlanta, GA, which had a solid commercial infrastructure but which lacked innovative products.
By merging Peer into EndoChoice and the addition of working capital, Accelmed was able to transform EndoChoice from a commodity player into a cutting edge technology company. The merger, carried out in 2013, led to Endochoice’s emergence as a leading, global, GI player with sales above $75M in 2015 (more than doubled since the merger), high double-digit growth and a presence in more than 25 countries. EndoChoice completed a successful IPO on June 2015 and was sold to Boston Scientific in October 2016.
 

 
 
 
OIS – Platform Model Case Study
OIS is another example of the successful deployment of Accelmed’s Platform Model.
OIS, a California-based ophthalmic imaging systems player, acquired MediVision, the developer of an innovative retinal camera based on Israeli defense technology. The deal was financed and led by Accelmed, which held 44% of OIS’s shares post-merger in 2009. Within two years, OIS was sold, providing Accelmed with an outstanding return.

Schedule 13D 
Item 1. Security and Issuer.  This
statement relates to the common stock, $0.01 par value (the Common Stock) of Cogentix Medical, Inc. (the Issuer) having its principal executive offices at 5420 Feltl Road, Minnetonka, MN 55343. 
Item 2. Identity and Background. 
This statement is being filed by: 
(a)    Accelmed Growth Partners, L.P. (the Fund); 
(b)    Accelmed Growth Partners (GP), L.P. (the GP); 
(c)    Accelmed Growth Partners (AGP) Ltd. (the GPGP); 
(d)    Accelmed Growth Partners Management Ltd. (the Management Company); and 
(e)    Uri Geiger, the controlling member and managing partner of the GPGP and the controlling shareholder and managing
partner of the Management Company. The persons named in this Item 2 are referred to individually herein as a Reporting Person
and collectively as the Reporting Persons. The Reporting Persons have entered into a Joint Filing Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, a copy of which is filed with this Schedule 13D as Exhibit 1 (which is incorporated herein
by reference), pursuant to which the Reporting Persons have agreed to file this statement jointly in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-l(k) under the Act. 
The address of the principal business office of the Reporting Persons is Accelmed Growth Partners, L.P., 6 Hachoshlim Street, 6th Floor, Herzliya Pituach, Israel 46120.  The principal business of the Fund is to invest
in medical device companies. The principal business of the GP is to act as the sole general partner of the Fund. The principal business of the GPGP is to act as the sole general partner of the GP. The principal business of the
Management Company is to manage the Fund. The principal business of Uri Geiger is to manage the Fund and affiliated entities.  During
the five years prior to the date hereof, none of the Reporting Persons have been convicted in a criminal proceeding or have been a party to a civil proceeding ending in a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting
or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.

The Fund and the GP are Cayman Island exempted limited partnerships. The GPGP and the
Management Company are Cayman Island private limited companies. Uri Geiger is an Israeli citizen.  Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or
Other Consideration.  The Fund purchased 16,129,033 shares (the Shares) of Common Stock at $1.55 per share, for an
aggregate purchase price of $25 million pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (as defined below). The Purchase Agreement is more particularly described below under Item 4 of this statement.
The working capital of the Fund was the source of the funds for the Shares. No part of the purchase price of the Shares was represented
by funds or other consideration borrowed or otherwise obtained for the purpose of acquiring, holding, trading or voting the Shares.  Item 4.
Purpose of Transaction.  The Fund acquired the Shares for investment purposes. Depending on market conditions, its continuing
evaluation of the business and prospects of the Issuer and other factors, the Fund and other Reporting Persons may dispose of or acquire additional shares of the Issuer. 
The Issuer entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with the Fund on September 7, 2016. Pursuant
to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Fund purchased the Shares from the Issuer (the Share Issuance) on November 3, 2016 (the Closing Date). 
In connection with the Purchase Agreement, on September 7, 2016, the Issuer and Lewis C. Pell (Pell) entered into a note exchange
agreement (the Note Exchange Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Note Exchange Agreement, the Issuer and Pell agreed to convert into shares of Common Stock all of the outstanding principal amount and accrued interest on certain
notes held by Pell (the Notes). Under the terms of the Note Exchange Agreement, the entire outstanding principal amount and all accrued interest on the Notes was converted into 17,688,423 shares of Common Stock at a price per share
of $1.67 on the Closing Date. Also pursuant to the Note Exchange Agreement, all of the outstanding warrants held by Pell (the Warrants), entitling Pell to purchase shares of Common Stock, were cancelled on the Closing Date. 
In connection with the Purchase Agreement and the Note Exchange Agreement, on September 7, 2016, the Fund and Pell entered into a voting
agreement (the Voting Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Voting Agreement, each of the Fund and Pell agreed to vote their shares of the Issuers Common Stock for the other partys nominees to the Issuers board of
directors (the Board) and each of the Fund and Pell are entitled to nominate two directors. Uri Geiger and Nachum Shamir, the initial nominees of the Fund, were appointed as members of the Board on November 3, 2016, upon the closing
of the Share Issuance. The initial nominees of Pell were Pell and Howard Zauberman, who were incumbent directors of the Issuer prior to the closing of the Share Issuance. As a result of the Share Issuance and the transactions contemplated
by the Note Exchange Agreement (the Transactions), the Fund and Pell own or control a majority of the outstanding Common Stock. As a result of the Voting Agreement, the Issuer qualifies as a Controlled Company under
Nasdaq Rule 5615(c)(2), and is therefore exempt from certain corporate governance requirements under the Nasdaq Rules.

In addition, in connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer entered into a
registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement) with the Fund and Pell on the Closing Date, pursuant to which the Issuer agreed, upon demand by the Fund, to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the resale
of the shares issued pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement and the Note Exchange Agreement. Also under the Purchase Agreement,
the Issuer agreed that following the Closing Date and upon demand by the Fund, the Issuer will take all corporate actions necessary (including taking commercially reasonable efforts to obtain stockholder approval) to amend and restate the (i)
Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Issuer and (ii) the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Issuer.  The foregoing
descriptions of the Purchase Agreement, Note Exchange Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the full text of the agreements, copies of which are
filed as Exhibit 2, Exhibit 3, Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5 to this Schedule 13D, each of which is incorporated by reference into this Item 4. 
Except as set forth above, none of the Reporting Persons has any present plans which relate to or would result in: 
(a)    The acquisition by any person of additional securities of the Issuer, or the disposition of securities of the
Issuer;  (b)    An extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the
Issuer or any of its subsidiaries;  (c)    A sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Issuer or of any of
its subsidiaries;  (d)    Any change in the present Board of Directors or management of the Issuer, including any
plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board; 
(e)    Any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer; 
(f)    Any other material change in the Issuers business or corporate structure; 
(g)    Changes in the Issuers charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede
the acquisition of control of the Issuer by any person;  (h)    Causing a class of securities of the Issuer to be
delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association;

by reference), pursuant to which the Reporting Persons have agreed to file this statement jointly in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-l(k) under the Act.  The address of the principal business office of the Reporting Persons is Accelmed Growth Partners, L.P., 6 Hachoshlim Street, 6th Floor, Herzliya Pituach, Israel 46120.

 of 13 Pages  The Fund and the GP are Cayman Island exempted limited partnerships. The GPGP and the
Management Company are Cayman Island private limited companies. Uri Geiger is an Israeli citizen.  Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or
Other Consideration.  The Fund purchased 16,129,033 shares (the Shares) of Common Stock at $1.55 per share, for an
aggregate purchase price of $25 million pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (as defined below). The Purchase Agreement is more particularly described below under Item 4 of this statement. The working capital of the Fund was the source of the funds for the Shares. No part of the purchase price of the Shares was represented
by funds or other consideration borrowed or otherwise obtained for the purpose of acquiring, holding, trading or voting the Shares.  Item 4.
Purpose of Transaction.  The Fund acquired the Shares for investment purposes. Depending on market conditions, its continuing
evaluation of the business and prospects of the Issuer and other factors, the Fund and other Reporting Persons may dispose of or acquire additional shares of the Issuer.  The Issuer entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with the Fund on September 7, 2016. Pursuant
to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Fund purchased the Shares from the Issuer (the Share Issuance) on November 3, 2016 (the Closing Date).  In connection with the Purchase Agreement, on September 7, 2016, the Issuer and Lewis C. Pell (Pell) entered into a note exchange
agreement (the Note Exchange Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Note Exchange Agreement, the Issuer and Pell agreed to convert into shares of Common Stock all of the outstanding principal amount and accrued interest on certain
notes held by Pell (the Notes). Under the terms of the Note Exchange Agreement, the entire outstanding principal amount and all accrued interest on the Notes was converted into 17,688,423 shares of Common Stock at a price per share
of $1.67 on the Closing Date. Also pursuant to the Note Exchange Agreement, all of the outstanding warrants held by Pell (the Warrants), entitling Pell to purchase shares of Common Stock, were cancelled on the Closing Date.  In connection with the Purchase Agreement and the Note Exchange Agreement, on September 7, 2016, the Fund and Pell entered into a voting
agreement (the Voting Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Voting Agreement, each of the Fund and Pell agreed to vote their shares of the Issuers Common Stock for the other partys nominees to the Issuers board of
directors (the Board) and each of the Fund and Pell are entitled to nominate two directors. Uri Geiger and Nachum Shamir, the initial nominees of the Fund, were appointed as members of the Board on November 3, 2016, upon the closing
of the Share Issuance. The initial nominees of Pell were Pell and Howard Zauberman, who were incumbent directors of the Issuer prior to the closing of the Share Issuance. As a result of the Share Issuance and the transactions contemplated
by the Note Exchange Agreement (the Transactions), the Fund and Pell own or control a majority of the outstanding Common Stock. As a result of the Voting Agreement, the Issuer qualifies as a Controlled Company under
Nasdaq Rule 5615(c)(2), and is therefore exempt from certain corporate governance requirements under the Nasdaq Rules.      CUSIP No. 19243A 104   13D    Page
 9
 of 13 Pages  In addition, in connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer entered into a
registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement) with the Fund and Pell on the Closing Date, pursuant to which the Issuer agreed, upon demand by the Fund, to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the resale
of the shares issued pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement and the Note Exchange Agreement. Also under the Purchase Agreement,
the Issuer agreed that following the Closing Date and upon demand by the Fund, the Issuer will take all corporate actions necessary (including taking commercially reasonable efforts to obtain stockholder approval) to amend and restate the (i)
Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Issuer and (ii) the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Issuer.  The foregoing
descriptions of the Purchase Agreement, Note Exchange Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the full text of the agreements, copies of which are
