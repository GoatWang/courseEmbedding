2015 STANDARD FOR PROTECTIVE HEADGEAR
For Use with Motorcycles and Other 
Motorized Vehicles
Special Note to Helmet Users
There are four reasons for you to be 
interested in this Standard:
1.   

The use of motorcycles and other motorized vehicles imposes risks of death or 
permanent impairment due to head injury.
2.   

The proper use of protective helmets can minimize the risk of death or permanent 
impairment.  
3.   

The protective capacity of a helmet is difficult to estimate, particularly at 
the time of purchase or use.   Protective capability is currently 
measured by destructive testing which is beyond the means of most helmet 
wearers. 
4.   

Snell certification backed by ongoing destructive testing samples taken randomly 
from dealers and distributors identifies those helmet models providing and 
maintaining the highest levels of head protection.
Four of the most critical elements affecting a 
helmet's protective properties are:
1.   

Impact management - how well the helmet protects against collisions with large 
objects.
2.   

Helmet positional stability - whether the helmet will be in place, on the head, 
when it's needed.
3.   

Retention system strength - whether the chin straps are sufficiently strong to 
hold the helmet throughout a head impact.
4.   

Extent of Protection - the area of the head protected by the helmet.
            
This Standard describes simple tests for all four of these items.  However, 
the tests for the second item, helmet stability, of necessity presume that the 
helmet is well matched to the wearer's head and that it has been carefully 
adjusted to obtain the best fit possible.  Unless you take similar care in 
the selection and fitting of your own helmet, you may not obtain the level of 
protection that current headgear can provide. 
            
The Foundation recommends the simple, straightforward procedure recommended to 
consumers by most helmet manufacturers:
            
Position the helmet on your head so that it sits low on your forehead; if you 
can't see the edge of the brim at the extreme upper range of your vision, the 
helmet is probably out of place.  Adjust the retention system so that when 
in use, it will hold the helmet firmly in place.  This positioning and 
adjusting should be repeated to obtain the very best result possible.  The 
procedure initially may be time consuming.  Take the time.
            
Try to remove the helmet without undoing the retention system closures.  If 
the helmet comes off or shifts over your eyes, readjust and try again.  If 
no adjustment seems to work, this helmet is not for you; try another.
            
This procedure is also the basis of the test for helmet stability described in 
this Standard.  This test performs the same steps but uses standard head 
forms.  However, you must still perform this procedure for yourself when 
buying a helmet and every time you wear a helmet.  Only in this way will 
you be able to make all the proper adjustments to get the best fit possible.  
Furthermore, your test on your own head will be an improvement on ours; you will 
determine whether the helmet is appropriate for you personally.
            
There are several other important aspects of helmets to consider.  Full 
face helmets provide a measure of protection from facial injuries.  These 
helmets incorporate a rigid "chin" guard which covers the lower part of the 
face.  The Foundation has devised special tests for the chin bars of full 
face helmets.  
            
There are two varieties of full face helmets. The chin guard may be an integral, 
immovable part of the helmet but, in so-called “modular” or “flip-up” helmets 
the chin guard may be hinged so that, when released, it will pivot or flip up 
and out of the way for the rider’s convenience. Modular helmets must meet all 
the same requirements as those equipped with integral chin bars with the 
additional requirement that the chin guard release mechanism must be 
sufficiently secure to prevent inadvertent opening in a crash impact.  
            
Some helmets come with a separate structure which bolts to the helmet and which 
is intended to cover the lower part of the face.  These removable chin bars 
are often intended to deflect small stones and debris encountered in some 
motorcycle sports and may not be effective facial protection in falls and 
accidents.  The Foundation does not test bolt-on chin bars and considers 
any headgear equipped with them to be an open face helmet.
            
If a full face helmet is equipped with a face shield, it may also provide a 
measure of eye protection.  The Foundation tests the face shields of full 
face helmets for particle penetration resistance.  Face shields provided 
with open face helmets generally do not provide the same levels of eye 
protection and, for that reason are not considered.
            
The shells of both open and full face helmets should also provide a measure of 
protection from penetration.  The Foundation tests the shells of both full 
and open face helmets for penetration resistance.
            
Effective headgear must be removable.  Paramedics and other emergency 
personnel must be able to quickly remove headgear from accident victims in order 
to check for vital signs and to perform emergency procedures.  The 
Foundation has devised tests and criteria for helmet removability.
            
The Foundation tests helmets for visual field.  The helmet must provide a 
minimum range of vision appropriate to its use as measured on standard head 
forms.  Most Snell certified helmets will meet the requirements stated in 
this Standard and are considered appropriate for street use.  However, the 
Foundation may also certify headgear with much more restricted visual fields for 
use only in carefully controlled competitive environments.  Such headgear 
will include warning labels identifying them as appropriate only for certain 
activities.  
            
Be absolutely certain that your helmet is appropriate for your intended uses.  
Furthermore, since the range of vision you obtain may vary considerably from our 
measurement, be absolutely certain that the helmet and face shield permit you 
adequate vision.
            
There are several important factors which the Foundation does not consider 
directly but which bear on the effectiveness of protective helmets.  Be 
certain your helmet is wearable, that is, that it’s comfortable and adequately 
ventilated when worn for prolonged periods.  Few people will wear an 
uncomfortable helmet.  A helmet that is not worn won't protect anyone.  
Also, while you’re trying the helmet on, take a good look in a mirror and ask 
some friends what they think.  Most people will quit using an ugly helmet 
much more quickly than one that is merely uncomfortable.
            
Check for conspicuity.  Bright colors and reflective patches will make you 
more visible to others and therefore less likely to be involved in a collision.  
All your riding gear and especially your helmet should be unmistakable, even to 
the most inattentive driver.
                                                                        
FOREWORD
            
In a motorcycle accident, the rider may suffer injury or death.  Helmets on 
the market today offer varying degrees of protection, but the consumer has 
little basis for judging the relative effectiveness of a given model.  This 
Standard presents rational methods for identifying those helmet models which 
definitely meet specified standards for impact (crash) protection and retention 
system strength and, afterwards, identifying  those which definitely have 
ceased to meet those standards.  
            
The Snell Foundation urges that protective helmets be required for all 
individuals participating in supervised racing events and encourages the general 
public to wear helmets which meet appropriate performance standards[1].
            
This 2015 Standard establishes performance characteristics suitable for 
motorcycling and for use with other open motorized vehicles in which the driver 
and passengers may not be enclosed such as boats, motorized carts, all-terrain 
vehicles and snowmobiles.  This Standard does not establish construction 
and material specifications.  The Foundation does not recommend specific 
materials or designs.  Manufacturers voluntarily submit helmets to be 
tested to this Standard and if the submitted helmets pass, a certification is 
issued.
            
The Foundation will make available the identity of those products which have 
been Snell certified but will not attempt to rank those products according to 
performance nor to any other criteria.  Neither does the Foundation 
distinguish between the needs of participants in competitive events and those of 
the general public. 
            
All of the requirements described herein, including both initial certification 
and random sample testing, are an integral part of this Standard.  No 
helmet can satisfy the Standard unless it is subject to both certification and 
random sample testing by the Foundation.
            
Snell certification for protective headgear requires a specific contractual 
agreement between the primary headgear manufacturer and the Foundation.  
Certification procedures may be obtained upon application to the Foundation.
            
SNELL MEMORIAL FOUNDATION is a registered certification mark and M2015 is a 
certification mark of the Snell Memorial Foundation.
                                                                     
INTRODUCTION
            
This Standard addresses the problem of protecting the head from direct impact 
with surfaces or objects that might be encountered in a motorcycling accident.  
The Standard prescribes direct measures of several factors bearing on a helmet's 
ability to protect the head as well as its general serviceability as 
motorcyclist headgear.  Thus, this Standard is directed towards the kinds 
of performance bearing on head protection that may not readily be discernable by 
even knowledgeable consumers at the time of purchase. 
            
Some of these performance requirements have been expressed in terms of 
limitations on the various components and features of the single general helmet 
configuration currently available.  These expressions have been used only 
for the sake of clarity and should not be misinterpreted as requiring specific 
configurations or materials.  As newer helmet technologies appear, these 
limitations will be re-examined and, perhaps, restated.
            
A motorcycle helmet consists generally of a rigid head covering and a retention 
system composed of flexible straps and hardware.  The rigid covering 
consists of a strong, stiff outer shell and a crushable liner.  The stiff 
outer shell protects by its capacity to spread a concentrated load at its outer 
surface over a larger area of the liner and the wearer's head.  The 
crushable liner protects the head from direct impact by its capacity to manage 
impact energy.   Since there is no certain way to anticipate the severity 
of a head impact or whether the impact surface will be such that it will spread 
the load over the helmet or concentrate it at a single point, the most generally 
effective helmet will combine the strongest, stiffest possible outer shell with 
a liner chosen to limit the peak deceleration of the wearer’s head to within 
tolerable limits. 
            
The retention system holds the headgear in position throughout normal usage and 
especially during falls and accidents, ensuring that the helmet will be in place 
to manage a direct impact.  This Standard applies two different tests to 
the retention system.  The first of these tests for stability by fitting 
the headgear to a standard head form and then attempting to displace it by 
applying tangential shock loadings.  The second tests retention system 
strength by applying a shock load to the system components through a simulated 
chin.
            
The quality of the fit and the care taken with the adjustments are absolutely 
critical elements in these tests.  The manufacturer must provide 
suitable guidance so that the wearer will be able to select and adjust headgear 
to obtain the necessary quality of fit and positional stability.
            
The capacity for impact protection is determined by direct measurement of the 
shock delivered through the helmet to a head form when the helmeted head form is 
dropped in a specified manner onto any of three unyielding anvils.  
            
Most motorcycle helmets are intended to accommodate a range of head sizes and 
shapes.  Various thicknesses of resilient padding are sometimes placed 
within otherwise identical helmets during production or during fitting to 
configure the helmet to several different ranges of head size.  This 
resilient padding does not significantly affect the way the helmet absorbs and 
attenuates impact and is not directly addressed in this Standard.
            
The helmet must also resist penetration by sharp edged and pointed projections 
and projectiles.  This capacity is tested by placing the helmet on a head 
form and dropping a metal cone of specified mass and geometry onto the shell.  
The tip of this cone must not penetrate to the head form.
            
Similarly, the helmets must resist chemical attack by bodily fluids as well as 
solvents and chemicals associated with motorsports.  This capacity may be 
tested by applying a solvent mix before further conditioning and testing.
            
Full face helmets including “modular” or “flip-up” helmets provide a measure of 
facial protection in addition to the impact protection generally sought.  
The principle feature of these is a chin bar that extends forward to cover the 
jaw area converting the facial opening into a visual port.  Frequently, a 
face shield is also provided so that the wearer's face is completely covered.
            
In traditional full face helmets, the chin bar is an integral, immovable part of 
the helmet structure.  In “modular” or “flip-up” full face configurations, 
the chin bar may be released to pivot about a hinge up and away from the face 
enabling wearers to adjust eyeglasses, eat, drink or converse when not actually 
riding.  Although other helmets may be configured to allow the use of “bolt-on” 
chin bar elements, these helmets are not considered to be full face and are 
treated instead as open face configurations.
            
For full face helmets, this Standard tests the rigidity of the chin bar by 
dropping a weight onto it at a specified velocity so as to attempt to force the 
chin bar toward the interior of the helmet.  The chin bar must not deflect 
more than a specified amount.
            
If a face shield is provided with a full face helmet, then this face shield must 
resist penetration by small particles.  A sharp lead pellet of a specified 
weight is directed into the face shield at a specified velocity.  The 
pellet must not penetrate into the helmet interior.
            
This Standard also includes a test intended to determine whether the headgear 
may be removed from an unconscious accident victim quickly, easily and reliably 
in spite of any damage the headgear might reasonably be expected to sustain.  
Traditional helmet architectures have satisfied this requirement so readily that 
many Standards including previous Snell Foundation Standards have not mentioned 
it.  Even so, it is unthinkable that a headgear might protect its wearer in 
an accident only to thwart attempts at rescue afterward.
            
Inadequate ventilation may render a helmet unwearable in hot climates, 
especially if the helmet is full faced.  But this Standard makes no direct 
demands on either the quantity or quality of air flow to the wearer.
            
Other general features of motorcycle helmets may include eyeshades and 
accommodations for goggles, and visibility enhancements such as bright colors 
and reflective surfaces.  These features all deal with matters of safety 
and comfort that are not directly addressed in this Standard but which merit the 
consideration of wearers as well as manufacturers.
            
 Although helmet use has been shown to reduce the risk of head injuries 
significantly, there are limits to a helmet's protective capability.  No 
helmet can protect the wearer against all foreseeable accidents.  Therefore 
injury may occur in accidents which exceed the protective capability of any 
helmet including even those helmets meeting the requirements of this Standard.
            
A helmet's protective capability may be exhausted protecting the wearer in an 
accident.  Helmets are constructed so that the energy of a blow is managed 
by the helmet, causing its partial destruction.  The damage may not be 
readily apparent and the Foundation strongly recommends that a helmet involved 
in an accident be returned to the manufacturer for complete inspection.  If 
it is not possible to do so, the helmet should always be destroyed and replaced.
            
Finally, the protective capability may diminish over time.  Some helmets 
are made of materials which deteriorate with age and therefore have a limited 
life span.  At the present time, the Foundation recommends that motorcycle 
helmets be replaced after five (5) years, or less if the manufacturer so 
recommends.
                                                                    
CONSTRUCTION
A.  General
            
The assembled helmet shall have smooth external and internal surfaces.  Any 
feature projecting more than 7 mm beyond the outer surface must readily break 
away; all other projections on the outer surface shall be smoothly faired and 
offer minimal frictional resistance to tangential impact forces.  Rivets 
and similar projections into the helmet interior must offer no laceration or 
puncture hazard.  Restraint clips may be used at the rear or on the side of 
the helmet.  The helmet shall provide as nearly uniform impact protection 
over the entire protected area as is possible.
            
If the absence of any detachable component of the helmet does not prevent its 
being worn, then this absence must not compromise either the retention system or 
the impact protection.  If any part of the helmet detaches during testing, 
it must offer no laceration or puncture hazard nor reduce the coverage of the 
head.
            
If the manufacturer provides add-ons such as visors, face shields and neck 
curtains with the helmet, these add-ons must not lessen the protective 
capability of the basic helmet nor reduce the visual field below standard 
requirements nor create a direct hazard for the wearer.
B.  Shell
            
If rivets are used, the heads shall not have sharp edges and shall not project 
more than 2 mm from the outer surface of the helmet.
C.  Materials
            
Ideally, materials used in the manufacture of the helmet should be of durable 
quality and not be harmed by exposure to sun, rain, dust, vibration, sweat or 
products applied to the skin or hair.  Similarly, the materials should not 
degrade due to temperature extremes likely to be encountered in routine storage 
or transportation.    Materials which are known to cause skin 
irritation or are conducive to disease shall not be used for the parts which 
contact the skin.  Materials which support the growth of fungi or algae 
shall not be used.  Fabric lining or padding materials, if used, may be 
detachable for the purpose of washing so long as their absence does not degrade 
the protective capabilities of the helmet.
D.  Finish
            
All edges of the helmet shall be smoothed and rounded with no metallic parts or 
other rigid projections on the inside of the shell that might injure the 
wearer's head in the event of impact.
E.  Retention System
            
The retention system shall be designed so as to discourage misuse.  That 
is, of all the ways in which the retention system might be used, the design use 
shall be the simplest and quickest to implement.  Helmets shall not be 
fitted with "non-essential" features which, if misused, can degrade the 
performance.  Quick release buckles, if used, shall not be able to be 
released inadvertently. 
            
Fabric chinstraps, if used, shall not be secured to the shell by a bolt, pin or 
rivet passing through the fabric itself.  Although other alternatives may 
be proposed, the preferred method of attachment is that the strap be looped 
through and sewn about a metal hanger which can then be secured to the shell by 
bolt, rivet or other appropriate means. 
F.  Peripheral 
Vision
            
The helmet shall provide peripheral visual clearance as measured using a 
reference head form appropriate to the size of the helmet.  This peripheral 
vision includes a horizontal clearance of at least 210º, an upward clearance of at 
least 7º and a downward clearance of at least 30º.  However, this downward 
clearance makes specific allowance for breath deflectors.  These clearances 
are described in terms of planes fixed in the reference head forms. 
            
Some competitive applications may require helmets with more restricted visual 
fields.  When justified, special addenda to this Standard will define 
reduced visual fields, the procedures for determining whether a helmet satisfies 
the requirement and the additional labeling requirements warning that the 
headgear may be appropriate only for certain uses.
G.  Sizing
            
The requirements of this standard are such that most helmets will perform 
optimally only when tested within a range of head circumferences.  Outside 
this range, helmets may still provide a measure of protection but they may not 
meet requirements for certification.  The manufacturer must specify this 
entire range when helmets are submitted for certification.  Later, when helmets 
are distributed for sale, every helmet shall include a permanent label 
indicating the range of head circumferences for which it is intended.  
                                              
QUALIFICATIONS FOR CERTIFICATION
            
For qualification testing, helmets shall be in the same condition as those 
offered for sale.  No helmet or component which has been subjected to any 
tests described in this Standard shall be offered for sale after testing.  At least five (5) and as 
many as seven (7) complete helmets must be submitted by the manufacturer for a 
certification test program for each distinct structural configuration of the 
models offered for sale.  All but one of these samples will be destroyed in 
testing; the untested sample shall be retained for comparison and reference.  
If different fit pad configurations are planned in order to accommodate this 
head gear for different size ranges, five of the samples submitted must be 
configured for the largest size range.  If seven samples are considered 
necessary, the remaining two samples must be configured for the smallest 
intended size.  Additional samples representing different fit pad 
configurations may also be provided at the discretion of the submitter.  
                                                                    
MODIFICATIONS
            
Cosmetic changes to certified headgear are permissible.  Such changes are 
generally limited to marking or trimming the headgear with manufacturer approved 
paint or tape.  Otherwise, modifications to certified headgear effectively 
create new configurations which shall not have the confidence and certification 
of the Foundation until properly evaluated.  Manufacturers must not place 
the Foundation's certification label in any modified headgear without the 
Foundation’s written authorization.
            
The Foundation recommends that helmet owners not modify or contract with someone 
else to modify their helmets.  Any structural modification may adversely 
affect a helmet's protective capability.  The Foundation’s certification 
and, quite likely, all manufacturer warranties apply to the headgear only in its 
as manufactured condition.  
                                                         
RANDOM SAMPLE TESTING
            
In addition to the certification testing, the Foundation will routinely obtain 
and test samples of previously certified models.  These samples will be 
selected from among those stocks intended for retail sale to consumers.  In 
this manner, the Foundation will attempt to ensure that the helmets made 
available to the public continue to meet the performance requirements of this 
Standard.
            
For those cases in which helmets are provided directly to users and do not pass 
through a normal sales distribution system, the Foundation will set up 
alternative procedures to monitor certified products.  Specifically, if 
helmets are provided directly to teams or individuals for use in events, the 
Foundation must have access to the helmets for spot checking and non-destructive 
evaluation.
                                                           
LABELING AND MARKING
            
Each helmet shall have durable, visible and legible labeling identifying the 
manufacturer, the month and year of manufacture, the model and the size.  
Labeling shall be uncoded and either in English or a language common to the area 
where the helmets are to be distributed.  The headgear shall also be 
labeled to the following effect: 
1.  The 
Certification ID#: This number consists of two alpha characters, four numerics, 
a hyphen and two more numerics indicating the year in which the certification 
was awarded. This certification id# is marked on the test reports, cover letter 
and the certificate awarded to the helmet maker shortly after the helmet met 
requirements, it identifies the tests and the archive samples on which the 
certification is based. 
2.  No 
helmet can protect the wearer against all foreseeable impacts.  However, 
for maximum protection, the helmet must be of good fit and the retention system 
must be securely fastened to retain the helmet.  The helmet, when fitted 
and fastened, shall not be removed easily.
3.  This 
helmet is so constructed that the energy of an impact may be absorbed through 
its partial destruction, though damage may not be visible.  If it suffers 
an impact, it must either be returned to the manufacturer for inspection or be 
destroyed and replaced.
4.  
Intended for head circumferences from XX cm through YY cm.
            
If any of the helmet components are sensitive to common solvents, adhesives, 
paints or cleansers; the helmet must also bear labels to the following effect:
This 
helmet can be seriously damaged by some common substances without visible 
damage.  Apply only the following:  (Recommended cleaning agents, 
paints, adhesives and the like) as appropriate.  
            
If the helmet model was certified according to a special addendum to this 
standard, each helmet shall also include the warning labels required by that 
addendum.
            
The Certification ID# label requirement is intended to minimize confusion during 
standards enforcement.  It may be waived at the discretion of the 
Foundation if the manufacturer can demonstrate that existing brand and model 
labels will reasonably identify the unit sufficiently.  Any such waiver 
must be obtained in writing. 
            
Each helmet shall also include one of the Foundation's serialized certification 
labels.  The Snell certification label shall be placed either inside or on 
the outside of the helmet, as appropriate, in such a way that it cannot be 
removed intact.











            
The registered trademark (certification label) of the Snell Memorial Foundation 
may be used by the manufacturer only under license from the Snell Memorial 
Foundation.  The specifics of licensure may be obtained from the 
Foundation.
MARKING AND LABELING OF 
CRITICAL COMPONENTS
            
If a helmet component may reasonably be replaced with an inappropriate 
substitute that might degrade wearer safety and performance in any of the tests 
called out in this standard, the manufacturer must mark those components so that 
users may avoid the purchase and use of inappropriate replacement parts.   
In particular, face shields on full face helmets must be marked to identify the 
manufacturer and the month and year of manufacture.
HEAD 
FORMS
            
This standard invokes six standard head forms for helmet inspection, marking and 
testing.  The geometry of these head forms is according to the definitions 
for the ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘E’, ‘J’, ‘M’, and ‘O’ head forms described in International 
Standards Organization (ISO) Draft Standard ISO DIS 6220-1983.  The impact 
mass specifications for the impact test phase are comparable to those in ECE 
22-05 for these same head form designations.
            
ISO DIS 6220-1983 includes descriptions for half head forms suitable for guided 
fall impact testing or for full head forms such as those used in the positional 
stability tests.  Figures 1 and 2 depict the general shapes of the half 
head form configuration.  The following table lists useful dimensions from 
the two references given above.

EXTENT OF PROTECTION
            
The extent of protection corresponds to that region of the head for which 
protection is sought.  There are a number of planes fixed in the geometry 
of these head forms as shown in Figure 1.  This description of the extent 
of protection uses the ISO definitions of the basic plane, the longitudinal 
plane, the transverse plane and the reference plane.  Other planes have 
also been defined strictly for convenience and clarity.
            
The basic plane corresponds to the anatomical plane (Frankfort plane) that 
includes the auditory meatuses and the inferior orbital rims.  The 
reference plane is above and parallel to the basic plane. The longitudinal or 
midsagittal plane is perpendicular to the basic plane and is the plane of 
symmetry dividing the right half of the head form from the left.  The 
transverse or coronal plane is perpendicular to both the longitudinal and basic 
planes.  It corresponds to the anatomical plane that contains the two 
auditory meatuses and divides the front from the rear portions of the head.
            
These planes are all well known entities.  Several other planes, however, 
have proven useful.  The S0
plane is parallel to the basic plane and lies above it at a distance determined 
by the size of the head form.  The S3 plane is parallel to the S0
plane and the basic plane and lies between them.  The S4 plane 
is also parallel to these planes and lies below the basic plane.

The rear plane divides the rear third of the 
head from the front two thirds.  It is parallel to the transverse plane and 
lies at a given distance behind the point where the reference plane and 
longitudinal planes intersect with the front surface of the head form.  The 
distance from this point, hereafter called the reference point, is determined by 
the size of the head form.  The fore plane is also parallel to the 
transverse plane.  It lies behind the reference point at a distance 
determined by the size of the head form.   The extent of protection 
provided by the helmet must include the entire region above the S0 
plane and forward of the fore plane, the entire region above the S3 
plane and between the fore and rear planes and the entire region above the S4 
plane and behind the rear plane.  Figure 2 and the associated table lay out 
these additional defined features and show the extent of protection and the test 
line.

TESTING
A.  
Inspection 
            
Each helmet will be inspected for the required labels and for compliance with 
the general limitations made on structure.  Samples received for 
certification testing must incorporate all the critical component labels but 
other labeling is not necessary for evaluation.  Samples received for RST 
(enforcement) testing must have all the required labels. 
            
Some helmets may incorporate innovations and other features not anticipated by 
this Standard but which raise concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the 
headgear.  These will be referred to members of the Foundation's Board of 
Directors for evaluation.  Any feature deemed to reduce the protective 
capacity of the headgear, whether explicitly mentioned in this Standard or not, 
will be a cause for rejection. 
B.  
Head Forms and Helmet Positioning
            The 
determination of which head forms are appropriate to a helmet is based on the 
specified smallest and largest head circumferences for the helmet.  For 
samples submitted for certification, this specification must include the 
smallest and largest values of head circumference for every possible fit pad 
configuration of the helmet.  For helmets received for RST testing, the 
smallest and largest head circumferences will be taken directly from the helmet 
label.
If 
the smallest head circumference specified for the helmet is less than 50 cm, the 
A head form is the smallest appropriate.  Otherwise, the smallest 
appropriate head form for a particular helmet is the largest of the six head 
forms whose circumference is no greater than the manufacturer’s specified 
smallest circumference. The largest appropriate head form is the largest of the 
six specified head forms whose circumference is no greater than the 
manufacturer’s specified largest circumference.

If 
the test samples are determined to be too small to accommodate the largest head 
form identified as appropriate, the next smaller head form shall be considered 
the largest appropriate.  If the samples are too small for even the 
smallest appropriate head form as indicated by the manufacture specification, 
the samples shall be rejected for certification.
The 
table shows which head forms will be used in certification testing for various 
head size specifications.  Since the largest head size should never be 
smaller than the smallest head size, most of the lower left region of the table 
is blank.  
If 
the size specification corresponds to one of the gray cells along the table’s 
main diagonal, only a single test head form will be necessary and the 
manufacturer need only submit five samples identical samples configured with 
comfort padding for the largest intended head size for certification testing.  
Otherwise, two more samples are required, identical to the first five in all 
respects except that the comfort padding must be configured for the smallest 
intended head size.
            
During testing, helmets will be positioned on the selected test head form 
according to the manufacturer’s specified helmet positioning indices.  If 
the manufacturer fails to provide positioning information with certification 
samples, the helmets will be positioned according to the best judgment of the 
authorized technical personnel.  If the helmets meet certification 
requirements, the helmet positioning indices will be those used in all future 
testing.
            
These helmet positioning indices represent distances on the front of the head 
form from the basic plane along the intersection with the longitudinal plane 
upward to the lower brow edge of the helmet.  Helmet positioning indices 
will be assigned for all head form sizes appropriate to the headgear.  Each 
headgear could conceivably require as many as six helmet positioning indices, 
one each for the ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘E’, ‘J’, ‘M’ and ‘O’ head forms. 

C.  Marking
            
The helmet is placed upon the largest appropriate ISO head form, positioned 
according to the apposite helmet positioning index and held in place with an 
applied force of 50 newtons (11.25 lbs).  The intersections of the shell 
with the various defined planes are then traced onto the outer surface of the 
helmet in the following manner:
            
The level of the S0
plane is marked on that portion of the helmet in front of the fore plane.  
The level of the S3 plane is marked on that portion lying between the 
fore and rear planes.  The level of the S4 plane is marked on 
that portion behind the rear plane.  Finally, line segments along the fore 
plane are marked to join the S0 and S3 planes and, 
similarly, line segments along the rear plane are marked to join the S3 
and S4
planes.  
            
These lines enclose the top of the helmet and are the boundary of the required 
extent of protection.  However, it shall not be a cause for rejection if 
parts of this boundary fall below the edge of the helmet.  A test line 
shall be constructed within the extent of protection 40 mm from the closest 
point on the boundary as shown in figure 2.
            
If identical helmets are to be configured with different thicknesses of comfort 
padding to accommodate different ranges of head size, the required extent of 
protection marked on the test samples shall include the required extent of 
protection for each different configuration as marked on the largest head form 
appropriate for each.  That is:  the helmet must meet all the 
requirements of this Standard in each of the intended configurations.


D.  Peripheral Vision
            
The clearance for peripheral vision will be checked by placing the helmet on 
each appropriate ISO head form, positioning it according to the apposite helmet 
positioning index and holding it in place with a force of 50 newtons.  The 
clearance must include the following solid angles to the front of the head form:
            
1. The upward visual clearance.
            
2. The lateral visual clearance.
            
3. The downward visual clearance except for the breath deflector allowance.
            
Helmets certified to a special addendum to this standard and bearing the warning 
labels specified in the addendum will not be subjected to the following 
procedures and criteria for evaluating clearances for vision.  However, the 
procedures and criteria specified in the addendum will be applied instead.
            
The upward visual clearance is the solid angle bounded by the reference plane of 
the head form and a second plane tilted 7º up from the reference plane.  
This second plane intersects the reference plane at two points on the front 
surface of the head form that are 31 mm to the right and left of the 
longitudinal plane as shown in figure 3.  

Figure 4 Lateral Visual Clearance
            
The lateral visual clearance, as shown in figure 4, is the solid angle bounded 
by the reference plane, the S4
plane and two more planes that are perpendicular to the reference plane and that 
contain the reference point on the front of the head form.  One of these 
two planes forms an angle of 105º with the longitudinal plane and lies to the 
left of the head form.  The other forms the same angle to the right of the 
head form.  
            
The downward visual clearance is the solid angle bounded by the basic plane of 
the head form and a second plane tilted 30º down from the basic plane that 
intersects it at two points on the front surface of the head form that are 31 mm 
to the right and left of the longitudinal plane as shown in figure 5.  
However, intrusions into this downward clearance are permitted so long as the 
intrusions are within the breath deflector allowance.











            
The breath deflector allowance is shown in figure 6.  It includes the 
region that is within 31 mm to the right and left of the longitudinal plane and 
that lies below the two planes that form 45º angles with the longitudinal plane 
and that intersect it at the level of the S4 plane. 
 
E.  Performance 
Testing
            
The performance testing subjects helmets to a dynamic test of retention system 
strength, to a test for positional stability, to impact management tests, to 
helmet shell penetration tests, to a removability test, and to chin bar and face 
shield tests if appropriate.  These tests are conducted upon helmet samples 
kept under laboratory ambient temperature and humidity or that have been 
conditioned in one of three environments simulating some of the conditions in 
which the helmet might reasonably be expected to be used. 
            
Prior to conditioning and testing, samples may be exposed to solvents common to 
motorsports which have been found to attack and degrade some helmet components.
            
In certification testing, four samples are required for testing on the largest 
appropriate head form.  The first of these is kept at laboratory ambient 
temperature and humidity and allowed to come to equilibrium.  It is 
subjected first to the positional stability test and then to the impact 
management and other tests.  The second, third and fourth samples are 
conditioned hot, cold and wet, and subjected to the dynamic test of the 
retention system, the impact management test and the other tests.  If the 
smallest appropriate head form is not the same as the largest, two additional 
samples are required for testing on this head form.  The first of these 
will be allowed to stabilize at laboratory ambient temperature and humidity and 
then will be subjected to the test for positional stability.  This sample 
may then be conditioned hot or cold or kept at laboratory ambient for impact 
testing.  The second additional sample shall be tested in impact 
conditioned hot, cold or wet or kept at lab ambient according to the best 
judgment of the test personnel.
            
The selection of tests, conditioning and special conditioning is left to the 
discretion of the Foundation's technical personnel.  However, for 
certification testing, each of the specified tests shall be applied to at least 
one sample.  Furthermore, it is expected that all testing will be conducted 
so as to exercise all the likely failure modes of the helmet.
E1.  Conditioning for 
Testing
            
Test samples may be kept at laboratory ambient temperature and humidity or may 
be conditioned cold, hot or wet according to the specifications given below.  
At the discretion of the Foundation's technical personnel and at any point 
during the testing, a sample previously kept at ambient may be conditioned cold, 
hot or wet.  However, once a sample has been conditioned cold, hot or wet, 
the sample must be maintained in that condition throughout the rest of the 
testing.
            
The special solvent wipe conditioning described below may be applied to any 
sample at the discretion of the Foundation's technical personnel.  
            
a. Special Conditioning.  
Prior to any impact or retention system testing helmets may first be conditioned 
with a solvent mix of 50% toluene and 50% isooctane.  A cotton cloth or 
suitable substitute shall be soaked in the solvent and used as an applicator.  
The solvent will be applied to the shell first in an area within 5 mm of the 
chin strap attachments for not less than five (5) seconds on each side and then 
applied to the remainder of the shell for not less than ten (10) seconds.  
At least thirty minutes shall elapse before further conditioning and testing.
            
b. Cold.  
The sample shall be conditioned by being exposed to a temperature of -20 ±2º C 
for a period of not less than four (4) hours, or more than twenty-four (24) 
hours.
            
c. Heat.  
The sample shall be conditioned by being exposed to a temperature of 50 ±2º C 
for a period of not less than four (4) hours, or more than twenty-four (24) 
hours.
            
d. Wet.  
The sample shall be conditioned by being continuously sprayed with water at a 
temperature of 25 ±5º C for a period of not less than four (4) hours, or more 
than twenty-four (24) hours.  This spray shall be directed at the helmet's 
external surfaces.  The helmet shall not be subjected to total immersion.
            
 All testing of these hot, cold and wet helmets shall begin within two (2) 
minutes from the time of removal from the conditioning apparatus.  The 
samples shall be returned to the conditioning apparatus between tests.
E2.  Positional 
Stability (Roll-Off)
            
The test for positional stability shall only be applied to samples kept at 
ambient laboratory temperature and humidity.  The helmet shall not have 
been subjected to any prior performance testing.

            
The helmet shall be tested on the smallest appropriate standard full-face head 
form.  The head form shall be supported on a stand so that its vertical 
axis points downward at an angle of 135º to the direction of gravity.  The 
head form shall be oriented face down.  The helmet shall be placed on the 
head form and adjusted to obtain the best configuration of the retention system.  
An inelastic strap shall be hooked to the edge of the helmet at the rear 
centerline and brought forward so that its free end hangs downward across the 
top of the helmet.  An inertial hammer shall be suspended from the free end 
of the strap.  This inertial hammer shall enable a 4.0 kg ±50 g mass to be 
dropped through a 0.6 m guided fall in order to deliver an abrupt shock load to 
the headgear.  The shock load will force the helmet to rotate forward on 
the head form.  The helmet may be shifted but must remain on the head form.  
            
The head form shall be repositioned so that it is facing upward but with the 
vertical axis still oriented downward at 135º to gravity.  The helmet shall 
be positioned and adjusted to obtain the best configuration of the retention 
system.  The strap/inertial hammer shall be hooked to the brow edge of the 
helmet at the center line so that the strap lies along the centerline and the 
hammer is suspended from the top of the helmet.  The shock weight shall be 
dropped through the 0.6 m guided fall delivering an abrupt shock load forcing 
the helmet to rotate rearward.  The helmet may be shifted but must remain 
on the head form. 
            
The entire portion of the inertial hammer assembly that participates in the 
loading of the helmet shall be such that its mass is no more than 5.0 kg 
including the 4.0 kg shock mass.
E3.  Dynamic Test of Retention System
            
The dynamic test of the retention system may be applied to any sample either 
kept at ambient temperature and humidity or conditioned hot, cold or wet.  
This test may be performed before, after, or between any of the other procedures 
in the test sequence.  However, the retention test shall not be valid if an 
integral chin bar has been removed from a full face helmet.  
            
The helmet shall be supported on its lower shell edge in such a manner that the 
chin strap may be fastened under a device whose upper end approximates the 
contour of the bony structure of the jaw.  The device will then be given a 
mechanical pre-load followed by a dynamic loading.  The retention system 
fails if it cannot support the mechanical loads or if the maximum deflection 
during the dynamic load exceeds 30 mm.  The retention system also fails if 
it cannot be easily and quickly unfastened after testing.
            
If the technician determines that the helmet cannot be adequately supported on 
its lower shell edge, at his discretion, he may support the helmet on a head 
form for this test.
            
a. This chinstrap loading device shall consist of a simulated jaw and 
accommodations for the pre-load and dynamic load.  The jaw portion shall 
consist of two metal bars or rollers, each one 12.7 ±0.5 mm in diameter, 
separated by 76 ±0.5 mm on center.  The mass of this device shall not 
exceed 6.0 kg.
            
b.   A 
pre-load shall be applied for at least 60 seconds. This pre-load shall consist 
of the mass of the chin strap loading device, static load of 23 kg and the shock 
load of 38 kg ± 500g which will total 61 kg ±500 g.
            
c.  
Raise the 38 kg ±500 g mass which will then be dropped in a vertical guided fall 
through a distance of 120 mm to load the retaining system abruptly; the shock 
load of 38 kg mass and static load of 23 kg mass shall not be additive. In order 
to protect the test mechanism, the impact of the 38 kg mass may be cushioned 
with a 00-93 durometer rubber pad 150 mm in diameter by 6½ mm thick, or its 
equivalent.
E4.  Impact 
Management Tests
            
The impact management tests may be performed on samples kept at ambient 
temperature and humidity or conditioned hot, cold or wet.  The sample shall 
not have been subjected to the shell penetration test beforehand.
            
These tests involve a series of controlled impacts in which the helmet is 
positioned on a test head form.  The helmeted head form is then dropped in 
guided falls onto specified test anvils.  The impact site and the impact 
energy must meet certain requirements in order for the tests to be valid. 
            
If the sample is so constructed that it interferes with the test equipment 
preventing impacts at sites within the test line, then, at the discretion of the 
Foundation's technical personnel, parts of the helmet may be cut away to 
facilitate testing.  Every reasonable effort to minimize such cutting will 
be made.  However, there shall be no relaxation of the impact levels or of 
the test criteria.
            
Certain tests shall not be valid when performed on samples that have been cut 
for impact testing: the dynamic strength of retention system test of section 
E3., the positional stability test of section E2., the chin bar test of section 
E5. and the removability test of section E8.
            
Special considerations apply when the helmet is a “flip-up” model, that is: 
configured with a chin bar that pivots up and away from the face of the wearer.  
For the first three impacts on any flip-up sample, the impact tests will be 
performed with the chin bar locked in the closed position.  In these tests 
the chin bar must not release and “flip-up” inadvertently. In certification 
testing, the tests will be structured so as to investigate performance in 
frontal followed by lateral impact.   
E4.1    
Impact Management Test Equipment
            
The test equipment shall consist of at least the following items:
            
a. The 
smallest and largest of the head forms appropriate for the helmet sample.  
This head form shall be of rigid, low resonance metal such as magnesium alloy 
and shall conform to the 'A', 'C', 'E', 'J', 'M' or 'O' geometries specified in 
ISO DIS 6220‑1983.
            
b. A 
ball‑arm/collar assembly which is fitted to a socket machined into the base of 
the head form.  The ball/socket configuration shall be such that the 
geometrical center of the ball is located on the central vertical axis of the 
head form 12.7 mm above the reference plane as described in ISO DIS 6220-1983.  
The ball-arm/collar assembly shall also include a uniaxial accelerometer fixed 
firmly into the ball.
            
c. A 
head form support assembly rigidly attached to the ball-arm.  This support 
assembly shall be such that it and consequently the head form may be guided in a 
vertical drop.  The mass of this support assembly shall not exceed 1.2 kg.  
The total mass of the head form plus ball-arm/collar assembly plus head form 
support assembly shall be within 100 grams of: 3.1 kg for the ISO A head form, 
3.6 kg for the ISO C head form, 4.1 kg for the ISO E head form, 4.7 kg for the 
ISO J head form, 5.6 kg for the ISO M head form and 6.1 kg for the ISO O head 
form.
            
d. A 
guidance system such that the head form/support assembly is guided in a vertical 
drop onto a test anvil.  This guidance system may consist of two or more 
wires or one or more rails.  The head form/support - guidance system - test 
anvil alignment shall be such that:
            
d1.  
The drop trajectory shall be a straight line within 3º of vertical and within 5º 
of the sensitive axis of the uniaxial accelerometer.
            
d2.  
The line parallel to the drop trajectory and passing through the center of the 
head form ball-socket shall pass within 5 mm of the center of the test anvil, 
within 10 mm of the center of gravity of the head form/support assembly, and 
within 5 mm of the sensitive element of the uniaxial accelerometer.  
            
e. A 
rigid anvil mount consisting of a solid mass of at least 500 kg.  The upper 
surface of the anvil mount shall consist of a steel plate with a minimum 
thickness of 12 mm and a minimum surface area of 0.10 m2.
            
f. 
Three test anvils: flat, hemispherical and edge.  
            
f1.  The 
flat anvil shall have a minimum surface area of 0.0127 m2, e.g. 127 
mm diameter face.  When fixed in position on the anvil mount, the surface 
shall be perpendicular to the head form trajectory.
            
f2.  
The hemispherical anvil shall have a 48 ±0.5 mm radius.  
            
f3.  
The edge anvil shall have a striking face 6.3 mm wide with a depth of at least 
35 mm.  The radius of the edges on the impact face shall not exceed 0.5 mm.  
When in position, the striking face shall be perpendicular to the head form 
trajectory.   The anvil shall be sufficiently long that the ends do not contact 
the helmet during impact.  
            
g. A 
uniaxial accelerometer.  The acceleration data channel must comply with SAE 
recommended practice J 211 requirements for channel class 1000 with the 
exception that the frequency response need not include the range from dc to 10 
hz which may not be obtainable using certain types of transducers.
            
h. A 
velocity measurement device which will yield the velocity of the head 
form/support assembly within the last 40 mm of travel before impact.  The 
velocity measurement must be accurate to within ±1%.  
E4.2    
Test Definitions
            
a. The 
impact site refers to the portion of the helmet struck during an impact test.  
It is defined as the point where a line passing through the center of the head 
form ball and the center of the anvil intersects the outer surface of the helmet 
at the instant the helmet first touches the anvil.
            
b. The 
impact velocity is the velocity of the head form/support assembly as measured 
within no more than 4 cm of the first contact between the helmet and the impact 
surface.
            
c.   This standard specifies nominal impact velocities which must 
be adjusted in order to allow for deviations between the actual mass of the test 
head form assembly and the specified ideal value.  The actual test impact 
velocity shall be the specified nominal velocity multiplied by the square root 
of the value obtained by dividing the ideal head form assembly mass by the 
actual mass.  For example, if, for the ‘A’ head form, the mass of the head 
form plus ball-arm/collar and support assembly as in paragraph E4.1c masses 3.2 
kg instead of the ideal mass of 3.1 kg, the test impact velocities shall be 
obtained by multiplying the nominal velocities by a factor of 0.984. 
            
d. 
There are two levels of test: the first is the standard level used to identify 
those helmets which definitely meet this standard.  It is applied to 
samples submitted for certification testing and to those acquired for the 
Foundation’s random sample test (RST) program.  The second is the deviation 
level which is applied to samples acquired for second round RST procedures, that 
is: testing of samples of currently certified models for which previous samples 
have obtained failing results in RST testing.   Failure to meet test 
criteria at the deviation levels indicates that the sample definitely does not 
meet the requirements of the standard.  
E4.3 Test Impacts
            
Test impact sites shall be on or above the test line.  Rivets, vents and 
any other helmet feature within this region shall be valid test sites.  
Each impact site will be subjected to a group of one or two impacts according to 
the anvil selected for that site. 
            
The impact site for the first impact within in a group is the target for the 
successive impacts in the same group.  However, if an impact group is sited 
closer than 120 mm to any previous impact group, that later impact shall be 
declared invalid.
            
There is no restriction regarding test anvil selection.  The impact 
velocities for each test impact depend on the type of test and on the head form 
designation.  Second impacts do not apply to helmets in tests against the 
edge anvil.
            
The technician may select either the largest or smallest appropriate head form 
for any particular group of impacts.  In all cases the technician may 
impact any site on the helmet surface on or within the test lines as drawn for 
any of the head forms considered appropriate for that helmet. 
            
The nominal impact velocities are listed in the following table:

a.
Each site tested against the flat anvil shall be tested according to the values 
in the impact velocity table adjusted for the mass of the head form assembly.
            
b.
Each site tested against the hemispherical anvil shall be tested according to 
the values in the impact velocity table adjusted for the mass of the head form 
assembly. 
            
c.
Each site tested against the edge anvil shall be tested according to the values 
in the impact velocity table adjusted for the mass of the head form assembly.  
No helmet shall be subjected to the second impact for this anvil.
            
d.
If the impact velocity for any test impact exceeds the specified mass adjusted 
velocity by more than 1.5%, that impact shall be declared invalid.
            
Please Note: The impacts described above are based on specific velocities 
and not prescribed drop heights.  To attain the proper velocity for an 
impact, it is likely that the drop height will need to be adjusted to compensate 
for frictions inherent in most mechanical helmet testing systems. Height 
adjustments for these frictions should not account for more than 10% of the 
total drop height.  Also, the 1.5% margin allowed for impact velocity 
reflects the uncertainties expected even for well maintained drop equipment.  
It is expected that drop heights will always be selected to produce, as closely 
as possible, the precise impact velocity as called out in the standards and 
adjusted for head form assembly drop mass.

The peak acceleration of the head form shall not exceed the values in the table 
above depending on the head form.  The helmet’s protective structures shall not 
break apart throughout the testing.  If the Foundation's technical 
personnel conclude that fracture of the helmet shell, impact liner, retention 
system or other components could reasonably imply an undue laceration hazard 
either from the impact surface or from the helmet itself, the sample shall be 
considered to have failed.
            
A flip-up configuration helmet sample tested with the chin bar closure locked at 
the outset of any of the first three impacts performed upon it in testing 
and which “flips-up” inadvertently as a result of a valid test will also be 
deemed to have failed.  In most cases, each helmet must not “flip-up” as a 
result of two impacts applied to the first site tested and the first of the two 
impacts at the second site.
            
If, in certification testing, a sample is found to meet all the test criteria 
but any two of the impacts were at less than 98.5% of the specified impact 
velocity as adjusted for drop assembly mass, the testing for that sample shall 
be declared inconclusive and must be repeated.  Similarly, if there are two 
instances where an impact falls beyond 10 mm from the first impacts in its 
group, the testing for the sample shall be declared inconclusive and must be 
repeated.  Finally, if an invalid impact produces a peak acceleration 
exceeding the test criterion, the testing for the sample shall be declared 
inconclusive and must be repeated.
            
The impact test procedures leave considerable latitude to the helmet tester 
regarding site and anvil selection.  It is expected that the tester will 
orchestrate each standard test series in order to investigate potential 
weaknesses and to exercise each likely failure mode and will conduct deviation 
level testing to exercise the failure modes identified previously.
            
If at the end of a certification test series, the Foundation's technical 
personnel conclude that the results obtained in valid impacts are not sufficient 
to determine whether the helmet model meets the performance requirements of this 
standard, additional samples may be conditioned and tested.  It is expected 
that all samples submitted will meet all the test requirements.
E5.  Chin Bar 
Test
            
The chin bar test applies to full face helmets only.  At least one helmet 
in each certification series shall be tested.  The helmet shall be firmly 
mounted on a rigid base so that the chin bar faces up and the reference plane is 
at 65 ±5º from horizontal.  A mass of 5 ± .2 kg with a flat striking face 
of 0.01 m5
minimum area shall be dropped in a guided fall so as to strike the central 
portion of the chin bar with an impact velocity of 3.5 ±0.2 m/sec.  The 
maximum downward deflection of the chin bar must not exceed 60 mm nor shall any 
component fail so as to cause a potential injury to the wearer.
E6.  Shell 
Penetration Test
            
The shell penetration test may be applied to helmets kept at laboratory ambient 
temperature and humidity or helmets conditioned hot, cold or wet. At least one 
helmet sample shall be tested in shell penetration.  The complete helmet 
shall be placed on a rigidly mounted head form.  The test head form for the 
penetration test need not be the standard ISO head form shape used in the impact 
testing and helmet marking.  It is expected only that the device used will 
provide reasonable support for the helmet and conformance with the interior of 
the helmet immediately beneath the site of the penetration test.  If the 
helmet contains a sling or some other adjustable sizing component, it shall be 
relaxed to its most extendable position.
            
The penetration test striker shall have a mass of 3 kg ±50 g and the point of 
the striker shall be a cone with an included angle of 60º ±0.5º and an altitude 
of 38 ±0.38 mm.  The striking tip shall have a hardness of 60 Rockwell 
(scale C ± 3 points) and a radius of 0.5 ± 0.1 mm.  The region of the 
support head form directly beneath the striker tip shall be wax or soft plastic 
so and covered with a thin tell-tale of paper, foil, tape or some similar 
material.
            
The striker shall be dropped to strike the surface of the helmet shell at a 
velocity of 7.45 ±
0.15 meters per second as measured when the striker is no more than 4 
centimeters away from contact with the helmet. The helmet may be oriented on the 
support head form so that the test striker is directed at any site on or above 
the test line but the penetration test site must be at least 7.5 cm removed from 
the center of any impact test site or any other penetration test site.  At 
the test technician’s discretion, samples may be tested at more than one site on 
the shell.
            
For all penetration tests performed, the test striker must not penetrate through 
the helmet wall so as to put a hole in the tell-tale between the helmet and the 
support head form.
E7.  
Face Shield Penetration Test
            
If a face shield is provided with a full face helmet, this face shield shall be 
tested for penetration resistance in the following manner:
            
The face shield shall be tested on the appropriate helmet, correctly deployed 
across the facial opening and under laboratory ambient conditions.  A soft 
lead pellet weighing 1 ±0.1 g with a diameter of 5.5 ±0.1 mm and traveling at a 
velocity of 500 ±20 km per hour shall strike the face shield normal to the 
surface.  The face shield shall be tested in at least three different 
locations:  the center line and 80 ±5 mm to either side of the center line.  
The pellet must not penetrate to the interior of the helmet.
E8.  Removability
            
The helmet removability test determines whether the helmet can be removed from 
an unconscious victim without resorting to any buckles, clasps or other 
mechanisms which may be rendered non-functional by impact stresses.  The 
helmet is placed on the largest appropriate complete ISO head form with all the 
closures and retention systems engaged.  A technician must remove the 
helmet from the head form using simple, common hand tools but without accessing 
any of the helmet mechanisms.
            
The hand tools for this test are limited to shears, simple edged tools and flat 
bladed screw drivers.  The operation must not require more than thirty 
seconds. 
E9.  Post-testing 
Disassembly and Inspection
            
If a set of helmets is submitted for and passes certification testing, at least 
one of the tested samples shall be disassembled and inspected.  If the 
laboratory staff identifies any internal feature that is not plausible for 
inclusion in a production helmet, the model shall be rejected.  If an 
internal projection on the helmet shell is deemed to present an undue laceration 
or puncture hazard, the model shall be rejected.  In evaluating these 
internal projections, no allowance shall be made for liner thickness.
            
At the discretion of the technician, any helmet may be disassembled in order to 
check for internal projections, plausibility or for deviations from the 
originally certified configuration.

Special Note to Helmet Users
There are four reasons for you to be
interested in this Standard:
1.   
Auto racing imposes risks of death or
permanent impairment due to head injury.
2.   
The proper use of protective helmets can
minimize the risk of death or permanent impairment.� 
3.   
The protective capacity of a helmet is
difficult to estimate, particularly at the time of purchase or use.��
Protective capability is currently
measured by destructive testing which is beyond the means of most helmet
wearers. 
4.   
Snell
certification backed by ongoing destructive testing samples taken randomly from
dealers and distributors identifies those helmet models providing and
maintaining the highest levels of head protection.
Six of the most critical elements affecting a
helmet's protective properties are:
1.   
Impact
management - how well the helmet protects against collisions with large
objects.
2.   
Helmet
positional stability - whether the helmet will be in place, on the head, when
it's needed.
3.   
Retention
system strength - whether the chin straps are sufficiently strong to hold the
helmet throughout a head impact.
4.   
Extent
of Protection - the area of the head protected by the helmet.
5.   
Flame Resistance - whether the helmet will withstand
exposure to direct flame. This flame resistance may well mean survival for well
belted drivers and passengers in a crashed vehicle where a few seconds of
additional time may enable escape or rescue.
6.   
Frontal Head Restraints � whether the helmet is
appropriate for use with tether systems intended to divert the inertial load of
the wearer�s head and helmet away from the cervical spine in crash impact
conditions. 
����������� This Standard describes simple
tests for all of these items.� However, the tests for the second item, helmet
stability, of necessity presume that the helmet is well matched to the wearer's
head and that it has been carefully adjusted to obtain the best fit possible.�
Unless you take similar care in the selection and fitting of your own helmet,
you may not obtain the level of protection that current headgear can provide. 
����������� The Foundation recommends the
simple, straightforward procedure recommended to consumers by most helmet
manufacturers:
����������� Position the helmet on your head
so that it sits low on your forehead; if you can't see the edge of the brim at
the extreme upper range of your vision, the helmet is probably out of place.�
Adjust the retention system so that when in use, it will hold the helmet firmly
in place.� This positioning and adjusting should be repeated to obtain the very
best result possible.� The procedure initially may be time consuming.� Take
the time.
����������� Try to remove the helmet without
undoing the retention system closures.� If the helmet comes off or shifts over
your eyes, readjust and try again.� If no adjustment seems to work, this helmet
is not for you; try another.
����������� This procedure is also the basis
of the test for helmet stability described in this Standard.� This test
performs the same steps but uses standard head forms.� However, you must still
perform this procedure for yourself when buying a helmet and every time you
wear a helmet.� Only in this way will you be able to make all the proper
adjustments to get the best fit possible.� Furthermore, your test on your own head
will be an improvement on ours; you will determine whether the helmet is
appropriate for you personally.
����������� There are several other important
aspects of helmets to consider.� Full face helmets provide a measure of
protection from facial injuries.� The external shell of these helmets includes
a rigid "chin" guard that passes from left to right over the lower
part of the face.� The Foundation has devised special tests for the chin bars
of full face helmets.
����������� There are two varieties of full
face helmets. The chin guard may be an integral, immovable part of the helmet
but, in so-called �modular� or �flip-up� helmets the chin guard may be hinged
so that, when released, it will pivot or flip up and out of the way for the
rider�s convenience. Modular helmets must meet all the same requirements as
those equipped with integral chin bars with the additional requirement that the
chin guard release mechanism must be sufficiently secure to prevent inadvertent
opening in a crash impact.� 
����������� Some helmets come with a separate
structure which bolts to the helmet and which is intended to cover the lower
part of the face.� These removable chin bars are often intended to deflect
small stones and debris encountered in some motor sports and may not be
effective facial protection in falls and accidents.� The Foundation does not
test removable chin bars and considers any headgear equipped with them to be an
open face helmet.
����������� If a full face helmet is equipped
with a face shield, it may also provide a measure of eye protection.� The Foundation
tests the face shields of full face helmets for particle penetration
resistance.� Face shields provided with open face helmets generally do not
provide the same levels of eye protection and, for that reason are not
considered.
����������� The shells of both open and full
face helmets should also provide a measure of protection from penetration.� The
Foundation tests the shells of both full and open face helmets for penetration
resistance.
����������� Effective headgear must be
removable.� Paramedics and other emergency personnel must be able to quickly
remove headgear from accident victims in order to check for vital signs and to
perform emergency procedures.� The Foundation has devised tests and criteria
for helmet removability.
����������� The Foundation tests helmets for
visual field.� The helmet must provide a minimum range of vision as measured on
standard head forms.� However, the range of vision you obtain may vary
considerably from our measurement.
����������� It is also important to remember
that the visual field requirements are based on the needs of people
participating in well regulated and controlled events.� For this reason, the
requirements are considerably less than those the Foundation requires for
street use headgear such as for motorcycle helmets.� Be absolutely certain that
the helmet and face shield permit you adequate vision for every intended use.�
Specifically, if your automotive racing helmet is only sufficient for
controlled track events, don't use it for street motorcycling.
����������� There are several important
factors which the Foundation does not consider directly but which bear on the
effectiveness of protective helmets.� Be certain your helmet is wearable, that
is, that it's comfortable and adequately ventilated when worn for prolonged
periods.� Few people will wear an uncomfortable helmet.� A helmet that is not
worn won't protect anyone.
FOREWORD
����������� In a racing accident, drivers and
passengers may suffer injury or death.� Helmets on the market today offer
varying degrees of protection, but the consumer has little basis for judging
the relative effectiveness of a given model.� This Standard presents rational
methods for identifying those helmet models which definitely meet specified
standards for impact (crash) protection and retention system strength and,
afterwards, identifying� those which definitely have ceased to meet those
standards.
����������� The Snell Foundation urges that
protective helmets be required for all individuals participating in supervised
racing events and encourages the general public to wear helmets which meet appropriate
performance standards[1].
����������� This 2015 Standard establishes
performance characteristics particularly suited to the conditions of automotive
racing which may include complete harness and restraint systems, elaborate roll
cages and reduced visual field requirements.� This Standard does not
establish construction and material specifications.� The Foundation does not
recommend specific materials or designs.� Manufacturers voluntarily submit
helmets to be tested to this Standard and if the submitted helmets pass, a
certification is issued.
����������� The Foundation will make
available the identity of those products which have been Snell certified but
will not attempt to rank those products according to performance nor to any
other criteria.� Neither does the Foundation distinguish between the needs of
participants in competitive events and those of the general public. 
����������� All of the requirements described
herein, including both initial certification and random sample testing, are an
integral part of this Standard.� No helmet can satisfy the Standard unless it
is subject to both certification and random sample testing by the Foundation.
����������� Snell certification for
protective headgear requires a specific contractual agreement between the
primary headgear manufacturer and the Foundation.� Certification procedures may
be obtained upon application to the Foundation.
����������� SNELL MEMORIAL FOUNDATION is a
registered certification mark and SA2015 is a certification mark of the Snell
Memorial Foundation.
INTRODUCTION
����������� This Standard addresses the
problem of protecting the head from direct impact with surfaces or objects that
might be encountered in a racing accident.� The Standard prescribes direct
measures of several factors bearing on a helmet's ability to protect the head
as well as its general serviceability as automotive racing headgear.� Thus,
this Standard is directed towards the kinds of performance bearing on head
protection that may not readily be discernable by even knowledgeable consumers
at the time of purchase. 
����������� Some of these performance
requirements have been expressed in terms of limitations on the various
components and features of the single general helmet configuration currently
available.� These expressions have been used only for the sake of clarity and
should not be misinterpreted as requiring specific configurations or
materials.� As newer helmet technologies appear, these limitations will be
re-examined and, perhaps, restated.
����������� A racing helmet consists
generally of a rigid head covering and a retention system composed of flexible
straps and hardware.� The rigid covering consists of a strong, stiff outer
shell and a crushable liner.� The stiff outer shell protects by its capacity to
spread a concentrated load at its outer surface over a larger area of the liner
and the wearer's head.� The crushable liner protects the head from direct
impact by its capacity to manage impact energy.� �Since there is no certain way
to anticipate the severity of a head impact or whether the impact surface will be
such that it will spread the load over the helmet or concentrate it at a single
point, the most generally effective helmet will combine the strongest, stiffest
possible outer shell with a liner chosen to limit the peak deceleration of the
wearer�s head to within tolerable limits. 
����������� Full face helmets including
�modular� or �flip-up� helmets provide a measure of facial protection in
addition to the impact protection generally sought.� The principle feature of
these is a chin bar that extends forward to cover the jaw area converting the
facial opening into a visual port.� Frequently, a face shield is also provided
so that the wearer's face is completely covered.
����������� In traditional full face helmets,
the chin bar is an integral, immovable part of the helmet structure.� In
�modular� or �flip-up� full face configurations, the chin bar may be released
to pivot about a hinge up and away from the face.� The security of the chin bar
closure is of special concern. Most of the tests prescribed in this standard
will be conducted with the chin bar closed and secured; failure of the chin bar
closure will generally be a cause for rejection. 
����������� Although other helmets may be
configured to allow the use of �bolt-on� chin bar elements, these helmets are
not considered to be full face and are treated instead as open face
configurations.����� 
����������� The retention system holds the
headgear in position throughout normal usage and especially during falls and
accidents, ensuring that the helmet will be in place to manage a direct impact.�
This Standard applies two different tests to the retention system.� The first
of these tests for stability by fitting the headgear to a standard head form
and then attempting to displace it by applying tangential shock loadings.� The
second tests retention system strength by applying a shock load to the system
components through a simulated chin.
����������� The quality of the fit and the
care taken with the adjustments are absolutely critical elements in these
tests.� The manufacturer must provide suitable guidance so that the wearer
will be able to select and adjust headgear to obtain the necessary quality of
fit and positional stability.
����������� The capacity for impact
protection is determined by direct measurement of the shock delivered through
the helmet to a head form when the helmeted head form is dropped in a specified
manner onto any of three unyielding anvils.� A fourth anvil is used to test
impact protection for repeated strikes against a roll cage assembly.� In
addition to meeting all other test criteria, the chin bar closure on flip up
helmet configurations must remain securely engaged for the first three impact
tests conducted on any helmet sample.
����������� Most racing helmets are intended
to accommodate a range of head sizes and shapes.� Various thicknesses of
resilient padding are sometimes placed within otherwise identical helmets
during production or during fitting to configure the helmet to several
different ranges of head size.� This resilient padding does not significantly
affect the way the helmet absorbs and attenuates impact and is not directly
addressed in this Standard.
����������� The helmet must also resist
penetration by sharp edged and pointed projections and projectiles.� This
capacity is tested by placing the helmet on a head form and dropping a metal
cone of specified mass and geometry onto the shell.� The tip of this cone must
not penetrate to the head form.
����������� Similarly, the helmets must
resist chemical attack by bodily fluids as well as solvents and chemicals
associated with motorsports.� This capacity may be tested by applying a solvent
mix before further conditioning and testing.
����������� Since auto racing drivers are
frequently unable to escape quickly from accident involved vehicles, their
helmets must also provide a measure of protection against fire.� Exposed helmet
components, whether internal or external, must be flame resistant.� They must
not be combustible and, when exposed to high temperatures, must self extinguish
when the heat load is removed.� 
����������� Helmet components are tested
separately for flame resistance by exposing them to a direct propane flame of a
specified temperature for specified time periods.� When the flame is withdrawn,
each of these components must self extinguish within a specified time limit.�
Furthermore, when the helmet shell is tested, the temperature of the padding or
lining materials within the helmet that would presumably touch the wearer's
head must not exceed 70�C.
����������� The chin strap must also be flame
resistant.� The chin strap will be tested similarly to other helmet
components.� It must not melt and must self extinguish within the allowed time.

����������� For full face helmets, this
Standard tests the rigidity of the chin bar by dropping a weight onto it at a
specified velocity so as to attempt to force the chin bar toward the interior
of the helmet.� The chin bar must not deflect more than a specified amount and,
if the helmet is a flip-up configuration, the chin-bar must remain securely
closed.
����������� If a face shield is provided with
a full face helmet, then this face shield must resist penetration by small
particles.� A sharp lead pellet of a specified weight is directed into the face
shield at a specified velocity.� The pellet must not penetrate into the helmet
interior.
����������� This face shield must also
withstand a flame resistance test.� As with other components, the face shield
must be self extinguishing within an allotted time.� Furthermore, the face
shield must not melt down allowing the flame to reach the interior of the
helmet.� Also, this face shield must have a positive "hold down".�
Since inadvertent displacement of the face shield during racing could have
disastrous consequences, the only way to remove or raise the face shield from
its normal operating position must involve the deliberate disengagement of some
catch mechanism.� Friction mechanisms will not satisfy this requirement.
����������� Auto racing helmets must also
include accommodations for frontal head restraints.� These consist of a metal
inserts in the helmet shell which will allow the attachment of tether mounts
appropriate to one of several available frontal head restraint systems.�
Requirements for these inserts are described in FIA 8858-2010 Frontal Head
Restraints.� Helmet owners who select and install their own tether mount hardware
must take care to use only appropriate equipment.� The inserts are metric and
may be permanently damaged by non-metric hardware. �
����������� This Standard also includes a
test intended to determine whether the headgear may be removed from an
unconscious accident victim quickly, easily and reliably in spite of any damage
the headgear might reasonably be expected to sustain.� Traditional helmet
architectures have satisfied this requirement so readily that many Standards
including previous Snell Foundation Standards have not mentioned it.� Even so,
it is unthinkable that a headgear might protect its wearer in an accident only
to thwart attempts at rescue afterward.
����������� Inadequate ventilation may render
a helmet unwearable in hot climates, especially if the helmet is full faced.� But
this Standard makes no direct demands on either the quantity or quality of air
flow to the wearer.
����������� Other general features of racing
helmets may include eyeshades and accommodations for goggles, and visibility
enhancements such as bright colors and reflective surfaces.� These features all
deal with matters of safety and comfort that are not directly addressed in this
Standard but which merit the consideration of wearers as well as manufacturers.
����������� �Although helmet use has been
shown to reduce the risk of head injuries significantly, there are limits to a
helmet's protective capability.� No helmet can protect the wearer against all
foreseeable accidents.� Therefore injury may occur in accidents which exceed
the protective capability of any helmet including even those helmets meeting
the requirements of this Standard.
����������� A helmet's protective capability
may be exhausted protecting the wearer in an accident.� Helmets are constructed
so that the energy of a blow is managed by the helmet, causing its partial
destruction.� The damage may not be readily apparent and the Foundation
strongly recommends that a helmet involved in an accident be returned to the
manufacturer for complete inspection.� If it is not possible to do so, the
helmet should always be destroyed and replaced.
����������� Finally, the protective
capability may diminish over time.� Some helmets are made of materials which
deteriorate with age and therefore have a limited life span.� At the present
time, the Foundation recommends that motor sports helmets be replaced after
five (5) years, or less if the manufacturer so recommends.
CONSTRUCTION
A.� General
����������� The assembled helmet shall have
smooth external and internal surfaces.� Any feature projecting more than 7 mm
beyond the outer surface must readily break away; all other projections on the
outer surface shall be smoothly faired and offer minimal frictional resistance
to tangential impact forces.� Rivets and similar projections into the helmet
interior must offer no laceration or puncture hazard.� Restraint clips may be
used at the rear or on the side of the helmet.� The helmet shall provide as
nearly uniform impact protection over the entire protected area as is possible.
����������� If the absence of any detachable
component of the helmet does not prevent its being worn, then this absence must
not compromise either the retention system or the impact protection.� If any
part of the helmet detaches during testing, it must offer no laceration or
puncture hazard nor reduce the coverage of the head.
����������� If the manufacturer provides
add-ons such as visors, face shields and neck curtains with the helmet, these
add-ons must not lessen the protective capability of the basic helmet nor
reduce the visual field below standard requirements nor create a direct hazard
for the wearer.

����������� If rivets are used, the heads
shall not have sharp edges and shall not project more than 2 mm from the outer
surface of the helmet.
C.�
Ventilation
����������� Ventilation inlets and outlets
may be used provided they are made of flexible materials such as rubber or
vinyl plastic.� Ports and fittings for forced air ventilation must comply with
all the general requirements on helmet features.� When connected to the forced
air sources, these ports and fittings must not limit the range of motion of the
head and must not interfere with a quick escape from the vehicle.
D.�
Materials
����������� Ideally, materials used in the
manufacture of the helmet should be of durable quality and not be harmed by
exposure to sun, rain, dust, vibration, sweat or products applied to the skin
or hair.� Similarly, the materials should not degrade due to temperature
extremes likely to be encountered in routine storage or transportation. ��������� Materials
which are known to cause skin irritation or are conducive to disease shall not
be used for the parts which contact the skin.� Materials which support the
growth of fungi or algae shall not be used.� Fabric lining or padding
materials, if used, may be detachable for the purpose of washing so long as
their absence does not degrade the protective capabilities of the helmet.
E.� Finish
����������� All edges of the helmet shall be
smoothed and rounded with no rigid projections on the inside of the shell that
might injure the wearer's head in the event of impact.
F.�
Retention System
����������� The retention system shall be
designed so as to discourage misuse.� That is, of all the ways in which the
retention system might be used, the design use shall be the simplest and
quickest to implement.� Helmets shall not be fitted with
"non-essential" features which, if misused, can degrade the
performance.� Quick release buckles, if used, shall not be able to be released
inadvertently. 
����������� Fabric chinstraps, if used, shall
not be secured to the shell by a bolt, pin or rivet passing through the fabric
itself.� Although other alternatives may be proposed, the preferred method of
attachment is that the strap be looped through and sewn about a metal hanger
which can then be secured to the shell by bolt, rivet or other appropriate
means. 
G.�
Peripheral Vision
����������� The helmet shall provide peripheral
visual clearance as measured using a reference head form appropriate to the
size of the helmet.� This peripheral vision includes a horizontal clearance of
at least 180�, an upward clearance of at least 5� and a downward
clearance of at least 20�.� However, this downward clearance makes specific
allowance for breath deflectors.� These clearances are described in terms of
planes fixed in the reference head forms. 
����������� Some competitive applications may
require helmets with more restricted visual fields.� When justified, special
addenda to this Standard will define reduced visual fields, the procedures for
determining whether a helmet satisfies the requirement and the additional
labeling requirements warning that the headgear may be appropriate only for certain
uses.
H.� Sizing
����������� The requirements of this standard
are such that most helmets will perform optimally only when tested within a
range of head circumferences.� Outside this range, helmets may still provide a
measure of protection but they may not meet requirements for certification.�
The manufacturer must specify this entire range when helmets are submitted for
certification. �Later, when helmets are distributed for sale, every helmet
shall include a permanent label indicating the range of head circumferences for
which it is intended.� 
QUALIFICATIONS FOR
CERTIFICATION
����������� For qualification testing,
helmets shall be in the same condition as those offered for sale.� No helmet or
component which has been subjected to any tests described in this Standard
shall be offered for sale after testing.� At least eight (8)
and as many as ten (10) complete helmets must be submitted by the manufacturer
for a certification test program for each distinct structural configuration of
the models offered for sale.� All but one of these samples will be destroyed in
testing; the untested sample shall be retained for comparison and reference.� 
����������� If different fit pad
configurations are planned in order to accommodate this head gear for different
size ranges, six of the samples submitted must be configured for the largest
size range.� The remaining samples may be configured for the smallest intended
size.� Additional samples representing other fit pad configurations may also be
provided at the discretion of the submitter.� 
MODIFICATIONS
����������� Cosmetic changes to certified
headgear are permissible.� Such changes are generally limited to marking or
trimming the headgear with manufacturer approved paint or tape.� Otherwise,
modifications to certified headgear effectively create new configurations which
shall not have the confidence and certification of the Foundation until
properly evaluated.� Manufacturers must not place the Foundation's
certification label in any modified headgear without the Foundation�s written
authorization.
����������� The Foundation recommends that
helmet owners not modify or contract with someone else to modify their
helmets.� Any structural modification may adversely affect a helmet's
protective capability.� The Foundation�s certification and, quite likely, all
manufacturer warranties apply to the headgear only in its as manufactured
condition.� 
RANDOM SAMPLE TESTING
����������� In addition to the certification
testing, the Foundation will routinely obtain and test samples of previously
certified models.� These samples will be selected from among those stocks
intended for retail sale to consumers.� In this manner, the Foundation will
attempt to ensure that the helmets made available to the public continue to
meet the performance requirements of this Standard.
����������� For those cases in which helmets
are provided directly to users and do not pass through a normal sales
distribution system, the Foundation will set up alternative procedures to
monitor certified products.� Specifically, if helmets are provided directly to
teams or individuals for use in events, the Foundation must have access to the
helmets for spot checking and non-destructive evaluation.
LABELING AND MARKING
����������� Each
helmet shall have durable, visible and legible labeling identifying the
manufacturer, the month and year of manufacture, the model and the size.�
Labeling shall be uncoded and either in English or a language common to the
area where the helmets are to be distributed.� The headgear shall also be
labeled to the following effect:
1.   
The
Certification ID#: This number consists of two alpha characters, four numerics,
a hyphen and two more numerics indicating the year in which the certification
was awarded. This certification id# is marked on the test reports, cover letter
and the certificate awarded to the helmet maker shortly after the helmet met
requirements, it identifies the tests and the archive samples on which the
certification is based.
2.  No
helmet can protect the wearer against all foreseeable impacts.� However, for
maximum protection, the helmet must be of good fit and the retention system
must be securely fastened to retain the helmet.� The helmet, when fitted and
fastened, shall not be removed easily.
3.   
This
helmet is so constructed that the energy of an impact may be absorbed through
its partial destruction, though damage may not be visible.� If it suffers an
impact, it must either be returned to the manufacturer for inspection or be
destroyed and replaced.
4.   
Intended
for head circumferences from XX cm through YY cm.
����������� If any of the helmet components
are sensitive to common solvents, adhesives, paints or cleansers; the helmet
must also bear labels to the following effect:
����������� This helmet can be seriously
damaged by some common substances without visible damage.� Apply only the
following:� (Recommended cleaning agents, paints, adhesives and the like) as
appropriate.� 
����������� If the helmet model was certified
according to a special addendum to this standard, each helmet shall also
include the warning labels required by that addendum.
����������� Each helmet shall also include
one of the Foundation's serialized certification labels.� The Snell
certification label shall be placed either inside or on the outside of the
helmet, as appropriate, in such a way that it cannot be removed intact.
����������� The registered trademark
(certification label) of the Snell Memorial Foundation may be used by the
manufacturer only under license from the Snell Memorial Foundation.� The
specifics of licensure may be obtained from the Foundation.
MARKING AND LABELING OF
CRITICAL COMPONENTS
����������� If a helmet component may
reasonably be replaced with an inappropriate substitute that might degrade
wearer safety and performance in any of the tests called out in this standard,
the manufacturer must mark those components so that users may avoid the
purchase and use of inappropriate replacement parts.�� In particular, face
shields on full face helmets must be marked to identify the manufacturer and
the month and year of manufacture.












HEAD FORMS
����������� This standard invokes six
standard head forms for helmet inspection, marking and testing.� The geometry
of these head forms is according to the definitions for the �A�, �C�, �E�, �J�,
�M�, and �O� head forms described in International Standards Organization (ISO)
Draft Standard ISO DIS 6220-1983.� The impact mass specifications for the
impact test phase are comparable to those in ECE 22-05 for these same head form
designations.

����������� ISO DIS 6220-1983 includes
descriptions for half head forms suitable for guided fall impact testing or for
full head forms such as those used in the positional stability tests.� Figures
1 and 2 depict the general shapes of the half head form configuration.� The
table lists useful dimensions from the two references given above.
EXTENT OF PROTECTION
����������� The extent of protection
corresponds to that region of the head for which protection is sought.� 
����������� There are a number of planes
fixed in the geometry of these head forms as shown in Figure 1.� This
description of the extent of protection uses the ISO definitions of the basic plane,
the longitudinal plane, the transverse plane and the reference plane.� Other
planes have also been defined strictly for convenience and clarity.
����������� The basic plane corresponds to
the anatomical plane (Frankfort plane) that includes the auditory meatuses and
the inferior orbital rims.� The reference plane is above and parallel to the
basic plane. The longitudinal or midsagittal plane is perpendicular to the
basic plane and is the plane of symmetry dividing the right half of the head
form from the left. �The transverse or coronal plane is perpendicular to both
the longitudinal and basic planes.� It corresponds to the anatomical plane that
contains the two auditory meatuses and divides the front from the rear portions
of the head.
����������� These planes are all well known
entities.� Several other planes, however, have proven useful.� The S0
plane is parallel to the basic plane and lies above it at a distance determined
by the size of the head form.� The S3 plane is parallel to the S0
plane and the basic plane and lies between them.� The S4 plane is
also parallel to these planes and lies below the basic plane.
����������� The rear plane divides the rear
third of the head from the front two thirds.� It is parallel to the transverse
plane and lies at a given distance behind the point where the
reference plane and
longitudinal planes intersect with the front surface of the head form.� The
distance from this point, hereafter called the reference point, is determined
by the size of the head form.� The fore plane is also parallel to the
transverse plane.� It lies behind the reference point at a distance determined
by the size of the head form.
����������� The extent of protection provided
by the helmet must include the entire region above the S0 plane and
forward of the fore plane, the entire region above the S3 plane and
between the fore and rear planes and the entire region above the S4
plane and behind the rear plane.� Figure 2 and the associated table lay out
these additional defined features and show the extent of protection and the
test line.

TESTING
A.�
Inspection 
����������� Each
helmet will be inspected for the required labels and for compliance with the
general limitations made on structure.� Samples received for certification
testing must incorporate all the critical component labels but other labeling
is not necessary for evaluation.� Samples received for RST (enforcement)
testing must have all the required labels. 
����������� Some
helmets may incorporate innovations and other features not anticipated by this
Standard but which raise concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the
headgear.� These will be referred to members of the Foundation's Board of
Directors for evaluation.� Any feature deemed to reduce the protective capacity
of the headgear, whether explicitly mentioned in this Standard or not, will be
a cause for rejection. 
B.� Head
Forms and Helmet Positioning
The
determination of which head forms are appropriate to a helmet is based on the
specified smallest and largest head circumferences for the helmet.� For samples
submitted for certification, this specification must include the smallest and
largest values of head circumference for every possible fit pad configuration
of the helmet.� For helmets received for RST testing, the smallest and largest
head circumferences will be taken directly from the helmet label.
If
the smallest head circumference specified for the helmet is less than 50 cm,
the A head form is the smallest appropriate.� Otherwise, the smallest
appropriate head form for a particular helmet is the largest of the six head
forms whose circumference is no greater than the manufacturer�s specified
smallest circumference. The largest appropriate head form is the largest of the
six specified head forms whose circumference is no greater than the
manufacturer�s specified largest circumference.

If
the test samples are determined to be too small to accommodate the largest head
form identified as appropriate, the next smaller head form shall be considered
the largest appropriate.� If the samples are too small for even the smallest
appropriate head form as indicated by the manufacture specification, the
samples shall be rejected for certification.
The
table shows which head forms will be used in certification testing for various
head size specifications.� Since the largest head size should never be smaller
than the smallest head size, most of the lower left region of the table is
blank.� 
If
the size specification corresponds to one of the light gray cells along the
table�s main diagonal, only a single test head form will be necessary and the
manufacturer need only submit seven samples identical samples six of which must
be configured with comfort padding for the largest intended head size for
certification testing.� The seventh sample may be configured with comfort
padding intended for the smallest intended head size.� If the size
specification corresponds to any other cell indicating that the helmet is
appropriate for testing on two or more different head forms, two more samples
are required, identical to the first seven in all respects except that the
comfort padding may be configured for the smallest intended head size.
����������� During
testing, helmets will be positioned on the selected test head form according to
the manufacturer�s specified helmet positioning indices.� If the manufacturer
fails to provide positioning information with certification samples, the
helmets will be positioned according to the best judgment of the authorized
technical personnel.� If the helmets meet certification requirements, the
helmet positioning indices will be those used in all future testing.
����������� These
helmet positioning indices represent distances on the front of the head form
from the basic plane along the intersection with the longitudinal plane upward to
the lower brow edge of the helmet.� Helmet positioning indices will be assigned
for all head form sizes appropriate to the headgear.� Each headgear could
conceivably require as many as six helmet positioning indices, one each for the
�A�, �C�, �E�, �J�, �M� and �O� head forms. 
C.� Marking
����������� At least one sample in each set
of helmets received for testing will be marked to guide the correct placement
of test impacts and to assess the correct location of the frontal restraint
hardware. If the samples have been submitted for certification testing, the
sample intended for the archive must be among those marked.��������� The helmet
is placed upon the largest appropriate ISO head form, positioned
according to the apposite helmet positioning index and held in place with an
applied force of 50 newtons (11.25 lbs).� The intersections of the shell with
the various defined planes are then traced onto the outer surface of the helmet
in the following manner:
����������� The level of the S0
plane is marked on that portion of the helmet in front of the fore plane.� The level
of the S3 plane is marked on that portion lying between the fore and
rear planes.� The level of the S4 plane is marked on that portion
behind the rear plane.� Finally, line segments along the fore plane are marked
to join the S0 and S3 planes and, similarly, line
segments along the rear plane are marked to join the S3 and S4
planes.� 
����������� These lines enclose the top of
the helmet and are the boundary of the required extent of protection.� However,
it shall not be a cause for rejection if parts of this boundary fall below the
edge of the helmet.� A test line shall be constructed within the extent of protection 40 mm from the closest point
on the boundary as shown in figure 2.
����������� Mark level of the Reference plane
on the center right and left sides of the sample and then mark a segment of the
Transverse plane intersecting both the reference plane and S4 plane
levels. The points at which the Reference plane and the Transverse plane
intersect will be the site of the Low Lateral impacts described in E4.3.3. The
points at which the S4 and Transverse planes intersect must be at
least 70 mm in front of the centers of the M6 inserts required for tether
mounts of frontal head restraint systems.
����������� If identical helmets are to be
configured with different thicknesses of comfort padding to accommodate
different ranges of head size, the required extent of protection marked on the
test samples shall include the required extent of protection for each different
configuration as marked on the largest head form appropriate for each.� That
is:� the helmet must meet all the requirements of this Standard in each of the
intended configurations.
D.�
Peripheral Vision
 
����������� The clearance for peripheral
vision will be checked by placing the helmet on each appropriate ISO head form,
positioning it according to the apposite helmet positioning index and holding
it in place with a force of 50 newtons.� The clearance must include the
following solid angles to the front of the head form:
����������� 1. The upward visual clearance.
����������� 2. The lateral visual clearance.
����������� 3. The downward visual clearance
except for the breath deflector allowance.
����������� 










Figure 3 Upward Visual Clearance
 


����������� The
upward visual clearance is the solid angle bounded by the reference plane of
the head form and a second plane tilted 5� up from the reference plane.� This
second plane intersects the reference plane at two points on the front surface
of the head form that are 31 mm to the right and left of the longitudinal plane
as shown in figure 3. 
�
Figure 4 Lateral Visual Clearance
 
����������� The lateral visual clearance, as
shown in figure 4, is the solid angle bounded by the reference plane, the S4
plane and the plane perpendicular to both the reference plane and the
longitudinal plane and that contains the points on the front of the head form
that are on the reference plane and are 31 mm to the right and to the left of
the longitudinal plane.� ���� 



Figure 5 Downward Visual Clearance
����������� The downward visual clearance is
the solid angle bounded by the basic plane of the head form and a second plane
tilted 20� down from the basic plane that intersects it at two points on the
front surface of the head form that are 31 mm to the right and left of the
longitudinal plane as shown in figure 5.� However, intrusions into this
downward clearance are permitted so long as the intrusions are within the
breath deflector allowance.



Figure 6 Breath Deflector Allowance
����������� The breath deflector allowance is
shown in figure 6.� It includes the region that is within 31 mm to the right
and left of the longitudinal plane and that lies below the two planes that form
45� angles with the longitudinal plane and that intersect it at the level of
the S4 plane. 
����������� Helmets certified to a special
addendum to this standard and bearing the warning labels specified in the
addendum will not be subject to these procedures and criteria for evaluating
clearances for vision; the procedures and criteria specified in the addendum
will be applied instead.
E. �Performance Testing
����������� The performance testing subjects
helmets to a dynamic test of retention system strength, to a test for
positional stability, to impact management tests, to helmet shell penetration
tests, to tests of the attachment terminals for frontal head restraint tethers,
to a removability test, to chin bar and face shield tests if appropriate and,
also if appropriate, to flame resistance tests.� These tests are conducted upon
helmet samples kept under laboratory ambient temperature and humidity or that
have been conditioned in hot or wet environments simulating some of the
conditions in which the helmet might reasonably be expected to be used.� There
is also a cold conditioning simulating extremes of storage and transport
through which samples may be cycled before being tested in any of the ambient,
hot or wet conditions.
����������� Prior to conditioning and
testing, samples may be exposed to solvents common to motorsports which have
been found to attack and degrade some helmet components.
����������� The selection of tests,
conditioning and special conditioning is left to the discretion of the
Foundation's technical personnel.� However, for certification testing, each of
the specified tests shall be applied to at least one sample.� Furthermore, it
is expected that every test series will be conducted so as to exercise all the
likely failure modes of the helmet.
E1.����� Conditioning
for Testing
����������� Test samples may be tested at
laboratory ambient temperature and humidity or may be conditioned hot or wet
according to the specifications given below.� Prior to establishing ambient,
hot or wet conditioning, any helmet may first be subjected to a cold-cycle.�
Each of these conditions shall be applied to at least one helmet in a
certification test series.� At the discretion of the Foundation's technical
personnel and at any point during the testing, a sample previously kept at
ambient may be conditioned hot or wet.� However, once a sample has been
conditioned hot or wet, the sample must be maintained in that condition
throughout the rest of the testing. The special solvent wipe conditioning
described below may also be applied to any sample at the discretion of the
Foundation's technical personnel.� 
����������� a. Special Conditioning.�
Prior to any impact or retention system testing helmets may first be
conditioned with a solvent mix of 50% toluene and 50% isooctane.� A cotton
cloth or suitable substitute shall be soaked in the solvent and used as an
applicator.� The solvent will be applied to the shell first in an area within 5
mm of the chin strap attachments for not less than five (5) seconds on each
side and then applied to the remainder of the shell for not less than ten (10)
seconds.� At least thirty minutes shall elapse before further conditioning and
testing.
����������� b. Cold-Cycle.� This
environment simulates an extreme storage or transport condition for the
headgear but is unreasonably cold for a use environment. At least one sample
shall be conditioned by being exposed to a temperature of -20�2� C
or, at the discretion of the Foundation's technical personnel, at a temperature
of ‑30�2�.� This exposure shall
continue for a period of not less than four (4) hours, nor more than
twenty-four (24) hours.� Samples cycled through this treatment shall be either
stored at laboratory ambient for at least four (4) hours or conditioned
according to either of the hot and wet specifications below before further
testing.
����������� c. Hot.� The
sample shall be conditioned by being exposed to a temperature of 50 �2� C for a
period of not less than four (4) hours, or more than twenty-four (24) hours.
����������� d. Wet.�
The sample shall be conditioned by being continuously sprayed with water at a
temperature of 25 �5� C for a period of not less than four (4) hours, or more
than twenty-four (24) hours.� This spray shall be directed at the helmet's
external surfaces.� The helmet shall not be subjected to total immersion.
����������� �All testing of these hot, cold
and wet helmets shall begin within two (2) minutes from the time of removal
from the conditioning apparatus.� The samples shall be returned to the
conditioning apparatus between tests.
E2.����� Positional
Stability (Roll-Off)
����������� The test for positional stability
shall only be applied to samples kept at ambient laboratory temperature and
humidity.� The helmet shall not have been subjected to any prior performance
testing. 
����������� The helmet shall be tested on the
smallest appropriate standard full-face head form.� The head form shall be
supported on a stand so that its vertical axis points downward at an angle of
135� to the direction of gravity.� The head form shall be oriented face down.�
The helmet shall be placed on the head form and adjusted to obtain the best
configuration of the retention system.� An inelastic strap shall be hooked to
the edge of the helmet at the rear centerline and brought forward so that its
free end hangs downward across the top of the helmet.� An inertial hammer shall
be suspended from the free end of the strap.� This inertial hammer shall enable
a 4.0 kg �50 g mass to be dropped through a 0.6 m guided fall in order to
deliver an abrupt shock load to the headgear.� The shock load will force the
helmet to rotate forward on the head form.� The helmet may be shifted but must
remain on the head form.� 
����������� The head form shall be
repositioned so that it is facing upward but with the vertical axis still
oriented downward at 135� to gravity.� The helmet shall be positioned and
adjusted to obtain the best configuration of the retention system.� The
strap/inertial hammer shall be hooked to the brow edge of the helmet at the
center line so that the strap lies along the centerline and the hammer is
suspended from the top of the helmet.� The shock weight shall be dropped
through the 0.6 m guided fall delivering an abrupt shock load forcing the
helmet to rotate rearward.� The helmet may be shifted but must remain on the head
form. 
����������� The entire portion of the
inertial hammer assembly that participates in the loading of the helmet shall
be such that its mass is no more than 5.0 kg including the 4.0 kg shock mass.
E3.����� Dynamic
Test of Retention System
����������� The dynamic test of the retention
system may be applied to any sample either kept at ambient temperature and
humidity or conditioned hot, cold or wet.� This test may be performed before,
after, or between any of the other procedures in the test sequence.� However,
the retention test shall not be valid if an integral chin bar has been removed
from a full face helmet.� 
����������� The helmet shall be supported on
its lower shell edge in such a manner that the chin strap may be fastened under
a device whose upper end approximates the contour of the bony structure of the
jaw.� The device will then be given a mechanical pre-load followed by a dynamic
loading.� The retention system fails if it cannot support the mechanical loads
or if the maximum deflection during the dynamic load exceeds 30 mm.� The
retention system also fails if it cannot be easily and quickly unfastened after
testing.
����������� If the technician determines that
the helmet cannot be adequately supported on its lower shell edge, at his
discretion, he may support the helmet on a head form for this test.
����������� a. This chinstrap loading
device shall consist of a simulated jaw and accommodations for the pre-load and
dynamic load.� The jaw portion shall consist of two metal bars or rollers, each
one 12.7 �0.5 mm in diameter, separated by 76 �0.5 mm on center.� The mass of
this device shall not exceed 6.0 kg.
����������� b. A
pre-load shall be applied for at least 60 seconds. This pre-load shall consist
of the mass of the chin strap loading device, static load of 23 kg and the
shock load of 38 kg � 500g which will total 61 kg �500 g.
����������� c.� Raise
the 38 kg �500 g mass which will then be dropped in a vertical guided fall through
a distance of 120 mm to load the retaining system abruptly; the shock load of
38 kg mass and static load of 23 kg mass shall not be additive. In order to
protect the test mechanism, the impact of the 38 kg mass may be cushioned with
a 00-93 durometer rubber pad 150 mm in diameter by 6� mm thick, or its
equivalent.
E4.����� Impact
Management Tests
����������� The impact management tests may
be performed on samples kept at ambient temperature and humidity or conditioned
hot, cold or wet.� The sample shall not have been subjected to the shell
penetration test beforehand.
����������� These tests involve a series of
controlled impacts in which the helmet is positioned on a test head form.� The
helmeted head form is then dropped in guided falls onto specified test anvils.�
The impact site and the impact energy must meet certain requirements in order
for the tests to be valid. 
����������� If the sample is so constructed
that it interferes with the test equipment preventing impacts at sites within
the test line, then, at the discretion of the Foundation's technical personnel,
parts of the helmet may be cut away to facilitate testing.� Every reasonable
effort to minimize such cutting will be made.� However, there shall be no
relaxation of the impact levels or of the test criteria.
����������� Certain tests shall not be valid
when performed on samples that have been cut for impact testing: the dynamic
strength of retention system test of section E3., the positional stability test
of section E2., the chin bar test of section E5. and the removability test of
section E8.� 
����������� Special considerations apply when
the helmet is a �flip-up� model, that is: configured with a chin bar that
pivots up and away from the face of the wearer.� For the first three impacts on
any flip-up sample, the impact tests will be performed, whenever possible, with
the chin bar locked in the closed position.� In these tests the chin bar must
not release and �flip-up� inadvertently. In certification testing, the tests
will generally be structured so as to investigate performance in frontal followed
by lateral impact.
E4.1��� Impact Management Test Equipment
����������� The test equipment shall consist
of at least the following items:
����������� a. The
smallest and largest of the head forms appropriate for the helmet sample.� This
head form shall be of rigid, low resonance metal such as magnesium alloy and
shall conform to the 'A', 'C', 'E', 'J', 'M' or 'O' geometries specified in ISO
DIS 6220‑1983.
����������� b. A
ball‑arm/collar assembly which is fitted to a socket machined into the
base of the head form.� The ball/socket configuration shall be such that the
geometrical center of the ball is located on the central vertical axis of the head
form 12.7 mm above the reference plane as described in ISO DIS 6220-1983.� The
ball-arm/collar assembly shall also include a uniaxial accelerometer fixed
firmly into the ball.
����������� c. A
head form support assembly rigidly attached to the ball-arm.� This support
assembly shall be such that it and consequently the head form may be guided in
a vertical drop.� The mass of this support assembly shall not exceed 1.2 kg.�
The total mass of the head form plus ball-arm/collar assembly plus head form
support assembly shall be within 100 grams of: 3.1 kg for the ISO A head form,
3.6 kg for the ISO C head form, 4.1 kg for the ISO E head form, 4.7 kg for the
ISO J head form, 5.6 kg for the ISO M head form and 6.1 kg for the ISO O head
form.
����������� d. A
guidance system such that the head form/support assembly is guided in a
vertical drop onto a test anvil.� This guidance system may consist of two or
more wires or one or more rails.� The head form/support - guidance system -
test anvil alignment shall be such that:
����������� d1. The
drop trajectory shall be a straight line within 3� of vertical and within 5� of
the sensitive axis of the uniaxial accelerometer.
����������� d2. The
line parallel to the drop trajectory and passing through the center of the head
form ball-socket shall pass within 5 mm of the center of the test anvil, within
10 mm of the center of gravity of the head form/support assembly, and within 5
mm of the sensitive element of the uniaxial accelerometer.� 
����������� e. A
rigid anvil mount consisting of a solid mass of at least 500 kg.� The upper
surface of the anvil mount shall consist of a steel plate with a minimum
thickness of 12 mm and a minimum surface area of 0.10 m2.
����������� f. Five
test anvils: flat, hemispherical, roll bar, kerbstone and edge.� 
����������� f1. The
flat anvil shall have a minimum surface area of 0.0127 m2, e.g. 127
mm diameter face.� When fixed in position on the anvil mount, the surface shall
be perpendicular to the head form trajectory.
����������� f2. The
hemispherical anvil shall have a 48 �0.5 mm radius. 
����������� f3.
The roll bar shall be 20.5 cm �5
mm in length and 5.0 cm �0.5 mm in diameter.
����������� f4. The
kerbstone shall consist of two sides forming an angle of 105 � 5�,
each of them with a slope of 52.5 �
2.5� towards the vertical and meeting along a striking edge with a radius of 15
mm � 0.5
mm. The height must be at least 50 mm and the length not less than 125 mm.
����������� f5. The
edge anvil shall have a striking face 6.3 mm wide with a depth of at least 35
mm.� The radius of the edges on the impact face shall not exceed 0.5 mm.� When
in position, the striking face shall be perpendicular to the head form
trajectory. ��The anvil shall be sufficiently long that the ends do not contact
the helmet during impact.� 
����������� g. A
uniaxial accelerometer.� The acceleration data channel must comply with SAE
recommended practice J 211 requirements for channel class 1000 with the
exception that the frequency response need not include the range from dc to 10
hz which may not be obtainable using certain types of transducers.
����������� h. A
velocity measurement device which will yield the velocity of the head form/support
assembly within the last 40 mm of travel before impact.� The velocity
measurement must be accurate to within �1%.� 
E4.2��� Test Definitions
����������� a. The
impact site refers to the portion of the helmet struck during an impact test.�
It is defined as the point where a line passing through the center of the head
form ball and the center of the anvil intersects the outer surface of the
helmet at the instant the helmet first touches the anvil.� Please note, this
point need not be the point at which the helmet shell makes first contact with
the anvil.
����������� b. The
impact velocity is the velocity of the head form/support assembly as measured
within no more than 4 cm of the first contact between the helmet and the impact
surface.
����������� c.�� This standard
specifies nominal impact velocities which must be adjusted in order to allow
for deviations between the actual mass of the test head form assembly and the
specified ideal value.� The actual test impact velocity shall be the specified
nominal velocity multiplied by the square root of the value obtained by
dividing the ideal head form assembly mass by the actual mass.� For example,
if, for the �A� head form, the mass of the head form plus ball-arm/collar and
support assembly as in paragraph E4.1c masses 3.2 kg instead of the ideal mass
of 3.1 kg, the test impact velocities shall be obtained by multiplying the
nominal velocities by a factor of 0.984. 
����������� d. There
are two levels of test: the first is the standard level used to identify those
helmets which definitely meet this standard.� It is applied to samples
submitted for certification testing and to those acquired for the Foundation�s
random sample test (RST) program.� The second is the deviation level which is
applied to samples acquired for second round RST procedures, that is: testing
of samples of currently certified models for which previous samples have
obtained failing results in RST testing.�� Failure to meet test criteria at the
deviation levels indicates that the sample definitely does not meet the
requirements of the standard. �
����������� The nominal impact velocities are
listed in Table 4.

E4.3 Test Impacts
����������� There are three different test
impact protocols: �Standard� which is intended to assess a helmet�s
capabilities in severe impact, �Low Velocity� which is intended to assess
capability in moderate impacts and �Low Lateral� which is intended to assess
capability in strikes against the sides of a vehicle interior. 
E4.3.1
Standard Test Impacts
����������� Samples maintained in any of the
specified conditions may be tested. Test impact sites shall be on or above the
test line.� Rivets, vents and any other helmet feature within this region shall
be valid test sites.� Each impact site will be subjected to a group of one, two
or three impacts according to the anvil selected for that site. 
����������� The impact site for the first
impact within in a group is the target for the successive impacts in the same
group.� However, if an impact group is sited closer than indicated in the
following table to any previous impact group, that later impact group shall be
declared invalid.

����������� There is no restriction regarding
test anvil selection.� The impact velocities for each test impact depend on the
type of test and on the head form designation.� Second impacts do not apply to
helmets in tests against the edge anvil. Third impacts apply only to helmets in
tests against the roll bar anvil. 
����������� The technician may select either
the largest or smallest appropriate head form for any particular group of
impacts.� In all cases the technician may impact any site on the helmet surface
on or within the test lines as drawn for any of the head forms considered
appropriate for that helmet. 
����������� a.
Flat Anvil: Each site tested against the flat anvil shall be tested in two
impacts according to the 1st and 2nd values
specified in the impact velocity table adjusted for the mass of the head form
assembly.� No site shall be subject to the third impact for this anvil. 
����������� b.
Hemispherical Anvil: Each site tested against the hemispherical anvil shall be
tested in two impacts according to the 1st and 2nd
values specified in the impact velocity table adjusted for the mass of the head
form assembly.� No site shall be subject to the third impact for this anvil. 
����������� c.
Each site tested against the edge anvil shall be tested in a single impact according
to the 1st value specified in the impact velocity table
adjusted for the mass of the head form assembly.� No site shall be subjected to
the second or third impact for this anvil.
����������� d.
Each site tested against the roll bar anvil shall be tested in three impacts
according to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd
values specified in the impact velocity table adjusted for the mass of the
head form assembly. 
����������� e.
If the impact velocity for any test impact exceeds the specified mass adjusted velocity
by more than 1.5%, that impact shall be declared invalid.
����������� Please Note: The impacts
described above are based on specific velocities and not prescribed drop
heights.� To attain the proper velocity for an impact, it is likely that the
drop height will need to be adjusted to compensate for frictions inherent in
most mechanical helmet testing systems. Height adjustments for these frictions
should not account for more than 10% of the total drop height.� Also, the 1.5%
margin allowed for impact velocity reflects the uncertainties expected even for
well maintained drop equipment.� It is expected that drop heights will always
be selected to produce, as closely as possible, the precise impact velocity as called
out in the standards and adjusted for head form assembly drop mass.
E4.3.2
Low Velocity Test Impacts
����������� A single helmet sample maintained
at laboratory ambient conditions shall be tested on the smallest appropriate
head form in five separate, single impacts against the flat anvil at the
according to the Low Velocity figure specified in Table 4. Impacts may be sited
anywhere on or above the test line but no two impacts may be sited any closer to
each other than the separation distance specified in Table 5.
E4.3.3
Low Lateral Impact
����������� The Low Lateral impact tests may
be performed only on samples maintained for the appropriate time period in
laboratory ambient condition.� The helmet sample may be tested on guided fall
equipment including an appropriate half-head form and a correctly aligned
uniaxial accelerometer or on free drop equipment using an appropriate full head
form and a triaxial accelerometer. The test technician will select the test
equipment according to his judgment as to which most favors the helmet being
tested. The impact surface for this test shall be the kerbstone anvil described
in E4.1.
����������� The helmet and head form assembly
shall be dropped in such a manner that, just prior to contact:
�       
The
head form has no perceptible rotational velocity.
�       
The
head form�s longitudinal plane is within 15� of horizontal.
�       
The
head form�s transverse plane shall be within 15� of perpendicular to the kerbstone
anvil�s striking edge.
�       
A
vertical erected from the center of the anvil passes within 10 mm of a point
marked on the helmet�s surface at the intersection of the head form transverse
and reference planes. 
����������� The nominal impact velocity for
this test is specified in the nominal impact velocity table. This value must be
adjusted to account for any difference between the ideal mass of the head form
and the measured mass.� The impact velocity shall be measured within the last
four centimeters of travel before contact with the anvil.� 
����������� The separation between this
impact site and previous or subsequent impact sites on the same sample must be
maintained according to the impact group separation table.�

����������� No peak acceleration of the head
form shall exceed the corresponding value in the table above depending on the
head form and the type of test.� The average of the five peak accelerations for
any sample subjected to the Low Velocity impact shall not exceed 180 G. The
helmet�s protective structures shall not break apart throughout the testing.�
If the Foundation's technical personnel conclude that fracture of the helmet
shell, impact liner, retention system or other components could reasonably
imply an undue laceration hazard either from the impact surface or from the
helmet itself, the sample shall be considered to have failed.� A flip-up
configuration tested with the chin bar closure locked at the outset of one of
the first three valid impacts performed on the sample and which releases
inadvertently as a result of the impact will also be deemed to have failed.
����������� If, in certification testing, a
sample is found to meet all the test criteria but any two of the impacts were
at less than 98.5% of the specified impact velocity as adjusted for drop
assembly mass, the testing for that sample shall be declared inconclusive and
must be repeated.� Similarly, if there are two instances where an impact falls
beyond 10 mm from the first impacts in its group, the testing for the sample
shall be declared inconclusive and must be repeated.� Finally, if an invalid
impact produces a peak acceleration exceeding the test criterion, the testing
for the sample shall be declared inconclusive and must be repeated.
����������� The impact test procedures leave
considerable latitude to the helmet tester regarding site and anvil selection.�
It is expected that the tester will orchestrate each standard test series in
order to investigate potential weaknesses and to exercise each likely failure
mode and will conduct deviation level testing to exercise the failure modes
identified previously.
����������� If at the end of a certification
test series, the Foundation's technical personnel conclude that the results
obtained in valid impacts are not sufficient to determine whether the helmet
model meets the performance requirements of this standard, additional samples
may be conditioned and tested.� It is expected that all samples submitted will
meet all the test requirements.
E5.����� Chin
Bar Test
����������� The chin bar test applies to full
face helmets only.� At least one helmet in each certification series shall be
tested.� The helmet shall be firmly mounted on a rigid base so that the chin
bar faces up and the reference plane is at 65 �5� from horizontal. �A mass of 5
� .2 kg with a flat striking face of 0.01 m5
minimum area shall be dropped in a guided fall so as to strike the central
portion of the chin bar with an impact velocity of 3.5 �0.2 m/sec.� The maximum
downward deflection of the chin bar must not exceed 60 mm nor shall any component
fail so as to cause a potential injury to the wearer.
E6.����� Shell
Penetration Test
����������� The shell penetration test may be
applied to helmets kept at laboratory ambient temperature and humidity or
helmets conditioned hot, cold or wet. At least one helmet sample shall be
tested in shell penetration.� The complete helmet shall be placed on a rigidly
mounted head form.� The test head form for the penetration test need not be the
standard ISO head form shape used in the impact testing and helmet marking.� It
is expected only that the device used will provide reasonable support for the
helmet and conformance with the interior of the helmet immediately beneath the
site of the penetration test.� If the helmet contains a sling or some other
adjustable sizing component, it shall be relaxed to its most extendable
position.
����������� The penetration test striker
shall have a mass of 3 kg �50 g and the point of the striker shall be a cone
with an included angle of 60� �0.5� and an altitude of 38 �0.38 mm.� The
striking tip shall have a hardness of 60 Rockwell (scale C � 3 points) and a
radius of 0.5 � 0.1 mm.� The region of the support head form directly beneath
the striker tip shall be wax or soft plastic and covered with a thin tell-tale
of paper, foil, tape or some similar material.
����������� The striker shall be dropped to
strike the surface of the helmet shell at a velocity of 7.45 �
0.15 meters per second as measured within no more than 4 centimeters of contact
with the helmet. The helmet may be oriented on the support head form so that the
test striker is directed at any site on or above the test line but the
penetration test site must be at least 7.5 cm removed from the center of any
impact test site or any other penetration test site.� At the test technician�s
discretion, samples may be tested at more than one site on the shell.
����������� For all penetration tests
performed, the test striker must not penetrate through the helmet wall so as to
mark the tell-tale between the helmet and the support head form.
E7.����� Face
Shield Penetration Test
����������� If a face shield is provided with
a full face helmet, this face shield shall be tested for penetration resistance
in the following manner:
����������� The face shield shall be tested
on the appropriate helmet, correctly deployed across the facial opening and
under laboratory ambient conditions.� A soft lead pellet weighing 1 �0.1 g with
a diameter of 5.5 �0.1 mm and traveling at a velocity of 500 �20 km per hour
shall strike the face shield normal to the surface.� The face shield shall be
tested in at least three different locations:� the center line and 80 �5 mm to
either side of the center line.� The pellet must not penetrate to the interior
of the helmet.
E8.����� Frontal
Head Restraint (FHR)
����������� The procedures for evaluating
frontal head restraint features are described in the Federation de l�Automobile
standard: FIA 8858-2010 Frontal Head Restraint (FHR) System.�� At least
one previously untested sample shall be inspected and tested according to Section
6. Assessment of Helmet and Appendix B. Helmet-M6-Terminal Test
Procedure.
����������� Any failure to meet the described
specifications or test criteria shall be a cause for rejection. 
E9.����� Flame
Resistance Tests
����������� The test will be conducted at
ambient temperature, between 10�C and 30�C,
and utilize the thermal load of a propane flame, at the flame location
representing a measured temperature of 790� �40�C.
����������� a. Shell:�
The site selected on the shell for this test must lie at least 120 mm from any
site tested in impact or shell penetration and from any cutting done to
facilitate impact testing.� The flame shall impinge upon the external surface
of the helmet shell for a period of 30 seconds.� Simultaneous with the removal
of the flame, a timing device shall be activated.� The helmet shall be
self-extinguishing within 10 seconds of the removal of the flame i.e., shall
not continue to burn with the emission of a flame.� The helmet will not be
subjected to impact tests after testing for flammability.
����������� The temperature of the padding
and lining materials normally in contact at any point with the wearer's head
shall not exceed 70�C during the test.
����������� b. Trim:�
The helmet trim will include any attachment sold for use with the product not
otherwise discussed in this section on flame resistance.� This includes face
shields provided with open face helmets.� The trim will be subjected to the
same propane flame utilized in the shell test, but for a period of 15 seconds.�
The trim shall be self-extinguishing within 20 seconds of the removal of the
thermal load.
����������� c. Chin
Strap:� The chin strap utilized will be subjected to the same propane flame
utilized in the shell test.� The chin strap and chin strap cover, if provided,
shall be suspended between two clips at least 75 mm apart so that there is only
minimal tension and so that the broad side of the strap is perpendicular.� The
flame shall be applied to the cover if present or otherwise to the strap for a
period of 15 seconds.� The chin strap and, if present, the cover shall not melt
and shall be self-extinguishing within 5 seconds of the removal of the thermal
load.
����������� d. Face
shield: (For full face helmets equipped with face shields only).� The face
shield will be subjected to the same propane flame utilized in the shell test,
but for a period of 45 seconds.� The face shield shall not melt down during
this period so as to allow the propane flame to penetrate the interior of the
helmet.� The shield shall be self-extinguishing in 20 seconds.
����������� e. Padding
and lining materials: The internal padding and lining materials will be
subjected to the same propane flame utilized in the shell test, but for a
period of 15 seconds.� The lining shall be self-extinguishing within 5 seconds
of the removal of the thermal load.� This test shall only be applied to that
part of the lining within 50 mm of the face or neck opening of the helmet.� 
E10.��� Removability
����������� This test shall be applied to
helmet models configured with systems other than traditional D-ring chin strap
retention systems. It is intended to determine whether the helmet can
reasonably be removed from an unconscious victim without resorting to any
buckles, clasps or other mechanisms which may be rendered non-functional by
impact damage.� The helmet is placed on the largest appropriate complete ISO head
form with all the closures and retention systems engaged.� A technician must
remove the helmet from the head form using simple, common hand tools either to
cut or circumvent helmet retention elements without accessing any of the helmet
mechanisms. 
����������� The hand tools for this test are
limited to shears, simple edged tools and common screw drivers.� The operation
must not require more than thirty seconds. 
E11.��� Post-testing
Disassembly and Inspection
����������� At the discretion of the
technician, any helmet may be disassembled in order to check for internal
projections, plausibility or for deviations from the originally certified
configuration.
Certification Series Test Plan
����������� For a certification test series,
it is expected that each test in this standard appropriate to the helmet
configuration will be performed at least once.� It is also expected that the
test technician will conduct the testing so as to obtain the most exhaustive
evaluation possible of likely failure modes.� The table below represents a
typical certification test plan by sample number, conditioning and tests in
order of application.� Bolding indicates that the particular test is routine
for that sample; otherwise, the particular test might be performed on another
sample if convenient.

����� Shortly
after William �Pete� Snell died of massive head injuries received during an
automotive racing accident, his friends and associates formed the Snell
Memorial Foundation. The goals of the Foundation were to investigate and
understand the mechanisms of head injury and to encourage the development of
truly protective helmets for use in automotive sports.
����� The
Snell Memorial Foundation is a not-for profit organization incorporated under
the laws of The State of California 1957. It exists solely for the purpose of
engaging in scientific and educational activities promoting the safety,
well-being and comfort of persons engaged in any type of travel or vehicular
transportation.
����� Today,
the Snell Memorial Foundation tests various kinds of helmets and certifies them
for use in prescribed activities. It currently publishes standards for
automotive racing helmets, Karting helmets, motorcycle helmets, bicycle
helmets, non-motorized or multi-sport helmets, harness racing and equestrian
sports helmets and skiing and snowboarding helmets. The Foundation is
interested in just about every kind of headgear worn to protect against crash
impact injury.
����� Helmet
manufacturers submit their products for certification. If their helmets pass
the demanding series of performance tests, and therefore meet the referenced
standard, the manufacturers are invited to enter a contract with The Snell
Memorial Foundation which entitles them to use the Snell Memorial Foundation
name and logo in their packaging and advertising, and to purchase certification
decals from The Foundation for use in their certified products. However, this
contract also requires the certified manufacturers to maintain their high
standards for all of their certified production and to participate in the
random sample test program. In this program, the Foundation acquires and tests
helmets to certify the continuing quality of the products. The Foundation takes
pains to see that these random sample helmets are drawn from the same supply as
those sold in stores; thus the Foundation is able to monitor the quality of the
helmets sold directly to the consumer.
����� Participation
in the Snell certification program is strictly voluntary. Manufacturers are not
obliged to seek certification or to continue it, but while a manufacturer does
participate, the Foundation demands full compliance. Similarly, the Foundation
prosecutes all unauthorized use of the Snell name and logo to the full extent
of the law.
����� The
Snell Memorial Foundation maintains a state of the art testing facility in
North Highlands, California. There is a Board of Directors who oversees the
activities of the Foundation, and a salaried staff who conducts the testing and
performs the administrative functions.

published Standards for headgear used in bicycling, non-motorized sports,
motorcycling, competitive skiing, skiing and snowboarding and equestrian
activities.� Copies of these Standards are available upon request.

			For the last two weeks or so, this has been happening on one-off, random clients. Before that, the messages were for "Unknown" computers - so it's hard to say, really. However, when I investigated the logs, there didn't seem to be any pattern to it. This has been going on for at least 8 months, possible longer.

			Thanks for your response, Marcos. 
I'm not sure how to send this info... 
Do you mean export part of the policy as xml? 
Pls excuse my ignorance!

Device Control - Rule with Invalid Data



							
								
									
										Mark Snell posted a topic in  ESET Endpoint Products






			We have around 500 EndPoint Antivirus clients using Device Control, around 50 or so rules in a global policy. 
Occasionally (approx. once or twice per day) we are getting error messages similar to this: 
  
%ProductName%: Error 
6/11/2014 7:59:16 AM - During execution of  on the computer PC1724, the following warning occurred: The imported configuration contains a rule with invalid data. 
  
I cannot reproduce the problem at will (seems to be resolved by a reboot). 
There seems to be no common factor other than the policy that is running (same as most other clients) 
Client versions are 5.0.2214 or 5.0.2228, OS is XP or Win 7 (all with latest patches) 
I am guessing this is caused by a device control rule but how can I diagnose which one? 
Any ideas please?

HIPS - should I be worried?



							
								
									
										Mark Snell posted a topic in  ESET Endpoint Products






			We have deployed EEA 5.0.2214 across our estate of about 500 XP SP3 clients - default settings for HIPS (enabled, automatic mode with rules) but no rules defined. 
I have just switched on "Log all blocked operations" in client policy and I am seeing quite a lot of activity in the HIPS logs - 4000 so far today, mainly Self Defense blocking registry deletes by Services.exe... 
Is this normal? 
We use SCCM to deploy software and updates to clients, could HIPS / Self defense be interfering with the normal registry cleanup process? 
Any advice appreciated, thanks 
Mark

Mark A. Snell













                    
                    Mark A. Snell, PhD, is a retired U.S. Army ordnance officer as well as a retired history professor. While on active duty, he served from 1987-1990 as an assistant professor in the Department of History at West Point, and then became the executive officer of the Academy's support battalion (1st Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment) as well as the commander of the US Military Academy Airborne Detachment from 1990-91. Upon his retirement from the Army in 1993, he taught for twenty years at Shepherd University and was the founding director of the university's George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War before retiring again in 2013. In 2008 he was the Visiting Senior Lecturer of War Studies at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the United Kingdom. Mark's specialty is the American Civil War but he also has produced studies on World War I and World War II. He lives in Gettysburg, PA and has just completed a monograph titled, "Gettysburg's Other Battle: The Ordeal of an American Shrine during the First World War" (under contract with Kent State University Press; available  spring, 2018). He has given tours of historic sites for the late Senator Ted Kennedy, Ambassador Caroline Kennedy, former Vice President Dick Cheney (and daughter Liz), Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) and former Army Surgeon General Eric B. Schoomaker, among other political and military notables. Mark was a historical consultant for the 2003 movie, "Gods and Generals," and has appeared as a "talking head" on several History Channel, BBC and PBS programs. He also is a member of the Gettysburg Foundation, for which he frequently volunteers. Mark is a "gentleman farmer" and avid motorcycle rider, the owner of a 2016 Indian Vintage Chief. He shares his farm with one cat (not counting strays), a flock of chickens, a mule, four horses and a cow. He is a big fan of the Baltimore Orioles, Pittsburgh Penguins and the Army football team, which not only beat Navy in 2016 (after 14 consecutive losses) but also went on to win a bowl game.

Mark A. Snell, "Gettysburg's Other Battle: The Ordeal of an American Shrine during the First World War"

Mark will be the keynote speaker at the Annual Eisenhower Society Luncheon at Gettysburg's historic Dobbin House Restaurant on October 15, 2017. His address will focus on the travails of the citizens of Gettysburg during World War I when two huge army camps occupied Gettysburg National Military Park and their historic little town from 1917-18. Captain Ike Eisenhower commanded the 1918 cantonment, known as Camp Colt, and watched helplessly as the Spanish Influenza wreaked havoc on his soldiers and the community from Sept. through November. This talk is based in part on Dr. Snell's forthcoming book, GETTYSBURG'S OTHER BATTLE: THE ORDEAL OF AN AMERICAN SHRINE DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR (Kent, OH, Kent State Univ. Press). For further details and reservations, email  the society at: info@dwightdeisenhowersociety.org

Founder
Frank Snell, Jr. and Mark Wilmer


Website

Founded in 1938, Snell & Wilmer is a business law firm with more than 400 attorneys practicing in nine locations throughout the western United States and in Mexico, including Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona; Los Angeles and Orange County, California; Denver, Colorado; Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Los Cabos, Mexico. Clients include major national and multinational corporations, educational and research institutions, municipalities and government agencies, nonprofits, charitable organizations, industry executives and high-net-worth individuals.

History[edit]
Snell & Wilmer traces its origins to 1938, when Mark Wilmer joined Frank L. Snell, Jr., Riney Salmon, and Charles Strouss, who had practiced together since 1934. Mr. Snell frequently recounted the search that led to his partnership with Mr. Wilmer. Because Mr. Snell was "snowed under"[clarification needed] by work and needed help, he consulted the three members of Maricopa County's Superior Court to identify the best trial lawyer in the state. Mr. Snell noted that each judge mentioned Mr. Wilmer, whom he had not yet met.
Both Mr. Snell and Mr. Wilmer recalled their first conversation as a lengthy discussion about their philosophies of the "practice of law". The conversation went so well that the two attorneys decided to become partners without working out financial terms.[clarification needed]
After World War II, Joseph T. Melczer, Jr. and James Walsh joined the firm that became known as Snell, Wilmer, Walsh and Melczer. Shortly after that Edwin Beauchamp arrived, and the firm's name became Snell, Wilmer, Walsh, Melczer & Beauchamp. Recognizing that the firm's letterhead was becoming unwieldy, Mr. Walsh suggested shortening the firm name to Snell & Wilmer.
In the 40s, Mr. Melczer became dean of Arizona's tax and estate planning bar.[clarification needed] When famous individuals (like John Wayne or Barry Goldwater) were seen in the firm's reception area, people generally assumed[clarification needed] that the celebrities had come to see Mr. Melczer.[clarification needed] According to the lore of the firm,[original research?] the U.S. Senate once reconvened to fix an error in a recently enacted tax code[citation needed] that was found by Mr. Melczer.[citation needed]
During the 1940s and early fifties, Snell & Wilmer practiced in the Heard Building. This was a period of moderate growth in attorney numbers and substantial growth in the firm's prominence and contribution to the Bar and the community.[1][2]
As Mr. Wilmer established his position as one of Arizona's leading trial lawyers, Mr. Snell emerged as a visionary who helped Phoenix and Arizona capitalize on "post-World War II" opportunities. Mr. Snell, who was instrumental in the merger of the state's two largest utilities into "Arizona Public Service Company", also helped find a use for an abandoned World War II flight training facility in Glendale. We now know the institution built there as the Thunderbird School of Global Management.
Mr. Snell was instrumental in cleaning up the city's crooked

political system.[citation needed] He and a small group[who?] of community leaders demanded and received[how?] the resignation of elected officials[who?] whose abuses threatened the city's growth.[how?]
During the 1960s, the firm moved from the Heard Building to the Security Building, which could accommodate the growing number of lawyers required to staff the firm's emerging practice areas, including complex business transactions, securities, and utility regulation. The hiring and training of larger groups of young lawyers became a firm priority and a system of committees began to address the challenges that confronted the firm. The firm's summer clerkship program, the first in Arizona,[citation needed] was one of the "innovations" adopted during this decade.
The year 1972 found Snell & Wilmer at an important juncture in its development. Mr. Snell, who had managed the firm, decided to reduce his administrative role. Snell & Wilmer's first Executive Committee was elected consisting of Mr. Wilmer, Mr. Melczer, Don Corbitt, Richard B. Snell and John J. Bouma. The partners agreed to invest in the future and commit partner earnings to building the infrastructure required to become a major[clarification needed] law firm. The firm diversified its practice groups, developed non-attorney administrative support, and placed more emphasis on recruiting, continuing legal education and community service.
In 1973, the firm moved from the Security Building to the newly constructed Valley Center (now Chase Tower). As the decade closed, the then nascent national legal press reported storm clouds on the economic horizon for lawyers.
The 1980s marked a period of retrenchment and "shake out" for law firms throughout the country. Rapid growth and economic excesses led to the demise and restructuring of many established firms. As the economics of the marketplace began to penetrate what The American Lawyer termed "the law business," Snell & Wilmer's conservative fiscal management and lean operations[clarification needed] served it well. The firm's market share increased in a period of market contraction.[citation needed] Unencumbered by debt or unwieldy compensation systems, Snell & Wilmer was successful in bringing on exceptionally capable[citation needed] attorneys from other prominent firms and began the firm's geographic expansion. In 1983, John J. Bouma became Chairman, succeeding Mr. Wilmer and Mr. Melczer.
In 1989, the Tucson office was established. Within months, negotiations with Tucson's largest and oldest law firm, Bilby & Shoenhair, led to a combination of the two firms, completed and celebrated at the firm's spring retreat in May 1989.
By the 1990s, Snell & Wilmer's status in the State of Arizona could be

called "legendary."[according to whom?] The Phoenix Business Journal ran an article[when?] describing the firm as one of the "big daddies of Phoenix law firms."[citation needed] Arizona Business magazine rated[when?] Snell & Wilmer No. 1 out of the top ten law firms in Arizona, dishing out high marks for "corporate and securities work," "real estate," "employee benefits," and other categories.[citation needed] However, its growth had just begun.
During the 1990s, the firm moved its Phoenix offices to the Arizona Center and opened offices in Orange County, California and Salt Lake City, Utah. Orange County began as an adjunct to Snell & Wilmer's product liability practice, and quickly grew into one of Orange County's largest law firms.[citation needed] The Salt Lake City office rapidly grew from a small cadre of transactional lawyers into a full-service practice that serves Utah's rapidly growing business community.
The 2000s began with the establishment of new offices in Denver and Las Vegas, each continuing the firm's tradition of providing quality legal counsel to businesses throughout the region. The firm's first international office, located in Los Cabos, Mexico, opened in October 2008, and its office in downtown Los Angeles opened in February 2009. The firm expanded its Nevada practice by opening a Reno location in early 2010.
In March, 2015, Matthew P. Feeney became Chairman, succeeding John Bouma.
Practice areas[edit]
Snell & Wilmer has a broad range of practice areas, including financial regulation, tax law, labor & employment, United States environmental law, water law, real estate & zoning, mergers & acquisitions, intellectual property, product liability, estate planning, telecommunications law, bankruptcy & restructuring, foreclosure, international law, and white-collar criminal defense.

						Share This Article:Mark A. Snell, a San Diego State product who rose through the ranks of Sempra Energy to become president of the San Diego-based company, says he will retire in March 2017.
Mark Snell of Sempra Energy. Photo via SempraSnell, 60, joined Sempra in 2001 as vice president of corporate planning and development and before being named president in 2011 was executive vice president and chief financial officer for six years. 
Sempra — parent company of SDG&E — on Tuesday also announced other executive appointments, mostly effective Jan. 1, 2017.
“One of the cornerstones of our success has been our ability to organically develop a strong leadership team,” said Debra L. Reed, chairman and CEO of Sempra Energy. “We and our board of directors spend considerable time and effort identifying talented leaders within the organization and exposing them to different aspects of our business. Today’s appointments represent another step forward in our succession planning process.”
The changes:
Joseph A. Householder, 61, Sempra’s executive vice president and chief financial officer of Sempra Energy, will be named to the new role of corporate group president of infrastructure businesses for Sempra Energy, reporting to Reed. He will oversee Sempra operations in midstream, LNG, renewable energy and Mexico
Steven D. Davis, 60, executive vice president of external affairs and corporate strategy, will be named to the new job of corporate group president of utilities, reporting to Reed. The SDSU grad also will chair the Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) boards of directors. Davis will oversee operations at Sempra Energy’s utilities in California and South America.
Jeffrey W. Martin, 54, chairman and president and CEO of SDG&E, will become Sempra executive vice president and chief financial officer, reporting to Reed. Martin will oversee all financial matters for the company, including business development and major acquisitions





Dennis V. Arriola, 55 — chairman, president and CEO of SoCalGas — will become executive vice president of corporate strategy and external affairs for Sempra Energy, reporting to Reed. He will be responsible for corporate strategy and will oversee all communications, government relations, regulatory and international affairs activities, as well as corporate social responsibility.
Patricia K. Wagner, 54, president and CEO of Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, will become CEO of SoCalGas, reporting to Davis. Until she assumes her new position in January 2017, Wagner has been appointed an executive vice president for Sempra Energy, effective immediately.
J. Bret Lane, 57, has been named president of SoCalGas effective immediately, and will continue in his role as SoCalGas’ chief operating officer, reporting to the CEO of SoCalGas.
Scott D. Drury, 51, chief energy supply officer for SDG&E, will become president of SDG&E, reporting to Davis. Drury holds a bachelor’s in public administration and a master’s in business administration from SDSU. He serves on the board of directors of the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corp. and the advisory board of Alzheimer’s San Diego.
Caroline A. Winn, 53, chief energy delivery officer for SDG&E, will become chief operating officer of SDG&E, reporting to Drury. She holds a bachelor’s in electrical engineering from CSU Sacramento. Winn serves on the board of directors of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce, Western Energy Institute and the Classroom of the Future Foundation.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREMy Gettysburg: Meditations On History And Placeby Snell, Mark A.The Gettysburg Campaign and its culminating battle have generatedmore than their share of analysis and published works. In My Gettysburg, Civil War scholar and twenty-six-year Gettysburg resident Mark Snell goes beyond the campaign itself to explore the "culture" of the battlefield. In this fascinating collection, Snell provides an intriguing interpretation of some neglected military aspects of the battle, such as a revisionist study of Judson Kilpatrick's decision to launch  "Farnsworth's Charge" on the southern end of the Confederate line after Pickett's Charge and the role of Union logisticians in the Northern victory. In addition, he looks at a town east of Gettysburg-York, Pennsylvania, a community that likewise suffered invasion in the summer of 1863-as well as at the role of Union and Confederate soldiers from the new state of West Virginia who fought against each other during the campaign. Further, this collection assesses Gettysburg's evolution as a historic place: an American shrine, an inspiration for popular music, a training ground for soldiers past and present, a mecca for reenactors, a combat zone between commercial developers and preservationists, and a home to its residents-including the author, who gives us a personal view of what the battlefield and its surrounding community have come to mean to him. A retired Army officer and an established authority on the Civil War and military history, Snell amply demonstrates in this thoughtprovoking yet entertaining anthology that there remains much to learn even from such a well-studied subject as Gettysburg.Civil War Period (1850-1877)Condition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
