What are analysts saying about Varonis Systems stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Varonis Systems stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Varonis Systems Inc. provides an innovative software platform that allows enterprises to map, analyze, manage and migrate their unstructured data. Its products include DatAdvantage, DataPrivilege, IDU Classification Framework, Data Transport Engine and DatAnywhere. The company sells its products to small and medium businesses, and large multinational enterprises in financial services, consumer and retail, industrial, healthcare, and energy and utilities industries. Varonis Systems Inc. is headquartered in New York.   " (7/5/2017)
2. Imperial Capital analysts commented, "We are maintaining our Outperform rating on VRNS shares and one-year price target of $35. Our price target implies potential upside of 25% above recent levels. We believe VRNS is benefiting from expanding awareness of the need to rapidly detect abnormal user behavior and unusual interactions to protect data and control access. While several transactions were delayed in 4Q16, we highlight the company's strong growth in license revenue (up 23% year-over-year [yoy]), exceeding our estimates and consensus. We continue to look for potential upside from expanding adoption of multiple products, with significant opportunities for add-on sales across various platforms. On 2/8/17, VRNS announced the planned departure of CFO Gili Iohan, effective 3/31/17, who will be immediately succeeded by Guy Melamed (VP of Finance). We see nominal disruption, given his familiarity of the organization since 2011." (2/13/2017)
3. Stifel Nicolaus analysts commented, "On Wednesday, February 8, after the market close, Varonis reported 4Q16 results that came in ahead of expectations across all relevant metrics. In what's becoming a bit of a pattern, Varonis continued to benefit from enterprise awareness surrounding the need for solutions designed to mitigate insider threats as well as increased awareness regarding both ransomware and data privacy initiatives. Interestingly, we note that Varonis was able to deliver a clean beat despite a handful of headwinds, including a tougher than expected quarter in EMEA (4% y/y growth) and currency headwinds (2% impact to the top-line). As we look forward, we are pleased with the ongoing traction with the company's DatAlert add-on and see a growing number of relevant use-cases that should help sustain growth in 2017." (2/9/2017)
4. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "VRNS reported another impressive Q, exceeding both rev and EPS estimates. Q1 guidance was above expectations. 23% license growth was down from 34% in the prior period, although still impressive given a tough comp. VP of Finance Guy Melamed will assume CFO responsibilities on April 1. We continue to view VRNS as a unique asset addressing significant needs across IT, including security associated with internal threats." (2/9/2017)

Consensus Ratings for Varonis Systems (NASDAQ:VRNS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold Ratings, 8 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.80)Consensus Price Target: $39.40 (5.63% upside)
