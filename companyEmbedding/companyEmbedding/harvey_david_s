We love all the gorgeous details of the season, from the Christmas gift baskets and gourmet Christmas gifts to the rustle of gift-wrap, the twinkling of lights, the slow drift of snowflakes, and the gleam of ornaments on the tree. It’s the season for gourmet Christmas gifts. Picture delicious, gourmet gifts for Christmas under the tree, waiting to be unwrapped and enjoyed by all. The holidays can be a busy time, but you shouldn’t be stressed when you’re out doing your Christmas shopping or looking for gifts online. Unique food gifts for Christmas are always a hit. From delightful fresh fruit and decadent chocolate to savory snacks and premium baked goods, there’s something for everyone to enjoy. Our Christmas gift baskets, gift towers, and Christmas gift boxes with wine pairings are just a few ideas in addition to our Christmas gift basket ideas, each guaranteed to make this season merry. Discover the perfect gift for a memorable holiday celebration. Our holiday gift guide makes selecting gifts for that next Christmas gift delivery quick and easy.

EXPLORE OUR GOURMET CLUB COLLECTION
                    
 Our customers love to send premium fruit and gourmet delights, delivered every month in perfect condition. A revolutionary program rooted deep within our history, our Fruit-of-the-Month Club® Collections have expanded over the years to offer decadent chocolates and chocolate-dipped fruit, artisan cheeses, premium Harry & David™ wine, fall favorites, bestsellers from our family of brands, and so much more.
                

                    Fueled by innovation, brothers Harry and David introduced the world's first monthly fruit Club in 1936. The brothers’ entrepreneurial spirits thrived on their commitment to quality and unparalleled service, and such dedication has been repeatedly exemplified over the years. To this day, our buyers travel the globe to curate the finest quality products from premium purveyors, orchards, and fields that uphold the same standards as we have since 1934. We look forward to delivering these monthly Clubs, full of delicious gourmet delights and handpicked fruit that has been harvested at peak ripeness, directly to your door.

High Quality Gift Baskets
If you want the highest quality gift baskets, luxury food gifts, and gourmet food delivered, you’ve come to the right place. Quality gourmet gift baskets are brimming with the finest quality sweet and savory delights available, with premium fresh fruit from our orchards, famous chocolate truffles, and the best quality gourmet foods from around the country. Adding little touches like expertly paired wine or a personalized note makes quality gift baskets like ours that much better. 
We grow, make, or bake many of our specialty gifts right here in our home in Southern Oregon to ensure the highest quality gift baskets. It all started in 1934 with an orchard, two brothers, and a dream from our founders, Harry and David Holmes.
Types of Gift Baskets 
There are gift baskets for all occasions! Some types of gift baskets include wine or fruits perfectly paired with gourmet cheeses and charcuterie. Other types of gift baskets have savory delights like soups and appetizer spreads, or gourmet chocolate gifts with exceptional chocolate truffles. Our gourmet gift basket types include: 
 Gift Baskets with Wine
 Fruit Baskets
 Holiday Gift Baskets
 Special Occasion Gift Baskets
Sympathy Gift Baskets

Sending a Gift Basket 
Sending a gift basket starts with choosing the type of gift basket that matches the occasion. From get well gifts and sympathy gifts to happy birthday and congratulations, sending an expertly crafted gourmet gift basket full of delights and comforts is the best way to show you care. Add a touch of elegance to the gift basket you send with a perfectly paired bottle of our premium wine, or add your own sentiments with a personalized note. 
Sending a personalized gourmet gift basket of your choice has never been this easy. You can choose from standard or expedited shipping, and we can even hold your order for a specific delivery date of your choice. Many gift baskets can be customized with wine, chocolates, and other delightful options.

A Brief History of Neoliberalism
David Harvey

Neoliberalism--the doctrine that market exchange is an ethic in itself, capable of acting as a guide for all human action--has become dominant in both thought and practice throughout much of the world since 1970 or so. Writing for a wide audience, David Harvey, author of The New Imperialism and The Condition of Postmodernity, here tells the political-economic story of where neoliberalization came from and how it proliferated on the world stage. Through critical engagement with this history, he constructs a framework, not only for analyzing the political and economic dangers that now surround us, but also for assessing the prospects for the more socially just alternatives being advocated by many oppositional movements.

A Brief History of Neoliberalism
David Harvey


Reviews and Awards

Shortlisted for the Inaugural International Political Economy Group annual book prize



"The most accessible and succinct overview of neoliberalism as an ideology and economic practice yet written. It lays out the origins of the idea, the devastating impact it has had on labor in both the advanced and developing world, and how it deepened crisis tendencies within the system...Harvey has done the left a great service in laying out a clear, concise, and provocative history of neoliberalism, one that can help educate a new generation of radicals and revolutionaries."--International Socialist Review
"Harvey's book is deeply insightful, rewarding and stimulating. His history of neoliberalism may indeed be brief, but the richness and profundity of this volume is without question."--Michael J. Thompson, democratiya
"Presents a concise but extremely well-documented economic history of the last three decades, encompassing not only the usual G-7 countries but the entire world, with a particular emphasis on the US and capitalist China."-- Brian Holmes, Interactivist Info Exchange
"David Harvey has done it again. He has provided us with the most lively, readable, comprehensive, and critical guide to what might be called 'the condition of neoliberalism', uncovering its origins, tracing its spread around the globe, and exposing its devastating effects on the vast majority of people everywhere."--Leo Panitch, Canada Research Chair in Comparative Political Economy, York University, Toronto
"With characteristic brilliance, David Harvey offers a razor-sharp analysis of the history and current condition of neoliberalism. In an intellectually extraordinary tour de force, he dissects the contradictions between the freedoms offered by neoliberalism and the liberties desired by the people. This book convincingly demonstrates how neoliberalism restores class power, flirts openly with authoritarianism, and undermines democratic impulses. With democracy under siege, freedom's prospect resides squarely in the struggle for new political governance. A must read if you want to know the state we are in and how to change it."--Erik Swyngedouw, Professor of Geography, University of Oxford
"This book compellingly challenges arguments praising the supposed advantages of neoliberalism. This is particularly important when the claim that there is no alternative to neoliberal restructing has been largely accepted... Harvey 's assessment of the shortcomings of neoliberalism and the practices used to distract attention from these shortcomings is indispensable to discussions of neoliberal policies."--Aaron Peron Ogletree, J.D. The Journal of Buddhist Ethics and The Electronic Journal of Sociology
"Leave it to David Harvey to brilliantly summarize in little more than 200 pages what has taken more than thirty years to emerge as a political-economic form of governance."--The Professional Geographer
"The many strengths of A Brief History of Neoliberalism cannot be adequately conveyed in this short space, but include powerful analyses of the devastating impact of neo-liberalism on the environment and labouring conditions (especially for women), a nuanced perspective on the external and internal forces compelling states to turn towards neo-liberalism, and the ways in which Marx's concept of "primitive accumulation" is highly pertinent to the neo-liberal era of capitalism."--Labour/Le Travail
"If you want to sharpen your thinking and understanding of these questions then I strongly recommend David Harvey's new book. Even if you disagree with parts of this readable Brief History, your assumptions and analysis will be well tested, and your arguments improved."--Open Democracy
