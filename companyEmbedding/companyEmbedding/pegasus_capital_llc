Pegasus Capital Group

						Pegasus makes control investments in private companies and corporate divestitures in North America.
					

LEARN MORE









Taking manufacturing companies to the next level for nearly 20 years

Since the late 1990s, Pegasus Capital Group has acquired industrial, consumer products, chemical, packaging, agricultural products and aerospace & defense manufacturing businesses that are leaders in their respective industry niches. While some of these companies have been corporate or institution-owned, most have been built from scratch by inspirational entrepreneurs and families that recognize a need to bring in fresh resources to reach the next level of growth. These owners care deeply about their organizations and sell to Pegasus because of its commitment to nurture and maintain their life's work. Unlike many private equity firms, which traditionally have emphasized financial engineering, Pegasus has elected to remain focused on the fundamentals: making consistent, impactful enterprise improvements so that each company has the opportunity to achieve its full potential.
Pegasus realizes operational improvements in partnership with accomplished experts who have helped expand dozens of small and medium-sized manufacturing businesses. Pegasus has assembled specialists who are genuinely passionate about improving and growing the businesses they assist, taking pride in the productivity gains resulting from their efforts.
Pegasus is proud to be affiliated with LSI Consulting Group, LLC (www.lsicg.com), which boasts an extensive track record of successful lean transformations at high-growth companies. LSI has improved the operations of some of America's best companies, while simultaneously improving the culture in which employees work.
Pegasus welcomes a discussion with any exceptional manufacturer seeking to achieve its next level of success. To learn more, download the Pegasus overview by selecting the image below.
