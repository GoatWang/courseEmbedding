Giovanni was one of the first natural salon hair care brands and today is the #1 selling Natural Hair Care line in the United States Natural Products Industry. But before there was a brand there was a pioneer. Arthur Guidotti, had a vision and a love for all things hair. He began developing his passion as a hairstylist in Hollywood and Beverly Hills. Giovanni brought new life to the category by introducing natural styling aids, hair treatments, hair re-constructors, setting lotions and the like. Giovanni is committed to creating only the highest performance formulations, wrapped in aesthetically beautiful packaging and marketed with extraordinary visuals and graphics. 
Herbspro.com is proud to carry the entire range of this fine brand.
