��PRIAC Variable Contract Account A��

Prudential Retirement  � Security Annuity  � � PROSPECTUS: May 1, 2007  This prospectus describes the
Prudential Retirement Security Annuity, a flexible premium deferred annuity (the �annuity� or �contract�) offered by Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company (�PRIAC�, the �company�, �we�,
�our� or �us�) and the PRIAC Variable Contract Account A. The annuity may be offered as an individual annuity contract or as an interest in a group annuity. When offered as an interest in a group annuity, �contract� or
�annuity� also means any certificate providing rights and benefits to a person designated in the certificate. This prospectus describes important features of the annuity and what you should consider before purchasing the annuity. The
annuity or certain of its investment options or features may not be available in all states. Various rights and benefits may differ between states to meet applicable laws and regulations. For more information about variations applicable to your
state, please refer to your contract.  � The annuity is sold exclusively to fund
individual retirement accounts, within the meaning of Section�408 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the �Code�), that are for the benefit of participants electing a direct rollover from certain retirement plans funded
with a PRIAC group annuity that provides for the transfer to this contract of the Prudential IncomeFlex guaranteed withdrawal benefit the participant has under the retirement plan. We may require the custodian of the individual retirement account be
our designated affiliate. These eligible investors, in addition to such direct rollover amounts, may contribute additional purchase payments to the annuity subject to our underwriting guidelines and the Code.  � If you are purchasing the annuity as a replacement for existing variable annuity or variable life
coverage, you should consider, among other things, any surrender or penalty charges you may incur when replacing your existing coverage. Before purchasing this annuity, you also should consider whether its features and benefits meet your needs and
goals. In particular, you should consider the relative features, benefits and costs of this annuity compared with those in your retirement plan or elsewhere before transferring assets from the plan to this annuity. PRIAC is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of The Prudential Insurance Company of America.  The Funds  The annuity offers a variety of variable investment options, each a sub-account of the PRIAC Variable Contract Account A, that invests in an underlying mutual fund portfolio.
Currently, each sub-account invests in one of the following portfolios of the Advanced Series Trust: AST Capital Growth Asset Allocation Portfolio, AST Balanced Asset Allocation Portfolio, AST Conservative Asset Allocation Portfolio, and the
AST Preservation Asset Allocation Portfolio.  � Please Read this Prospectus
 Please read this prospectus before purchasing the annuity and keep it for future reference. The accompanying
prospectuses for the underlying mutual funds contain important information about the mutual funds. When you invest in a variable investment option, you should read the underlying mutual fund prospectus and keep it for future reference.

Part I Summary  Prudential Retirement Security Annuity Prospectus 
4 


Glossary  � 
We have tried to make this prospectus as easy to read and understand as possible. By the nature of the contract, however, certain technical words or terms are
unavoidable. We have identified the following as some of these words or terms. Certain terms within this prospectus are described within the text where they appear. The descriptions of those terms may not be repeated in this glossary.
 ACCUMULATION PHASE  The period that begins with the contract
date (which we define below) and ends on your annuity date (defined below), or earlier if the contract is terminated through a full withdrawal or payment of a death benefit.  � ADJUSTED CONTRACT VALUE  When you begin receiving
annuity payments, the value of your contract minus any charge we impose for premium taxes.  � ANNUAL GUARANTEED WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT  Under the terms of the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit, an amount that you may withdraw each Birthday Year
as long as the Participant lives (if the optional Prudential IncomeFlex Spousal Benefit is elected, then until the last to die of the Participant and spouse). The annual income amount is set initially as a percentage of the Protected Income Base,
but will be adjusted to reflect subsequent purchase payments, Excess Withdrawals and any Step-Up.  � ANNUITANT  The person whose life determines the amount of annuity payments that will be paid.  � ANNUITY DATE  The date you elect to begin annuity payments (annuitization). We define annuity payments below.  � ANNUITY OPTIONS  Options under the contract that define the frequency and duration of annuity payments. In your contract,
we also
refer to these as payout or annuity options. See Section�3, �What Kind Of Payments Will I Receive During The Annuity Phase�.  � ANNUITY PAYMENTS  Payments made on or after your annuity date in accordance with
the annuity option you select. Annuity payments under the payout or annuity options are not withdrawals, including withdrawals under the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit. See in Section�5, �Withdrawals with
the Prudential IncomeFlex Benefit� for more information about guaranteed withdrawals.  � ANNUITY PHASE  The period that begins with the annuity date and ends when there are no further annuity payments due under the annuity option
you select.  � BENEFICIARY  The person(s) or entity you have chosen to receive a death benefit.  � BIRTHDAY  Each anniversary of the Participant�s date of birth. If this date is
not a business day, then the Birthday will be the last business day immediately preceding the anniversary of the Participant�s date of birth.  � BIRTHDAY YEAR  Each year beginning on the Birthday and ending on the last business
day preceding the next Birthday.  � BUSINESS DAY  A day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Our business day generally ends at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. Our business day may close earlier, for example, if
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange closes early.  � CODE
 The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  PART I 
PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SUMMARY  �
5 


Glossary continued  � CONTRACT DATE  The date we accept your initial purchase payment and all necessary
paperwork in good order at the Prudential Retirement Service Center. Contract anniversaries are measured from the contract date. A contract year starts on the contract date or on a contract anniversary.  � CONTRACT OWNER, OWNER OR YOU  The person entitled to the ownership rights under
the contract. With an annuity issued as a certificate under a group annuity contract, the person designated in the certificate as
having the rights and benefits in the certificate.  � CONTRACT VALUE
 The total value of your contract, equal to the sum of the values of your investment in each investment option you have chosen. Your contract value will go up
or down based on the performance of the investment options you choose.  � DEATH
BENEFIT  If a death benefit is payable, the beneficiary you designate will receive the contract value. See Section�4, �What Is The Death
Benefit?�  � ELIGIBLE INVESTMENT  The investment options offered under a Retirement Plan when used to receive the guarantees of the Retirement Plan Prudential IncomeFlex benefit.  � EXCESS WITHDRAWALS  Withdrawals in each Birthday Year in excess of the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount. Each Excess Withdrawal reduces your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount in the same proportion as the contract value was reduced by the
Excess Withdrawal. See Section�5, �What is the Prudential IncomeFlex Benefit?�  � GOOD ORDER  An instruction received at the Prudential Retirement Service Center, utilizing such forms, signatures and dating as we require,
which is sufficiently clear that we do not need to exercise any discretion to follow such instructions.  � GUARANTEED WITHDRAWAL PERCENTAGE  The percentage of the Protected Income Base used to determine the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal
Amount. This percentage generally equals 5% if you attained age 65 at the time you lock in your guaranteed withdrawals, or 4% if you did not attain age 65. If you elect the spousal benefit, then the age of the younger of you and your spouse would be
used to determine this percentage.  � HIGHEST BIRTHDAY VALUE  For purposes of determining the Protected Income Base, the greater of (a)�the adjusted Retirement Plan Highest Birthday Value on the date the rollover transaction is executed,
and (b)�the highest contract value attained on the last business day immediately prior to each of the Participant�s Birthdays until the Participant attains (or would have attained) age 70. This value is adjusted for withdrawals. See
Section�5, �What is the Prudential IncomeFlex Benefit�.  � INDIVIDUAL
RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA)  Individual retirement accounts within the meaning of Section�408 of the Code. We may require that the custodian of the IRA
funded by the annuity be our designated affiliate. This contract is issued as a nonqualified annuity. In order for it to be used for an IRA, the contract must be issued to a custodial account established as an IRA.  � INVESTED PURCHASE PAYMENTS  Your purchase payments (which we define below) less any deduction we make for any tax charge.  � LOCK-IN DATE  The date you elect to lock in your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal
Amount under this annuity. You must attain age 55 to select a Lock-In Date (both you and your spouse must attain age 55 to select a Lock-In Date for the Prudential IncomeFlex Spousal Benefit).  � PRUDENTIAL INCOMEFLEX BENEFIT  A standard feature of the annuity that guarantees your ability to withdraw a percentage of an initial notional value called the Protected Income Base for your life if certain
conditions are satisfied. A charge for this guarantee is deducted from the value of your investment options.  PART I  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SUMMARY  �
6 


� 
PRUDENTIAL INCOMEFLEX SPOUSAL BENEFIT, OR SPOUSAL BENEFIT  An optional
version of the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit available for an additional charge. If elected and certain conditions are satisfied, then the Spousal Benefit extends guaranteed withdrawals until the last to die of you and your spouse.  � PARTICIPANT  A participant in a Retirement Plan who has a Retirement Plan Prudential IncomeFlex benefit.  � PROTECTED INCOME BASE  The Protected Income Base is used to determine the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount. Your Protected
Income Base is equal to the greatest of: (A)�the Roll-Up Value; (B)�the Highest Birthday Value; and (C)�the contract value when you lock in your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount (that is, the contract value on the Business Day
prior to the Lock-In Date).  � PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SERVICE CENTER
 For general correspondence or express overnight mail: Prudential Retirement, 30 Scranton Office Park, Scranton, PA 18507-1789. The phone number is (877)
778-2100. Prudential�s Web site is www.prudential.com.  � PURCHASE PAYMENTS
 The amount of money you pay us to purchase the contract. Generally, subject to limits of the Code, you can make additional purchase payments at any time
during the accumulation phase.  � RETIREMENT PLAN  An employment based retirement plan funded with a PRIAC group annuity that permits you or your spouse to transfer to this contract your Retirement Plan Prudential IncomeFlex
Benefit.  � RETIREMENT PLAN GUARANTEED WITHDRAWAL PERCENTAGE  The percentage of the Retirement Plan Protected Income Base used to determine the Retirement Plan Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount. This percentage generally equals 5% if you
attained age 65 at the time you locked in your guaranteed withdrawals, or 4% if you did not attain age 65. If you elected the spousal benefit, then the age of the younger of you and your spouse would be used to
determine this percentage.  � RETIREMENT PLAN HIGHEST BIRTHDAY VALUE
 The Highest Birthday Value as determined under the Retirement Plan Prudential IncomeFlex benefit.  � RETIREMENT PLAN PRUDENTIAL INCOMEFLEX BENEFIT  The Prudential IncomeFlex guaranteed withdrawal benefit as offered through a Retirement Plan.  � RETIREMENT PLAN PRUDENTIAL INCOMEFLEX SPOUSAL BENEFIT  The Prudential IncomeFlex Spousal Benefit as offered through a Retirement Plan.  � RETIREMENT PLAN ROLL-UP VALUE  The Roll-Up Value as determined under the Retirement Plan Prudential
IncomeFlex benefit.  � ROLL-UP VALUE  For purposes of determining the Protected Income Base, the adjusted Retirement Plan Roll-Up Value on the date the rollover transaction is executed, growing 5%�per year, plus subsequent purchase payments growing 5%�per year, until
the Participant attains (or would have attained) age 70. This value is adjusted for withdrawals. Please see Section 5, �What is the Prudential IncomeFlex Benefit?�  � SEPARATE ACCOUNT  Purchase payments allocated to the
variable investment options are held by us in a separate account called the PRIAC Variable Contract Account A. The separate account is set apart from all of the general assets of PRIAC.  � STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  A document
containing certain additional information about the Prudential Retirement Security Annuity. We have filed the Statement of Additional Information with the Securities and Exchange Commission and it is legally a part of this prospectus. To learn how
to obtain a copy of the Statement of Additional Information, see the front cover of this prospectus.  PART I  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SUMMARY  �

� 
STEP-UP VALUE  5% of the contract value (4% of the contract value if
your Guaranteed Withdrawal Percentage is 4%) as of the last business day immediately prior to each of the Participant�s Birthdays following the Lock-In Date.  � TAX DEFERRAL  This is a way to increase your assets
without currently being taxed. Generally, you do not pay taxes on your contract earnings until you take money out of your contract. You should be aware that this annuity will be held in a tax favored plan (an IRA), which already provides tax
deferral regardless of whether it invests in annuity contracts. See Section�9, �What Are The Tax Considerations Associated With The Prudential Retirement Security Annuity Contract?�  � VARIABLE INVESTMENT OPTION  When you choose a variable investment option, we purchase shares of the underlying mutual fund that are held as an investment for that option. We hold these shares in the separate account. The division of the separate account
of PRIAC that invests in a particular mutual fund is referred to in your contract as a sub-account.  PART I  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SUMMARY  �

 � 1 Each Portfolio invests in shares of other
Portfolios of the Fund (the Acquired Portfolios). In addition, each Portfolio may invest otherwise uninvested cash in the Dryden Core Investment Fund (Money Market and/or Short-Term Bond Series).  Investors in a Portfolio indirectly bear the fees and expenses of the Acquired Portfolios and/or Dryden Core Investment Fund. The expenses shown in the column �Acquired
Portfolio Fees and Expenses� represent a weighted average of the expense ratios of the Acquired Portfolios and/or Dryden Core Investment Fund, in which the Portfolios invested during the year ended December 31, 2006. The Portfolios do not pay
any transaction fees when they purchase and redeem shares of the Acquired Portfolios.  Where �Acquired Portfolio Fees and Expenses� are less than
0.01%, such expenses are included in the column titled �Other Expenses.� This may cause the Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses to differ from those set forth in the Financial Highlights tables of the respective Portfolios.
 2 Prudential Investments LLC and AST Investment Services, Inc. have voluntarily agreed to waive a portion of their management fee and/or limit total expenses
(expressed as an annual percentage of average daily net assets) for certain Portfolios of the Fund. These arrangements, which are set forth as follows, may be discontinued or otherwise modified at any time. Each of the Portfolios: 0.20%.

Expense Examples  � These examples are intended to help you
compare the cost of investing in the contract with the cost of investing in other variable annuity contracts. These costs include contract owner transaction expenses, contract fees, separate account annual expenses, and underlying mutual fund fees
and expenses.  The examples assume that you invest $10,000 in the contract for the time periods indicated. The examples also assume that your investment has a
5% return each year and assume the maximum fees and expenses of any of the mutual funds, which do not reflect any expense reimbursements or waivers. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would be
as indicated in the tables that follow.  � Example 1: Base
Single Life Prudential IncomeFlex Benefit  This example assumes that: 


�
�
 You invest $10,000 in Prudential Retirement Security Annuity; 


�
�
 You have the base Prudential IncomeFlex benefit; 


�
�
 You allocate all of your assets to the variable investment option having the maximum total operating expenses; 


�
�
 Your investment has a 5% return each year; and 


�
�
 The mutual fund�s total operating expenses remain the same each year.  � Example 2: Optional Spousal Prudential IncomeFlex Benefit  This example assumes that: 


�
�
 You invest $10,000 in Prudential Retirement Security Annuity; 


�
�
 You choose the optional Prudential IncomeFlex spousal benefit; 


�
�
 You allocate all of your assets to the variable investment option having the maximum total operating expenses; 


�
�
 Your investment has a 5% return each year; and 


�
�
 The mutual fund�s total operating expenses remain the same each year.  � Because this contract has no withdrawal charges, your costs are not impacted by whether or not you choose to make withdrawals. Your actual costs may
be higher or lower, but below are examples of what your costs would be based on these assumptions.  � EXPENSES WITH BASE SINGLE LIFE PRUDENTIAL INCOMEFLEX BENEFIT

Summary For Sections 1�10  � For a more complete discussion
of the following topics, see the corresponding section in Part II of the prospectus.  � SECTION 1  What Is The Prudential Retirement Security Annuity?  The Prudential Retirement Security Annuity is a contract between you, the owner, and us, the insurance company. The contract allows you to invest assets contributed to a custodial IRA in the contract, which provides variable investment
options, certain withdrawal and annuity benefits and a death benefit. The contract is intended for retirement savings or other long-term investment purposes.  The variable investment options available under the contract offer the opportunity for a favorable return that can increase your contract value. However, this is NOT guaranteed. It is possible, due to market changes, that your contract
value may decrease in value.  You can invest your money in any or all of the variable investment options. With certain restrictions, you may also
transfer assets among the variable investment options.  The contract, like all deferred annuity contracts, has two phases: the accumulation phase and
the annuity phase. During the accumulation phase, any earnings grow on a tax-deferred basis and are generally taxed as income only when you make withdrawals, including withdrawals under the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit. The annuity phase starts
when you begin receiving annuity payments from your contract. The amount of money you are able to accumulate in your contract during the accumulation phase will help determine the amount you will receive during the annuity phase. Other factors will
affect the amount of your payments, such as age, gender and the payout option you select.  We may amend the contract as permitted by law. For example,
we may add new features to the contract. Subject to applicable law, we determine whether or not to make such contract amendments available to contracts that already have been issued.  � If you change your mind about owning the contract, you may cancel your contract within 10 days after receiving it (or whatever time
period is required by applicable law). Generally, you will receive a refund equal to your contract value (plus the amount of any fees or other charges) as of the date you surrendered your contract. This time period is referred to as the �Free
Look� period. Note that the individual retirement account this annuity funds may separately provide an unconditional refund period. Please refer to your individual retirement account documents for more information.  � SECTION 2  What Investment Options Can I Choose?  You can invest your money in one or more of four variable investment options. The variable investment options
are classified according to their investment style, and to assist you in evaluating these options a brief description of each portfolio�s investment objective and key policies is set forth in Section�2.  Depending upon market conditions, you may earn or lose money in any of these options. Your contract value will fluctuate with the investment performance of the
mutual fund portfolios underlying the variable investment options you choose. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.  � SECTION 3  What Kind Of Payments Will I Receive During The Annuity Phase?
(Annuitization)  During the annuity phase, commonly called �annuitization,� you may choose from several annuity payment options, including guaranteed
payments for life. Once you begin receiving regular annuity payments, you generally cannot change your payment plan.  Note that during the
accumulation phase, the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit (discussed in Section�5) also provides guaranteed minimum income protection for your life in the form of guaranteed withdrawals. These guaranteed withdrawals do not require annuitization.

PROSPECTUS����SUMMARY  �

� 
SECTION 4  What Is The Death Benefit?  If the owner dies before the annuity phase of the contract begins, the person(s) or entity chosen as beneficiary generally will receive the contract value.  � SECTION 5  What Is The Prudential IncomeFlex (SM) Benefit?  The Prudential IncomeFlex benefit guarantees your ability to withdraw a designated amount from the
annuity annually, subject to our rules regarding the timing and amount of withdrawals. This annual guaranteed withdrawal amount is equal to a percentage of an initial notional value (called the �Protected Income Base�), regardless of the
impact of market performance on your actual contract value. This benefit is designed to provide an annual withdrawal amount for life. You must attain age 55 before starting Prudential IncomeFlex guaranteed withdrawals (both you and your spouse must
attain age 55 to begin guaranteed withdrawals with the spousal benefit).  Prudential IncomeFlex is a standard feature of the annuity that applies to
the annuitant automatically. The spousal benefit is optional and may be elected for an additional charge. The current charge for the base Prudential IncomeFlex benefit is a daily fee equal on an annual basis to 0.95% of the contract value (1.45% if
the optional spousal benefit is elected).  � SECTION 6  How Can I Purchase The Prudential Retirement Security Annuity?  The contract is available
only to investors transferring funds directly from a retirement plan in which they have a Prudential IncomeFlex benefit to an individual retirement account. You can purchase this contract, unless we agree otherwise and subject to our rules, with a
minimum initial purchase payment of $20,000. You must get our prior approval for any initial and additional purchase payment of $1 million or more, unless we are prohibited under applicable state law from insisting on such prior approval. Generally,
subject to the Code, you can make additional purchase payments at any time during the accumulation phase of the contract. Our Retirement Investment Counselors can help you fill out the proper forms. This contract
is issued as a nonqualified annuity. In order for it to be used for an IRA, the contract must be issued to a custodial account established as an IRA.  � SECTION 7  What Are The Expenses Associated With The Prudential Retirement Security
Annuity?  The contract has insurance features and investment features, and there are costs related to each.  �


�
�
 Each year we deduct a contract maintenance charge of up to $150.00. Currently, we waive this charge. 


�
�
 For insurance and administrative costs, we also deduct daily a charge of up to an annual rate of 1.60% based on the average daily value of all assets allocated to the
variable investment options. This charge is currently 0.50%. 


�
�
 We also deduct a charge for the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit (see Section�5, �What is the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit?�). The current daily cost is
equivalent to an annual charge of: 


�
�
�
 Up to 1.45% with the base Prudential IncomeFlex benefit. This charge is currently 0.95%; or 


�
�
�
 Up to 2.05% if you choose the optional Prudential IncomeFlex spousal benefit. This charge is currently 1.45% (i.e., 0.50% more than the base Prudential IncomeFlex charge).
 There are also expenses associated with the underlying mutual funds. For 2006, the fees of these funds ranged from 1.05% to 1.12%
annually. For certain funds, expenses are reduced by expense waivers and comparable arrangements. In general, these expense waivers and comparable arrangements are not guaranteed, and may be terminated at any time.  For more information, including details about other possible charges under the contract, see �Summary Of Contract Expenses� and Section�7, �What
Are The Expenses Associated With The Prudential Retirement Security Annuity Contract?�  PART I  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SUMMARY  �

Summary For Sections continued  � 
SECTION 8  How Can I Access My Money?  You may withdraw money at any time during the accumulation phase. You may, however, be subject to income tax. If you make a
withdrawal prior to age 59�1/2, you also may be subject to an additional tax penalty.  This contract provides an insurance benefit, called Prudential IncomeFlex, under which we guarantee that certain amounts will be available to you for withdrawal,
regardless of market-related declines in your contract value. You are not required to withdraw these guaranteed amounts.  � SECTION 9  What Are The Tax Considerations Associated With The Prudential Retirement
Security Annuity?  This contract is offered exclusively to fund certain individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Because this contract is issued as a nonqualified annuity, the contract must be issued to a custodial account established as an IRA.  Generally, all amounts withdrawn from IRAs (excluding qualified distributions from Roth IRAs) are taxable and
subject to a 10% penalty if withdrawn prior to age 59�1/2. Currently, this contract is not available to fund Roth IRAs.
 � SECTION 10  Other Information  This contract is issued by Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Prudential Insurance Company of America. The contract is sold through registered representatives of affiliated broker/dealers.  PART I  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SUMMARY  �

Part II Sections 1�10  Prudential Retirement Security Annuity Prospectus 
17 



1:  What Is The Prudential Retirement  Security Annuity?
 � 
The Prudential Retirement Security Annuity is a contract between you, the owner, and us, the insurance company. Under our contract, in exchange for your payment to us,
we promise to pay you a guaranteed stream of payments upon annuitization that can begin any time after the first contract anniversary. Your annuity is in the accumulation phase until you decide to begin receiving these annuity payments. The date you
elect to begin receiving annuity payments is the annuity date. On the annuity date, your contract switches to the annuity phase. The contract also permits you to make guaranteed withdrawals during the accumulation phase. See Section�5,
�What is the Prudential IncomeFlexSM Benefit?�, for further details. These withdrawals are different than annuity payments.
 Annuity contracts generally benefit from tax deferral when sold outside a tax-favored plan (generally called a non-qualified annuity). Tax deferral
means that you are not taxed on earnings or appreciation on the assets in your contract until you withdraw money from your contract. This annuity is offered exclusively to fund certain individual retirement accounts (IRAs), which generally provide
tax deferral without investing in an annuity contract. In other words, you need not purchase this contract to gain the preferential tax treatment provided by your IRA. Therefore, before purchasing this annuity, you should consider whether its
features and benefits beyond tax deferral, including the income and death benefits, meet your needs and goals. You should consider the relative features, benefits and costs of this annuity compared with any other investments or benefits available
through your retirement plan or elsewhere.  The Prudential Retirement Security Annuity is a variable annuity contract. This means that during the
accumulation phase, you can allocate your assets among the variable investment options. The amount of money you are able to accumulate in your contract during the accumulation phase depends upon the investment performance of the underlying mutual
fund associated with that variable investment option. Because the underlying mutual funds� portfolios fluctuate in value depending upon market conditions, your contract value can either increase or decrease.
This is important, since the amount of the annuity payments you receive during the annuity phase depends upon the value of your contract at the time you begin receiving payments.  As the owner of the contract, you have all of the decision-making rights under the contract. You will also be the annuitant. The annuitant is the person who
receives the annuity payments when the annuity phase begins. The annuitant is also the person whose life is used to determine the amount of these payments and how long (if applicable) the payments will continue once the annuity phase begins. On or
after the annuity date, the annuitant may not be changed.  The beneficiary is the person(s) or entity you designate to receive any death benefit. You
may change the beneficiary any time prior to the annuity date by making a written request to us. The optional Prudential IncomeFlex spousal benefit requires your spouse to be both your spouse and beneficiary when you elect the benefit and when you
die. See Section�5, �What is the Prudential IncomeFlex Benefit?�  � 
SHORT TERM CANCELLATION RIGHT OR �FREE LOOK�  If you change your mind about owning the Prudential Retirement
Security Annuity, you may cancel your contract within 10 days after receiving it (or whatever period is required by applicable law). You can request a refund by returning the contract either to the representative who sold it to you, or to the
Prudential Retirement Service Center at the address shown on the first page of this prospectus. Generally, you will receive a refund equal to your contract value (plus the amount of any fees or other charges) as of the date you surrendered your
contract less applicable federal and state income tax withholding (or whatever amount is required by applicable law). Note that the individual retirement account this annuity funds may separately provide an unconditional refund period. Please refer
to your individual retirement account documents for more information.  PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10  �
18 



2:  What Investment Options  Can I Choose?  � The contract gives you the choice of allocating your purchase payments to any of the variable
investment options.  The variable investment options invest in selected portfolios of the Advanced Series Trust, which is a mutual fund. The Advanced
Series Trust sells shares to both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of different insurance companies, which could create the kinds of conflicts that are described in more detail in the current prospectus for the
underlying mutual fund. The current prospectuses for the Advanced Series Trust portfolios available in your contract also contain important information about each of the underlying mutual funds in which your variable investment options invest. When
you invest in a variable investment option funded by a mutual fund, you should read the mutual fund prospectus and keep it for future reference.  � 
VARIABLE INVESTMENT OPTIONS  The following chart classifies each of the portfolios based on our assessment of their investment style (as
of the date of this prospectus). The chart also lists each portfolio�s investment objective and a short, summary description of their investment policies to assist you in determining which portfolios may be of interest to you. There is no
guarantee that any portfolio will meet its investment objective and you could lose money. The name of the adviser for each portfolio appears next to the description.  The portfolios of the Advanced Series Trust are co-managed by Prudential Investments LLC and AST Investment Services, Incorporated, which are both indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Prudential Financial, Inc.  � A fund or portfolio may have a similar name or an investment objective and investment
policies resembling those of a mutual fund managed by the same investment adviser that is sold directly to the public. Despite such similarities, there can be no assurance that the investment performance of any such fund or portfolio will resemble
that of the publicly available mutual fund.  PRIAC has entered into agreements with certain underlying portfolios and/or the investment adviser or
distributor of such portfolios. PRIAC may provide administrative and support services to such portfolios pursuant to the terms of these agreements and under which it receives a fee of up to 0.10% annually (as of May 1, 2007) of the average assets
allocated to the portfolio under the contract. These agreements, including the fees paid and services provided, can vary for each underlying mutual fund whose portfolios are offered as sub-accounts.  In addition, the investment adviser, sub-adviser or distributor of the underlying portfolios may also compensate us by providing reimbursement or paying directly
for, among other things, marketing and/or administrative services and/or other services they provide in connection with the contract. These services may include, but are not limited to: co-sponsoring various meetings and seminars attended by
broker/dealer firms� registered representatives, plan sponsors and participants, and creating marketing material discussing the contract and the available options.  � [SPACE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]  PART II

TRANSFERS AMONG OPTIONS  Subject to certain restrictions, you can transfer money among the variable investment options. The minimum
transfer amount is the lesser of $250 or the total amount in the investment option from which the transfer is to be made. Currently, we waive this minimum transfer amount. We have the right to begin imposing this minimum transfer amount for any
future transfers.  In general, your transfer request may be made by telephone, electronically, or otherwise in paper form to the Prudential Retirement
Service Center. We have procedures in place to confirm that instructions received by  PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10 
20 


� 
telephone or electronically are genuine. We will not be liable for following telephone or electronic instructions that we reasonably believe to be genuine. Your
transfer request will take effect at the end of the business day on which it was received in good order by us, or by certain entities that we have specifically designated. Transfer requests received after the close of the business day will take
effect at the end of the next business day.  During the contract accumulation phase, you can make up to 12 transfers each contract year, among the
investment options, without charge. If you make more than 12 transfers in one contract year, you may be charged up to $30 for each additional transfer. For purposes of the 12 free transfers per year that we allow, we will treat multiple transfers
that are submitted on the same business day as a single transfer. Currently, we waive this transfer charge. We have the right to begin imposing this charge for any future transfers.  � REDEMPTION FEES AND ABUSIVE TRADING PRACTICES  The practice
of making frequent transfers among variable investment options in response to short-term fluctuations in markets, sometimes called �market timing� or �excessive trading,� can make it very difficult for a portfolio manager to
manage an underlying mutual fund�s investments. Frequent transfers may cause the fund to hold more cash than otherwise necessary, disrupt management strategies, increase transaction costs or affect performance. For these reasons, the annuity
was not designed for persons who make programmed, large or frequent transfers.  We consider �market timing/excessive trading� to be one or
more trades into and out of (or out of and into) the same variable investment option within a rolling 30-day period when each exceeds a certain dollar threshold. Automatic or system-driven transactions, such as regularly scheduled or periodic
distributions do not constitute prohibited excessive trading and will not be subject to these criteria.  In light of the risks posed by market
timing/excessive trading to contract owners and other mutual fund investors, we monitor annuity transactions in an effort to identify such trading practices. We reserve the right to limit the number of transfers in any year for all contract
owners, and to take the other actions discussed below. We also reserve the right to refuse any transfer request from all or certain contract owners if: (a) we believe that market timing (as we define it) has
occurred; or (b) we are informed by an underlying fund that transfers in its shares must be restricted under its policies and procedures concerning excessive trading.  In furtherance of our general authority to restrict transfers as described above, and without limiting other actions we may take in the future, we have adopted the following specific procedures: 


�
�
 Warning. Upon identification of activity that meets the market-timing criteria, a warning letter will be sent to the contract owner. 


�
�
 Restriction. A second incidence of activity meeting the market timing criteria within a six-month period will trigger a trade restriction. To the extent permitted by
law, we will restrict a contract owner from trading through the Internet, phone or facsimile for all investment options available to the contract owner. In such case, the contract owner will be required to provide written direction via standard
(non-overnight) U.S. mail delivery for trades of the underlying funds. The duration of a trade restriction is 3 months, and may be extended incrementally (3 months) if the behavior recurs during the 6-month period immediately following the initial
restriction. 


�
�
 Action by an Underlying Fund. The portfolios may have adopted their own policies and procedures with respect to excessive trading of their respective shares, and we
reserve the right to enforce these policies and procedures. The prospectuses for the portfolios describe any such policies and procedures, which may be more or less restrictive than the policies and procedures we have adopted. Under federal
securities regulations, we are required to: (1) enter into a written agreement with each portfolio or its principal underwriter that obligates us to provide to the portfolio promptly upon request certain information about the trading activity of
individual contract owners, and (2) execute instructions from the portfolio to restrict or prohibit further purchases or transfers by specific contract  � PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY
PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10 
21 


2:  What Investment Options Can I Choose?
continued  �


�
 
owners who violate the excessive trading policies established by the portfolio. In addition, you should be aware that some portfolios may receive �omnibus�
purchase and redemption orders from other insurance companies or intermediaries such as retirement plans. The omnibus orders reflect the aggregation and netting of multiple orders from individual owners of variable insurance contracts and/or
individual retirement plan participants. The omnibus nature of these orders may limit the portfolios in their ability to apply their excessive trading policies and procedures. In addition, the other insurance companies and/or retirement plans may
have different policies and procedures or may not have any such policies and procedures because of contractual limitations. For these reasons, we cannot guarantee that the portfolios (and thus contract owners) will not be harmed by transfer activity
relating to other insurance companies and/or retirement plans that may invest in the portfolios.  A portfolio also may assess a
short term trading fee in connection with a transfer out of the variable investment option investing in that portfolio that occurs within a certain number of days following the date of allocation to the variable investment option. Each portfolio
determines the amount of the short term trading fee and when the fee is imposed. The fee is retained by or paid to the portfolio and is not retained by us. The fee will be deducted from your contract value.  Although our transfer restrictions are designed to prevent excessive transfers, they are not capable of preventing every potential occurrence of excessive transfer
activity.  � SCHEDULED TRANSACTIONS  Scheduled transactions include systematic withdrawals, systematic investments, required minimum distributions, substantially equal periodic payments under Section�72(t) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code), and annuity payments. Scheduled transactions are processed and valued as of the date they are scheduled, unless the scheduled day is not a business day. In that case, the transaction will be
processed and valued on the next business day, unless (with respect to required minimum distributions, substantially equal periodic payments under Section�72(t) of the Code, and annuity payments only), the
next business day falls in the subsequent calendar year, in which case the transaction will be processed and valued on the prior business day.  � VOTING RIGHTS  We are the legal owner of the shares of the underlying mutual funds used by
the variable investment options. However, we vote the shares of the mutual funds according to voting instructions we receive from contract owners. When a vote is required, we will mail you a proxy, which is a form you need to complete and return to
us to tell us how you wish us to vote. When we receive those instructions, we will vote all of the shares we own on your behalf in accordance with those instructions. We will vote fund shares for which we do not receive instructions, and any other
shares that we own in our own right, in the same proportion as shares for which we receive instructions from contract owners. This voting procedure is sometimes referred to as �mirror voting� because, as indicated in the immediately
preceding sentence, we mirror the votes that are actually cast, rather than decide on our own how to vote. In addition, because all the shares of a given mutual fund held within our separate account are legally owned by us, we intend to vote all of
such shares when that underlying fund seeks a vote of its shareholders. As such, all such shares will be counted towards whether there is a quorum at the underlying fund�s shareholder meeting and towards the ultimate outcome of the vote. Thus,
under �mirror voting,� it is possible that the votes of a small percentage of contract owners who actually vote will determine the ultimate outcome. We may change the way your voting instructions are calculated if it is required or
permitted by federal or state regulation.  � 
SUBSTITUTION  We may substitute one or more of the underlying mutual funds used by the variable investment options. We may also cease to
allow investments in existing funds. We would not do this without the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and any necessary state insurance departments. You will be given specific notice in advance of any substitution we intend
to make.  � PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10

3:  What Kind Of Payments Will I Receive During The  Annuity Phase? (Annuitization)  � � 

PAYMENT PROVISIONS  You can begin taking annuity payments any time after the first contract anniversary. We make the income plans
described below available at any time before the annuity date. These plans are called �annuity options� or �settlement options.� During the annuity phase, all of the annuity options under this contract are fixed annuity options.
This means that your participation in the variable investment options ends on the annuity date. Generally, once the annuity payments begin, the annuity option cannot be changed and you cannot make withdrawals or surrender the Contract. 
IN ADDITION TO THE ANNUITY PAYMENT OPTIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS SECTION, PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PRUDENTIAL INCOMEFLEX BENEFIT OFFERS GUARANTEED INCOME IN THE FORM OF
GUARANTEED WITHDRAWALS. THIS SECTION DOES NOT DESCRIBE PRUDENTIAL INCOMEFLEX. PLEASE SEE SECTION�5 OF THIS PROSPECTUS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRUDENTIAL INCOMEFLEX BENEFIT.  � 
Option 1  Annuity Payments For A Fixed Period  Under this option, we will make equal payments for the period chosen, up to 25 years (but not to exceed life expectancy). The annuity payments may be made monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually, as you choose, for the fixed period.
If the annuitant dies during the annuity phase, payments will continue to the beneficiary for the remainder of the fixed period or, if the beneficiary so chooses, we will make a single lump sum payment. The amount of the lump sum payment is
determined by calculating the present value of the unpaid future payments. This is done by using the interest rate used to compute the actual payments.  � 
Option 2  Life Income Annuity Option  Under
this option, we will make annuity payments monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually as long as the annuitant is alive. If the annuitant dies before we have made 10 years worth of payments, we will pay the beneficiary in one lump sum the present
value of the annuity payments scheduled to have been made over the remaining portion of that 10 year period, unless we were specifically instructed that such remaining annuity payments continue to be paid to the
beneficiary. The present value of the remaining annuity payments is calculated by using the interest rate used to compute the amount of the original 120 payments.  � 
Other Annuity Options  We currently offer a variety of other annuity options not described above. At the time annuity payments are
chosen, we may make available to you any of the fixed annuity options that are offered at your annuity date.  � 
TAX CONSIDERATIONS  Your contract will be held in a custodial account established as an individual retirement account (IRA). Therefore,
you should consider the required minimum distribution provisions of the Code requirements of the IRA when selecting your annuity option.  � 
HOW WE DETERMINE ANNUITY PAYMENTS  Generally speaking, the annuity phase of the contract involves our distributing to you in increments
the value that you have accumulated. We make these incremental payments either over a specified time period (e.g., 15 years) (fixed period annuities) or for the duration of the life of the annuitant (and possibly co-annuitant) (life annuities).
There are certain assumptions that are common to both fixed period annuities and life annuities. In each type of annuity, we assume that the value you apply at the outset toward your annuity payments earns interest throughout the payout period. If
our current annuity purchase rates on the annuity date are more favorable to you than the guaranteed rates stated below, we will make payments based on those more favorable rates.  Assumptions that we use for life annuities and fixed period annuities differ, as detailed in the following overview:  � Fixed Period Annuities  Generally speaking, in determining the amount of each annuity payment under a fixed period annuity, we start  PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10  �

with the adjusted contract value and add interest assumed to be earned over the fixed period. Using the interest in effect, we determine the benefit that can be
supported during the guaranteed period such that the present value of the benefit payments equals the accumulated account balance. The life expectancy of the annuitant and co-annuitant are relevant to this calculation only in that we will not allow
you to select a fixed period that exceeds life expectancy.  � Life Annuities
 There are more variables that affect our calculation of life annuity payments. Most importantly, we make several assumptions about the annuitant�s or
co-annuitant�s life expectancy.  � Below are the standard assumptions
that determine the guaranteed annuity benefit. As stated above, if current assumptions provide a more favorable benefit, the more favorable benefit will be paid.

 In addition, certain states may require the use of assumptions that produce a more favorable benefit. When these requirements apply, the more
favorable benefit will be paid.  � PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10

4:  What Is The  Death Benefit?  � The death benefit feature protects the contract value for the beneficiary.  � 
BENEFICIARY  The beneficiary is the person(s) or entity you name to receive any death benefit. The beneficiary is named at the time the
contract is issued, unless you change it at a later date. A change of beneficiary will take effect on the date you sign the change request form, provided that we receive the form in good order. Unless an irrevocable beneficiary has been named,
during the accumulation period you can change the beneficiary at any time before the owner dies.  The optional Prudential IncomeFlex spousal benefit
requires your spouse to be both your spouse and beneficiary when you elect the benefit and when you die. See Section�5, �What is the Prudential IncomeFlex Benefit?�  � 
CALCULATION OF THE DEATH BENEFIT  If the owner dies during the accumulation period, after we receive the appropriate proof of death and
any other needed documentation (�due proof of death�), your beneficiary will receive the contract value as of the date we receive due proof of death. We require due proof of death to be submitted promptly.  � 
PAYOUT OPTIONS  The beneficiary may, within 60 days of providing due proof of death, choose to take the death benefit under one of
several death benefit payout options listed below.  The death benefit payout options are:  Choice 1. Lump sum payment of the death benefit. If the beneficiary does not choose a payout option within sixty days, the beneficiary will receive this payout
option. Payment as a transfer to another IRA titled as an inherited IRA would also be included in this payout option.  � Choice 2. The payment of the entire death benefit within 5 years of the date of death of the owner.  Choice 3. Payment of the death benefit under an annuity or annuity settlement option over the lifetime of the beneficiary or over a period not extending beyond the
life expectancy of the beneficiary with distribution beginning within one year of the date of death of the owner.  If the beneficiary is the spouse of the owner at the time of the owner�s death, then the contract will continue and the spouse will become the owner. The spouse may, within 60 days of providing due proof of death, elect to
take the death benefit under any of the payout options described above. In addition, the spouse can choose to defer payments until the IRA owner would have reached age 70�1/2 or can change title to the account to the spouse�s name.  The tax
consequences to the beneficiary vary among the three death benefit payout options. See Section�9, �What Are The Tax Considerations Associated With The Prudential Retirement Security Annuity Contract?�  Any portion of the death benefit not applied under Choice 3 within one year of the owner�s date of death must be distributed within five years of the date of
death.  PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY

5:  What Is The Prudential  IncomeFlexSM Benefit?  � 
PRUDENTIAL INCOMEFLEXSM BENEFIT  The Prudential IncomeFlex benefit is a standard feature of the contract that guarantees your ability to withdraw amounts equal to a percentage of an initial notional value (called
the �Protected Income Base�), regardless of the impact of market performance on your contract value (subject to our rules regarding the timing and amount of withdrawals). There are two options � one is the base benefit designed to
provide an annual withdrawal amount for your life and the other is a spousal benefit designed to provide the same annual withdrawal amount until the last to die of you and your spouse.  The base Prudential IncomeFlex benefit and its daily charge apply to the contract automatically. It cannot be terminated without ending your contract. When deciding
to purchase this contract, you should consider the costs and benefits of this feature. Generally, this benefit may be appropriate if you intend to make periodic withdrawals from your contract and wish to ensure that adverse market performance will
not affect your ability to receive annual payments. You are not required to make withdrawals.  The Prudential IncomeFlex spousal benefit is optional.
You may elect this benefit when you lock in your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount. There is an additional daily charge for this benefit, which applies only after the Lock-In Date. Once elected, the spousal benefit may not be revoked, and the
additional daily charge will continue until your contract ends, even if your spouse dies before you or is otherwise ineligible for the spousal benefit due to divorce or beneficiary changes.  The Prudential IncomeFlex benefit is subject to certain restrictions described below.  � 
Transfer of Retirement Plan Guarantees  This contract is sold exclusively to Participants who have a Prudential IncomeFlex benefit in
connection with a Retirement Plan. This contract is designed to accept the transfer of certain Retirement Plan Prudential IncomeFlex benefit values in connection with a direct rollover of assets to an individual retirement account. In connection
with the rollover transaction, each guarantee value described below will begin with a value equal to the corresponding Retirement Plan guarantee value, assuming a transfer of all Retirement Plan account assets
invested in Eligible Investments. If less than 100% of assets invested in Eligible Investments are rolled over to the contract, then the initial guarantee values described below will be reduced proportionately.  If you purchase this contract prior to your Retirement Plan Guaranteed Withdrawal Lock-In Date, then your Retirement Plan Roll-Up and Highest Birthday Values will
be used to determine your initial Roll-Up Value, Highest Birthday Value, and Protected Income Base under this contract. You also can choose whether to elect the Prudential IncomeFlex spousal benefit at the time you lock in your Annual Guaranteed
Withdrawal Amount under this contract.  If you purchase this contract on or after your Retirement Plan Guaranteed Withdrawal Lock-In Date, then your
Retirement Plan Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount will be used to determine your initial Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount under this contract. Your guaranteed withdrawals will be available immediately, and you will not establish a Roll-Up
Value, Highest Birthday Value or Protected Income Base under this contract. If you elected the Retirement Plan Prudential IncomeFlex Spousal Benefit, then you will automatically receive and be charged for the Prudential IncomeFlex spousal benefit
under this contract. If you purchase this contract on or after your Retirement Plan Guaranteed Withdrawal Lock-In Date, then you may not add or remove the spousal benefit after you purchase this contract.  This section continues with a description of the basic elements of the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit, including the Protected Income Base, Roll-Up Value, Highest
Birthday Value and Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount. Then this section describes and provides examples of how these elements apply in situations where you locked in your Prudential IncomeFlex benefit in your Retirement Plan before purchasing this
contract. Next, this section explains how the elements apply when you lock in the benefit after purchasing this contract. Finally, this section covers  PART II

� 
withdrawals, the optional spousal benefit, step-ups and other special considerations with the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit.  � 
Protected Income Base  The Protected Income Base is used to determine the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount. Your Protected Income Base
is equal to the greatest of: (A)�the Roll-Up Value; (B)�the Highest Birthday Value; and (C)�the contract value when you lock in your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount (that is, the contract value on the business day prior to the
Lock-In Date). In no event shall the Protected Income Base exceed $5,000,000. We reserve the right to increase this maximum.  � 
Roll-Up Value  The initial Roll-Up Value is determined by your Retirement Plan Roll-Up Value. If this contract is purchased with 100% of
the assets invested in Eligible Investments, then the initial Roll-Up Value equals the Retirement Plan Roll-Up Value on the date the rollover transaction is executed. If this contract is purchased with less than 100% of the assets invested in the
Eligible Investments, then the initial Roll-Up Value shall be reduced proportionately. For example, if this contract is purchased with 60% of the assets invested in Eligible Investments, then the initial Roll-Up Value will be 60% of the Retirement
Plan Roll-Up Value on the date the rollover transaction is executed. Your initial Roll-Up Value may be lower than the market value of assets transferred to purchase this contract, and therefore your initial Roll-Up Value may be lower than your
initial contract value.  Unless limited by state law, the Roll-Up Value will then equal the initial Roll-Up Value growing 5%�per year, plus the
amount of any subsequent purchase payments growing at 5%�per year from the application of the purchase payment to your contract, until the earlier of the date the Retirement Plan participant (the �Participant�) attains (or would have
attained) age 70 or the Lock-In Date. The Roll-Up Value is also increased by the amount of purchase payments made after the Participant attains (or would have attained) age 70 and before the Lock-In Date.  � Withdrawals prior to the Lock-In Date reduce your Roll-Up Value proportionately. Each
withdrawal reduces the Roll-Up Value by the percentage equivalent of the ratio of (a)�the amount of the withdrawal, to (b)�the contract value (before the contract value is reduced by the amount of the withdrawal).  � Example � Proportional Reduction of Roll-Up Value  �

Highest Birthday Value  The initial Highest Birthday Value is determined by your Retirement Plan Highest Birthday Value. If this contract
is purchased with 100% of the assets invested in Eligible Investments, then the initial Highest Birthday Value equals the Retirement Plan Highest Birthday Value on the date the rollover transaction is executed. If this contract is purchased with
less than 100% of the assets invested in the Eligible Investments, then the initial Roll-Up Value shall be reduced proportionately. For example, if this contract is purchased with 60% of the assets invested in Eligible Investments, then the initial
Highest Birthday Value will be 60% of the Retirement Plan Highest Birthday Value on the date the rollover transaction is executed. Your initial Highest Birthday Value may be lower than the market value of assets transferred to purchase this
contract, and therefore your initial Highest Birthday Value may be lower than your initial contract value.  The Highest Birthday Value will then equal
the greater of the initial Highest Birthday Value and the highest contract value attained on each of the Participant�s Birthdays, until the earlier of the date the Participant attains (or would have attained) age 70 or the Lock-In Date. Until
the Lock-In Date, each Highest Birthday Value attained is also increased by the amount of subsequent purchase payments made.  � PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY

Withdrawals prior to the Lock-In Date reduce your Highest Birthday Value proportionately. Each withdrawal reduces the Highest Birthday Value by the percentage

Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount  The Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount is the amount we guarantee that you may withdraw from the
contract each Birthday Year for your life, regardless of the impact of market performance on your contract value. The Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount is subject to our rules regarding the timing and amount of withdrawals. In no event shall the
Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount under this contract exceed $250,000. We reserve the right to increase this maximum.  You may not lock in an Annual
Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount that is less than $800. Therefore, your Protected Income Base must equal $16,000 or more to lock in guaranteed withdrawals ($20,000 or more if your Guaranteed Withdrawal Percentage is 4%). Before purchasing the contract,
you should consider the description of Protected Income Base above to determine your ability to lock in guaranteed withdrawals. Your ability to lock in the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit is not guaranteed.  � 
Lock-In Date Elected In Retirement Plan  If your Retirement Plan Lock-In Date was elected before purchasing this contract, then your
Retirement Plan Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount will be used to determine your initial Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount under this contract. If you purchase this contract with 100% of the assets invested in
Eligible Investments, then the initial Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount equals the Retirement Plan Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount on the date the rollover transaction is executed. If you purchase this contract with less than 100% of the
assets invested in the Eligible Investments, then the initial Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount shall be reduced proportionately. For example, if this contract is purchased with 60% of the assets invested in Eligible Investments, then the initial
Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount will be 60% of the Retirement Plan Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount on the date the rollover transaction is executed. The Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount available between the date the contract is issued
and the end of the current Birthday Year will be reduced by guaranteed withdrawals made in the Retirement Plan during the same Birthday Year. In other words, guaranteed withdrawals made in the plan during the Birthday Year you purchase the contract
will count toward your guaranteed withdrawals under the contract (adjusted in the manner described above if this contract is purchased with less than 100% of assets invested in Eligible Investments).  You can increase your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount by making additional purchase payments (subsequent to the initial purchase payment). The amount of the
increase is equal to 5% of any additional purchase payments (4% of additional purchase payments if your Retirement Plan Guaranteed Withdrawal Percentage was 4%). We will add the increase to your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount on the day you
make the purchase payment, subject to the following: 


�
�
 During the initial Birthday Year when the contract is issued, any increase to the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount available between the date of the purchase payment and
the Participant�s next Birthday will be prorated by the ratio of (i)�the number of days remaining in the Birthday Year and (ii)�365 days. In other words, the increase to the  � PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10 
28 


�


�
 
Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount during the initial Birthday Year will be reduced proportionately for the partial year remaining after the purchase payment is made.
This adjustment in the initial Birthday Year will not reduce the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount in future Birthday Years. 


�
�
 If the purchase payment is made after an Excess Withdrawal has occurred in any Birthday Year, then the increase will not apply until the next Birthday Year. In other words,
once an Excess Withdrawal has occurred in a Birthday Year, all additional withdrawals in that Birthday Year will be Excess Withdrawals, even if additional purchase payments are made. For information about Excess Withdrawals, see �Withdrawals
with the Prudential IncomeFlex Benefit,� later in this section.  Your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount may also increase for
Step-Ups (described below) under �Step-Up � Increase of Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount�).  � 
Guaranteed Withdrawal Lock-In Date NOT Elected In Retirement Plan  If your Retirement Plan Guaranteed Withdrawal Lock-In Date was not
elected before purchasing this contract, then your initial Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount under this contract will be determined when you choose to lock in your guaranteed withdrawals (the �Lock-In Date�). You must attain age 55 to
elect a Lock-In Date. If you have attained age 65, then your initial Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount will equal 5% of the Protected Income Base (4% of the Protected Income Base if you have not attained age 65), as of the business day prior to
your Lock-In Date. The Protected Income Base is equal to the greatest of: (A)�the Roll-Up Value; (B)�the Highest Birthday Value; and (C)�the contract value as of the Business Day prior to the Lock-In Date. If your Lock-In Date is not
on the Participant�s Birthday, then the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount available between the Lock-In Date and the Participant�s next Birthday will be prorated by the ratio of (i)�the number of days remaining in the Birthday Year
and (ii)�365 days. In other words, the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount during the Birthday Year you lock in guaranteed withdrawals will be reduced proportionately if that year is a partial year. This
adjustment in the first Birthday Year will not reduce the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount in future Birthday Years.  You can increase your Annual
Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount by making subsequent purchase payments after your Lock-In Date. The increase is equal to 5% of any additional purchase payments (4% of additional purchase payments if your Guaranteed Withdrawal Percentage is 4%). We will
add the increase to your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount on the day you make the purchase payment, subject to the following: 


�
�
 During the Birthday Year you lock in guaranteed withdrawals, any increase to the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount available between the date of the purchase payment and
the Participant�s next Birthday will be prorated by the ratio of (i)�the number of days remaining in the Birthday Year and (ii)�365 days. In other words, the increase to the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount during the Birthday Year
you lock in guaranteed withdrawals will be reduced proportionately for the partial year remaining after the purchase payment is made. This adjustment in the initial Birthday Year will not reduce the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount in future
Birthday Years. 


�
�
 If the purchase payment is made after an Excess Withdrawal has occurred in any Birthday Year, then the increase will not apply until the next Birthday Year. In other words,
once an Excess Withdrawal has occurred in a Birthday Year, all additional withdrawals in that Birthday Year will be Excess Withdrawals, even if additional purchase payments are made.  Your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount may also increase for Step-Ups (described below under �Step-Up � Increase of Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal
Amount�). If you wish to elect the optional Prudential IncomeFlex spousal benefit, then the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount availability (minimum age of 55), initial amount, and increases due to subsequent purchase payments (4% or 5%), will
all be based on the age of the younger of you and your spouse.  � PART II

Prudential IncomeFlex Spousal Benefit  With the optional Prudential IncomeFlex spousal benefit, the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount
continues to be available until the later death of you and your spouse. You make an irrevocable choice whether or not to elect the spousal benefit at the Lock-In Date. The spousal benefit extends only to the person you are legally married to on the
Lock-In Date. Before you can make this election, you must provide us with due proof of marriage and your spouse�s date of birth in a form acceptable to us. You may not add or remove the spousal benefit after the Lock-In Date.  Both you and your spouse must attain age 55 to lock in your guaranteed withdrawals with the spousal benefit. The age of the younger spouse is used to determine the
amount of the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount. Therefore, the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount will equal 5% of the Protected Income Base if the younger spouse has attained age 65, or 4% of the Protected Income Base if the younger spouse is
under age 65.  There is an additional charge for the spousal benefit. This additional charge begins on the Lock-In Date and continues until the last
to die of you and your spouse.  The spousal benefit requires the same person to be both your spouse and sole Beneficiary of this contract and the IRA
it funds when you elect the benefit and when you die. Once elected, the spousal benefit may not be �transferred� to a new spouse due to divorce, your spouse�s death or any other reason. The spousal benefit is irrevocable and once
elected the additional charge will continue to apply until your contract ends.  � PART

If, prior to purchasing this contract,
a Participant dies after signing up for the Retirement Plan Prudential IncomeFlex benefit and before the Retirement Plan
Lock-In Date, then his or her surviving spouse may continue the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit to the extent permitted by the Retirement Plan and the Code. The surviving spouse may rollover assets invested in Eligible Investments to this contract to
the same extent as the Participant, and will receive the same transfer of Prudential IncomeFlex guarantees that would have been available to the Participant, including the adjusted Highest Birthday and Roll-Up Values.  Continuation of the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit under this contract is subject to the following conditions: 


�
�
 The Participant�s Birthday will be used to determine: 


�
�
�
 the Roll-Up and Highest Birthday Values under this contract; 


�
�
�
 the Birthday Year for Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amounts; 


�
�
�
 the availability and amount of Step-Ups. 


�
�
 At the Lock-In Date, the age of the surviving spouse will be used to determine the availability and amount of the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount, as well as increases
due to subsequent purchase payments. 


�
�
 The charge for the base Prudential IncomeFlex benefit will apply until the Lock-In Date. After the Lock-In Date, the additional charge for the spousal benefit will apply
until the contract ends. 


�
�
 If the surviving spouse remarries, he or she may not extend the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount for the life of a new spouse.  � 
Withdrawals with the Prudential IncomeFlex Benefit  The Prudential IncomeFlex benefit guarantees your ability to withdraw from the
contract an amount equal to the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount each Birthday Year for your lifetime.  The Prudential IncomeFlex benefit does not
affect your ability to make withdrawals under your contract or limit your ability to request withdrawals that exceed the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount. You are not required to withdraw all or any portion of the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal
Amount in any Birthday Year.  If, cumulatively, you withdraw an amount less than the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount in any Birthday Year, the
unused portion will expire and will not carry-over to subsequent Birthday Years. If your cumulative withdrawals in a Birthday Year are less than or equal to the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount, then the withdrawals will not reduce your Annual
Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount in subsequent Birthday Years.  Cumulative withdrawals in a Birthday Year that are in excess of the Annual Guaranteed
Withdrawal  � PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10

Amount are considered Excess Withdrawals. If you make Excess Withdrawals, then your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount in subsequent years will be reduced
proportionately (except with regard to certain required minimum distributions described below under �Excess Withdrawals � Required Minimum Distributions�). This means your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount will be reduced by a
percentage determined by the ratio of: (a)�the amount of the Excess Withdrawal, to (b)�the contract value immediately prior to such withdrawal (see examples of this calculation below). We will determine whether you have made an Excess
Withdrawal at the time of each withdrawal. Therefore, a subsequent increase in the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount will not offset the effect of an earlier Excess Withdrawal.  � Examples � Impact of Withdrawals on Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount  The examples below assume the following (the values set forth are purely hypothetical and do not reflect charges):  �

Excess Withdrawals � Required Minimum Distributions  You may be required to withdraw more than your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal
Amount to satisfy required minimum distribution requirements under the Code (�RMD Requirements�). These withdrawals will not be treated as Excess Withdrawals, subject to the requirements that follow. As of the last business day in each
calendar year (each the �RMD Calculation Date�), we will determine the amount you would need to take  � PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10

� 
as a withdrawal to comply with the RMD Requirements during the next calendar year (each the �RMD Payment Year�). This determination is based solely on the
sum of the contract value and the actuarial value of our guarantees under the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit on the RMD Calculation Date.  If the
required minimum distribution (RMD) amount determined using these assumptions exceeds the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount on the RMD Calculation Date, then the difference between such RMD amount and the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount shall
be the �RMD Value�. Withdrawals taken in the RMD Payment Year shall be treated as Excess Withdrawals only to the extent they exceed the RMD Value. Any RMD Value remaining at the end of each RMD Payment Year shall expire and not increase
the RMD Value in any subsequent RMD Payment Year.  � Example � Treatment of

5:  What Is The Prudential
IncomeFlexSM Benefit? continued  �
The Step-Up Value is determined annually and equals 5% of your contract value on the last business day immediately before the Participant�s Birthday (4% of
contract value if you did not attain age 65 on your Lock-In Date, or, if you elected the spousal benefit, either you and your spouse were not age 65 on your Lock-In Date). If the Step-Up Value is greater than your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal
Amount, then you are eligible to increase your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount to equal the Step-Up Value.  With each Step-Up, we increase the
Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount to be equal to the Step-Up Value. Any increase will be added to your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount on the day the Step-Up is effective.  The Step-Up will occur automatically unless the charge for the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit has increased.  If we have increased the charges for the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit, then you must choose whether or not to accept the Step-Up. If you do, then the current
higher charges will apply to your entire contract value following a Step-Up.  If accepting the Step-Up will increase your Prudential IncomeFlex
charges, then we will provide you with 90 days notice that you are eligible for the Step-Up and that the Step-Up will increase your charges. Unless you notify us in writing by the end of the 90 day period that you reject the Step-Up, the Step-Up and
resulting increase in charges will be considered accepted. Any such increase in Prudential IncomeFlex charges would be subject to the maximum charge limit set forth in the Summary of Contract Expenses.  � Example � Step Up Calculation  �

Benefits Under IncomeFlex 


�
�
 If your contract value equals zero and your Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount is greater than zero, we will pay you the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount in monthly
withdrawal payments, unless you request another payment frequency. 


�
�
 When the contract value equals zero, we will no longer accept purchase payments under the contract.  � Other Important Considerations 


�
�
 Withdrawals under Prudential IncomeFlex are subject to all of the terms and conditions of the contract. 


�
�
 Withdrawals made while Prudential IncomeFlex is in effect will be treated, for tax purposes, in the same way as any other withdrawals under the contract. Prudential
IncomeFlex does not directly affect the contract value or surrender value, but any withdrawal will decrease the contract value by the amount of the withdrawal. If you surrender your contract, you will receive the current contract value, not the
Protected Income Base or Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount.  � 
Termination of IncomeFlex and Waiting Period  You may terminate the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit by surrendering your contract. If you
terminate the  � PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10 
34 


� 
Prudential IncomeFlex benefit, any guarantee provided by the benefit will end as of the date the termination is effective.  Prudential IncomeFlex terminates: 


�
�
 upon your surrender of the contract, 


�
�
 upon your death (or the death of you and your spouse, if the spousal benefit was elected), 


�
�
 upon a change in ownership of the contract that changes the tax identification number of the contract owner other than in connection with a Prudential IncomeFlex spousal
benefit, or 


�
�
 upon your election to begin receiving annuity payments.  We cease imposing the charge for Prudential IncomeFlex upon the effective date of the benefit termination for the events described above.  While you may terminate IncomeFlex at any time, we may not terminate the benefit other than in the circumstances listed above. However, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may stop offering the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit by refusing new purchase payments, or we may increase related charges for new purchase payments and Step-Up transactions at any time in the future.  Currently, if you terminate the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit, you will only be permitted to re-elect the benefit in another of our
contracts after 90 calendar days
from the date the benefit was last terminated.  � Additional Tax Considerations for
Qualified Contracts/Arrangements  You have purchased the contract as an investment vehicle to be held by a custodial traditional individual retirement account
(IRA). Required minimum distribution rules under the Code require that you begin receiving periodic amounts from your IRA beginning after age 70 1/2. The amount required under the Code may exceed the Annual Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount. See
�Excess Withdrawals � Required Minimum Distributions�, earlier in this section.  � PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10

6:  How Can I Purchase The Prudential Retirement  Security
Annuity?  � 

PURCHASE PAYMENTS  The initial purchase payment is the amount of money you give us to purchase the contract. Unless we agree otherwise
and subject to our rules, the minimum initial purchase payment is $20,000. You must get our prior approval for any initial and additional purchase payment of $1 million or more, unless we are prohibited under applicable state law from insisting on
such prior approval. To the extent permitted by law, we reserve the right to cease accepting new purchase payments under the contract at any time. With some restrictions, you can make additional purchase payments of no less than $50 at any time
during the accumulation phase. Currently, we waive this minimum purchase payment requirement, but may impose it at any time in the future.  Currently,
you must get a prior approval to make maximum aggregate purchase payments in excess of $2 million unless we are prohibited under applicable state law from insisting on such prior approval. We limit the maximum total purchase payments in any contract
year other than the first to $1 million absent our prior approval. Depending on applicable state law, other limits may apply. This contract is issued as a nonqualified annuity. In order for it to be used for an IRA, the contract must be issued to a
custodial account established as an IRA.  � 
ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PAYMENTS  When you purchase a contract, we will allocate your purchase payment among the variable options based on
the percentages you choose. The percentage of your allocation to a particular investment option can range in whole percentages from 0% to 100%.  When
you make an additional purchase payment, we will allocate it in the same way as your most recent purchase payment unless you tell us otherwise.  You
may change your allocation of future invested purchase payments at any time. Contact the Prudential Retirement Service Center for details.  We
generally will credit the initial purchase payment to your contract within two business days from the day on which we receive your payment in good order at the Prudential Retirement Service Center. If, however, your first payment is made without enough information for us to set up your contract, we may need to contact you to obtain the required information. If we are not able to obtain this information within five business days, we will within that
five business day period either return your purchase payment or obtain your consent to continue holding it until we receive the necessary information. We will generally credit each subsequent purchase payment as of the business day we receive it in
good order at the Prudential Retirement Service Center. Subsequent purchase payments received in good order after the close of the business day will be credited on the following business day.  At our discretion, we may give initial and subsequent purchase payments (as well as transfers) received in good order by certain broker/dealers prior to the close
of a business day the same treatment as they would have received had they been received at the same time at the Prudential Retirement Service Center. Any such arrangements would be governed by the terms and conditions of a written agreement between
us and the broker/dealer.  � 
CALCULATING CONTRACT VALUE  The value of your contract will go up or down depending on the investment performance of the variable
investment options you choose. To determine the value of your contract, we use a unit of measure called an accumulation unit. An accumulation unit works like a share of a mutual fund.  Every day we determine the value of an accumulation unit for each of the variable investment options. We do this by: 


1)
Adding up the total amount of money allocated to a specific investment option; 


2)
Subtracting from that amount insurance charges and any other applicable charges such as for taxes; and 


3)
Dividing this amount by the number of outstanding accumulation units.  When
you make a purchase payment to a variable investment option, we credit your contract with accumulation units of the sub-account or sub accounts for the investment options you choose. The number of  PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY
PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10  �
36 


� 
accumulation units credited to your contract is determined by dividing the amount of the purchase payment allocated to an investment option by the unit price of the
accumulation unit for that investment option. We calculate the unit price for each investment option after the New York Stock Exchange closes each day and then credit your contract. The value of the accumulation
units can increase, decrease, or remain the same from day to day.  We cannot guarantee that your contract value will increase or that it will not fall
below the amount of your total purchase payments.  � � PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY
PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10

7:  What Are The Expenses Associated With The Prudential  Retirement Security Annuity?  � 
There are charges and other expenses associated with the contract that reduce the return on your investment. These charges and expenses are described below.
 � The charges under the contracts are designed to cover, in the aggregate, our direct
and indirect costs of selling, administering and providing benefits under the contracts. They are also designed, in the aggregate, to compensate us for the risks of loss we assume pursuant to the contracts. If, as we expect, the charges that we
collect from the contracts exceed our total costs in connection with the contracts, we will earn a profit. Otherwise, we will incur a loss. The rates of certain of our charges have been set with reference to estimates of the amount of specific types
of expenses or risks that we will incur. In most cases, this prospectus identifies such expenses or risks in the name of the charge; however, the fact that any charge bears the name of, or is designed primarily to defray a particular expense or risk
does not mean that the amount we collect from that charge will never be more than the amount of such expense or risk. Nor does it mean that we may not also be compensated for such expense or risk out of any other charges we are permitted to deduct
by the terms of the contract.  � 
INSURANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGES  Each day we make a deduction for the insurance and administrative charges. These charges cover our
expenses for mortality and expense risk, administration, marketing and distribution. The mortality risk portion of the charge is for assuming the risk that the annuitant(s) will live longer than expected based on our life expectancy tables. When
this happens, we pay a greater number of annuity payments. The expense risk portion of the charge is for assuming the risk that the current charges will be insufficient in the future to cover the cost of administering the contract. The
administrative expense portion of the charge compensates us for the expenses associated with the administration of the contract. This includes preparing and issuing the contract; establishing and maintaining
contract records; preparation of confirmations and annual reports; personnel costs; legal and accounting fees; filing fees; and systems costs.  The
current insurance and administrative charge equals, on an annual basis 0.50% of the daily value of the contract. We have the right to increase this charge up to 1.60%, but we have no current intention to do so. Any increase in this charge would
apply immediately to the daily value of the contract.  � 
PRUDENTIAL INCOMEFLEX CHARGES  In addition to the current insurance and administrative charge, each day we make a deduction for the
charges associated with the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit. We impose a current charge equal, on an annual basis, to 0.95% for the base Prudential IncomeFlex benefit. We have the right to increase this charge up to 1.45%, but we have no current
intention to do so. If you elect the optional Prudential IncomeFlex spousal benefit, then we impose a current charge equal, on an annual basis, to 1.45% (or 0.50% more than the base Prudential IncomeFlex benefit). We have the right to increase this
charge up to 2.05%, but we have no current intention to do so. Any increase in these charges would apply only to new purchase payments and Step-Up transactions after the effective date of the increase. The charge for the optional Prudential
IncomeFlex spousal benefit replaces the charge for the base Prudential IncomeFlex benefit (that is, both Prudential IncomeFlex charges do not apply).  If the charges under the contract are not sufficient to cover our expenses, then we will bear the loss. We do, however, expect to profit from these charges. Any profits made from these charges may be used by us to pay for the costs of
distributing the contracts.  � 
CONTRACT MAINTENANCE CHARGE  During the accumulation phase, we reserve the right to charge an annual contract fee for administrative
expenses. Currently, we waive this fee. Although this fee currently is waived, we may begin to impose and may change this fee up to a maximum of $150 per year, but  PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10  �
38 


� 
we have no current intention to do so. Also, we may establish and reserve the right to change a level of contract value at which we waive this fee. If we begin to
charge this fee, it will be assessed quarterly on the last business day of the quarter, and the charge will be deducted proportionately from each of the contract�s variable investment options.  � 
TAXES ATTRIBUTABLE TO PREMIUM  There may be federal, state and local premium based taxes applicable to your purchase payment. We are
responsible for the payment of these taxes and may make a deduction from the value of the contract to pay some or all of these taxes. It is our current practice not to deduct a charge for the federal tax associated with deferred acquisition costs
paid by us that are based on premium received. However, we reserve the right to charge the contract owner in the future for any such tax associated with deferred acquisition costs and any federal, state or local income, excise, business or any other
type of tax measured by the amount of premium received by us.  � 
TRANSFER FEE  You can make up to 12 free transfers every contract year. We measure a contract year from the date we issue your contract
(contract date). If you make more than 12 transfers in a contract year, we may deduct a transfer fee of up to a maximum of $30 per transfer. Currently, we waive this fee. If we begin to impose this fee, we will deduct the transfer fee pro-rata from
the investment options from which the transfer is made.  � 
COMPANY TAXES  We pay company income taxes on the taxable corporate earnings created by this separate account product. While we may
consider company income taxes when pricing our products, we do not currently include such income taxes in the tax charges you pay under the contract. We will periodically review the issue of charging for these
taxes and may impose a charge in the future.  In calculating our corporate income tax liability, we derive certain corporate income tax benefits
associated with the investment of company assets, including separate account assets, which are treated as company assets under applicable income tax law. These benefits reduce our overall corporate income tax liability. Under current law, such
benefits may include foreign tax credits and corporate dividend received deductions. We do not pass these tax benefits through to holders of the separate account annuity contracts because (i)�the contract owners are not the owners of the assets
generating these benefits under applicable income tax law and (ii)�we do not currently include company income taxes in the tax charges you pay under the contract. We reserve the right to change these tax practices.  � 
UNDERLYING MUTUAL FUND FEES  When you allocate a purchase payment or a transfer to the variable investment options, we in turn invest in
shares of a corresponding underlying mutual fund. Those funds charge fees that are in addition to the contract-related fees described in this section. For 2006, the fees of these funds ranged from 1.05% to 1.12% annually. For certain funds, expenses
are reduced pursuant to expense waivers and comparable arrangements. In general, these expense waivers and comparable arrangements are not guaranteed, and may be terminated at any time. For additional information about these fund fees, please
consult the prospectuses for the funds.  � PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10

8:  How Can I  Access My Money?  � You can access your money by: 


�
�
 Making a withdrawal (either partial or complete); or 


�
�
 Choosing to receive annuity payments during the annuity phase (annuitization). Please see Section�3, �What Kind Of Payments Will I Receive During The Annuity
Phase?�  � 
WITHDRAWALS DURING THE ACCUMULATION PHASE  When you make a full withdrawal, you will receive the value of your contract minus any
applicable fees. We will calculate the value of your contract and charges, if any, as of the date we receive your request in good order at the Prudential Retirement Service Center.  Unless you tell us otherwise, any partial withdrawal will be made proportionately from all of the variable investment options you have selected. The minimum amount
which may be withdrawn is $250. We currently waive this minimum. We may begin to impose this minimum at any time in the future. We will generally pay the withdrawal amount, less any required tax withholding, within seven days after we receive a
withdrawal request in good order.  Income taxes, tax penalties and certain restrictions also may apply to any withdrawal you make. For a more
complete explanation, see Section�9.  � 
AUTOMATED WITHDRAWALS  We offer an automated withdrawal feature. This feature enables you to receive periodic withdrawals in monthly,
quarterly, semiannual or annual intervals. We will process your withdrawals at the end of the business day at the intervals you specify. We will continue at these intervals until you tell us otherwise. You can make withdrawals from any designated
investment option or proportionally from all investment options. The minimum automated withdrawal amount you can make generally is $250. We currently waive this minimum. We may begin to impose this minimum at any time in the future.  Income taxes, tax penalties and certain restrictions may apply to automated withdrawals. For a more complete explanation, see Section�9.  � 
SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS OR TRANSFERS  The SEC may require us to suspend or postpone payments made in connection with withdrawals or
transfers for any period when: 


�
�
 The New York Stock Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); 


�
�
 Trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted; 


�
�
 An emergency exists, as determined by the SEC, during which sales and redemptions of shares of the underlying mutual funds are not feasible or we cannot reasonably value the
accumulation units; or

9:  What Are The Tax Considerations Associated With The Prudential  Retirement Security Annuity?  � 
This tax discussion is general in nature and describes only federal income tax law (not state or other tax laws). It is based on current law and interpretations, which
may change. The discussion includes a description of certain spousal rights under the contract and under tax-qualified plans. Our administration of such spousal rights and related tax reporting accords with our understanding of the Defense of
Marriage Act (which defines a �marriage� as a legal union between a man and a woman and a �spouse� as a person of the opposite sex). The information provided is not intended as tax advice. You should consult with a qualified tax
advisor for complete information and advice.  This contract will be purchased by a custodial IRA, which can hold other permissible assets other than
the annuity. This contract is currently not available for Roth IRA or other tax favored plans. The terms and administration of the trust or custodial account in accordance with the laws and regulations are the responsibility of the applicable
trustee or custodian.  � 
CONTRACTS HELD BY TAX FAVORED PLANS  The following discussion covers annuity contracts held under tax-favored retirement plans.
 Currently, the contract will be purchased for use in connection with individual retirement accounts, which are subject to Section�408 of the
Code. This contract is issued as a nonqualified annuity. In order for it to be used for an IRA, the contract must be issued to a custodial account established as an IRA. This description assumes that you have satisfied the requirements for
eligibility for these accounts.  You should be aware that tax favored plans such as IRAs generally provide tax deferral regardless whether they invest
in annuity contracts. This means that when a tax favored plan invests in an annuity contract, it generally does not result in any additional tax deferral benefits.  IRAs. When you buy this contract for use in an IRA, we will provide you a copy of the prospectus and contract. The �IRA Disclosure Statement,� delivered to you separately, contains information about
eligibility, contribution limits, tax particulars, and other IRA information. In addition to this information (some of which is summarized below), the IRS requires that you have a �free look� for seven
days following receipt of the disclosure statement. During this time, if the IRA is being established at the same time you purchase the contract, you can cancel the contract by notifying us in writing, and we will refund all of the purchase payments
under the contract (or, if provided by applicable state law, the amount your contract is worth, if greater) less any applicable federal and state income tax withholding. Otherwise, state law rules governing short-term cancellation rights may apply.
See Section�1, �What Is The Prudential Retirement Security Annuity?�  Contributions Limits/Rollovers. Because of the way the
contract is designed, you may only purchase a contract for an IRA in connection with a �rollover� of amounts from a qualified retirement plan (see cover page of prospectus). You must make a minimum initial payment of $20,000 to purchase a
contract. This minimum is greater than the maximum amount of any annual contribution allowed by law you may make to an IRA. For 2007, the limit is $4,000, increasing to $5,000 in 2008. After 2008, the contribution amount will be indexed for
inflation. The tax law also provides for a catch-up provision for individuals who are age 50 and above, allowing these individuals an additional $1,000 contribution each year.  The �rollover� rules under the Code are fairly technical; however, an individual (or his or her surviving spouse) may generally �roll over�
certain distributions from tax favored retirement plans (either directly or within 60 days from the date of these distributions) if he or she meets the requirements for distribution. Once you buy the contract, you can make regular IRA contributions
under the contract (to the extent permitted by law and the contract). However, if you make such regular IRA contributions, you should note that you will not be able to treat the contract as a �conduit IRA,� which means that you will not
retain possible favorable tax treatment if you subsequently �roll over� the contract funds originally derived from a qualified retirement plan into another Section�401(a) plan. Beginning in 2007, non-spouse beneficiaries can also roll
over distributions from a tax favored retirement plan into an inherited IRA. Currently this contract is not available to fund inherited IRAs.  PART II

9:  What Are The Tax Considerations Associated
With The Prudential Retirement Security Annuity? continued  � 
Usually, the full amount of any distribution from an IRA (including a distribution from this contract) which is not a rollover is taxable. As taxable income, these
distributions are subject to the general tax withholding rules described earlier. In addition to this normal tax liability, you may also be liable for the following, depending on your actions: 


�
�
 A 10% �early distribution penalty�; 


�
�
 Liability for �prohibited transactions� if you, for example, borrow against the value of an IRA; or 


�
�
 Failure to take a minimum distribution.  � Required Minimum Distribution Provisions and Payment Option  When you hold the contract under an IRA (or other tax-favored plan), IRS required minimum distribution provisions must be
satisfied. This means that generally payments must start by April�1 of the year after the year you reach age 70�1/2
and must be made for each year thereafter. The amount of the payment from the IRA must at least equal the minimum required under the IRS rules. Several choices are available for calculating the minimum amount. More information on the mechanics of
this calculation is available on request. Please contact us a reasonable time before the IRS deadline so that a timely distribution is made. Please note that there is a 50% tax penalty on the amount of any minimum distribution not made in a timely
manner.  To determine the amount of any required minimum distributions the value of the contract will be calculated based on the sum of the
contract value and the actuarial value of any additional death benefits and benefits under the contract. As a result, if amounts are distributed from the contract to satisfy the required minimum distributions rules, the amount distributed may be
larger than if the calculation were based on the contract value only, which may in turn result in an earlier (but not before the required beginning date) distribution of amounts under the contract and an increased amount of taxable income
distributed to the contract owner, and a reduction of death benefits and the benefits of any optional riders.  You can use the minimum distribution
option to satisfy the IRS required minimum distribution rules for this contract without either beginning annuity payments or surrendering the contract. We will distribute to you this required minimum distribution
amount, less any other partial withdrawals that you made during the year. Although the IRS rules determine the required amount to be distributed from your IRA each year, certain payment alternatives are still available to you. If you own more than
one IRA, you can choose to satisfy your minimum distribution requirement for each of your IRAs by withdrawing that amount from any of your IRAs. Similarly, if the IRA that includes the contract has other investments, you can choose to satisfy your
minimum distribution requirement from those investments.  � Penalty for Early
Withdrawals  You may owe a 10% tax penalty on the taxable part of distributions received from an IRA before
you attain age 59�1/2.  Amounts are not subject to this tax penalty if: 


 �
�
 the amount is paid on or after you reach age 59�1/2 or die; 


�
�
 the amount received is attributable to your becoming disabled; or 


 �
�
 the amount paid or received is in the form of substantially equal payments not less frequently than annually (please note that
substantially equal payments must continue until the later of reaching age 59�1/2 or 5 years. Modification of payments
during that time period will generally result in retroactive application of the 10% tax penalty.).  Other exceptions to this
tax may apply. You should consult your tax advisor for further details.  � Withholding
 Unless you elect otherwise, we will withhold federal income tax from the taxable portion of such distribution at an appropriate percentage. The rate of
withholding on annuity payments where no mandatory withholding is required is determined on the basis of the withholding certificate that you file with us. If you do not file a certificate, we will automatically withhold federal taxes on the
following basis: 


�

 For any annuity payments not subject to mandatory withholding, you will have taxes withheld by us as if you are a married individual, with three exemptions; and

�


�
�
 For all other distributions, we will withhold at a 10% rate.  State income tax withholding rules vary and we will withhold based on the rules of your State of residence. Special tax rules apply to withholding for nonresident aliens, and we generally withhold income tax for nonresident aliens at a 30%
rate. A different withholding rate may be applicable to a nonresident alien based on the terms of an existing income tax treaty between the United States and the nonresident alien�s country.  We will provide you with forms and instructions concerning the right to elect that no amount be withheld from payments in the ordinary course. However, you should
know that, in any event, you are liable for payment of federal income taxes on the taxable portion of the distributions, and you should consult with your tax advisor to find out more information on your potential liability if you fail to pay such
taxes.  � ERISA Disclosure/Requirements  ERISA (the �Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974�) and the Code prevent a fiduciary and other �parties in
interest� with respect to a plan (and, for these purposes, an IRA would also constitute a �plan�) from receiving any benefit from any party dealing with the plan, as a result of the sale of the contract. Administrative exemptions
under ERISA generally permit the sale of insurance/annuity products to plans, provided that certain information is disclosed to the person purchasing the contract. This information has to do primarily with the fees, charges, discounts and other
costs related to the contract, as well as any commissions paid to any agent selling the contract.  Information about any applicable fees, charges,
discounts, penalties or adjustments may be found under Section�7, �What Are The Expenses Associated With The Prudential Retirement Security Annuity Contract?�  Information about sales of the contract may be found under �Other Information� in Section�10.  In addition, other relevant information required by the exemptions is contained in the contract and accompanying documentation. Please consult your tax advisor if
you have any additional questions.  � � � PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10

10:  Other  Information  � 

PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT INSURANCE AND ANNUITY COMPANY (PRIAC)  PRIAC is a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of
Connecticut in 1981. PRIAC�s principal business address is 280 Trumbull Street, Hartford, CT, 06103. It is authorized to do business in the District of Columbia and all states. The Company issues group and individual annuities and other
insurance contracts. The Company was formerly a subsidiary of Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, which is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CIGNA Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On April�4, 2004, the Company was acquired
by The Prudential Insurance Company of America, a New Jersey corporation (�Prudential Insurance�). The Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, which in turn is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential
Financial, Inc., Newark, New Jersey, an insurance holding company. As PRIAC�s ultimate parent, Prudential Financial exercises significant influence over the operations and capital structure of PRIAC and Prudential Insurance. However, neither
Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance, nor any other related company has any legal responsibility to pay amounts that PRIAC may owe under the contract.  � 
THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT  We have established a separate account, the PRIAC Variable Contract Account A (separate account), to hold the
assets that are associated with the variable annuity contracts. The separate account was established under Connecticut law on October�6, 2006, and is registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as a unit investment trust,
which is a type of investment company.  The assets of the separate account are held in the name of PRIAC and legally belong to us. Income, gains, and
losses, whether or not realized, for assets allocated to the separate account, are, in accordance with the applicable contracts, credited to or charged against the separate account without regard to other income, gains, or losses of PRIAC. Assets of
the separate account may not be charged with liabilities arising out of any other business of PRIAC. However, all obligations under the contract are PRIAC�s general corporate obligations. More detailed
information about PRIAC, including its audited financial statements, is provided in the Statement of Additional Information.  � 
SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE CONTRACT  Prudential Investment Management Services LLC (PIMS), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential
Financial, Inc., is the distributor and principal underwriter of the securities offered through this prospectus. PIMS acts as the distributor of a number of annuity contracts and life insurance products we and our affiliates offer.  PIMS�s principal business address is Three Gateway Center, 14th Floor, 100 Mulberry Street, Newark, New Jersey 07102. PIMS is registered as a broker/dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and is a member of
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD).  The contract is offered on a continuous basis. PIMS may enter distribution agreements
with broker/dealers who are registered under the Exchange Act and with entities that may offer the contract but are exempt from registration (firms). Applications for the contract may be solicited by registered representatives of those firms. Such
representatives will also be our appointed insurance agents under state insurance law. In addition, PIMS may offer the contract directly to potential purchasers.  Commissions may be paid to firms on sales of the contract according to one or more schedules. The individual representative would receive a portion of the compensation, depending on the practice of his or her firm. Currently,
we do not intend to pay commissions in connection with sales of the contract, but may do so in the future. Any commission would be generally based on a percentage of purchase payments, up to a maximum of 8%.  We may also provide compensation to the distributing firm for providing ongoing service to you in relation to the contract. Commissions and other compensation paid
in relation to the contract do not result in any additional charge to you or to the separate account.  PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10  �
44 


� 
In addition, in an effort to promote the sale of our products (which may include the placement of PRIAC and/or the contract on a preferred or recommended company or
product list and/or access to the firm�s registered representatives), we or PIMS may enter into compensation arrangements with certain broker/dealer firms with respect to certain or all registered representatives of such firms under which such
firms may receive separate compensation or reimbursement for, among other things, training of sales personnel and/or marketing and/or administrative services and/or other services they provide to us or our affiliates. These services may include, but
are not limited to: educating customers of the firm on the contract�s features; conducting due diligence and analysis; providing office access, operations and systems support; holding seminars intended to educate registered representatives and
make them more knowledgeable about the contract; providing a dedicated marketing coordinator; providing priority sales desk support; and providing expedited marketing compliance approval to PIMS. A list of firms that PIMS paid pursuant to such
arrangements, if any, is provided in the Statement of Additional Information which is available upon request.  To the extent permitted by NASD rules
and other applicable laws and regulations, PIMS may pay or allow other promotional incentives or payments in the form of cash or non-cash compensation. These arrangements may not be offered to all firms and the terms of such arrangements may differ
between firms.  You should note that firms and individual registered representatives and branch managers within some firms participating in one of
these compensation arrangements might receive greater compensation for selling the contract than for selling a different contract that is not eligible for these compensation arrangements. While compensation is generally taken into account as an
expense in considering the charges applicable to a contract product, any such compensation will be paid by us or PIMS and will not result in any additional charge to you. Overall compensation paid to the distributing firm does not exceed, based on
actuarial assumptions, 8% of the total purchase payments made. Your registered representative can provide you with more information about the compensation arrangements that apply upon the sale of the contract.
 � 
LITIGATION  PRIAC may be subject to various pending or threatened legal or regulatory proceedings arising from the conduct of its
business. Most of these matters are routine and in the ordinary course of business. Litigation and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given the complexity and scope, the outcomes cannot be predicted. It is possible that the
results of operations or the cash flow of PRIAC in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of a litigation or regulatory matter. Management believes, however, that the ultimate
outcome of all pending or threatened litigation or regulatory matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, should not have a material adverse effect on PRIAC�s financial position.  � 
ASSIGNMENT  This contract must be used to fund an individual retirement account, and therefore you generally may not assign the contract
during your lifetime.  � 
MISSTATEMENT OF AGE OR SEX � ANNUITY PAYMENTS  If there has been a misstatement of the age and/or sex of any person upon whose life
annuity payments are based, then we will make adjustments to conform to the facts. As to annuity payments: (a)�any underpayments by us will be remedied on the next payment following correction; and (b)�any overpayments by us will be
charged against future amounts payable by us under your annuity.  � 
MISSTATEMENTS AND CORRECTIONS AFFECTING THE PRUDENTIAL INCOMEFLEX BENEFIT  If we discover that your age, your spouse�s age or any
other fact pertaining to our guarantees under the Prudential IncomeFlex benefit was misstated, or we discover a clerical error, then we will make adjustments to any fees, guarantees or other values under this annuity to reasonably conform to the
facts following our established procedures, which shall be applied on a uniform basis.  � PART II  PRUDENTIAL RETIREMENT SECURITY ANNUITY PROSPECTUS����SECTIONS 1�10

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Public Reference Branch of the Commission, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, (202) 551-8090. 
Applicants' Representations 
1. PRIAC is a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of Connecticut. PRIAC is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial, Inc. 
2. The PRIAC Account was established by PRIAC as a separate account under Connecticut law and is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust for the purpose of funding certain variable annuity contracts issued by PRIAC (the “Contracts”). Security interests under the Contracts have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”). The PRIAC Account currently has five subaccounts, each of which invests exclusively in a single corresponding portfolio of the Advanced Series Trust (“AST”). AST is a Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end management investment company with multiple separate series or portfolios. Shares of the AST portfolios are sold to insurance company separate accounts, including Start Printed Page 27866the PRIAC Account, and are registered under the 1933 Act. AST is advised by Prudential Investments LLC and AST Investment Services, Inc., both of which are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Prudential Financial, Inc. 
3. PIMS is registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. PIMS is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial, Inc. PIMS serves as the distributor and principal underwriter of the Contracts. PIMS also serves as distributor and principal underwriter for the registered open-end management investment companies advised by Prudential Investments LLC and/or AST Investment Services, Inc. (any such current or future investment company advised by Prudential LLC, AST Investment Services, Inc. or an affiliate, or series thereof, hereinafter referred to as a “Prudential Mutual Fund” and collectively, the “Prudential Mutual Funds”). 
4. Applicants and their affiliates propose to offer certain retirement programs, each of which is designed to provide participants (“Participants”) in a single coordinated program a selection of investment options, including both Contracts and mutual fund options, and the ability to periodically transfer their account values among the investment options without charge (each a “Program” and collectively, the “Programs”). The Programs are designed to serve the retirement income needs of Participants by combining the benefits of direct investments in mutual funds with the insurance benefits available through variable annuity contracts, including benefits designed to provide guaranteed withdrawal benefits for the life of the Participant and/or his or her spouse. Applicants have designed two Programs, which are described below, and Applicants may in the future design additional similar Programs. 
5. The first Program (the “IRA Program”) is an individual retirement account (“IRA”) that qualifies for federal tax benefits under Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The IRA will be funded by a rollover transaction from certain employment based retirement plans or arrangements administered by PRIAC or its affiliates or from certain group annuity contracts issued by PRIAC. 
6. Participants in the IRA Program may allocate their investments to a Contract and/or to certain Prudential Mutual Funds.[1] 

7. The Contract permits Contract owners to allocate Contract value to and among four subaccounts of the PRIAC Account (each, a “Subaccount” and collectively, the “Subaccounts”). Each current Subaccount invests in an AST asset allocation portfolio. The Contract permits transfers of Contract value among the Subaccounts subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Contract prospectus. The Contract offers a guaranteed withdrawal benefit which guarantees certain minimum withdrawal amounts for the life of the Participant and/or his or her spouse subject to certain conditions (the “Guaranteed Withdrawal Benefit”). 
8. PIMS currently makes available to the IRA Program shares of the following 16 Prudential Mutual Funds: Jennison 20/20 Focus Fund; Dryden Government Income Fund, Inc.; Dryden Index Series Fund; Jennison Small Company Fund, Inc.; The Prudential Investment Portfolios, Inc. (Jennison Growth Fund); Jennison Mid-Cap Growth Fund, Inc.; JennisonDryden Portfolios (Jennison Value Fund); The Target Portfolio Trust (Large Capitalization Growth, Small Capitalization Growth; International Equity; Total Return Bond, Large Capitalization Value, Small Capitalization Value); Jennison Natural Resources Fund, Inc.; Jennison Sector Funds, Inc. (Jennison Utility Fund); Dryden High Yield Fund, Inc.; and MoneyMart Assets, Inc. 
9. PIMS may make available shares of additional Prudential Mutual Funds in the future. Any class of shares of a Prudential Mutual Fund made available in the IRA Program are not subject to any sales charges on purchases or any sales charges or other withdrawal charges on redemption. No fee or charge applies to any exchange from one Prudential Mutual Fund to another Prudential Mutual Fund within the IRA Program. The Prudential Mutual Funds permit exchanges between multiple funds subject to certain conditions set forth in the prospectuses for the Prudential Mutual Funds. Therefore, Participants are permitted to transfer from one Prudential Mutual Fund to another Prudential Mutual Fund subject to the conditions set forth in the prospectuses. 
10. Participants in the IRA Program are charged an overall asset-based account fee for the IRA account and also bear the expenses of the investment options available under the IRA Program. The IRA account fee varies by account size and ranges from an annual rate of 0.25% to 1.10% of assets in the IRA Program, subject to a minimum annual fee of $100 and a maximum annual fee of $500. The Contract does not impose any sales charges on investments in the Contract or any sales charges or other withdrawal charges on withdrawals from or surrenders of the Contract. PRIAC reserves the right to charge a maximum transfer fee of $30 per transfer after the twelfth transfer among investment options in the Contract in any one Contract year, but it currently does not impose any transfer fee. PRIAC may also deduct the charge for premium taxes imposed on PRIAC by certain states or jurisdictions, which currently range from 0% to 3.5% of Contract value. No premium tax deduction will be applied to any exchange between a Subaccount and a Prudential Mutual Fund under the IRA Program. The Contract provides for the following periodic expenses. PRIAC reserves the right to charge an annual Contract fee of up to $150, but currently does not assess this charge. PRIAC assesses the following charges, expressed as an annual percentage of Contract value: insurance and administrative charge (maximum charge of 1.60% and current charge of 0.50%); base Guaranteed Withdrawal Benefit charge (maximum charge of 1.45% and current charge of 0.95%); and optional spousal Guaranteed Withdrawal Benefit charge (maximum charge of 0.60% and current charge of 0.50%). Investments in the Contract also bear indirectly the fees and expenses of the underlying AST portfolios. Investments in the shares of Prudential Mutual Funds available under the IRA Program are not subject to any sales charges on purchases or any sales charges or other withdrawal charges on redemption. No fee or charge applies to any exchange from one Prudential Mutual Fund to another Prudential Mutual Fund under the IRA Program. Investments in the Prudential Mutual Funds are subject to ongoing fees and expenses. 
11. The second Program (the “Retirement Plan Program”) is designed for ongoing retirement arrangements that qualify for federal tax benefits under Section 401(a), 403 or 457 of the Code and certain non-qualified arrangements. The Retirement Plan Program permits Participants to allocate Start Printed Page 27867program investments to a Contract and/or to certain Prudential Mutual Funds.[2] 

12. The Contract used in the Retirement Plan Program is substantially identical to the Contract used in the IRA Program, with minor changes needed to reflect the existence of an employment based retirement plan and plan sponsor and related provisions required by tax law. 
13. PIMS currently makes available to the Retirement Plan Program shares of the following Prudential Mutual Funds: Dryden Total Return Bond Fund, Inc.; Jennison 20/20 Focus Fund; Dryden California Municipal Fund (California Income Series); Dryden Government Income Fund, Inc.; Cash Accumulation Trust (Liquid Assets Fund); Dryden Index Series Fund; Dryden Global Real Estate Fund; Jennison Small Company Fund, Inc.; Prudential Institutional Liquidity Portfolio, Inc. (Institutional Money Market Series); The Prudential Investment Portfolios, Inc. (Dryden Active Allocation Fund, Jennison Growth Fund, Jennison Equity Opportunity Fund, JennisonDryden Conservative Allocation Fund, JennisonDryden Moderate Allocation Fund, JennisonDryden Growth Allocation Fund); Dryden Municipal Bond Fund (Insured Series, High Income Series); Dryden Tax-Managed Funds (Dryden Large-Cap Core Equity Fund); Dryden Small-Cap Core Equity Fund, Inc.; Jennison Mid-Cap Growth Fund, Inc.; JennisonDryden Portfolios (Jennison Value Fund, Dryden U.S. Equity Active Extension Fund); Prudential World Fund, Inc. (Jennison Global Growth Fund, Dryden International Equity Fund, Dryden International Value Fund); The Target Portfolio Trust (Large Capitalization Growth, Small Capitalization Growth; International Equity; Total Return Bond, Mortgage Backed Securities, Large Capitalization Value, Small Capitalization Value, International Bond, Intermediate-Term Bond, U.S. Government Money Market); Target Asset Allocation Funds (Target Conservative Allocation Fund, Target Moderate Allocation Fund, Target Growth Allocation Fund); Strategic Partners Style Specific Funds (Jennison Conservative Growth Fund, Dryden Small Capitalization Value Fund); Strategic Partners Opportunity Funds (Jennison Select Growth, Dryden Strategic Value Fund); Strategic Partners Mutual Funds, Inc. (Dryden Mid-Cap Value Fund, Jennison Equity Income Fund, Dryden Money Market Fund); Dryden Government Securities Trust (Money Market Series); Jennison Blend Fund, Inc.; Jennison Natural Resources Fund, Inc.; Jennison Sector Funds, Inc. (Jennison Financial Services Fund, Jennison Health Sciences Fund, Jennison Utility Fund); Nicholas-Applegate Fund, Inc.; Dryden Global Total Return Fund, Inc.; Dryden High Yield Fund, Inc.; MoneyMart Assets, Inc.; Prudential Tax-Free Money Fund, Inc. (Dryden Tax-Free Money Fund); Dryden National Municipals Fund, Inc.; and Dryden Short-Term Bond Fund, Inc. 
14. PIMS may make available shares of additional Prudential Mutual Funds in the future. Any class of shares of a Prudential Mutual Fund made available in the Retirement Plan Program are not subject to any sales charges on purchases or any sales charges or other withdrawal charges on redemption. No fee or charge applies to any exchange from one Prudential Mutual Fund to another Prudential Mutual Fund. Investments in the Prudential Mutual Funds are subject to ongoing fees and expenses. 
15. Unlike the IRA Program, there is no set account fee under the Retirement Plan Program. Instead, each plan sponsor negotiates an administrative services agreement with PRIAC or an affiliate under which PRIAC or the affiliate provides recordkeeping and other services to the Plan. Although the terms of these administrative services agreements vary from plan to plan, in all cases no transaction fees are charged for exchanges from one investment option to another investment option under the Program. 
16. The Programs are designed to provide flexibility to transfer value among the investment options available under the Program. Applicants state that under existing procedures and Rules 11a-2 and 11a-3 under the 1940 Act, exchanges may be made among the Variable Annuity Subaccounts and exchanges may be made among the Prudential Mutual Funds. 
17. Applicants propose to add an additional exchange feature under the Programs. In particular, Applicants propose that Participants be permitted to transfer value: (1) From a Separate Account to a Prudential Mutual Fund; and (2) from a Prudential Mutual Fund to a Separate Account. Applicants seek a Commission Order under Section 11 of the 1940 Act to permit this additional exchange feature. 
18. Applicants represent that the exchange feature under any Program will meet the following conditions: 
(a) No sales charge or other charge will be assessed in connection with a withdrawal from a Separate Account to be transferred to a Prudential Mutual Fund; 
(b) No sales charge or other charge will be assessed in connection with an allocation to a Separate Account from a transfer from a Prudential Mutual Fund; 
(c) The Distributor will offer in the Program only classes of Prudential Mutual Funds that do not charge any sales or other charges on purchases or redemption; 
(d) The exchange will not be a taxable event or have adverse tax consequences for the Participant; and 
(e) the Separate Account prospectus will disclose the terms of the exchange feature, including (i) the fact that Applicants reserve the right to terminate or modify the Program upon notice, (ii) any limitations on exchanges, and (iii) the effect of an exchange on any Contract benefits, including the Guaranteed Withdrawal Benefit. 
19. Applicants state that exchanges will be subject to any rules or procedures established under the Contract or established by the Prudential Mutual Funds with respect to transfers and redemptions generally, including minimum transfer amounts and policies and procedures relating to frequent transfers and abusive trading practices. Applicants also reserve the right to implement exchange limitations for the Programs generally. No fees or charges will be assessed in connection with any exchange from a Separate Account to a Prudential Mutual Fund or from a Prudential Mutual Fund to a Separate Account. 
20. Applicants intend to make this exchange feature available on an ongoing basis to all Participants, but reserve the right to terminate the offer with respect to all or any of the investment options with advance notice to affected Participants. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. Section 11(a) of the 1940 Act provides, in pertinent part, that “[i]t shall be unlawful for any registered open-end company or any principal underwriter for such a company to make or cause to be made an offer to the holder of a security of such company or of any other open-end investment company to exchange his security for a security in the same or another such company on any basis other than the relative net asset values of the respective securities to be exchanged, unless the terms of the offer have first Start Printed Page 27868been submitted to and approved by the Commission or are in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Commission may have prescribed in respect of such offers which are in effect at the time such offer is made.” Section 11(c) provides that, irrespective of the basis of exchange, subsection (a) shall be applicable to any offer of exchange of any security of a registered open-end company for a security of a registered unit investment trust, or to any offer of exchange of any security of a registered unit investment trust for the securities of any other investment company. Although all the proposed exchanges would be at net asset value, the involvement of any registered unit investment trust (such as a Separate Account) requires a prior order of approval of the Commission. 
2. The legislative history of Section 11 indicates that the purpose of the provision is to provide the Commission with an opportunity to review the terms of certain offers of exchange to ensure that a proposed offer is not being made “solely for the purpose of exacting additional selling charges.” H. Rep. No. 2639, 76th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1940). One of the practices Congress sought to prevent through Section 11 was the practice of inducing investors to switch securities so that the promoter could charge investors another sales load. Applicants assert that the proposed offers of exchange involve no possibility of such abuse. 
3. Applicants assert that, because the proposed exchange offers for which approval is sought will be based on the relative net asset values or unit values of the interests being exchanged, there is no possibility of the abuse to which Section 11 was directed. Nevertheless, because each of the proposed exchange offers involves a unit investment trust, Section 11(c) makes Section 11(a) inapplicable irrespective of the basis of the exchange. Applicants state that exemptive relief is necessary for Applicants to offer the proposed exchange feature. 
4. Applicants note that previous applications under Section 11(a) and orders granting those applications appropriately have focused on sales loads or sales load differentials and administrative fees to be imposed for effecting a proposed exchange. Rule 11a-2, adopted under Section 11 of the 1940 Act, provides blanket Commission approval of certain types of offers of exchange of one variable annuity contract for another, or of one variable life insurance contract for another. Applicants state that adoption of Rule 11a-3 represents the most recent Commission action under Section 11 of the 1940 Act. As with Rule 11a-2, the focus of the Rule is primarily on sales and administrative charges that would be incurred by investors for effecting exchanges. Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed offer are consistent with Rule 11a-3 because no sales or administrative charge will be incurred as a result of the exchange. Because one investment company involved in the proposed exchange offer is organized as a unit investment trust rather than as a management investment company, Applicants believe that they may not rely upon Rule 11a-3. 
Class Relief 
1. Applicants request that the Order extend to all similarly situated current and affiliated entities, defined previously as Insurance Companies, Separate Accounts and Distributors. Applicants also request that the Order extend to all variable annuity contracts issued by an Insurance Company that are substantially similar to the Contracts and to any share class of any Prudential Mutual Fund for which there are no front-end sales charges or deferred sales charges. 
2. Applicants submit that providing class relief is appropriate. Applicants assert that because no front-end or deferred sales charges are applicable and all exchanges will be at relative net asset value, there will be no possibility of the abuses Congress sought to prevent through Section 11. Furthermore, without such exemptive relief, before Participants could be given any additional exchange options, Applicants would have to apply for and obtain additional approval orders. Applicants believe that such additional applications would present no new issues under the 1940 Act not already addressed in the application. 
Conclusion 
For the reasons and upon the facts summarized above, Applicants submit that the proposed exchange offers at net asset value do not involve any of the abuses that Section 11 is designed to prevent and provide a benefit to Participants by expanding exchange privileges under Programs designed to provide a mix of investment options and annuity benefits for retirement savings.

1.
     Participants may also direct investments under the IRA Program to an annuity contract offering a fixed rate investment option (the “Fixed Rate Annuity Contract”). Interests under the Fixed Rate Annuity Contract are exempt from registration under the 1933 Act under Section 3(a)(8) of the 1933 Act. Because the interests under the Fixed Rate Annuity Contract are not securities issued by a registered investment company, Applicants are not seeking exemptive relief with respect to exchanges to and from the Fixed Rate Annuity Contract.

2.
     Participants may also direct investments to the Fixed Rate Annuity Contract. Participants may also direct investments to registered open-end investment companies for which Applicants or their affiliates do not serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter (the “Unaffiliated Mutual Funds”). Because the Unaffiliated Mutual Funds and their principal underwriters are not affiliated with Applicants, Applicants are not seeking exemptive relief with respect to exchanges to and from the Unaffiliated Mutual Funds.

Please consult with a qualified investment professional if you wish to obtain investment advice.The target date is the approximate date when investors plan to retire and may begin withdrawing their money. The asset allocation of the target date funds will become more conservative until the date which is ten years prior to the target date by lessening the equity exposure and increasing the exposure in fixed income investments. The principal value of an investment in a target date fund is not guaranteed at any time, including the target date. There is no guarantee that the fund will provide adequate retirement income.A target-date fund should not be selected solely based on age or retirement date. Before investing, participants should carefully consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses, as well as their age, anticipated retirement date, risk tolerance, other investments owned, and planned withdrawals.The stated asset allocation may be subject to change. It is possible to lose money in a target date fund, including losses near and following retirement. Investments in the Funds are not deposits or obligations of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by any governmental agency or instrumentality.The Prudential Day One Funds may be offered as mutual funds. You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of each fund carefully before investing. The prospectus and the summary prospectus contain this and other information about the fund. Contact your financial professional for a prospectus and the summary prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.Shares of the registered mutual funds are offered through Prudential Investment Management Services LLC (PIMS), Newark, NJ, a Prudential Financial company.Prudential Day One Funds may also be offered as: (i) insurance company separate accounts available under group variable annuity contracts issued by Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company (PRIAC), Hartford, CT, a Prudential Financial company, and (ii) collective investment trust funds established by Prudential Trust Company, as trustee, a Pennsylvania trust company located in Scranton, PA, and a Prudential Financial company. Each of PRIAC and Prudential Trust Company is solely responsible for its own contractual obligations and financial condition. Offers of the collective investment trust funds may only be made by sales officers of Prudential Trust Company.The Day One Funds, as insurance company separate accounts or collective investment trust funds, are investment vehicles available only to qualified retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans and government plans, and their participants. Unlike mutual funds, the Day One Funds , as insurance company separate accounts or collective investment trust funds, are exempt from Securities and Exchange Commission registration under both the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, but are subject to oversight by state banking or insurance regulators, as applicable. Therefore, investors are generally not entitled to the protections of the federal securities laws.Please note that the Prudential Day One IncomeFlex Target Funds follow a different glidepath than the Day One Funds.

Back to topGeneral Contract for Services BasicsEstablish good professional relationships and prevent future misunderstandings with a general contract for services. Also known as an agreement for services or service contract, it defines the relationship between the business providing a service and the person or business receiving it. A general contract for services helps both parties by creating a clear record of the price, duration of services, obligations, and more, so if one party disagrees, the other is protected.

What is a General Contract for Services?Establish good professional relationships and prevent future misunderstandings with a general contract for services. Also known as an agreement for services or service contract, it defines the relationship between the business providing a service and the person or business receiving it. A general contract for services helps both parties by creating a clear record of the price, duration of services, obligations, and more, so if one party disagrees, the other is protected.
