Consumer Reviews


The Frugal Gambler -- No Bum Steer
Review by merle_levy

 November, 01 2011							
						


Pros: Following Scott's lead, you will have some really fun vacations.


Cons: You might find yourself playing solely for comps, losing more than the comps are worth.





Frugal Gambling Sounds Like an Oxymoron
Review by badragon

 July, 21 2001							
						


Pros: Tells you how to stretch your dollars in Las Vegas


Cons: Only touches on gambling in other places





A Frugal Book Rich with Gambling Knowledge
Review by mickdog

 March, 08 2001							
						


Pros: A great introduction to getting the most out of your money while gambling.


Cons: Only scratches the surface of the complex world of casino comps and promotions.

UPCOMING EVENTS / MESSAGES FROM JEAN



Upcoming Appearance
We don't currently have anything planned, but if you happen to spot us out and about at the Vegas casinos, please stop and introduce yourself  we don't mind taking a rest from gambling to chat with old friends and make new ones.

Friend Me On Facebook!
You can be on my friend on Facebook by clicking here: http://www.facebook.com/queenofcomps/.

Check Out My Blog!
You can access my "Frugal Vegas" blog at http://jscott.lvablog.com/.

													Since I don't write every day, if you want to know when there is a new entry, you can "subscribe" and you will be sent an e-mail alert as soon as I post. To do this, go to my blog and under the main banner is a link that says "Subscribe to Blog." Click on that to enter your email address and you will automatically be alerted by e-mail when there is a new post.

													I post whenever I am in the mood  I love not having the deadline I had with "Frugal Fridays." Although the content is mostly about Vegas and all things gambling, I put in enough personal details that you can keep track of what Brad and I are doing, in and out of casinos. See you there!

Product Reviews and General Publicity

NEW: Jean Scott's Frugal Vegas: "Review of 2015 Edition of Tax Book"

													ThePOGG Interview: "Jean Scott The Queen of Comps"

													Pittsburgh Tribune-Review: "Video Poker Expert 'A Real Nut' About Gaining an Edge"

													Casino City Times review of Tax Help for Gamblers by John Grochowski

													Reviews of The Frugal Gambler, 2nd ed. and More Frugal Gambling on VideoPokerBaller.com

Some of My Favorite Web Sites

													1) http://www.vpfree2.com  I am always being asked where the best video poker games are found. This free site lists where the most generous games can be found, and more.

													2) http://www.snopes.com  Hear one of those amazing stories that are passed around the Internet? Before you send it to hundreds of your closest friends, check it out here, where you can find out whether it is fact or urban legend.

													3) http://www.vegas4locals.com  One of the best places to find free and/or inexpensive things to do in Vegas, with tons of information for frugal locals and visitors alike.

													4) Mark's Las Vegas  This has unique coverage with information you might not readily find elsewhere, including a great "Players Club Comps and Tier Advancement Cheat Sheet" that shows how you can spend/buy your way way up to a higher tier in many casinos!

													5) http://www.sevenstarsinsider.com  From this website, you can subscribe for a free monthly newsletter and read former issues. Originally designed exclusively for Seven Stars cardholders, I find that there are plenty of new and valuable details in every newsletter for any player who is trying to squeeze more value from their play at a Caesars property.

Frugal Gambler Casino Guide
			A timeless treatment of the foundation of frugal gambling

The Frugal Gambler Casino Guide is a comprehensive update on the low-roller concepts for casino gambling covered in the first two Frugal books. It covers all the casino games, tables and machines, with instructions on how to play longer by losing less. And detailed guidance on everyday arithmetic in game selection and playing decisions, proper use of the players club systems with an emphasis on comps and other free stuff, and taking advantage of promotions will help recreational gamblers accrue the perks that all casino enthusiasts dream about: staying free at hotel-casinos, eating and drinking on the house, and gambling at a profit.

Memorial Trees
Circle of Life
In today’s changing world with climate change and environment concerns, “Honoring a Life” allows for
  family and friends to plant a memorial tree in honor of their loved one and friend. The purchase of a tree creates a beautiful permanent record on the Honoring a Life website, www.honoringalife.org. Each tree is planted through the efforts of Forestry Services throughout North America who determine where the greatest needs for reforestation are. Once planted, the geographical location where the tree is planted will be added to the record. A beautiful card is also sent to the family signifying your thoughtful gesture.
