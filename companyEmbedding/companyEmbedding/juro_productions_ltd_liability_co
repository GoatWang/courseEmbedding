What is an LLC?
The simple definition of a limited liability company (LLC) is that it is a form of business entity that limits the liability of its owners while allowing flexibility in operation and management and passing through its income to its members with no tax at the entity level.
Well, that's a pretty easy definition of an LLC, but it leaves a lot of queations unanswered.  So, really, what is a limited liability company?
Basic Features  of an LLC
The basic features of a limited liability company are:

Its owners have limited liability for the entity's debts and obligations, similar to the status of shareholders in a corporation, and 
Its income and losses are normally passed through to the owners as if it were a partnership.

The LLC is probably most like a limited partnership, but without the requirement that there be at least one general partner liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership.
An LLC is a statutory creation. That is, unlike general partnerships which developed under common law, an LLC, like a corporation, is created by filing a document (usually called Articles of Organization) with an officer designated by state law.  As the LLC is a statutory entity, the laws governing the LLC set up a particular ramework of rules for the operation and management of the LLC.  Generally, most of the statutory rules are considered to be fallback provisions which take effect only if the LLC's operating agreement doesn't provide for guidance on a particular point.
The LLC - a Newcomer
The LLC is a relatively new business entity, at least in the United States.   Business entities that bear strong similarities to limited liability companies existed in some European countries, but the first modern LLC statute in the United States was adopted by the Wyoming legislature in 1977.  At first, the novel entity was slow to gain acceptance.  The second state to enact a limited liability company act was Florida in 1982, five years after Wyoming's act. However, in the 1990's the popularity of the LLC snowballed and by 1997, every state and the District of Columbia had passed statutes allowing the formation of limited liability companies.

These services typically charge around $100-$500 to do the paperwork for you and make the filing with the various Secretaries of State to form the LLC.

Forms of Business Organization (provided by the Missouri Small Business and Technology Development Centers) One of the first decisions that you will have to make as a business owner is how the business should be structured.  All businesses must adopt some legal configuration that defines the rights and liabilities of participants in the business’s ownership, control, personal liability, life span, and financial structure.  This decision will have long-term implications, so you may want to consult with an accountant and attorney to help you select the form of ownership that is right for you.  In making a choice, you will want to take into account the following: •Your vision regarding the size and nature of your business.
•The level of control you wish to have.
•The level of “structure” you are willing to deal with.
•The business’s vulnerability to lawsuits.
•Tax implications of the different organizational structures.
•Expected profit (or loss) of the business.
•Whether or not you need to re-invest earnings into the business.
•Your need for access to cash out of the business for yourself.
An overview of the four basic legal forms of organization: Sole Proprietorship; Partnerships; Corporations and Limited Liability Company follows. Sole Proprietorship The vast majority of small businesses start out as sole proprietorships.  These firms are owned by one person, usually the individual who has day-to-day responsibility for running the business.  Sole proprietorships own all the assets of the business and the profits generated by it.  They also assume complete responsibility for any of its liabilities or debts.  In the eyes of the law and the public, you are one in the same with the business. Advantages of a Sole Proprietorship • Easiest and least expensive form of ownership to organize.
• Sole proprietors are in complete control, and within the parameters of the law, may make decisions as they see fit.
• Profits from the business flow-through directly to the owner’s personal tax return.
• The business is easy to dissolve, if desired. Disadvantages of a Sole Proprietorship • Sole proprietors have unlimited liability and are legally responsible for all debts against the business.  Their business and personal assets are at risk.
• May be at a disadvantage in raising funds and are often limited to using funds from personal savings or consumer loans.
• May have a hard time attracting high-caliber employees, or those that are motivated by the opportunity to own a part of the business.
• Some employee benefits such as owner’s medical insurance premiums are not directly deductible from business income (only partially as an adjustment to income). Partnerships In a Partnership, two or more people share ownership of a single business.  Like proprietorships, the law does not distinguish between the business and its owners.  The Partners should have a legal agreement that sets forth how decisions will be made, profits will be shared, disputes will be resolved, how future partners will be admitted to the partnership, how partners can be bought out, or what steps will be taken to dissolve the partnership when needed; Yes, its hard to think about a “break-up” when the business is just getting started, but many partnerships split up at crisis times and unless there is a defined process, there will be even greater problems.  They also must decide up front how much time and capital each will contribute, etc. Advantages of a Partnership • Partnerships are relatively easy to establish; however time should be invested in developing the partnership agreement.
• With more than one owner, the ability to raise funds may be increased.
• The profits from the business flow directly through to the partners’ personal tax return.
• Prospective employees may be attracted to the business if given the incentive to become a partner.
• The business usually will benefit from partners who have complementary skills. Disadvantages of a Partnership • Partners are jointly and individually liable for the actions of the other partners.
• Profits must be shared with others.
• Since decisions are shared, disagreements can occur.
• Some employee benefits are not deductible from business income on tax returns.
• The partnership may have a limited life; it may end upon the withdrawal or death of a partner. Types of Partnerships that should be considered: 1. General Partnership
Partners divide responsibility for management and liability, as well as the shares of profit or loss according to their internal agreement.  Equal shares are assumed unless there is a written agreement that states differently. 2. Limited Partnership and Partnership with limited liability
“Limited” means that most of the partners have limited liability (to the extent of their investment) as well as limited input regarding management decision, which generally encourages investors for short term projects, or for investing in capital assets.  This form of ownership is not often used for operating retail or service businesses.  Forming a limited partnership is more complex and formal than that of a general partnership. 3. Joint Venture
Acts like a general partnership, but is clearly for a limited period of time or a single project.  If the partners in a joint venture repeat the activity, they will be recognized as an ongoing partnership and will have to file as such, and distribute accumulated partnership assets upon dissolution of the entity.
  Corporations A Corporation, chartered by the state in which it is headquartered, is considered by law to be a unique entity, separate and apart from those who own it.  A Corporation can be taxed; it can be sued; it can enter into contractual agreements.  The owners of a corporation are its shareholders.  The shareholders elect a board of directors to oversee the major policies and decisions.  The corporation has a life of its own and does not dissolve when ownership changes. Advantages of a Corporation • Shareholders have limited liability for the corporation’s debts or judgments against the corporation.
• Generally, shareholders can only be held accountable for their investment in stock of the company.  (Note however, that officers can be held personally liable for their actions, such as the failure to withhold and pay employment taxes.
• Corporations can raise additional funds through the sale of stock.
• A Corporation may deduct the cost of benefits it provides to officers and employees.
• Can elect S Corporation status if certain requirements are met.  This election enables company to be taxed similar to a partnership. Disadvantages of a Corporation • The process of incorporation requires more time and money than other forms of organization.
• Corporations are monitored by federal, state and some local agencies, and as a result may have more paperwork to comply with regulations.
• Incorporating may result in higher overall taxes.  Dividends paid to shareholders are not deductible from business income; thus this income can be taxed twice. Subchapter S Corporation A tax election only; this election enables the shareholder to treat the earnings and profits as distributions, and have them pass through directly to their personal tax return.  The catch here is that the shareholder, if working for the company, and if there is a profit, must pay his/herself wages, and it must meet standards of “reasonable compensation”.  This can vary by geographical region as well as occupation, but the basic rule is to pay yourself what you would have to pay someone to do your job, as long as there is enough profit.  If you do not do this, the IRS can reclassify all of the earnings and profit as wages, and you will be liable for all of the payroll taxes on the total amount. Limited Liability Company (LLC) The LLC is a relatively new type of hybrid business structure that is now permissible in most states.  It is designed to provide limited liability features of a corporation and the tax efficiencies and operational flexibility of a partnership.  Formation is more complex and formal than that of a general partnership. The owners are members, and the duration of the LLC is usually determined when the organization papers are filed.  The time limit can be continued if desired by a vote of the members at the time of expiration.  LLC’s must not have more than two of the four characteristics that define corporations:  Limited liability to the extent of assets; continuity of life; centralization of management; and free transferability of ownership interests. Federal Tax Forms for LLC Taxed as a partnership in most cases; corporation forms must be used if there are more than 2 of the 4 corporate characteristics, as described above. In summary, deciding the form of ownership that best suits your business venture should be given careful consideration.  Use your key advisors to assist you in the process.

Insurance Requirements for Suppliers and VendorsPosted on: September 9, 2014 | 0 Comments | by Swingle CollinsMost retail, wholesale and manufacturing businesses permit suppliers and vendors to deliver products to their premises, perhaps even directly to the sales area. These businesses may have question like this: “I want to be sure our suppliers and vendors are properly insured before they deliver products to us or their employees visit our premises. I also want to be sure we have limited our company’s liability as much as possible when we sell, use or distribute their products. What kinds of insurance should we require and what documentation is needed to accomplish these goals?”
First, consult with your attorney to review your current vendor/supplier agreements or draft new ones. Many of the issues involved in this question require drafting an agreement that protects you with indemnification or hold-harmless and waiver of subrogation provisions, as well as requiring specific types of insurance the vendor/supplier must carry before they can do business with you. In addition, a properly-drafted agreement will indicate what the vendor/supplier must furnish to you as evidence that they are complying with the indemnification and insurance requirements. This is typically accomplished by requiring a Certificate of Insurance from their insurance company or agent. Your agent will be happy to discuss these requirements with your attorney.
Here are some specific points you and your attorney should consider.
Commercial General Liability Insurance
The supplier/vendor should already be covered by a Commercial General Liability (CGL) insurance policy. This type of policy protects them in case of an accident involving their premises, operations and products. Your agreement should require evidence that this policy provides the following:
Limits of Liability. Limits of $1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 aggregate are common limits carried on CGL policies. These should be the minimum limits you require.
Your Company as Additional Insured. Adding your company as an additional insured to the supplier/vendor’s CGL policy normally requires a special endorsement to the policy. There are different kinds of additional insured endorsements, so you should specify what kinds you require.
Waiver of Subrogation. If an employee of the vendor/supplier injures someone or damages property while delivering product to your premises, you want to be sure the vendor/supplier’s insurance company can’t sue you to recover any amounts they pay to settle the claim. Your agreement should require a “waiver of subrogation” to prevent this from happening and the vendor/supplier should provide evidence that their insurance company has agreed to the waiver.
Contractual Liability. In most cases, the CGL policy carried by the vendor/supplier covers the indemnification or hold harmless provision in your agreement, but you want to be sure the insurance company has not restricted the coverage in an unacceptable way. Your agreement with the vendor/supplier should clearly state that such modifications are not acceptable.
Automobile Liability Insurance
You want to be sure the vendor/supplier is adequately protected for accidents involving their vehicles while delivering products to you. The liability coverage on their auto policy covers your company as an additional insured automatically. You should require evidence of auto liability with a minimum limit of $1,000,000.
Workers Compensation
If an employee of the vendor/supplier is injured while delivering product to your premises, you want to be sure the supplier/vendor carries workers compensation insurance to cover the employee’s medical bills and lost wages. The employee is much less likely to sue your company if he or she is compensated by workers compensation insurance. In addition, you want to be sure the vendor/supplier’s insurance company can’t sue you to recover any amounts they pay to settle the claim. Your agreement should require a “waiver of subrogation” on the workers compensation policy to prevent this from happening and the vendor/supplier should provide evidence that their insurance company has agreed to the waiver.
Certificates of Insurance
What kind of evidence should you require to be sure the vendor/supplier has the insurance required by your agreement? The typical document is a “Certificate of Insurance.” Your agreement should require the vendor/supplier to furnish a Certificate of Insurance prior to commencing work for your company AND again when submitting an invoice for payment.
Reviewing the certificates and other documents furnished by your suppliers and vendors and analyzing them to be sure they are in compliance with your requirements can be a really big job. If it’s going to be done correctly, with assurance that compliance has indeed been accomplished, the job requires someone who is familiar with insurance policies and the nuances of coverage issues. And it requires someone who can communicate those issues clearly to the vendor/supplier or their insurance agent. Our agency has a solution. Instead of your employees spending time managing certificates of insurance, our agency can do this for you. Your employees have better things to do, like helping you grow your company. Ask your agent for more information.

LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Why Do Film Companies Form an LLC for a Movie?


                  by            
                  LegalZoom Staff




Why Do Film Companies Form an LLC for a Movie?
by LegalZoom Staff, December 2009





The entertainment industry is completely unrecognizable from what it was fifty years ago. You can watch movies on iPods, download TV shows from the internet, and vote for the newest American Idol from your phone. And it doesn't stop there. Fifty years ago, you'd never hear a salty independent producer say "I'm gonna put you in my LLC, kid." Today, you just might.
Risky and Independent
Independent producers still exist in Hollywood, but their numbers are far smaller. Their work is both limited and risky. They must compete with integrated media giants that can bear risk by spreading costs over a number of products. The independent producer develops and ultimately makes far fewer shows, spreading economic risk over a smaller number of projects.
Even so, studios and independent producers are still intertwined. The studio buys a finished product from a producer. These deals are often negotiated before a film completes and payment is made on delivery. These types of agreements, sometimes called "negative pick up" agreements, are good for producers because they keep them in business and independent. The independent company still bears the risk that a project will not be completed or will incur serious financial loss. To reduce risk and enhance control, independent producers began to form LLCs around productions.
Producing an LLC
The LLC, or limited liability company, is an entity that essentially contains investor liability within the bounds of the LLC itself. Unlike a partnership, the investor in an LLC is liable only for the amount of his or her investment in that company. So, if a hypothetical LLC were to go from being in the black to being far, far in the red, the individual investors are not personally liable for the debts of the LLC. For companies that operate as partnerships between founders, it is useful to form an LLC around an individual production in order to prevent any losses incurred from that production from impacting either the partnership as a whole or the assets of the individual partners.
Critics may wonder, why not form a corporation around the production and limit liability that way? While it is true that a corporation offers similar protection for individual assets, LLCs have some other unique features that make them the preferred entity for individual productions. Unlike corporations, LLCs are not subject to double taxation at both the shareholder and company level. Instead, LLCs are taxed as partnerships. This gives more flexibility in the way that they allocate gains and losses, a critically important feature for entertainment companies whose gains and losses may vary wildly depending on the success of any given project at a particular moment in time.
LLCs offer an additional feature that makes them more flexible and more desirable for use in the entertainment industry: they are not subject to governance rules. Because they are not hemmed in by legal requirements that dictate the manner and mode of governance and organization, an LLC may be run as the controlling parties desire, meaning that no board meetings or shareholder accountings are mandated. This gives the company operating the LLC the ability to make quick decisions which is highly desirable in a business where "time is money."

 
 
New Businesses, New Taxes
Of course, LLCs are not without certain drawbacks. Among the most notable is the recent California tax change that subjects LLCs to a hefty tax. Some guess this tax was created in order to exact more funds from Southern California's dominant industry: film. Whatever the reasons, LLCs are now more expensive to form and maintain than they have been in the past
Yet, for many companies engaged in the often speculative business of film and television production, an LLC is still cheaper than the risk of financial ruin. LLCs protect company assets to make risky business decisions a little bit safer.

Skip to main content







In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.
