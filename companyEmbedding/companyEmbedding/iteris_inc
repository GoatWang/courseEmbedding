Iteris, Inc. is an American company which was set up in 1969 and now is based in Santa Ana, California, focusing on intelligent information solutions to the traffic management market globally. Based on its technology, these intelligent transportation systems (ITS) help to reduce traffic congestions, improve predictions of weather and traffic conditions, and provide more accurate performance analysis. There are two major segments in Iteris, namely roadway sensors and transportation systems. In December 2010, the company acquired Meridian Environmental Technology, Inc.[1] In November 2011, the company acquired Berkeley Transportation Systems, Inc.[2][3]

History[edit]
In the late 1990s, Iteris acquired some assets of Rockwell International Corp., Mohaddes Associates, and Viggen Corporation. Meanwhile, it cooperated to develop a lane departure warning system. In 2011, Iteris reconstructed its production line of lane departure to be an intelligent traffic management information company and then developed the iPerform group. After that, the company acquired Meridian Environmental Technologies and Berkeley Transportation Systems for better weather forecasting and traffic measurement.[4]
Products[edit]
Iteris, Inc.’s roadway sensors segment markets on vehicle detection systems for traffic intersection control and traffic data collections. The products of this segment are Vantage series video detection system (such as VantageView, Vantage Vector), SmartSpan and SmartCycle, VersiCam, Pico, and Abacus. The company’s transportation systems segment markets on transportation engineering, and consulting services, information systems and decision support systems for better traffic conditions. In addition, its iPerform segment markets on transportation performance measurement.[5]
In 2013, the company launched SmartCycle, which can detect vehicles and bicycles accurately with a single video detection camera facing a dedicated approach.[6]
In 2016, the company launched PedTrax, which automates measurement of both the count, direction and speed of pedestrians in crosswalks to provide insights on levels of street life.[7]
In 2017, the company launched VantageLive!, which allows users to view intersection activity by automatically collecting and analyzing vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian data on a continuous basis. [8]
Research and development[edit]
September, 2013. Iteris, Inc. announced the new web-based software iPeMS lite for arterial and freeway applications, with an instant analysis and visualization of big data in traffic conditions, such as speed and congestions.[9]
May, 2013. Iteris, Inc. cooperated with INRIX to integrate INRIX’s real-time and historical traffic information with IterisPeM. After the integration, IterisPeMS could collect traffic data information across all major highways and arterial roads for better evaluation abilities.[10]
Iteris has also collaborated with Conservis to provide weather data and analytics to farmers. [11]
Awards[edit]
2013. ASCE’s Award for the Outstanding Private Sector Civil Engineering Project for its contribution to Metro Orange Line Extension.[12]
2013. Iteris received the Project Achievement Award, to by CMAA Southern California Chapter for the Metro Orange Line Extension.[13]
2010. Iteris won the One of the Best in the West by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) for the I-15 North Design-Build Project.[14]
2009. Iteris won "The Next Downtown, A Sustainable Vision for Downtown L.A." by the American Planning Association (APA), Los Angeles Section.[14]

SmartSpan - Vehicle Detection System






 
Many traffic management agencies using span-wire mounted signals have not previously been able to widely deploy video vehicle detection, as it has traditionally been mounted on rigid traffic signal mast arms. Until now, span-wire mounted cameras provided tough challenges for image processing algorithms, due to uncontrolled and random camera movement.
 
 
 
 





 
 


Vantage Vector - Vehicle Detection Sensor






 
Vantage Vector is an all-in-one vehicle detection sensor with a wide range of capabilities: stop bar detection, advanced-zone detection, and sensing that enables advanced safety and adaptive control applications.It includes all the proven benefits of Iteris video detection: high accuracy, high availability, the video image for remote viewing, no trenching or pavement cutting for installation, and bicycle detection capability

                        Mission
                    


Our mission is to be the leading intelligent traffic management information company, applying advanced technologies to plan, design, integrate, and enable complete solutions that address significant needs in the traffic management market. We commit ourselves to high standards of integrity in contributing to the best interests of our clients, the transportation profession, our associates and our communities, and to seeking significant returns to our shareholders, based on the continual pursuit of technological and operational excellence.





                        History
                    


Iteris’ roots date back to 1993 when engineers used their video image processing expertise to introduce Vantage, Iteris’ first commercial vehicle detection product to address the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) market. In the late 1990s, Iteris acquired the transportation systems business of Rockwell International Corp., Meyer, Mohaddes Associates, a premier Traffic Engineering and ITS Consulting firm based in Los Angeles, and certain assets of the Washington D.C.-based consulting firm of Viggen Corporation to enhance our product engineering and ITS consulting practices. 
At the same time, Iteris developed and went into production with the world’s first commercially available Lane Departure Warning (LDW) System which was soon deployed on commercial trucks in Europe and the U.S. Within four years, the first passenger cars to offer LDW became available in the U.S. 
Iteris continued to mature alongside the ITS industry since the early 1990s, and has emerged as a flourishing company with distinguished products and services that have resulted in national projects and awards. 
In 2011, Iteris divested its Lane Departure product group to focus and transform into an intelligent traffic management information company. Later that year we established the iPerform group to develop and market software based performance measurement and management products and services. We acquired Meridian Environmental Technologies providing us with added expertise in traveler information/511 systems, as well as weather forecasting and information system. We also acquired Berkeley Transportation Systems with expertise in performance measurement and management. 
Our products and services range from regional and state-wide traffic management programs, to Commercial Vehicle Operations contracts and Goods Movement programs, to a comprehensive offering of Roadway detection products, serving both public and commercial customers in providing predictive traffic and weather information systems.
With corporate headquarters in Santa Ana, California and over 20 offices nationwide, as well as South America and Middle East. The company remains committed to its position as a leader in the intelligent traffic management market and to helping solve some of the world’s most challenging surface transportation networks.
