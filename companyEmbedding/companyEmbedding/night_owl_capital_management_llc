Wired HD Cameras







Wired Analog Cameras







Wireless IP Cameras









Decoy Cameras






The first video cameras were sold in 1956 for $50,000 each. Since then, the technology has greatly improved as more manufacturers have entered the space and products dropped in price. As technology marches forward, video cameras became less expensive, better quality, and more available for commercial and residential use. Night Owl Meets Security Surveillance Cameras DemandThere is a growing market for surveillance cameras that offer better video quality. Globally, video surveillance will reach over $42 billion by 2019. Prompted by global demand, consumers are looking for cost effective ways to safeguard their family and property. Night Owl’s security surveillance cameras are the solution for the world’s increased security demand.HD Quality Video Surveillance Cameras Magnify Details Two decades ago, it wasn’t cost efficient for a small business to own more than one security video camera. In the unfortunate case of a forced entry, the robber’s face could not be identified due to the poor quality of the video stream. Today, homeowners and business owners can afford to place video surveillance cameras in multiple vantage points around their property - and enjoy the HD quality that streams in, in clear and vivid detail.Complete Security Video Cameras Night Owl provides HD security cameras and analog security cameras as part of a complete security surveillance system. Our cameras shoot live video in 720p in High Definition. This means shopkeepers can identify faces that walk in their door, parents are able to see what the babysitter is doing when they are not home, and homeowners are able to see the people that walk about their premises.  Features To Fit Your BudgetNight Owl is proud to be on the forefront of this change. Our products integrate into smart homes and are also backward compatible with analog devices. Choose from different types of features depending on your needs: night vision, optical zoom, audio enabled, wide viewing angles, and weatherproof ratings. Night Owl stocks security video cameras that let you zoom in on details with clear and crisp precision. Complete security systems are available that record footage for up to 6 months. We also carry refurbished and decoy cameras for consumers on a budget.

Home security systems
Home security is not a subject to be taken lightly. You put a lot of time and effort into purchasing, building, and decorating a home – now it’s time to protect your investment. With a wide variety of home security systems to choose from, you can get peace of mind knowing your family and valuables are being protected in exactly the way you want. Think you’re ready for a home security system? Complete the form above to get free quotes from local pros.

        Alarm system installation
Home security alarm systems help offer protection against burglary and other unwanted intrusions. With the latest technology, you can even choose between a hardwired or wireless alarm. Alarms usually require a keypad and control panel. They’re available in both hardwired and wireless options.

        Equipment options
With all the brands and tech options on the market, your home security equipment can be as minimal or robust as you’d like. The best way to decide what you need is to talk to home security companies about their package and a la carte offerings. There’s a huge range of equipment choices from installing a camera to having a smart lock on your door to 24-hour monitoring and motion detectors.

        Cameras
Installing a camera is a one of the basic equipment options you’ll encounter, so it’s important to know how extensive or minimal you might want your camera system to be. Looking into some of the most popular brands, figuring out which entry points in your home you may want monitored, and deciding if an indoor or outdoor camera would be better for you are some good first steps into researching your camera needs.

        How to get started
Once you’ve done your online research, we recommend talking to a few security companies to see what they think you need for your home’s size and location. This will also help you nail down how best to work within your budget while getting everything you need for your home security. They can walk you through equipment recommendations (like alarm types and cameras) as well as answer all your questions. If you’re considering purchasing a home security system, complete the above form to review free quotes from local professionals.

Home security systems
Home security is not a subject to be taken lightly. You put a lot of time and effort into purchasing, building, and decorating a home – now it’s time to protect your investment. With a wide variety of home security systems to choose from, you can get peace of mind knowing your family and valuables are being protected in exactly the way you want. Think you’re ready for a home security system? Complete the form above to get free quotes from local pros.

        Alarm system installation
Home security alarm systems help offer protection against burglary and other unwanted intrusions. With the latest technology, you can even choose between a hardwired or wireless alarm. Alarms usually require a keypad and control panel. They’re available in both hardwired and wireless options.

        Equipment options
With all the brands and tech options on the market, your home security equipment can be as minimal or robust as you’d like. The best way to decide what you need is to talk to home security companies about their package and a la carte offerings. There’s a huge range of equipment choices from installing a camera to having a smart lock on your door to 24-hour monitoring and motion detectors.

        Cameras
Installing a camera is a one of the basic equipment options you’ll encounter, so it’s important to know how extensive or minimal you might want your camera system to be. Looking into some of the most popular brands, figuring out which entry points in your home you may want monitored, and deciding if an indoor or outdoor camera would be better for you are some good first steps into researching your camera needs.

        How to get started
Once you’ve done your online research, we recommend talking to a few security companies to see what they think you need for your home’s size and location. This will also help you nail down how best to work within your budget while getting everything you need for your home security. They can walk you through equipment recommendations (like alarm types and cameras) as well as answer all your questions. If you’re considering purchasing a home security system, complete the above form to review free quotes from local professionals.
