OUR STORY 





Jim Pittenger and Dan Anderson began their careers at bank investment departments in the 1970s before working together at Dean Witter in the ’80s. As their brokerage careers progressed, they found the interests of the brokerage firm and those of their clients moving further apart. Brokers (today called financial advisors) were being incentivized to sell in-house products and other high fee investments that typically favored the firm over the client.
Sensing a need for an advisor who always put their clients’ interests first, Pitt left Dean Witter to start Pittenger & Co. in 1995 with the goal of managing $75 million in assets. One year later, Dan rejoined his old partner and Pittenger & Anderson was born.  In doing so, they started a revolution, one that believes investment advice shouldn’t be tied to the sale of products.  Today, P&A manages $1.3 billion in investments with a full-time staff of 11 people.  Clearly the business model is working.
In 2012, P&A rolled out their initial succession plan by announcing three new principals: Jon Sevenker, Diane Klein, and Trey Pittenger.   In 2014, Blake Anderson rejoined the firm and became a principal, and in 2015, Shane Riley was named a principal as well.  Together, these five have shown their commitment to serving our clients with the utmost professionalism and service, while continuing to grow our business for the future.
Although we call Lincoln home, we serve clients from coast to coast in nearly 30 states. We’ve found that clients are drawn to our Midwestern values and work ethic, as well as our friendliness and proactive communication style.  All our clients are encouraged to get to know everyone in the office and to work with whomever they feel most comfortable.  Our open office environment breeds collaboration and teamwork which ultimately benefits our clients.  Are you interested in why we behave the way we do?

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT 








Our five main investment management styles are highlighted below.  We have included characteristics of each, who they might appeal to, and the average all-in cost to you for each style.





Custom EquityFixed IncomeBalancedMutual FundsETFs




Typically has a 100% allocation to equities, but fixed income can be added at discretion of P&A.
Largely individual stocks, with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds mixed in to round out the portfolio.
If you want to know exactly what stocks you own, Custom Equity will appeal to you.
This style allows us to more effectively manage your realized gains & losses each tax year.
Our fee schedule begins at 1% of assets per year, with the first breakpoint at $1 million.
The average all-in cost to you (including trading commissions) is generally in the 1.04% to 1.08% range on an annual basis.








This style is invested 100% in bonds, bond funds, and other fixed income securities.
If you want a predictable income stream and lower volatility than a portfolio with stocks, this style will appeal to you.
If you’re in a high tax bracket and want the tax-free interest from municipal bonds.
If you prefer knowing when your bonds will mature, this style should appeal to you.
Same fee schedule as Custom Equity.








Our most popular management style, this is a combination of Custom Equity & Fixed Income.
Primarily individual stocks and bonds, with some mutual funds and ETFs mixed in to round out the portfolio.
Asset allocations are tailored to your risk tolerance, financial goals, and time horizon.
A good option if you don’t want all your invested assets exposed to the stock market.
Same fee schedule as Custom Equity and Fixed Income.








No-load and no transaction fee mutual funds are used to achieve proper diversification.
Low cost index funds constitute anywhere from 60% to 100% of these accounts.  Index funds seek to replicate the return of a market benchmark or index, such as the S&P 500.  Managed mutual funds, where the fund manager seeks to beat a certain index or benchmark, represent the remainder of the portfolio.
Mutual Fund Accounts are rebalanced twice per year at a minimum.  Rebalancing involves bringing each mutual fund back to our desired weighting.  Funds that have outperformed typically are trimmed, while those that have underperformed typically are added to.
If you plan to consistently add to or withdraw from your account, this style may be of interest.
Our fee schedule for Mutual Fund Accounts starts at 0.75% annually.
The all-in cost to you (which includes the underlying mutual fund expenses, as well as our management fee) is generally between 1% and 1.25%.








Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are baskets of stocks or bonds similar to mutual funds, but they trade during the day like individual stocks and bonds do.
Our ETF accounts will be formally rebalanced (or reviewed for rebalancing) two times per year.  In effect, they are constantly being monitored for any investment that falls outside of our preferred range.
These accounts work well for investors who are comfortable with mutual fund-like products and who want to minimize their expenses.
Our fee schedule for these accounts starts at 0.75% annually.
The ETFs we use have relatively lower expense ratios than mutual funds. The all-in cost to you (including ETF expenses, trading commissions, and our management fee) is generally around 1%.









You won’t read this on many other financial adviser websites, but given our fee-only business model it’s in our interest to keep your investment management fees as low as possible. Clearly, this aligns your interests and ours.
If you have any questions or would like more information about how P&A would manage your investments, please call us at 402-328-8800 and ask for Pitt, Dan, Jon, Diane, Trey, or Blake.

COMPLIMENTARY SERVICES 








When you become an investment management client of P&A, you are entitled to the following services at no extra cost. We hope you’ll take advantage of this offer and get as much work out of us as you can.
Financial Planning
Mention the words financial planning to many people and their eyes glaze over or a look of dread appears on their face, but financial planning doesn’t have to be boring or thought of in the same terms as having a root canal.
The reason we do them for free (for our investment management clients) is because they are worth more than we can sell them for. Yes, they’re that important to your financial future. Going through the process will give you peace of mind and validation, help you spend more freely, or maybe provide you with some goals to work toward. This process also benefits you because it allows us to get a clearer picture of where you stand and to offer you more accurate advice. Click on the link for a more detailed discussion of the Financial Planning process.
Consistent Education
A large part of our role in your financial life is sharing knowledge. We do this in our conversations with you, via the P&A Blog, our Twitter account, as well as through our monthly e-newsletters and quarterly letters. From keeping you informed of changes in the marketplace to protecting your pocketbook from Wall Street, it’s our goal for you to view P&A as your trusted financial advocate.
Retirement Plan Help
Company retirement plans typically don’t offer their employees personalized help. Essentially, you are paying fees to the 401k provider while acting as your own investment adviser. We can help you in one of two ways: 1) you can send us a recent statement of your account and we can analyze how it is invested and make recommendations, or 2) if you’re eligible, you can take what’s called an in-service distribution and roll the money into an IRA rollover account and have us manage this money.  We will do a side-by-side cost comparison (of what you’re currently paying versus what you’d pay us) if you are considering an in-service distribution.
Charitable Gift Trusts & Donor-Advised Funds
The most tax-efficient way to give money to charities and 501c3 organizations is not by writing the charity a check.  If you have an after-tax investment account with highly appreciated securities, a charitable gift trust or donor-advised fund should be of interest.  We use Fidelity for these and they charge 0.60% per year for this account, while we don’t charge you anything.
You fund a gift trust account by contributing appreciated securities, netting you a charitable contribution deduction for the current tax year.  You also avoid paying capital gains taxes on the securities you contribute to your gift trust account.  Fidelity requires a minimum of $5,000 to open one and minimum donations to charity (called grants) of $50 each. Here’s more about the benefits of using a charitable gift trust/DAF.
Collaborating With Your Other Advisors
P&A can be your financial quarterback, coordinating and collaborating with your accountant around tax-related items and your attorney regarding estate planning needs. By getting all your advisors on the same page, your financial affairs will get the detailed care and cohesion they deserve.
These are just a few of the complimentary services we offer you on your financial journey.

Company Description


Pittenger & Anderson (P&A) employs a core and satellite investment approach. Equity accounts are constructed around a core of large-cap stock holdings. The equity satellites may include: mid-cap, small-cap, foreign, alternatives, etc. Fixed income accounts are constructed around a core of investment grade holdings. The fixed income satellites may include: high yield, foreign, mortgaged-backed, etc. The core holdings tend to be more passive than the satellite holdings. As the satellites grow they can acquire satellites of their own. P&A manages these advisory accounts on a discretionary basis. Account supervision is based on the client's stated objectives (i.e. maximum capital appreciation, growth, income, or growth and income), as well as tax considerations. The firm offers five different styles of portfolio management, which all employ their core and satellite strategy: Custom Equity, Fixed Income, and Balanced.P&A offers two different styles of model portfolio management which are further broken down by size and asset allocation: Fireball and Canonball. The Fireball model offers no-load mutual fund exposure while Cannonball portfolios are comprised of ETFs. Both employ licensed software products that allow their investment committee to build and continually rebalance economical and scalable portfolios.Fixed income investments include US treasuries, US government guaranteed/collateralized debt and federal agencies, as well as GNMA, FNMA & FHLB mortgage backed debt. Corporate debt and asset back securities must be investment grade, exchange listed and or highly liquid. Municipal revenue bonds must be investment grade and display consistent debt service coverage. Municipal general obligation bonds must be investment grade and display modest debt to assessed valuations. Non-rated municipal and corporate bonds must meet investment grade standards set by the investment committee. Fallen angels in all categories must also meet the investment grade standards held by the investment committee regardless of rating.
