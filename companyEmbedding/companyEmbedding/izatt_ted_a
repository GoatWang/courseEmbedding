		I have had the pleasure of working with Ted Gudorf for several years now after interviewing several Estate Planning Attorney’s who also specialized in Medicaid Planning. I also needed an Attorney well versed in the Agricultural community, as Nationwide Agribusiness is the largest writer of Farm owners in the U.S.. Ted has also interviewed with the lead Attorney for Nationwide Financial before becoming a strong partner Southwestern Ohio.

Ted is an excellent communicator and experienced at speaking before large crowds at seminars. His knowledge, credentials, support staff and all around professionalism has been a tremendous asset to our joint clients, who we approach as a team. After 35 years in the insurance business and 22 years with Nationwide, this particular Partnership has developed into one of the strongest of my career.

For anyone in need of an Estate Planning Attorney who is very well versed in Medicaid Planning, all types of Trusts and Tax Laws, I would not hesitate at all in recommending Ted. I am looking forward to many more years of this successful partnership….focused on helping clients	

		– Don Russell, Territory Sales Director - Nationwide Financial Network	





		
		I am an attorney specializing in estate, business and charitable planning.  I have known Ted Gudorf for over ten years and have worked with Ted on many cases.  Not only is Ted extremely bright, he is dedicated to his practice and his clients to a degree I have not seen in many of my other colleagues…who are also very dedicated.  Ted takes each of his cases and delves into it with an enthusiasm and devotion to make the very best estate plan to satisfy the goals and dreams of that particular client.  He crunches numbers to see the greatest tax savings for different strategies.  He researches charities and charitable techniques for the greatest impact.  He listens to his clients so he can adeptly draft the language to protect and provide for their loved ones. He cares…he really cares.

Ted has a personality wherein he can easily work with other professionals without infringing on others’ egos. He is truly a team player and is highly respected by other estate planners around the country.  He is constantly striving to learn more.  Long after he received his Juris Doctor to be an attorney, Ted studied after his work day to get his Master in Tax.  He enjoys learning new strategies so he has a firm grasp on complex techniques that may be just right for that particular client.

What I admire most about Ted are his values.  He is honest as the day is long, he is committed to his family, and he honors his friends, his community, his country.  I would work with Ted at any time because it is an absolute pleasure.  I am proud to call Ted my friend and colleague.

		– Manuel E. Brown, Jr.	





My husband and I first became acquainted with the Gudorf Law Group in late 2008. We had been working on estate plans for some time with our life insurance agent and his associated financial planner, but we had some questions that were outside their areas of expertise. After an extensive search on their part, they recommended Ted Gudorf and his firm, and I'm forever grateful that they did.
Like many Gudorf clients, we were interested in minimizing federal estate taxes, but we had other concerns too. We have two adult sons, who were in their early twenties at the time. Neither was married or in a serious relationship. We were hoping to find a way to avoid the necessity of pre-nuptial agreements while still protecting assets in the event of a divorce. We were also hoping to find a plan that would be portable if we moved away from Ohio.
The Gudorf Law Group fulfilled all our expectations and gave us outstanding service. They set up a number of trusts for us, but more importantly, they provided the necessary handholding to ensure that our assets were appropriately re-titled. We had set up a similar trust some years earlier, but I never felt that I knew exactly what needed to be done to maximize its effectiveness. In just three meetings with Ted, we were able to lay out all our concerns, make changes to the drafts he wrote, and finalize the documents. He even met with our sons to explain exactly what they needed to do in order to make the provisions work as planned. I really appreciate his attention to detail and thoroughness.
It's clear that Ted takes his responsibilities very seriously. He often attends workshops to keep abreast of the latest developments in tax law and estate planning. In addition, he makes it very convenient to work with him: our meetings usually took place on Saturdays or in the very late afternoons. Besides that, he's a most congenial person, and it was a pleasure to interact with him and his associates. I would not hesitate to recommend Gudorf Law Group to a friend or family member.
They have my highest recommendation.
