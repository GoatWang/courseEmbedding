About Us
Community




At the heart of Where Food Comes From, Inc. is a group of people dedicated to agriculture, family and community.  We believe in conducting business with integrity, ingenuity, respect and transparency, and translating those values across all that we do.
 
A key aspect of fulfilling the promise of our value system is by engaging our communities in a significant and positive manner.  Not only do we work hard to support agriculture and rural America in a variety of ways, but we also:

→ focus on youth – particularly in agriculture and leadership
→ encourage sustainability of business, family and the environment
→ provide resources to enable knowledge and transparency about food production
→ reach out to and lift up rural communities


 



 
 
 






Featured Organization: Colorado Agricultural Leadership Foundation (CALF)


CALF brings suburban kids to the country. John and Bea Lowell, CALF’s founders, were dedicated to ensuring that all youth who wanted to be involved in agriculture had the opportunity to do so.  They started the “CALF Kid” program in 2002.  CALF provides facilities for 4-H and FFA members to raise their market livestock projects at the Lowell Ranch.  Over the years, more than 40 youth have raised their projects at CALF’s Lowell Ranch.
CALF Kids purchase their animals and provide daily care and feed for their project.  CALF provides the facility.  CALF Kids may also have gardening, forestry, or other projects at the ranch. CALF also offers both kid and adult education and agricultural experience programs outside of the CALF Kid program. To date, CALF has hosted tens of thousands of suburban children and adults in a variety of programs focused on agriculture and food production. A highlight of the farm is the Where Food Comes From School Garden, where children participate in the annual planting, care and harvest of a wide variety of row crops, vegetables and fruits.
Where Food Comes From, Inc. is a very proud supporter of CALF!  To learn more about the organization, visit www.thecalf.org.

Programs - Where Food Comes From

What We Do
Programs




The type of product you are growing, raising or packaging will impact what kind of verification and certification programs are available to you and most appropriate for your needs.  As you can probably imagine, programs that work well for a cattle producer or beef processor may not fit the needs of an asparagus farmer or orange juice purveyor.  Similarly, the demand for specific product attributes varies greatly between commodities – which is exactly why you’ve come to the right place!
Our team can help determine what programs may or may not fit best for your operation and your marketing needs, and answer any questions you have on the process, expectations, standards and estimated audit schedule. Contact us today to learn more or search for some common programs by a specific area of focus below.

 



 
 
 




Claims and Programs We Work With
We offer third-party verification services to literally hundreds of claims, programs and markets. These include Process Verified Programs, Safe Quality Food initiatives, Organic Certification, Non-GMO Project Verification, and many more. No matter what you produce or how you produce it, there’s likely a program—or programs—that fit your needs perfectly.

USDA Process Verified Programs (USDA PVP):
Multiple divisions of Where Food Comes From, Inc. carry USDA PVP accreditation, which means that we offer verification services to a wide variety of “points” or “claims” that are tied to processes and procedures the USDA has reviewed and approved. We conduct the audits, determine compliance to the claims requested, and issue certificates of approval for our customers.
You can learn more about USDA Process Verified Programs here.
A few examples of these programs would be:
Source Verification – Identification and traceability are the cornerstones of this claim. To know an animal’s birthplace, we must to be able to review records that identify the animal in a unique way tied to that source of origin. This is most often done with the use of individual, electronic ear tags that the animals wear, which are then cross referenced to specific records maintained on the farm or ranch. Similarly, source can be tracked in fruits, vegetables, grains, and all types of agricultural products. If you want the story behind your food, you must first know where it came from! That is why nearly 100% of our verification programs and services start with Source Verification as their base.
Age Verification – Age verification of cattle remains a valuable and viable market-driven program for the U.S. beef industry. Not only does it prevent cattle from falling out of EV programs where dentition is the common means for age determination, but coupled with Source Verification it is considered the base value-add program for the cattle industry.
Non-Hormone Treated Cattle (NHTC) – The NHTC program was specifically developed in 1999 to facilitate beef trade between the U.S. and the European Union (EU). Since that time, exporting U.S. beef to any of the 27 countries within the EU requires the product must come from cattle verified by a third-party to have never received any hormone growth promotants during their lifecycle.
Visit the USDA NHTC website here.
View the IMI Global NHTC program flier here.
Contact us to enroll today!
Saudia Arabia EV – The Saudi Arabia market was closed to U.S. beef in 2012. Since that time, the beef industry has been working with the U.S. government to re-open that market, which officially happened in the fall of 2016. At a minimum, cattle must be traceable to the ranch of origin and under 30 months of age. In addition, there are specific feeding restrictions at the backgrounding and feedlot level, which is why cattle approved for the Verified Natural program (referenced below) are automatically in compliance.
Additional programs offered within the Process Verified umbrella are: Never-Fed Beta Agonists, Verified Grass-Fed Beef, Vegetarian Fed, Flax Fed, SO100 Feed Claims, and Pork for the European Union.
National Organic Program (NOP):
National Organic Program – USDA National Organic Program (NOP) Certification is required by law in the U.S. to market products as Organic. Organic is a labeling term for food or other agricultural products that have been produced using practices that support the cycling of on-farm resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity in accordance with the USDA organic regulations. Synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, irradiation, and genetic engineering are a few examples of products or processes that are prohibited.
Visit the NOP website here.

Third-Party & Private Label Programs:
One of the unique aspects of Where Food Comes From, Inc. is our ability to provide verification and certification services to a broad range of programs and standards. In addition to our USDA accreditation, we are also an approved third-party verifier for 50+ additional programs and organizations, and have highlighted many of them below.

Global Animal Partnership 5-Step Animal Welfare Rating (GAP) – Required for all beef, pork, chicken and turkey products sold in Whole Foods Market stores, the GAP 5-Step Animal Welfare Rating is a private standard focused on farm-animal handling practices. The program is designed to promote and facilitate continuous improvement, and better inform consumers about the production systems they choose to support.
Visit the GAP website here.
View the IMI Global GAP program flier here.
Contact us to enroll today!
Verified Natural Beef (VNB) – The VNB  program allows cattle to be eligible for buyers and brands seeking specialty markets requiring natural beef. The standard incorporates three prohibited aspects of production – hormone growth promotants, antibiotics, and animal by-products.
View the IMI Global VNB program flier here.
Contact us to enroll today!
Non-GMO Project Verified – The Non-GMO Project is North America’s leading third-party verification and labeling program for non-GMO food and products. GMOs, or “genetically modified organisms,” are plants or animals that have been genetically engineered with DNA from bacteria, viruses, and/or other animals and plants. The standard requires the auditing of processes, procedures and facilities and the use of testing protocols for food products to confirm the absence of GMOs.
Visit the Non-GMO Project website here.

Download our Non-GMO Project Questionnaire here. Livestock producer? Download our Livestock Questionnaire here.
Contact us with any questions!
Gluten Free Certification – The Certified ICS Gluten-Free Standard is based on a combination of quantitative analysis of ingredients and products, along with required management practices aimed at minimizing the introduction (accidental or otherwise) of gluten proteins in the production stream.
Visit the ICS website to learn more.
Download our Gluten-Free flier here.
Contact us to enroll today!
Verified Grass-Fed – This standard requires grass and forage to be the sole feed source consumed for the lifetime of the animal, with the exception of milk consumed prior to weaning. Mineral and vitamin supplementation from non-grain sources is also permitted.
Contact us to enroll today!
American Grass-Fed Alliance (AGA) – The American Grass-Fed Alliance in a private industry standard. AGA defines grass-fed animals as those that have eaten nothing but grass and forage from weaning to harvest, have not been raised in confinement, and have never been fed antibiotics or growth hormones. In addition, all AGA-Certified Producers are American farms and their livestock is born and raised in the U.S.
Visit the AGA website here.
Contact us to enroll today!
Safe Quality Food (SQF) – Safe Quality Food (SQF) is a certification benchmarked by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). SQF is recognized worldwide and is requested more and more frequently by customers of food processors and manufacturers. Our Validus division is licensed and accredited to perform SQF audits both on farm and in plants processing raw agricultural goods for many different SQF Food Sector Categories: livestock and game animals, animal feed, slaughterhouse operations, meat and poultry processing, seafood processing, dairy food processing, egg processing, manufacture of preserved foods, manufacture of pet food, and manufacture of animal feed.
Visit the SQF website here.
Visit the Validus website to get started.
Feed Verified – Feed Verified is a resource for livestock producers, feed companies, and food brands alike to confirm a particular feed product meets the requirements for specific verification or certification programs. Our IMI Global division assures that segregation and traceability practices are in place at the manufacturer and products are verified to meet the requirements of the programs selected.

Grocery store aisles and menus are full of claims and labels related to the food products they are selling or preparing.  As a result, it can be confusing as to which statements are simply great marketing versus authentic and verifiable claims about the food you are eating.  This is why many brands are seeking out new ways to communicate the story of their products to consumers transparently and with validity.  And the Where Food Comes From Source Verified® label is their answer!

 



 
 
 





How can you understand anything about a food product if you don’t know where it comes from?  All of those credence attributes or production practices that may be important to many individual consumers are irrelevant if you cannot first determine WHERE it was raised or grown.  After that, you can begin to understand the HOW, WHEN and WHY.
Rest assured, any product that carries the Where Food Comes From Source Verified® label has undergone a thorough audit and verification process to assure that their products are traceable back to the individual families that produced them.  They know where their food comes from, and as a result, so can you.
Meet the brands, stores and restaurants offering Where Food Comes From Source Verified® products.
