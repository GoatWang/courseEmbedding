Judgment honed over two decades of investment experience
The Value of Experience.Crescent’s Mezzanine strategy is one of the leading independent global providers of mezzanine capital. Since 1992, Crescent's Mezzanine strategy has developed a reputation as a reliable provider of junior debt capital, primarily to fund shareholder transitions on behalf of private equity firms. We believe our reputation is a result of our extensive investment experience, broad transaction sourcing capabilities, and disciplined investment approach. Our objective is to provide investors with substantial current income and capital appreciation by investing in a diversified portfolio of mezzanine securities. Investments generally take the form of private debt securities with equity participation in connection with buyouts, recapitalizations and refinancings.
 
Investors committed more than $4.6 billion to Crescent Mezzanine Partners VII (“Fund VII”), exceeding the initial fundraising target of $3.0 billion and representing the largest private mezzanine offering in Crescent Mezzanine’s history. Our experience investing in over 190 mezzanine transactions for 25 years is a key element to our continued success.Providing financing to private equity sponsors
