						CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) Stock Rating Lowered by Zacks Investment Research

							Filed Under: Analyst Articles - US - Finance 







Tweet










CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a report released on Monday. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
Several other equities analysts have also recently weighed in on CA. Citigroup Inc.  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $34.00 price objective (up previously from $33.00) on shares of CA in a research report on Sunday, May 14th. DA Davidson  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $12.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Friday, May 19th. BidaskClub cut CA from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a research report on Saturday, July 1st. Raymond James Financial, Inc.  reissued a “market perform” rating on shares of CA in a research report on Thursday, June 22nd. Finally, Sanford C. Bernstein  reissued an “underperform” rating and set a $28.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Wednesday, June 28th. Four equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned  a hold rating and five have given a buy rating to the stock. CA currently has an average rating of “Hold” and an average price target of $35.10.




Shares of CA (NASDAQ CA) opened at 34.06 on Monday. The company’s 50 day moving average price is $33.34 and its 200 day moving average price is $32.43. The stock has a market capitalization of $14.23 billion, a P/E ratio of 18.41 and a beta of 0.87. CA has a one year low of $30.01 and a one year high of $36.54. 
CA (NASDAQ:CA) last released its quarterly earnings results on Thursday, May 11th. The technology company reported $0.54 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the consensus estimate of $0.49 by $0.05. The company had revenue of $1.01 billion during the quarter, compared to the consensus estimate of $996.59 million. CA had a return on equity of 17.15% and a net margin of 19.20%. The firm’s revenue was up .3% on a year-over-year basis. During the same quarter in the prior year, the company posted $0.60 EPS.  On average, equities analysts expect that  CA will post $2.38 earnings per share for the current year.

Staley Capital » About Us





 

















Management Perspectives




"The Staley Capital team was tremendously valuable on our board and as investors in NEW. Renny's experience as a private equity investor was a great asset to our company, from which we will benefit well beyond their ownership period."
Fred SchaufeldChairman and FounderNEW Customer Service




"I really trust Jeff Hurst...he picks winners and he knows how to support growth. He was able to get us together and sign up one of our most important accounts. Jeff is someone who can add strategic value on top of just making an investment."
Rob WeisbergCEOInvaluable




"Renny Smith and Philip Riese were instrumental in Parago's success. Whether I simply needed a sounding board or I was seeking their guidance on key strategic decisions, I knew their involvement would make a significant difference."
Juli SpottiswoodCEOParago, Inc.




"I have seen how this team knows marketing services. They also understand how to create value and how to empower management teams. Strategically, we were better off because of their contributions. I viewed them as my business partners - not just a source of capital."
Pat O'RahillyCEOAspen Marketing Services




"Jeff Hurst's expertise in scaling sales and marketing has been really helpful to us. He has been stalwart and strong in his support through all types of market cycles."
Jay TeichCEOSeahorse Bioscience




"There aren't many investors out there who do what Staley does in the field of retail and retail services. Staley really stood out and we were able to get into a much more sophisticated conversation much faster than with other investors."
Noah GlassFounder and CEOOlo










 

About Us
The Staley Capital team has developed and executed a successful investment strategy that matches diverse private investment and operating skills to its investment focus.
We know outstanding entrepreneurs and management teams can access numerous sources of capital in today's marketplace, but we believe we offer leaders of business services companies a different kind of long-term, value-added investor for the following reasons:
Investment Focus

We focus exclusively on business services companies – especially technology-enabled business services companies with a global delivery footprint and potentially explosive growth.
We do not pursue an investment if we don't believe we understand the vertical markets and business problems that a company addresses.

Track Record as Value-Added Investors and Operators

We have developed a clear set of criteria to evaluate whether to make an investment and to measure value creation over time. We believe this clarity has contributed significantly to our success.
We have operated as executives in the trenches, driving sales and refining product marketing, building account management teams and making investments in technology and global operations teams.

Flexible Transaction Structure

We invest growth equity to fund expansion and investments in key areas such as sales and marketing, operations and technology.
We do debt-financed buy-outs and/or recapitalizations to provide liquidity to existing shareholders.

Investment Philosophy and Approach

We are in business to create value.
We work hard to form strong relationships with the management teams we back based on mutual respect and integrity.
We stay focused on measuring outcomes of key priorities and initiatives objectively.
We are mindful of our own experience and the areas where we do not have expertise.
We aspire to be trusted advisors – asking tough questions, proposing new ideas, and focusing on "doing the right things right."

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Staley Inc carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
Staley Inc currently holds license 884728 (Electrical), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Staley Inc



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Staley Inc



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.
Staley Inc has a $12,500 bond with Travelers Casualty And Surety Company Of America. 











What else should I know before hiring Staley Inc



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
