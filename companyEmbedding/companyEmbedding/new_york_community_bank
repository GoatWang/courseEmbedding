2016 Annual Report










Stock QuoteNYSENYCBMarket Value ($M)6,362.59Change ($)0.01Change (%)0.08Volume1,821,694Stock Quote ($)13.01As of July 21, 2017 - Minimum 20 minute delay.New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE: NYCB) is one of the 25 largest bank holding 
companies in the nation, with assets of $48.8 billion and a market cap of $6.8 
billion at March 31, 2017. With deposits of $28.7 billion and 255 branches in Metro New York, 
New Jersey, Florida, Arizona, and Ohio, we also rank among the largest depositories 
in the United States. 

We operate our branches through two banks with eight local divisions, reflecting 
our growth through seven traditional mergers and two FDIC-assisted transactions 
between the years 2000 and 2010. Established in 1859, New York Community Bank is 
a New York State-chartered savings bank with 225 branches throughout our five-state 
franchise; established in 2005 and also New York State-chartered, New York Commercial 
Bank has 30 branches--all in Metro New York. 

In addition to fueling the growth of our deposit franchise, acquisitions have fueled 
the growth of our interest-earning assets and, in particular, our multi-family loans. 
We are a leading producer of multi-family loans for portfolio in New York City, 
with an emphasis on rent-regulated buildings that feature below-market rents. At 
the end of March, our portfolio totaled $27.1 billion, representing 72.5% of total 
held-for-investment loans. 

In addition to our expertise in multi-family lending, we are known for our record 
of superior asset quality. In the past 20 years—including those of the Great Recession—few 
of our non-performing assets resulted in actual losses. In fact, net charge-offs 
have represented a modest 0.04% of average loans over the course of our public life. 


We invite you to learn more about the Company, our performance, and business model 
as we continue to focus on enhancing the value of our investors’ shares.News ReleasesDateTitle6/28/2017New York Community Bancorp, Inc. to Report Second Quarter 2017 Earnings and Host Conference Call on July 26th6/27/2017New York Community Bancorp, Inc.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
