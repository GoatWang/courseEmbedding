Child Safety Product Firm Formed after near Mishap

Article excerpt

From what could have been a terrible accident in a Tulsa restaurant
two years ago, an Ada couple has formed a company that manufactures
lifesaving products for toddlers which is expected to generate sales
of up to $2 million this year.
 Leachco Inc. of Ada was formed in  May 1988 by Clyde and Jamie
Leach shortly after a harrowing incident  involving their
five-month-old son Alex.
 "We were at a restaurant  in Tulsa and we had our baby with us,"
said Jamie Leach. "They put him  a high chair, and he was slipping
and sliding around in it and he caught  his neck on the tray."
 To prevent further mishaps, she put together,  in three hours,
out of material scraps, Velcro and dental floss what  is now known as
Wiggle Wrap.
 Wiggle Wrap wraps around an infant,  much like a diaper, and
comes up just under the arm pits. The Velcro  closures hold the
child secure in high chairs, grocery shopping carts,  infant seats
and strollers, preventing him or her from slipping or falling
forwards.
 Because it's adjustable, Wiggle Wrap can be used on a  child from
infancy to the age of two.
 The curiosity Wiggle Wrap  prompted when the Leaches took their
child out in public led them to  obtaining a mechanical patent for
it, then later another patent for  Wiggle Wrap used on physically
handicapped children.
 "We formed  our business in May of 1988, then we had a booth in
the Made in Oklahoma  Building at the State Fair that year," Leach
said.
 Not only did  the Leach's display gain interest among the general
public, it lead  to a marketing arrangement with Kamber's and Streets
stores in Oklahoma  City.
 The couple decided to give up their careers to mass produce
their child safety product. Clyde Leach, who was president and
founder  of Leach Agri-Sprayers Inc., a commercial crop dusting firm,
is now  president and chief executive officer of Leachco. Jamie
Leach, a registered  nurse, is executive vice president of the
company and is responsible  for the development of new Leachco
products.
 Since the formation  of Leachco, Wiggle Wrap has become available
at JC Penney stores and  a marketing agreement has been reached with
Toys R Us - so now not only  is it in stores across Oklahoma, but
throughout the 50 states and some  foreign countries.
 Leach said Wiggle Wrap was better known initially  in Canada than
in the United States thanks to an article about the product  in a
Canadian publication entitled Entrepreneur magazine. …

Bill Passed Reducing Manufacturer Liability/by House 
By Tipton, David

Read preview




Article excerpt

An act designed to reduce the liability of product manufacturers and
sellers in civil suits to individuals who have suffered injury or
damages  through use of a given product was passed by the House of
Representatives  Wednesday by a vote of 91 to 4.
 The Products Liability Act, House  Bill 1227, now goes to the
Senate for assignment to committee. The title  of the measure was
struck so that it could eventually be considered  in conference
committee.
 According to the author, Rep. Jim Henshaw,  R-Tulsa, the measure
would codify existing case law concerning products  liability into
the state statutes.
 "This gets away from the absolute  liability of the manufacturer
and provides for a strict liability,"  Henshaw said.
 Strict liability means a manufacturer is not found  to be
completely liable if an individual suffers damages or injuries  as
the result of improper use of the manufacturer's product, he said.
 Under  the provisions of the bill, the manufacturer would be
liable to a claimant  if the claimant proves:
  -  The product was unsafe in either construction  or design.
  -  The product was unsafe because the manufacturer  failed to
provide adequate warnings or instructions about either a danger
connected with the product or about proper use of the product.
  -   The product was unsafe because it did not conform to the
warranty made  by the manufacturer. …

Cold brew coming to the office





By Dave DeWitte
TIPTON—David’s Famous Custard founder David Gott couldn’t find a producer capable of making his butterfat-rich new custard confection on contract, so he’s building a factory to do it himself.
Mr. Gott, of South Amana, is a career stockbroker who developed the product from a family recipe, found help producing small batches of David’s Famous at a University of Minnesota pilot plant and began selling it earlier this year. He is sufficiently proud that each pint carton bears his own likeness.
The rich ingredients and authentic flavorings of David’s Famous Custard work together to produce a powerful taste sensation.
“It’s almost like a gelato,” said Mark Nolte, the president of the Iowa City Area Development (ICAD) Group, which helped get David’s Famous established. “It’s so rich you don’t have to eat a lot. A spoonful or two, and you feel good about the world.”
Mr. Gott has personally approached dozens of Hy-Vee store managers to gain placement of the product in more than 27 stores, and often heads out to stores to serve up samples. At an age when many people would be contemplating retirement, Mr. Gott is having a blast.
“The really, really fun part is going to a busy grocery store and giving away samples and coming up with new flavors,” he said.
Mr. Gott said the major challenges have been attempting to find a contract producer for his product and dealing with sometimes overlapping federal and state regulatory authorities. Some ice cream producers turned him down flat, saying that they didn’t think they could produce ice cream with such high butterfat content.
Aaron Gott, one of Mr. Gott’s sons, is an attorney who serves as corporate counsel and handles regulatory issues.
“He (David) has always prided himself on making things that people can enjoy,” said Aaron, who has been writing about his experiences on the Ice Cream Lawyer blog, found on the company’s website.
Another one of Mr. Gott’s sons, Isaac Gott, will play a key role in plant operations when the facility is completed.
David’s Famous now offers five gourmet flavors – lemon, Dutch chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and sea salt and caramel. Each sells for about $5 per pint.
ICAD Group helped Famous David’s Custard apply successfully for economic development assistance from the Iowa Economic Development Authority totaling more than $125,000, and local matching assistance from the Central Iowa Power Cooperative.
Mr. Gott said ICAD Group also helped the company find the building in Tipton and get set up for electronic data interchange, which was a requirement by many retailers for tracking inventories.
The build-out of the Tipton plant has been delayed by the shipping of the plant’s flash-freezing equipment ordered from a firm in Denmark and by a major windstorm, which diverted the project’s general contractor to more urgent priorities.
David Gott approaches the challenges with the confidence of someone who believes in his product.
“I’m just a stockbroker who stumbled into something nobody else does and something the guys who do it for a living say you can’t do,” said Mr. Gott.
