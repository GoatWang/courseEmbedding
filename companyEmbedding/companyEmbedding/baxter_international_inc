Anesthesia & Critical Care

Baxter is a leading manufacturer of products for general anesthesia. These include anesthetic gases, or inhaled anesthetics, and anesthesia-related critical care drugs. 
View Products


BioSurgery

Baxter's BioSurgery business unit offers a comprehensive line of biologics, devices and combination products.
View Products


Drug Delivery

Baxter is one of the world's leading manufacturers of commercially prepared IV solutions in flexible containers. Baxter also has a range of irrigation solutions and sets to suit a wide range of patient needs.
View Products


Infusion Systems

Large Volume Pumps (LVP) are used to deliver medication and solutions through various routes (e.g. Intravenous and epidural) for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. They are designed for more accurate fluid delivery than manually adjusted gravity infusions. 
View Products


Access

Baxter's comprehensive Access portfolio includes Pump Administration sets, Gravity Sets, and ONE-LINK Neutral Displacement Needleless Connector.  Baxter’s Access portfolio offers a variety of different components and configurations to meet a broad range of clinical applications.
View Products


Enteral & Oral Syringes


View Products


IV Preparation & Compounding

It takes spikes, syringes, and pumps to make an intravenous (IV) solution. A pharmacy workflow management system and automated compounding system can help streamline pharmacy operations. Though vastly different, these tools share a basic truth. Behind every IV dose there is a pharmacist and behind every pharmacist there is the means to not only make that dose, but also support pharmacy workflow. 
View Products


Parenteral Nutrition Solutions & Additives

One size does not fit all for nutrition therapy. Prescribing practices are as unique as patient populations, and pharmacies have varying levels of nutrition compounding capability and expertise.  Baxter's leading Parenteral Nutrition Portfolio offers pharmacy technology, premixes and a comprehensive selection of macro and micronutrients to support specific requirements.

First to Review
        


There is a real problem with this company and the service.  Customer service keeps you on hold so long you have no choice but to hang up.  Currently at 23 minutes.  They need to step up their game or suffer more than the department of justice has recently given them.

History[edit]
Baxter International was founded in 1931 by Donald Baxter, a Los Angeles-based medical doctor, as a manufacturer and distributor of intravenous therapy solutions.[4] Seeing a need for products closer to the Midwest, the company opened a manufacturing plant in Glenview, Illinois, in 1933.[4] Baxter's interest was bought out in 1935 by Ralph Falk, who established a research and development function. In 1939 the company developed a vacuum-type collection container, extending the shelf life of blood from hours to weeks. In 1954, the company expanded operations outside of the United States by opening an office in Belgium. In 1956 Baxter International introduced the first functioning artificial kidney, and in 1971 became a member of the Fortune 500.
In 1971, Baxter built a major manufacturing plant in Ashdod, Israel, and as a result, the company was placed on the Arab League boycott list in the early 1980s.[5]
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the company expanded to deliver a wider variety of products and services (including vaccines, a greater variety of blood products) through acquisitions of various companies. Sales and production facilities also expanded throughout the world.[4]
In 1982, Baxter acquired Medcom, Inc., a New York-based firm founded by Richard Fuisz and his brother, that had large markets in the United States and Saudi Arabia.[6][7][8] Baxter chief executive Vernon Loucks fired Fuisz who then brought anti-boycott charges against Baxter to the U.S. Commerce Department Office of Anti-Boycott Compliance (OAC). Fuisz alleged that Baxter had sold their profitable Ashdod facility to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1988[9] while simultaneously negotiating the construction of a similar plant in Syria in partnership with the Syrian military in order to be removed from the Arab League blacklist in 1989.[5][10][11] In 1993 Baxter pleaded guilty to a felony in relation to an anti-boycott law in the United States.[9][12]
In July 15, 1985, American Hospital Supply Corporation CEO Karl D. Bays and Baxter's then-CEO Vernon R. Loucks Jr. signed an agreement that merged two of the United States' "largest producers of medical supplies".[13] This was a "one-Baxter approach" in which the company provided "70% to 80% of what a hospital needed."[14]
In 1991, Baxter's home infusion subsidiary, Caremark, "was accused by the government of paying doctors to steer patients to its intravenous drug service"[15] In 1992 Caremark spun off from Baxter International.[15] Caremark was fined $160 million for the "four-year-long federal mail-fraud and kickback" scheme in which the "home-infusion business unit made weekly payments to scores of doctors that averaged about $75 per patient for referring those patients to its services. Some doctors earned as much as $80,000 a year from the kickbacks, according to government documents."[15]
In 1996, the company entered into a four-way, $640 million settlement with haemophiliacs 1999 in relation to blood clotting concentrates that were infected with HIV.[16] Under pressure from shareholders due to poor performance and an unsuccessful merger, Loucks was forced to resign.[12]:115
Baxter acquired medical device firm Baxa on November 10, 2011.[17] In 2011, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC completed the acquisition of Baxter Healthcare Corporation's US generic injectables business (Multi-Source Injectables or MSI).[18][19]
In July 2013, EU antitrust regulators approved Baxter's bid for Sweden's Gambro.[20]
In March 2014, Baxter announced plans to create two separate, independent global health care companies—one focused on developing and marketing bio-pharmaceuticals and the other on medical products. The medical products company retained the name Baxter International Inc. and the bio-pharmaceuticals company is named Baxalta and spun-off as a new public company that showed on trading boards as of July 1, 2015.[21]
In July 2014, Baxter announced that it was exiting the vaccines business—divesting its commercial vaccine portfolio to Pfizer (with sale expected to close by the end of the year) and exploring options for its vaccines R&D program, including influenza.[22] In October 2015, José E. Almeida was named chairman and chief executive officer.[23] In January 2016 Shire PLC agreed to acquire Baxalta for $32 billion.[24]
In December 2016, Baxter announced it would acquire Claris Lifesciences injectables subsidiary, Claris Injectables, for $625 million.[25]
Former employees[edit]
During the tenure of Vernon Loucks, who was Baxter's CEO from 1980 to 1998 and chairman from 1987 to 1999, company sales "more than quadrupled to $5.7 billion while its workforce rose from 30,000 to 42,000." During that time, Loucks hired and groomed a number of staff who went on to become CEOs elsewhere. Baxter alumni groomed by Loucks included Terry Mulligan of MedAssets, Lance Piccolo at Caremark, Mike Mussallem of Edwards Lifesciences Corp and CEOs of Boston Scientific Corp. and Cardinal Health.[14]
Environmental activities[edit]
In 1997, a report produced by the company indicated that changes made to reduce environmental impacts generated savings that exceeded their cost, producing a net profit. Reporting was company-wide, with a variety of aggregation and reporting, including on the company's internet and intranet sites.[26] The company was an early joiner in the "green and greedy" movement, which aims to lessen the environmental impacts of manufacturing its products while saving the company money.[27] In 2009 the company announced it had reached a variety of its environmentally friendly goals, and that it would continue to try to reduce waste, emissions, energy use and environmental incidents over the coming years.[28]

In 2013, Baxter International spent more than $1.2 billion on research and development.[31]
Corporate governance[edit]
In 1953 William Graham became the company's CEO. Vernon Loucks became president and CEO in 1980. Loucks was forced to resign by shareholders.[12] When shareholders forced Loucks to resign,[32]

"In January, as Baxter International Inc.'s Vernon Loucks relinquished his CEO duties after 18 years, directors handed him a special stock-option grant of 950,000 shares "for the specific purposes of motivating" him "to implement a smooth transition of his responsibilities." If Mr. Loucks sells all the 400,000 shares he can exercise at year end and Baxter's stock price remains at its current level, he will make more than $4 million."
— The Wall Street April 29, 1999

Loucks was succeeded by Harry Kraemer, who was succeeded by Robert Parkinson, who took the CEO position in 2004.[4]
H1N1 vaccine[edit]
In June 2009, Baxter International announced it expected to have the first commercial vaccine for the H1N1 ("swine flu") influenza as early as July of the same year. The company has been one of several working with the World Health Organization and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the vaccine, and uses a cell-based rather than egg-based technology that allows a shorter production time.[33]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2008, Baxter launched Science@Work: Expanding Minds with Real-World Science, which supports teacher training and student development in healthcare and biotechnology in Chicago Public Schools.[34]:17
In 2013, the company was included in The Civic 50, a list of the most community-minded companies in America from The National Conference on Citizenship and Points of Light, published by Bloomberg.[35]
In 2014, roughly 6,300 Baxter employees volunteered in their communities through The Baxter International Foundation's Dollars for Doers program, addressing local concerns such as healthcare, the environment and education.[36]:104 In 2014, Baxter and The Baxter International Foundation gave over $50 million.[37]
Baxter was included for the 13th year in Corporate Responsibility magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list in 2014 for its social responsibility performance.[38]
Controversies[edit]
1975 Hemofil hepatitis B outbreak[edit]
In August 1975, Baxter / Travenol withdrew a clotting factor product Hemofil after the product was associated with an outbreak of hepatitis B.[39]
1983 prison plasma collection[edit]
Baxter, unknown to the FDA, continued to use prison plasma in factor concentrate production until October 1983, despite having entered into an agreement with the FDA (11 months earlier) that they would no longer use US prison plasma, which posed a high risk of virus transmission.[40]
1996 Japanese haemophiliac HIV lawsuit[edit]
It was announced in quarter 1 of 1996 that Baxter had agreed to settle a lawsuit involving 200 Japanese haemophilia patients who had become infected with HIV as a result of using contaminated haemophilia products which were unheated. The Japanese courts ordered for each victim to receive $411,460 by March 29 that year.[41]
2001 Althane disaster[edit]
Main article: Baxter Althane disaster
The Baxter Althane disaster in autumn 2001 was a series of 56 sudden deaths of renal failure patients in Spain, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Taiwan, Colombia and the USA (mainly Nebraska and Texas). All had received hospital treatment with Althane hemodialysis equipment, a product range manufactured by Baxter International, USA.[42][43]
2008 Chinese heparin adulteration[edit]
Main article: 2008 Chinese heparin adulteration
In 2008, the quality of blood thinning products produced by Baxter was brought into question when they were linked to 19 deaths in the United States.[44] Upon inspection, one of the raw ingredients used by Baxter was found to be contaminated – between 5 and 20 percent – with a substance that was similar, but not identical, to the ingredient itself. The company initiated a voluntary recall, temporarily suspended the manufacture of heparin, and launched an investigation.
Investigation into the contamination has focused on raw heparin produced by Changzhou Scientific Protein Laboratories, a China-based branch of Scientific Protein Laboratories, based in Waunakee, Wisconsin. Due to procedural errors, Changzhou SPL's facilities were never subjected to inspection by US FDA officials, as required by FDA regulations. In addition, Changzhou SPL's products were also never certified as safe for use in pharmaceutical products by Chinese FDA officials, due to Changzhou SPL's registration as a chemical company rather than a pharmaceutical manufacturer.[45][46][47] Though Baxter was first to recall heparin because of increased adverse reactions, after the contaminant was identified and testing protocols were shared with other manufacturers globally, over a dozen other companies in nearly a dozen countries issued recalls, which linked back to certain supply points in China.
2009 Avian flu contamination[edit]
In early 2009, samples of viral material supplied by Baxter International to a series of European laboratories were found to be contaminated with live Avian flu virus (Influenza A virus subtype H5N1).[48] Samples of the less harmful seasonal flu virus (subtype H3N2) were found to be mixed with the deadly H5N1 strain after a vaccine made from the material killed test animals in a lab in the Czech Republic. Though the serious consequences were avoided by the lab in the Czech Republic,[49] Baxter then claimed the failed controls over the distribution of the virus were 'stringent' and there was 'little chance' of the lethal virus harming humans.[50]
2009 drug cost inflation[edit]
On July 2, 2009, Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway announced a settlement between the state and Baxter Healthcare Corporation, a subsidiary of Baxter International, worth $2 million. The company had been inflating the cost of the intravenous drugs sold to Kentucky Medicaid, at times as much as 1300%.[51]
2010 hepatitis C infections[edit]
In 2010, a jury in Las Vegas, Nevada, ordered Baxter and Teva Pharmaceuticals to pay $144 million to patients who had been infected with hepatitis C after doctors wrongly reused dirty medical supplies to administer propofol to patients, although the label for propofol clearly states that it is for single-patient use only and that aseptic procedures should be used at all times.[52] Per a 2009 indemnity agreement between Teva (the manufacturer) and Baxter (acting as a distributor on behalf of Teva), the litigation and related settlements were defended and paid by Teva.[53]
2010 infusion pump recall[edit]
In 2010, Baxter was ordered by the FDA to recall all of their Colleague infusion pumps from the market due to 87 recalls and deaths associated with the pump.[54]
2008–2010 tax avoidance[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Baxter for spending $10.45 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $66 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $926 million.[55]

History[edit]
Baxter International was founded in 1931 by Donald Baxter, a Los Angeles-based medical doctor, as a manufacturer and distributor of intravenous therapy solutions.[4] Seeing a need for products closer to the Midwest, the company opened a manufacturing plant in Glenview, Illinois, in 1933.[4] Baxter's interest was bought out in 1935 by Ralph Falk, who established a research and development function. In 1939 the company developed a vacuum-type collection container, extending the shelf life of blood from hours to weeks. In 1954, the company expanded operations outside of the United States by opening an office in Belgium. In 1956 Baxter International introduced the first functioning artificial kidney, and in 1971 became a member of the Fortune 500.
In 1971, Baxter built a major manufacturing plant in Ashdod, Israel, and as a result, the company was placed on the Arab League boycott list in the early 1980s.[5]
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the company expanded to deliver a wider variety of products and services (including vaccines, a greater variety of blood products) through acquisitions of various companies. Sales and production facilities also expanded throughout the world.[4]
In 1982, Baxter acquired Medcom, Inc., a New York-based firm founded by Richard Fuisz and his brother, that had large markets in the United States and Saudi Arabia.[6][7][8] Baxter chief executive Vernon Loucks fired Fuisz who then brought anti-boycott charges against Baxter to the U.S. Commerce Department Office of Anti-Boycott Compliance (OAC). Fuisz alleged that Baxter had sold their profitable Ashdod facility to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1988[9] while simultaneously negotiating the construction of a similar plant in Syria in partnership with the Syrian military in order to be removed from the Arab League blacklist in 1989.[5][10][11] In 1993 Baxter pleaded guilty to a felony in relation to an anti-boycott law in the United States.[9][12]
In July 15, 1985, American Hospital Supply Corporation CEO Karl D. Bays and Baxter's then-CEO Vernon R. Loucks Jr. signed an agreement that merged two of the United States' "largest producers of medical supplies".[13] This was a "one-Baxter approach" in which the company provided "70% to 80% of what a hospital needed."[14]
In 1991, Baxter's home infusion subsidiary, Caremark, "was accused by the government of paying doctors to steer patients to its intravenous drug service"[15] In 1992 Caremark spun off from Baxter International.[15] Caremark was fined $160 million for the "four-year-long federal mail-fraud and kickback" scheme in which the "home-infusion business unit made weekly payments to scores of doctors that averaged about $75 per patient for referring those patients to its services. Some doctors earned as much as $80,000 a year from the kickbacks, according to government documents."[15]
In 1996, the company entered into a four-way, $640 million settlement with haemophiliacs 1999 in relation to blood clotting concentrates that were infected with HIV.[16] Under pressure from shareholders due to poor performance and an unsuccessful merger, Loucks was forced to resign.[12]:115
Baxter acquired medical device firm Baxa on November 10, 2011.[17] In 2011, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC completed the acquisition of Baxter Healthcare Corporation's US generic injectables business (Multi-Source Injectables or MSI).[18][19]
In July 2013, EU antitrust regulators approved Baxter's bid for Sweden's Gambro.[20]
In March 2014, Baxter announced plans to create two separate, independent global health care companies—one focused on developing and marketing bio-pharmaceuticals and the other on medical products. The medical products company retained the name Baxter International Inc. and the bio-pharmaceuticals company is named Baxalta and spun-off as a new public company that showed on trading boards as of July 1, 2015.[21]
In July 2014, Baxter announced that it was exiting the vaccines business—divesting its commercial vaccine portfolio to Pfizer (with sale expected to close by the end of the year) and exploring options for its vaccines R&D program, including influenza.[22] In October 2015, José E. Almeida was named chairman and chief executive officer.[23] In January 2016 Shire PLC agreed to acquire Baxalta for $32 billion.[24]
In December 2016, Baxter announced it would acquire Claris Lifesciences injectables subsidiary, Claris Injectables, for $625 million.[25]
Former employees[edit]
During the tenure of Vernon Loucks, who was Baxter's CEO from 1980 to 1998 and chairman from 1987 to 1999, company sales "more than quadrupled to $5.7 billion while its workforce rose from 30,000 to 42,000." During that time, Loucks hired and groomed a number of staff who went on to become CEOs elsewhere. Baxter alumni groomed by Loucks included Terry Mulligan of MedAssets, Lance Piccolo at Caremark, Mike Mussallem of Edwards Lifesciences Corp and CEOs of Boston Scientific Corp. and Cardinal Health.[14]
Environmental activities[edit]
In 1997, a report produced by the company indicated that changes made to reduce environmental impacts generated savings that exceeded their cost, producing a net profit. Reporting was company-wide, with a variety of aggregation and reporting, including on the company's internet and intranet sites.[26] The company was an early joiner in the "green and greedy" movement, which aims to lessen the environmental impacts of manufacturing its products while saving the company money.[27] In 2009 the company announced it had reached a variety of its environmentally friendly goals, and that it would continue to try to reduce waste, emissions, energy use and environmental incidents over the coming years.[28]

The company had 2014 sales of $16.7 billion, across two businesses: BioScience (2013 sales - $6.6 billion) and Medical Products ($8.7 billion).[1] Sales in 2013 were 42% in the United States, 30% in Europe, 16% in Asia Pacific, 12% in Latin America and Canada. In 2011, Baxter had approximately 61,500 employees. The breakdown of regional employees in 2013 was 36% in the United States; 34% in Europe; 16% in Asia Pacific; 14% in Latin America and Canada. In 2013, Baxter International spent more than $1.2 billion on research and development.[31]
Corporate governance[edit]
In 1953 William Graham became the company's CEO. Vernon Loucks became president and CEO in 1980. Loucks was forced to resign by shareholders.[12] When shareholders forced Loucks to resign,[32]

"In January, as Baxter International Inc.'s Vernon Loucks relinquished his CEO duties after 18 years, directors handed him a special stock-option grant of 950,000 shares "for the specific purposes of motivating" him "to implement a smooth transition of his responsibilities." If Mr. Loucks sells all the 400,000 shares he can exercise at year end and Baxter's stock price remains at its current level, he will make more than $4 million."
— The Wall Street April 29, 1999

Loucks was succeeded by Harry Kraemer, who was succeeded by Robert Parkinson, who took the CEO position in 2004.[4]
H1N1 vaccine[edit]
In June 2009, Baxter International announced it expected to have the first commercial vaccine for the H1N1 ("swine flu") influenza as early as July of the same year. The company has been one of several working with the World Health Organization and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the vaccine, and uses a cell-based rather than egg-based technology that allows a shorter production time.[33]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2008, Baxter launched Science@Work: Expanding Minds with Real-World Science, which supports teacher training and student development in healthcare and biotechnology in Chicago Public Schools.[34]:17
In 2013, the company was included in The Civic 50, a list of the most community-minded companies in America from The National Conference on Citizenship and Points of Light, published by Bloomberg.[35]
In 2014, roughly 6,300 Baxter employees volunteered in their communities through The Baxter International Foundation's Dollars for Doers program, addressing local concerns such as healthcare, the environment and education.[36]:104 In 2014, Baxter and The Baxter International Foundation gave over $50 million.[37]
Baxter was included for the 13th year in Corporate Responsibility magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list in 2014 for its social responsibility performance.[38]
Controversies[edit]
1975 Hemofil hepatitis B outbreak[edit]
In August 1975, Baxter / Travenol withdrew a clotting factor product Hemofil after the product was associated with an outbreak of hepatitis B.[39]
1983 prison plasma collection[edit]
Baxter, unknown to the FDA, continued to use prison plasma in factor concentrate production until October 1983, despite having entered into an agreement with the FDA (11 months earlier) that they would no longer use US prison plasma, which posed a high risk of virus transmission.[40]
1996 Japanese haemophiliac HIV lawsuit[edit]
It was announced in quarter 1 of 1996 that Baxter had agreed to settle a lawsuit involving 200 Japanese haemophilia patients who had become infected with HIV as a result of using contaminated haemophilia products which were unheated. The Japanese courts ordered for each victim to receive $411,460 by March 29 that year.[41]
2001 Althane disaster[edit]
Main article: Baxter Althane disaster
The Baxter Althane disaster in autumn 2001 was a series of 56 sudden deaths of renal failure patients in Spain, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Taiwan, Colombia and the USA (mainly Nebraska and Texas). All had received hospital treatment with Althane hemodialysis equipment, a product range manufactured by Baxter International, USA.[42][43]
2008 Chinese heparin adulteration[edit]
Main article: 2008 Chinese heparin adulteration
In 2008, the quality of blood thinning products produced by Baxter was brought into question when they were linked to 19 deaths in the United States.[44] Upon inspection, one of the raw ingredients used by Baxter was found to be contaminated – between 5 and 20 percent – with a substance that was similar, but not identical, to the ingredient itself. The company initiated a voluntary recall, temporarily suspended the manufacture of heparin, and launched an investigation.
Investigation into the contamination has focused on raw heparin produced by Changzhou Scientific Protein Laboratories, a China-based branch of Scientific Protein Laboratories, based in Waunakee, Wisconsin. Due to procedural errors, Changzhou SPL's facilities were never subjected to inspection by US FDA officials, as required by FDA regulations. In addition, Changzhou SPL's products were also never certified as safe for use in pharmaceutical products by Chinese FDA officials, due to Changzhou SPL's registration as a chemical company rather than a pharmaceutical manufacturer.[45][46][47] Though Baxter was first to recall heparin because of increased adverse reactions, after the contaminant was identified and testing protocols were shared with other manufacturers globally, over a dozen other companies in nearly a dozen countries issued recalls, which linked back to certain supply points in China.
2009 Avian flu contamination[edit]
In early 2009, samples of viral material supplied by Baxter International to a series of European laboratories were found to be contaminated with live Avian flu virus (Influenza A virus subtype H5N1).[48] Samples of the less harmful seasonal flu virus (subtype H3N2) were found to be mixed with the deadly H5N1 strain after a vaccine made from the material killed test animals in a lab in the Czech Republic. Though the serious consequences were avoided by the lab in the Czech Republic,[49] Baxter then claimed the failed controls over the distribution of the virus were 'stringent' and there was 'little chance' of the lethal virus harming humans.[50]
2009 drug cost inflation[edit]
On July 2, 2009, Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway announced a settlement between the state and Baxter Healthcare Corporation, a subsidiary of Baxter International, worth $2 million. The company had been inflating the cost of the intravenous drugs sold to Kentucky Medicaid, at times as much as 1300%.[51]
2010 hepatitis C infections[edit]
In 2010, a jury in Las Vegas, Nevada, ordered Baxter and Teva Pharmaceuticals to pay $144 million to patients who had been infected with hepatitis C after doctors wrongly reused dirty medical supplies to administer propofol to patients, although the label for propofol clearly states that it is for single-patient use only and that aseptic procedures should be used at all times.[52] Per a 2009 indemnity agreement between Teva (the manufacturer) and Baxter (acting as a distributor on behalf of Teva), the litigation and related settlements were defended and paid by Teva.[53]
2010 infusion pump recall[edit]
In 2010, Baxter was ordered by the FDA to recall all of their Colleague infusion pumps from the market due to 87 recalls and deaths associated with the pump.[54]
2008–2010 tax avoidance[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Baxter for spending $10.45 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $66 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $926 million.[55]

History[edit]
Baxter International was founded in 1931 by Donald Baxter, a Los Angeles-based medical doctor, as a manufacturer and distributor of intravenous therapy solutions.[4] Seeing a need for products closer to the Midwest, the company opened a manufacturing plant in Glenview, Illinois, in 1933.[4] Baxter's interest was bought out in 1935 by Ralph Falk, who established a research and development function. In 1939 the company developed a vacuum-type collection container, extending the shelf life of blood from hours to weeks. In 1954, the company expanded operations outside of the United States by opening an office in Belgium. In 1956 Baxter International introduced the first functioning artificial kidney, and in 1971 became a member of the Fortune 500.
In 1971, Baxter built a major manufacturing plant in Ashdod, Israel, and as a result, the company was placed on the Arab League boycott list in the early 1980s.[5]
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the company expanded to deliver a wider variety of products and services (including vaccines, a greater variety of blood products) through acquisitions of various companies. Sales and production facilities also expanded throughout the world.[4]
In 1982, Baxter acquired Medcom, Inc., a New York-based firm founded by Richard Fuisz and his brother, that had large markets in the United States and Saudi Arabia.[6][7][8] Baxter chief executive Vernon Loucks fired Fuisz who then brought anti-boycott charges against Baxter to the U.S. Commerce Department Office of Anti-Boycott Compliance (OAC). Fuisz alleged that Baxter had sold their profitable Ashdod facility to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1988[9] while simultaneously negotiating the construction of a similar plant in Syria in partnership with the Syrian military in order to be removed from the Arab League blacklist in 1989.[5][10][11] In 1993 Baxter pleaded guilty to a felony in relation to an anti-boycott law in the United States.[9][12]
In July 15, 1985, American Hospital Supply Corporation CEO Karl D. Bays and Baxter's then-CEO Vernon R. Loucks Jr. signed an agreement that merged two of the United States' "largest producers of medical supplies".[13] This was a "one-Baxter approach" in which the company provided "70% to 80% of what a hospital needed."[14]
In 1991, Baxter's home infusion subsidiary, Caremark, "was accused by the government of paying doctors to steer patients to its intravenous drug service"[15] In 1992 Caremark spun off from Baxter International.[15] Caremark was fined $160 million for the "four-year-long federal mail-fraud and kickback" scheme in which the "home-infusion business unit made weekly payments to scores of doctors that averaged about $75 per patient for referring those patients to its services. Some doctors earned as much as $80,000 a year from the kickbacks, according to government documents."[15]
In 1996, the company entered into a four-way, $640 million settlement with haemophiliacs 1999 in relation to blood clotting concentrates that were infected with HIV.[16] Under pressure from shareholders due to poor performance and an unsuccessful merger, Loucks was forced to resign.[12]:115
Baxter acquired medical device firm Baxa on November 10, 2011.[17] In 2011, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC completed the acquisition of Baxter Healthcare Corporation's US generic injectables business (Multi-Source Injectables or MSI).[18][19]
In July 2013, EU antitrust regulators approved Baxter's bid for Sweden's Gambro.[20]
In March 2014, Baxter announced plans to create two separate, independent global health care companies—one focused on developing and marketing bio-pharmaceuticals and the other on medical products. The medical products company retained the name Baxter International Inc. and the bio-pharmaceuticals company is named Baxalta and spun-off as a new public company that showed on trading boards as of July 1, 2015.[21]
In July 2014, Baxter announced that it was exiting the vaccines business—divesting its commercial vaccine portfolio to Pfizer (with sale expected to close by the end of the year) and exploring options for its vaccines R&D program, including influenza.[22] In October 2015, José E. Almeida was named chairman and chief executive officer.[23] In January 2016 Shire PLC agreed to acquire Baxalta for $32 billion.[24]
In December 2016, Baxter announced it would acquire Claris Lifesciences injectables subsidiary, Claris Injectables, for $625 million.[25]
Former employees[edit]
During the tenure of Vernon Loucks, who was Baxter's CEO from 1980 to 1998 and chairman from 1987 to 1999, company sales "more than quadrupled to $5.7 billion while its workforce rose from 30,000 to 42,000." During that time, Loucks hired and groomed a number of staff who went on to become CEOs elsewhere. Baxter alumni groomed by Loucks included Terry Mulligan of MedAssets, Lance Piccolo at Caremark, Mike Mussallem of Edwards Lifesciences Corp and CEOs of Boston Scientific Corp. and Cardinal Health.[14]
Environmental activities[edit]
In 1997, a report produced by the company indicated that changes made to reduce environmental impacts generated savings that exceeded their cost, producing a net profit. Reporting was company-wide, with a variety of aggregation and reporting, including on the company's internet and intranet sites.[26] The company was an early joiner in the "green and greedy" movement, which aims to lessen the environmental impacts of manufacturing its products while saving the company money.[27] In 2009 the company announced it had reached a variety of its environmentally friendly goals, and that it would continue to try to reduce waste, emissions, energy use and environmental incidents over the coming years.[28]

In 2013, Baxter International spent more than $1.2 billion on research and development.[31]
Corporate governance[edit]
In 1953 William Graham became the company's CEO. Vernon Loucks became president and CEO in 1980. Loucks was forced to resign by shareholders.[12] When shareholders forced Loucks to resign,[32]

"In January, as Baxter International Inc.'s Vernon Loucks relinquished his CEO duties after 18 years, directors handed him a special stock-option grant of 950,000 shares "for the specific purposes of motivating" him "to implement a smooth transition of his responsibilities." If Mr. Loucks sells all the 400,000 shares he can exercise at year end and Baxter's stock price remains at its current level, he will make more than $4 million."
— The Wall Street April 29, 1999

Loucks was succeeded by Harry Kraemer, who was succeeded by Robert Parkinson, who took the CEO position in 2004.[4]
H1N1 vaccine[edit]
In June 2009, Baxter International announced it expected to have the first commercial vaccine for the H1N1 ("swine flu") influenza as early as July of the same year. The company has been one of several working with the World Health Organization and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the vaccine, and uses a cell-based rather than egg-based technology that allows a shorter production time.[33]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2008, Baxter launched Science@Work: Expanding Minds with Real-World Science, which supports teacher training and student development in healthcare and biotechnology in Chicago Public Schools.[34]:17
In 2013, the company was included in The Civic 50, a list of the most community-minded companies in America from The National Conference on Citizenship and Points of Light, published by Bloomberg.[35]
In 2014, roughly 6,300 Baxter employees volunteered in their communities through The Baxter International Foundation's Dollars for Doers program, addressing local concerns such as healthcare, the environment and education.[36]:104 In 2014, Baxter and The Baxter International Foundation gave over $50 million.[37]
Baxter was included for the 13th year in Corporate Responsibility magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list in 2014 for its social responsibility performance.[38]
Controversies[edit]
1975 Hemofil hepatitis B outbreak[edit]
In August 1975, Baxter / Travenol withdrew a clotting factor product Hemofil after the product was associated with an outbreak of hepatitis B.[39]
1983 prison plasma collection[edit]
Baxter, unknown to the FDA, continued to use prison plasma in factor concentrate production until October 1983, despite having entered into an agreement with the FDA (11 months earlier) that they would no longer use US prison plasma, which posed a high risk of virus transmission.[40]
1996 Japanese haemophiliac HIV lawsuit[edit]
It was announced in quarter 1 of 1996 that Baxter had agreed to settle a lawsuit involving 200 Japanese haemophilia patients who had become infected with HIV as a result of using contaminated haemophilia products which were unheated. The Japanese courts ordered for each victim to receive $411,460 by March 29 that year.[41]
2001 Althane disaster[edit]
Main article: Baxter Althane disaster
The Baxter Althane disaster in autumn 2001 was a series of 56 sudden deaths of renal failure patients in Spain, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Taiwan, Colombia and the USA (mainly Nebraska and Texas). All had received hospital treatment with Althane hemodialysis equipment, a product range manufactured by Baxter International, USA.[42][43]
2008 Chinese heparin adulteration[edit]
Main article: 2008 Chinese heparin adulteration
In 2008, the quality of blood thinning products produced by Baxter was brought into question when they were linked to 19 deaths in the United States.[44] Upon inspection, one of the raw ingredients used by Baxter was found to be contaminated – between 5 and 20 percent – with a substance that was similar, but not identical, to the ingredient itself. The company initiated a voluntary recall, temporarily suspended the manufacture of heparin, and launched an investigation.
Investigation into the contamination has focused on raw heparin produced by Changzhou Scientific Protein Laboratories, a China-based branch of Scientific Protein Laboratories, based in Waunakee, Wisconsin. Due to procedural errors, Changzhou SPL's facilities were never subjected to inspection by US FDA officials, as required by FDA regulations. In addition, Changzhou SPL's products were also never certified as safe for use in pharmaceutical products by Chinese FDA officials, due to Changzhou SPL's registration as a chemical company rather than a pharmaceutical manufacturer.[45][46][47] Though Baxter was first to recall heparin because of increased adverse reactions, after the contaminant was identified and testing protocols were shared with other manufacturers globally, over a dozen other companies in nearly a dozen countries issued recalls, which linked back to certain supply points in China.
2009 Avian flu contamination[edit]
In early 2009, samples of viral material supplied by Baxter International to a series of European laboratories were found to be contaminated with live Avian flu virus (Influenza A virus subtype H5N1).[48] Samples of the less harmful seasonal flu virus (subtype H3N2) were found to be mixed with the deadly H5N1 strain after a vaccine made from the material killed test animals in a lab in the Czech Republic. Though the serious consequences were avoided by the lab in the Czech Republic,[49] Baxter then claimed the failed controls over the distribution of the virus were 'stringent' and there was 'little chance' of the lethal virus harming humans.[50]
2009 drug cost inflation[edit]
On July 2, 2009, Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway announced a settlement between the state and Baxter Healthcare Corporation, a subsidiary of Baxter International, worth $2 million. The company had been inflating the cost of the intravenous drugs sold to Kentucky Medicaid, at times as much as 1300%.[51]
2010 hepatitis C infections[edit]
In 2010, a jury in Las Vegas, Nevada, ordered Baxter and Teva Pharmaceuticals to pay $144 million to patients who had been infected with hepatitis C after doctors wrongly reused dirty medical supplies to administer propofol to patients, although the label for propofol clearly states that it is for single-patient use only and that aseptic procedures should be used at all times.[52] Per a 2009 indemnity agreement between Teva (the manufacturer) and Baxter (acting as a distributor on behalf of Teva), the litigation and related settlements were defended and paid by Teva.[53]
2010 infusion pump recall[edit]
In 2010, Baxter was ordered by the FDA to recall all of their Colleague infusion pumps from the market due to 87 recalls and deaths associated with the pump.[54]
2008–2010 tax avoidance[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Baxter for spending $10.45 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $66 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $926 million.[55]

History[edit]
Baxter International was founded in 1931 by Donald Baxter, a Los Angeles-based medical doctor, as a manufacturer and distributor of intravenous therapy solutions.[4] Seeing a need for products closer to the Midwest, the company opened a manufacturing plant in Glenview, Illinois, in 1933.[4] Baxter's interest was bought out in 1935 by Ralph Falk, who established a research and development function. In 1939 the company developed a vacuum-type collection container, extending the shelf life of blood from hours to weeks. In 1954, the company expanded operations outside of the United States by opening an office in Belgium. In 1956 Baxter International introduced the first functioning artificial kidney, and in 1971 became a member of the Fortune 500.
In 1971, Baxter built a major manufacturing plant in Ashdod, Israel, and as a result, the company was placed on the Arab League boycott list in the early 1980s.[5]
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the company expanded to deliver a wider variety of products and services (including vaccines, a greater variety of blood products) through acquisitions of various companies. Sales and production facilities also expanded throughout the world.[4]
In 1982, Baxter acquired Medcom, Inc., a New York-based firm founded by Richard Fuisz and his brother, that had large markets in the United States and Saudi Arabia.[6][7][8] Baxter chief executive Vernon Loucks fired Fuisz who then brought anti-boycott charges against Baxter to the U.S. Commerce Department Office of Anti-Boycott Compliance (OAC). Fuisz alleged that Baxter had sold their profitable Ashdod facility to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1988[9] while simultaneously negotiating the construction of a similar plant in Syria in partnership with the Syrian military in order to be removed from the Arab League blacklist in 1989.[5][10][11] In 1993 Baxter pleaded guilty to a felony in relation to an anti-boycott law in the United States.[9][12]
In July 15, 1985, American Hospital Supply Corporation CEO Karl D. Bays and Baxter's then-CEO Vernon R. Loucks Jr. signed an agreement that merged two of the United States' "largest producers of medical supplies".[13] This was a "one-Baxter approach" in which the company provided "70% to 80% of what a hospital needed."[14]
In 1991, Baxter's home infusion subsidiary, Caremark, "was accused by the government of paying doctors to steer patients to its intravenous drug service"[15] In 1992 Caremark spun off from Baxter International.[15] Caremark was fined $160 million for the "four-year-long federal mail-fraud and kickback" scheme in which the "home-infusion business unit made weekly payments to scores of doctors that averaged about $75 per patient for referring those patients to its services. Some doctors earned as much as $80,000 a year from the kickbacks, according to government documents."[15]
In 1996, the company entered into a four-way, $640 million settlement with haemophiliacs 1999 in relation to blood clotting concentrates that were infected with HIV.[16] Under pressure from shareholders due to poor performance and an unsuccessful merger, Loucks was forced to resign.[12]:115
Baxter acquired medical device firm Baxa on November 10, 2011.[17] In 2011, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC completed the acquisition of Baxter Healthcare Corporation's US generic injectables business (Multi-Source Injectables or MSI).[18][19]
In July 2013, EU antitrust regulators approved Baxter's bid for Sweden's Gambro.[20]
In March 2014, Baxter announced plans to create two separate, independent global health care companies—one focused on developing and marketing bio-pharmaceuticals and the other on medical products. The medical products company retained the name Baxter International Inc. and the bio-pharmaceuticals company is named Baxalta and spun-off as a new public company that showed on trading boards as of July 1, 2015.[21]
In July 2014, Baxter announced that it was exiting the vaccines business—divesting its commercial vaccine portfolio to Pfizer (with sale expected to close by the end of the year) and exploring options for its vaccines R&D program, including influenza.[22] In October 2015, José E. Almeida was named chairman and chief executive officer.[23] In January 2016 Shire PLC agreed to acquire Baxalta for $32 billion.[24]
In December 2016, Baxter announced it would acquire Claris Lifesciences injectables subsidiary, Claris Injectables, for $625 million.[25]
Former employees[edit]
During the tenure of Vernon Loucks, who was Baxter's CEO from 1980 to 1998 and chairman from 1987 to 1999, company sales "more than quadrupled to $5.7 billion while its workforce rose from 30,000 to 42,000." During that time, Loucks hired and groomed a number of staff who went on to become CEOs elsewhere. Baxter alumni groomed by Loucks included Terry Mulligan of MedAssets, Lance Piccolo at Caremark, Mike Mussallem of Edwards Lifesciences Corp and CEOs of Boston Scientific Corp. and Cardinal Health.[14]
Environmental activities[edit]
In 1997, a report produced by the company indicated that changes made to reduce environmental impacts generated savings that exceeded their cost, producing a net profit. Reporting was company-wide, with a variety of aggregation and reporting, including on the company's internet and intranet sites.[26] The company was an early joiner in the "green and greedy" movement, which aims to lessen the environmental impacts of manufacturing its products while saving the company money.[27] In 2009 the company announced it had reached a variety of its environmentally friendly goals, and that it would continue to try to reduce waste, emissions, energy use and environmental incidents over the coming years.[28]

Corporate governance[edit]
In 1953 William Graham became the company's CEO. Vernon Loucks became president and CEO in 1980. Loucks was forced to resign by shareholders.[12] When shareholders forced Loucks to resign,[32]

"In January, as Baxter International Inc.'s Vernon Loucks relinquished his CEO duties after 18 years, directors handed him a special stock-option grant of 950,000 shares "for the specific purposes of motivating" him "to implement a smooth transition of his responsibilities." If Mr. Loucks sells all the 400,000 shares he can exercise at year end and Baxter's stock price remains at its current level, he will make more than $4 million."
— The Wall Street April 29, 1999

Loucks was succeeded by Harry Kraemer, who was succeeded by Robert Parkinson, who took the CEO position in 2004.[4]
H1N1 vaccine[edit]
In June 2009, Baxter International announced it expected to have the first commercial vaccine for the H1N1 ("swine flu") influenza as early as July of the same year. The company has been one of several working with the World Health Organization and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the vaccine, and uses a cell-based rather than egg-based technology that allows a shorter production time.[33]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2008, Baxter launched Science@Work: Expanding Minds with Real-World Science, which supports teacher training and student development in healthcare and biotechnology in Chicago Public Schools.[34]:17
In 2013, the company was included in The Civic 50, a list of the most community-minded companies in America from The National Conference on Citizenship and Points of Light, published by Bloomberg.[35]
In 2014, roughly 6,300 Baxter employees volunteered in their communities through The Baxter International Foundation's Dollars for Doers program, addressing local concerns such as healthcare, the environment and education.[36]:104 In 2014, Baxter and The Baxter International Foundation gave over $50 million.[37]
Baxter was included for the 13th year in Corporate Responsibility magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list in 2014 for its social responsibility performance.[38]
Controversies[edit]
1975 Hemofil hepatitis B outbreak[edit]
In August 1975, Baxter / Travenol withdrew a clotting factor product Hemofil after the product was associated with an outbreak of hepatitis B.[39]
1983 prison plasma collection[edit]
Baxter, unknown to the FDA, continued to use prison plasma in factor concentrate production until October 1983, despite having entered into an agreement with the FDA (11 months earlier) that they would no longer use US prison plasma, which posed a high risk of virus transmission.[40]
1996 Japanese haemophiliac HIV lawsuit[edit]
It was announced in quarter 1 of 1996 that Baxter had agreed to settle a lawsuit involving 200 Japanese haemophilia patients who had become infected with HIV as a result of using contaminated haemophilia products which were unheated. The Japanese courts ordered for each victim to receive $411,460 by March 29 that year.[41]
2001 Althane disaster[edit]
Main article: Baxter Althane disaster
The Baxter Althane disaster in autumn 2001 was a series of 56 sudden deaths of renal failure patients in Spain, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Taiwan, Colombia and the USA (mainly Nebraska and Texas). All had received hospital treatment with Althane hemodialysis equipment, a product range manufactured by Baxter International, USA.[42][43]
2008 Chinese heparin adulteration[edit]
Main article: 2008 Chinese heparin adulteration
In 2008, the quality of blood thinning products produced by Baxter was brought into question when they were linked to 19 deaths in the United States.[44] Upon inspection, one of the raw ingredients used by Baxter was found to be contaminated – between 5 and 20 percent – with a substance that was similar, but not identical, to the ingredient itself. The company initiated a voluntary recall, temporarily suspended the manufacture of heparin, and launched an investigation.
Investigation into the contamination has focused on raw heparin produced by Changzhou Scientific Protein Laboratories, a China-based branch of Scientific Protein Laboratories, based in Waunakee, Wisconsin. Due to procedural errors, Changzhou SPL's facilities were never subjected to inspection by US FDA officials, as required by FDA regulations. In addition, Changzhou SPL's products were also never certified as safe for use in pharmaceutical products by Chinese FDA officials, due to Changzhou SPL's registration as a chemical company rather than a pharmaceutical manufacturer.[45][46][47] Though Baxter was first to recall heparin because of increased adverse reactions, after the contaminant was identified and testing protocols were shared with other manufacturers globally, over a dozen other companies in nearly a dozen countries issued recalls, which linked back to certain supply points in China.
2009 Avian flu contamination[edit]
In early 2009, samples of viral material supplied by Baxter International to a series of European laboratories were found to be contaminated with live Avian flu virus (Influenza A virus subtype H5N1).[48] Samples of the less harmful seasonal flu virus (subtype H3N2) were found to be mixed with the deadly H5N1 strain after a vaccine made from the material killed test animals in a lab in the Czech Republic. Though the serious consequences were avoided by the lab in the Czech Republic,[49] Baxter then claimed the failed controls over the distribution of the virus were 'stringent' and there was 'little chance' of the lethal virus harming humans.[50]
2009 drug cost inflation[edit]
On July 2, 2009, Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway announced a settlement between the state and Baxter Healthcare Corporation, a subsidiary of Baxter International, worth $2 million. The company had been inflating the cost of the intravenous drugs sold to Kentucky Medicaid, at times as much as 1300%.[51]
2010 hepatitis C infections[edit]
In 2010, a jury in Las Vegas, Nevada, ordered Baxter and Teva Pharmaceuticals to pay $144 million to patients who had been infected with hepatitis C after doctors wrongly reused dirty medical supplies to administer propofol to patients, although the label for propofol clearly states that it is for single-patient use only and that aseptic procedures should be used at all times.[52] Per a 2009 indemnity agreement between Teva (the manufacturer) and Baxter (acting as a distributor on behalf of Teva), the litigation and related settlements were defended and paid by Teva.[53]
2010 infusion pump recall[edit]
In 2010, Baxter was ordered by the FDA to recall all of their Colleague infusion pumps from the market due to 87 recalls and deaths associated with the pump.[54]
2008–2010 tax avoidance[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Baxter for spending $10.45 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $66 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $926 million.[55]

History[edit]
Baxter International was founded in 1931 by Donald Baxter, a Los Angeles-based medical doctor, as a manufacturer and distributor of intravenous therapy solutions.[4] Seeing a need for products closer to the Midwest, the company opened a manufacturing plant in Glenview, Illinois, in 1933.[4] Baxter's interest was bought out in 1935 by Ralph Falk, who established a research and development function. In 1939 the company developed a vacuum-type collection container, extending the shelf life of blood from hours to weeks. In 1954, the company expanded operations outside of the United States by opening an office in Belgium. In 1956 Baxter International introduced the first functioning artificial kidney, and in 1971 became a member of the Fortune 500.
In 1971, Baxter built a major manufacturing plant in Ashdod, Israel, and as a result, the company was placed on the Arab League boycott list in the early 1980s.[5]
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the company expanded to deliver a wider variety of products and services (including vaccines, a greater variety of blood products) through acquisitions of various companies. Sales and production facilities also expanded throughout the world.[4]
In 1982, Baxter acquired Medcom, Inc., a New York-based firm founded by Richard Fuisz and his brother, that had large markets in the United States and Saudi Arabia.[6][7][8] Baxter chief executive Vernon Loucks fired Fuisz who then brought anti-boycott charges against Baxter to the U.S. Commerce Department Office of Anti-Boycott Compliance (OAC). Fuisz alleged that Baxter had sold their profitable Ashdod facility to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1988[9] while simultaneously negotiating the construction of a similar plant in Syria in partnership with the Syrian military in order to be removed from the Arab League blacklist in 1989.[5][10][11] In 1993 Baxter pleaded guilty to a felony in relation to an anti-boycott law in the United States.[9][12]
In July 15, 1985, American Hospital Supply Corporation CEO Karl D. Bays and Baxter's then-CEO Vernon R. Loucks Jr. signed an agreement that merged two of the United States' "largest producers of medical supplies".[13] This was a "one-Baxter approach" in which the company provided "70% to 80% of what a hospital needed."[14]
In 1991, Baxter's home infusion subsidiary, Caremark, "was accused by the government of paying doctors to steer patients to its intravenous drug service"[15] In 1992 Caremark spun off from Baxter International.[15] Caremark was fined $160 million for the "four-year-long federal mail-fraud and kickback" scheme in which the "home-infusion business unit made weekly payments to scores of doctors that averaged about $75 per patient for referring those patients to its services. Some doctors earned as much as $80,000 a year from the kickbacks, according to government documents."[15]
In 1996, the company entered into a four-way, $640 million settlement with haemophiliacs 1999 in relation to blood clotting concentrates that were infected with HIV.[16] Under pressure from shareholders due to poor performance and an unsuccessful merger, Loucks was forced to resign.[12]:115
Baxter acquired medical device firm Baxa on November 10, 2011.[17] In 2011, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC completed the acquisition of Baxter Healthcare Corporation's US generic injectables business (Multi-Source Injectables or MSI).[18][19]
In July 2013, EU antitrust regulators approved Baxter's bid for Sweden's Gambro.[20]
In March 2014, Baxter announced plans to create two separate, independent global health care companies—one focused on developing and marketing bio-pharmaceuticals and the other on medical products. The medical products company retained the name Baxter International Inc. and the bio-pharmaceuticals company is named Baxalta and spun-off as a new public company that showed on trading boards as of July 1, 2015.[21]
In July 2014, Baxter announced that it was exiting the vaccines business—divesting its commercial vaccine portfolio to Pfizer (with sale expected to close by the end of the year) and exploring options for its vaccines R&D program, including influenza.[22] In October 2015, José E. Almeida was named chairman and chief executive officer.[23] In January 2016 Shire PLC agreed to acquire Baxalta for $32 billion.[24]
In December 2016, Baxter announced it would acquire Claris Lifesciences injectables subsidiary, Claris Injectables, for $625 million.[25]
Former employees[edit]
During the tenure of Vernon Loucks, who was Baxter's CEO from 1980 to 1998 and chairman from 1987 to 1999, company sales "more than quadrupled to $5.7 billion while its workforce rose from 30,000 to 42,000." During that time, Loucks hired and groomed a number of staff who went on to become CEOs elsewhere. Baxter alumni groomed by Loucks included Terry Mulligan of MedAssets, Lance Piccolo at Caremark, Mike Mussallem of Edwards Lifesciences Corp and CEOs of Boston Scientific Corp. and Cardinal Health.[14]
Environmental activities[edit]
In 1997, a report produced by the company indicated that changes made to reduce environmental impacts generated savings that exceeded their cost, producing a net profit. Reporting was company-wide, with a variety of aggregation and reporting, including on the company's internet and intranet sites.[26] The company was an early joiner in the "green and greedy" movement, which aims to lessen the environmental impacts of manufacturing its products while saving the company money.[27] In 2009 the company announced it had reached a variety of its environmentally friendly goals, and that it would continue to try to reduce waste, emissions, energy use and environmental incidents over the coming years.[28]

In 2011, Baxter had approximately 61,500 employees. The breakdown of regional employees in 2013 was 36% in the United States; 34% in Europe; 16% in Asia Pacific; 14% in Latin America and Canada. In 2013, Baxter International spent more than $1.2 billion on research and development.[31]
Corporate governance[edit]
In 1953 William Graham became the company's CEO. Vernon Loucks became president and CEO in 1980. Loucks was forced to resign by shareholders.[12] When shareholders forced Loucks to resign,[32]

"In January, as Baxter International Inc.'s Vernon Loucks relinquished his CEO duties after 18 years, directors handed him a special stock-option grant of 950,000 shares "for the specific purposes of motivating" him "to implement a smooth transition of his responsibilities." If Mr. Loucks sells all the 400,000 shares he can exercise at year end and Baxter's stock price remains at its current level, he will make more than $4 million."
— The Wall Street April 29, 1999

Loucks was succeeded by Harry Kraemer, who was succeeded by Robert Parkinson, who took the CEO position in 2004.[4]
H1N1 vaccine[edit]
In June 2009, Baxter International announced it expected to have the first commercial vaccine for the H1N1 ("swine flu") influenza as early as July of the same year. The company has been one of several working with the World Health Organization and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the vaccine, and uses a cell-based rather than egg-based technology that allows a shorter production time.[33]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2008, Baxter launched Science@Work: Expanding Minds with Real-World Science, which supports teacher training and student development in healthcare and biotechnology in Chicago Public Schools.[34]:17
In 2013, the company was included in The Civic 50, a list of the most community-minded companies in America from The National Conference on Citizenship and Points of Light, published by Bloomberg.[35]
In 2014, roughly 6,300 Baxter employees volunteered in their communities through The Baxter International Foundation's Dollars for Doers program, addressing local concerns such as healthcare, the environment and education.[36]:104 In 2014, Baxter and The Baxter International Foundation gave over $50 million.[37]
Baxter was included for the 13th year in Corporate Responsibility magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list in 2014 for its social responsibility performance.[38]
Controversies[edit]
1975 Hemofil hepatitis B outbreak[edit]
In August 1975, Baxter / Travenol withdrew a clotting factor product Hemofil after the product was associated with an outbreak of hepatitis B.[39]
1983 prison plasma collection[edit]
Baxter, unknown to the FDA, continued to use prison plasma in factor concentrate production until October 1983, despite having entered into an agreement with the FDA (11 months earlier) that they would no longer use US prison plasma, which posed a high risk of virus transmission.[40]
1996 Japanese haemophiliac HIV lawsuit[edit]
It was announced in quarter 1 of 1996 that Baxter had agreed to settle a lawsuit involving 200 Japanese haemophilia patients who had become infected with HIV as a result of using contaminated haemophilia products which were unheated. The Japanese courts ordered for each victim to receive $411,460 by March 29 that year.[41]
2001 Althane disaster[edit]
Main article: Baxter Althane disaster
The Baxter Althane disaster in autumn 2001 was a series of 56 sudden deaths of renal failure patients in Spain, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Taiwan, Colombia and the USA (mainly Nebraska and Texas). All had received hospital treatment with Althane hemodialysis equipment, a product range manufactured by Baxter International, USA.[42][43]
2008 Chinese heparin adulteration[edit]
Main article: 2008 Chinese heparin adulteration
In 2008, the quality of blood thinning products produced by Baxter was brought into question when they were linked to 19 deaths in the United States.[44] Upon inspection, one of the raw ingredients used by Baxter was found to be contaminated – between 5 and 20 percent – with a substance that was similar, but not identical, to the ingredient itself. The company initiated a voluntary recall, temporarily suspended the manufacture of heparin, and launched an investigation.
Investigation into the contamination has focused on raw heparin produced by Changzhou Scientific Protein Laboratories, a China-based branch of Scientific Protein Laboratories, based in Waunakee, Wisconsin. Due to procedural errors, Changzhou SPL's facilities were never subjected to inspection by US FDA officials, as required by FDA regulations. In addition, Changzhou SPL's products were also never certified as safe for use in pharmaceutical products by Chinese FDA officials, due to Changzhou SPL's registration as a chemical company rather than a pharmaceutical manufacturer.[45][46][47] Though Baxter was first to recall heparin because of increased adverse reactions, after the contaminant was identified and testing protocols were shared with other manufacturers globally, over a dozen other companies in nearly a dozen countries issued recalls, which linked back to certain supply points in China.
2009 Avian flu contamination[edit]
In early 2009, samples of viral material supplied by Baxter International to a series of European laboratories were found to be contaminated with live Avian flu virus (Influenza A virus subtype H5N1).[48] Samples of the less harmful seasonal flu virus (subtype H3N2) were found to be mixed with the deadly H5N1 strain after a vaccine made from the material killed test animals in a lab in the Czech Republic. Though the serious consequences were avoided by the lab in the Czech Republic,[49] Baxter then claimed the failed controls over the distribution of the virus were 'stringent' and there was 'little chance' of the lethal virus harming humans.[50]
2009 drug cost inflation[edit]
On July 2, 2009, Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway announced a settlement between the state and Baxter Healthcare Corporation, a subsidiary of Baxter International, worth $2 million. The company had been inflating the cost of the intravenous drugs sold to Kentucky Medicaid, at times as much as 1300%.[51]
2010 hepatitis C infections[edit]
In 2010, a jury in Las Vegas, Nevada, ordered Baxter and Teva Pharmaceuticals to pay $144 million to patients who had been infected with hepatitis C after doctors wrongly reused dirty medical supplies to administer propofol to patients, although the label for propofol clearly states that it is for single-patient use only and that aseptic procedures should be used at all times.[52] Per a 2009 indemnity agreement between Teva (the manufacturer) and Baxter (acting as a distributor on behalf of Teva), the litigation and related settlements were defended and paid by Teva.[53]
2010 infusion pump recall[edit]
In 2010, Baxter was ordered by the FDA to recall all of their Colleague infusion pumps from the market due to 87 recalls and deaths associated with the pump.[54]
2008–2010 tax avoidance[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Baxter for spending $10.45 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $66 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $926 million.[55]

History[edit]
Baxter International was founded in 1931 by Donald Baxter, a Los Angeles-based medical doctor, as a manufacturer and distributor of intravenous therapy solutions.[4] Seeing a need for products closer to the Midwest, the company opened a manufacturing plant in Glenview, Illinois, in 1933.[4] Baxter's interest was bought out in 1935 by Ralph Falk, who established a research and development function. In 1939 the company developed a vacuum-type collection container, extending the shelf life of blood from hours to weeks. In 1954, the company expanded operations outside of the United States by opening an office in Belgium. In 1956 Baxter International introduced the first functioning artificial kidney, and in 1971 became a member of the Fortune 500.
In 1971, Baxter built a major manufacturing plant in Ashdod, Israel, and as a result, the company was placed on the Arab League boycott list in the early 1980s.[5]
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the company expanded to deliver a wider variety of products and services (including vaccines, a greater variety of blood products) through acquisitions of various companies. Sales and production facilities also expanded throughout the world.[4]
In 1982, Baxter acquired Medcom, Inc., a New York-based firm founded by Richard Fuisz and his brother, that had large markets in the United States and Saudi Arabia.[6][7][8] Baxter chief executive Vernon Loucks fired Fuisz who then brought anti-boycott charges against Baxter to the U.S. Commerce Department Office of Anti-Boycott Compliance (OAC). Fuisz alleged that Baxter had sold their profitable Ashdod facility to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1988[9] while simultaneously negotiating the construction of a similar plant in Syria in partnership with the Syrian military in order to be removed from the Arab League blacklist in 1989.[5][10][11] In 1993 Baxter pleaded guilty to a felony in relation to an anti-boycott law in the United States.[9][12]
In July 15, 1985, American Hospital Supply Corporation CEO Karl D. Bays and Baxter's then-CEO Vernon R. Loucks Jr. signed an agreement that merged two of the United States' "largest producers of medical supplies".[13] This was a "one-Baxter approach" in which the company provided "70% to 80% of what a hospital needed."[14]
In 1991, Baxter's home infusion subsidiary, Caremark, "was accused by the government of paying doctors to steer patients to its intravenous drug service"[15] In 1992 Caremark spun off from Baxter International.[15] Caremark was fined $160 million for the "four-year-long federal mail-fraud and kickback" scheme in which the "home-infusion business unit made weekly payments to scores of doctors that averaged about $75 per patient for referring those patients to its services. Some doctors earned as much as $80,000 a year from the kickbacks, according to government documents."[15]
In 1996, the company entered into a four-way, $640 million settlement with haemophiliacs 1999 in relation to blood clotting concentrates that were infected with HIV.[16] Under pressure from shareholders due to poor performance and an unsuccessful merger, Loucks was forced to resign.[12]:115
Baxter acquired medical device firm Baxa on November 10, 2011.[17] In 2011, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC completed the acquisition of Baxter Healthcare Corporation's US generic injectables business (Multi-Source Injectables or MSI).[18][19]
In July 2013, EU antitrust regulators approved Baxter's bid for Sweden's Gambro.[20]
In March 2014, Baxter announced plans to create two separate, independent global health care companies—one focused on developing and marketing bio-pharmaceuticals and the other on medical products. The medical products company retained the name Baxter International Inc. and the bio-pharmaceuticals company is named Baxalta and spun-off as a new public company that showed on trading boards as of July 1, 2015.[21]
In July 2014, Baxter announced that it was exiting the vaccines business—divesting its commercial vaccine portfolio to Pfizer (with sale expected to close by the end of the year) and exploring options for its vaccines R&D program, including influenza.[22] In October 2015, José E. Almeida was named chairman and chief executive officer.[23] In January 2016 Shire PLC agreed to acquire Baxalta for $32 billion.[24]
In December 2016, Baxter announced it would acquire Claris Lifesciences injectables subsidiary, Claris Injectables, for $625 million.[25]
Former employees[edit]
During the tenure of Vernon Loucks, who was Baxter's CEO from 1980 to 1998 and chairman from 1987 to 1999, company sales "more than quadrupled to $5.7 billion while its workforce rose from 30,000 to 42,000." During that time, Loucks hired and groomed a number of staff who went on to become CEOs elsewhere. Baxter alumni groomed by Loucks included Terry Mulligan of MedAssets, Lance Piccolo at Caremark, Mike Mussallem of Edwards Lifesciences Corp and CEOs of Boston Scientific Corp. and Cardinal Health.[14]
Environmental activities[edit]
In 1997, a report produced by the company indicated that changes made to reduce environmental impacts generated savings that exceeded their cost, producing a net profit. Reporting was company-wide, with a variety of aggregation and reporting, including on the company's internet and intranet sites.[26] The company was an early joiner in the "green and greedy" movement, which aims to lessen the environmental impacts of manufacturing its products while saving the company money.[27] In 2009 the company announced it had reached a variety of its environmentally friendly goals, and that it would continue to try to reduce waste, emissions, energy use and environmental incidents over the coming years.[28]

The company had 2014 sales of $16.7 billion, across two businesses: BioScience (2013 sales - $6.6 billion) and Medical Products ($8.7 billion).[1] Sales in 2013 were 42% in the United States, 30% in Europe, 16% in Asia Pacific, 12% in Latin America and Canada. In 2011, Baxter had approximately 61,500 employees. The breakdown of regional employees in 2013 was 36% in the United States; 34% in Europe; 16% in Asia Pacific; 14% in Latin America and Canada. In 2013, Baxter International spent more than $1.2 billion on research and development.[31]
Corporate governance[edit]
In 1953 William Graham became the company's CEO. Vernon Loucks became president and CEO in 1980. Loucks was forced to resign by shareholders.[12] When shareholders forced Loucks to resign,[32]

"In January, as Baxter International Inc.'s Vernon Loucks relinquished his CEO duties after 18 years, directors handed him a special stock-option grant of 950,000 shares "for the specific purposes of motivating" him "to implement a smooth transition of his responsibilities." If Mr. Loucks sells all the 400,000 shares he can exercise at year end and Baxter's stock price remains at its current level, he will make more than $4 million."
— The Wall Street April 29, 1999

Loucks was succeeded by Harry Kraemer, who was succeeded by Robert Parkinson, who took the CEO position in 2004.[4]
H1N1 vaccine[edit]
In June 2009, Baxter International announced it expected to have the first commercial vaccine for the H1N1 ("swine flu") influenza as early as July of the same year. The company has been one of several working with the World Health Organization and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the vaccine, and uses a cell-based rather than egg-based technology that allows a shorter production time.[33]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2008, Baxter launched Science@Work: Expanding Minds with Real-World Science, which supports teacher training and student development in healthcare and biotechnology in Chicago Public Schools.[34]:17
In 2013, the company was included in The Civic 50, a list of the most community-minded companies in America from The National Conference on Citizenship and Points of Light, published by Bloomberg.[35]
In 2014, roughly 6,300 Baxter employees volunteered in their communities through The Baxter International Foundation's Dollars for Doers program, addressing local concerns such as healthcare, the environment and education.[36]:104 In 2014, Baxter and The Baxter International Foundation gave over $50 million.[37]
Baxter was included for the 13th year in Corporate Responsibility magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list in 2014 for its social responsibility performance.[38]
Controversies[edit]
1975 Hemofil hepatitis B outbreak[edit]
In August 1975, Baxter / Travenol withdrew a clotting factor product Hemofil after the product was associated with an outbreak of hepatitis B.[39]
1983 prison plasma collection[edit]
Baxter, unknown to the FDA, continued to use prison plasma in factor concentrate production until October 1983, despite having entered into an agreement with the FDA (11 months earlier) that they would no longer use US prison plasma, which posed a high risk of virus transmission.[40]
1996 Japanese haemophiliac HIV lawsuit[edit]
It was announced in quarter 1 of 1996 that Baxter had agreed to settle a lawsuit involving 200 Japanese haemophilia patients who had become infected with HIV as a result of using contaminated haemophilia products which were unheated. The Japanese courts ordered for each victim to receive $411,460 by March 29 that year.[41]
2001 Althane disaster[edit]
Main article: Baxter Althane disaster
The Baxter Althane disaster in autumn 2001 was a series of 56 sudden deaths of renal failure patients in Spain, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Taiwan, Colombia and the USA (mainly Nebraska and Texas). All had received hospital treatment with Althane hemodialysis equipment, a product range manufactured by Baxter International, USA.[42][43]
2008 Chinese heparin adulteration[edit]
Main article: 2008 Chinese heparin adulteration
In 2008, the quality of blood thinning products produced by Baxter was brought into question when they were linked to 19 deaths in the United States.[44] Upon inspection, one of the raw ingredients used by Baxter was found to be contaminated – between 5 and 20 percent – with a substance that was similar, but not identical, to the ingredient itself. The company initiated a voluntary recall, temporarily suspended the manufacture of heparin, and launched an investigation.
Investigation into the contamination has focused on raw heparin produced by Changzhou Scientific Protein Laboratories, a China-based branch of Scientific Protein Laboratories, based in Waunakee, Wisconsin. Due to procedural errors, Changzhou SPL's facilities were never subjected to inspection by US FDA officials, as required by FDA regulations. In addition, Changzhou SPL's products were also never certified as safe for use in pharmaceutical products by Chinese FDA officials, due to Changzhou SPL's registration as a chemical company rather than a pharmaceutical manufacturer.[45][46][47] Though Baxter was first to recall heparin because of increased adverse reactions, after the contaminant was identified and testing protocols were shared with other manufacturers globally, over a dozen other companies in nearly a dozen countries issued recalls, which linked back to certain supply points in China.
2009 Avian flu contamination[edit]
In early 2009, samples of viral material supplied by Baxter International to a series of European laboratories were found to be contaminated with live Avian flu virus (Influenza A virus subtype H5N1).[48] Samples of the less harmful seasonal flu virus (subtype H3N2) were found to be mixed with the deadly H5N1 strain after a vaccine made from the material killed test animals in a lab in the Czech Republic. Though the serious consequences were avoided by the lab in the Czech Republic,[49] Baxter then claimed the failed controls over the distribution of the virus were 'stringent' and there was 'little chance' of the lethal virus harming humans.[50]
2009 drug cost inflation[edit]
On July 2, 2009, Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway announced a settlement between the state and Baxter Healthcare Corporation, a subsidiary of Baxter International, worth $2 million. The company had been inflating the cost of the intravenous drugs sold to Kentucky Medicaid, at times as much as 1300%.[51]
2010 hepatitis C infections[edit]
In 2010, a jury in Las Vegas, Nevada, ordered Baxter and Teva Pharmaceuticals to pay $144 million to patients who had been infected with hepatitis C after doctors wrongly reused dirty medical supplies to administer propofol to patients, although the label for propofol clearly states that it is for single-patient use only and that aseptic procedures should be used at all times.[52] Per a 2009 indemnity agreement between Teva (the manufacturer) and Baxter (acting as a distributor on behalf of Teva), the litigation and related settlements were defended and paid by Teva.[53]
2010 infusion pump recall[edit]
In 2010, Baxter was ordered by the FDA to recall all of their Colleague infusion pumps from the market due to 87 recalls and deaths associated with the pump.[54]
2008–2010 tax avoidance[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Baxter for spending $10.45 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $66 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $926 million.[55]

Company Also Recognized for the 4th Consecutive Year as One of the 50 
      Most Community-Minded Companies in the United States by Points of Light



      Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX), a global medical products 
      company, today announced the publication of its 18th annual 
      corporate responsibility report. Entitled Making a Meaningful 
      Difference, the report details Baxter’s commitment to delivering 
      environmental, social and economic value to the communities and 
      constituencies the company serves in support of its mission to “Save and 
      Sustain Lives.”
    

      Baxter was also recently recognized for the fourth consecutive year as 
      one of the 50 most community-minded companies in the United States by 
      Points of Light, the world’s largest organization dedicated to volunteer 
      service. The 
      Civic 50 provides a national standard for superior corporate 
      citizenship and showcases how companies can use their time, skills and 
      other resources to improve the quality of life in the communities where 
      they do business.
    

      “Our corporate responsibility priorities are tightly integrated with our 
      strategic imperatives as a healthcare leader, adding greater dimension 
      to how we bring our mission to life,” said Baxter Chairman and Chief 
      Executive Officer José (Joe) E. Almeida. “Even as we transform as a 
      business, we are tireless in our efforts to expand access to quality 
      care, reduce our environmental footprint, advance STEM education, 
      promote an inclusive workplace, and ultimately make a difference for the 
      communities and constituencies we serve.”
    

      This year's report, which is available at www.Baxter.com/responsibility, 
      outlines the company’s corporate responsibility strategy and highlights 
      progress toward Baxter’s 2020 corporate responsibility goals. Areas of 
      focus include employee health and safety; community service; product 
      innovation; access to care; operations; ethics and compliance; 
      responsible procurement and logistics; and workplace culture.
    

      2016 Highlights include:
    

        Operations: Baxter decreased plastic waste by more than 535 metric 
        tons; achieved a 67% recycling rate; reduced its use of PVC by 145 
        metric tons; and reduced its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions footprint 
        by 6% from 2015
      

        Responsible Procurement and Logistics: The company’s total worldwide 
        GHG emissions from product transport equaled 336,000 metric tons 
        carbon dioxide equivalent, a 25% decrease from 2015; additionally, the 
        company converted approximately 30% of its road freight to rail during 
        the year
      

        Serving Our Communities: Baxter and the Baxter International 
        Foundation donated more than $27 million in product, cash and grants 
        to help increase access to healthcare and support causes that matter 
        to employees globally
      

        Employee Health and Safety: More than 14,000 employees logged over 
        165,000 hours of exercise as part of the BeWell@Baxter Exercise 
        Challenge, a 29% increase over 2015
      

      In recognition of the company’s broader efforts to advance corporate 
      responsibility, Baxter has been included on the Dow Jones Sustainability 
      Index for 17 consecutive years. The company has also been recognized as 
      a Best Place to Work by the Human Rights Campaign. Baxter achieved an A- 
      on its CDP Climate Change score; and is recognized as an EPA Green Power 
      Partner for being the 23rd largest corporate purchaser of 
      renewable energy in the United States. For more information about recent 
      recognition visit: http://www.baxter.com/awards.

About BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC.

A medical products manufacturer,  Baxter International is a leading producer of intravenous (IV) fluids and systems. It also makes infusion pumps, pre-filled syringes, biological sealants, and inhaled anesthetics, as well as dialyzers and other products for the treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In 2015 Baxter split its operations into two companies -- one focused on biopharmaceuticals (Baxalta) and the other on medical products (Baxter).
The company traces its roots back to 1931, when it was founded as an intravenous  products maker.
Operations

   Baxter operates in two primary segments -- Hospital Products and Renal. The Hospital Products segment, which accounts for about two-thirds of total revenue, makes IV solutions and administration sets, pre-filled syringes and vials for injectables, IV nutrition products, pre-mixed drugs and drug reconstitution systems, infusion pumps, inhalation anesthetics, and biosurgery instruments. It also provides services related to pharmacy compounding (customized drug preparation) and drug formulation.
  

   The Renal segment provides products and services to help treat ESRD, or irreversible kidney failure, and acute kidney injuries. Its portfolio includes therapies for peritoneal dialysis, in-center and home hemodialysis, continuous renal replacement therapy, and other dialysis services.
  

   The group's subsidiaries include Baxter Colorado, Baxter World trade, Baxter Corporation, and Gambro.
  
Geographic Reach

   Baxter earns 60% of its annual revenues from sales in international markets. The company has about 50 manufacturing locations in about 25 countries, as well as more than 100 distribution centers and sales operations in over 100 countries around the globe. Primary operating regions outside the US include Canada, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia/Pacific regions.
  

   The company maintains 13 manufacturing sites in the US, including three in Puerto Rico. It operates R&D centers around the world, including facilities in Austria, Belgium, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Sweden, and the US.
  
Sales and Marketing

   The company markets its products to hospitals, nursing homes, dialysis centers, medical and research laboratories, and other health care centers, as well as to physicians and patients themselves. Baxter uses a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors and wholesalers. In the US, third parties such as Cardinal Health warehouse and ship much of Baxter's products through their distribution centers.
  
Financial Performance

   By keeping its operations diverse and nimble, Baxter has generally kept its revenues on the rise. However, as a result of the spin-off of the Baxalta operations in 2015, revenue declined 40% to $10 billion. Net income, which has been fluctuating, also declined that year. It fell 61% to $968 million -- again due to the lower revenue related to the Baxalta separation.
  

   Cash flow from operations fell 49% to $1.7 billion in 2015 as a result of the reduced net income. A $52 million legal settlement that year and payments related to a debt tender offer that summer also impacted cash flow.
  
Strategy

   The strategic objectives of Baxter include advancing its core product portfolio (including international expansion into new markets), driving innovation through research and development, growing through collaborations and acquisitions, and establishing public-private partnerships with government agencies (primarily for hemophilia, renal dialysis, and plasma therapies).
  

   The company announced in 2014 that it would divide into two separate companies focused on developing biopharmaceuticals (Baxalta) and on life-saving medical products (Baxter). The separation was completed in mid-2015.
  

   During 2015, the company invested $911 million towards the production of dialysis and IV solutions. Baxter is also focused on improving its cost structure and manufacturing capabilities,. In 2012 Baxter announced that it would expand capacity of its plasma-based medicines by building a new manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia. The plant is expected to cost more than $1 billion over a period of five years and will open in 2018. In 2014 Baxter announced plans to build an R&D center in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
  

   In 2014, the company received FDA approval of BAXJECT III, a reconstitution system for ADVATE that reduces the number of steps in the reconstitution process for hemophilia A patients. The system also received approval in Europe, and it was granted approval for ADVATE in Turkey and Russia. Other approvals that year included HYQVIA (treating adult immunodeficiency), OBIZUR (for adult-acquired hemophilia A), RIXUBIS (pediatric hemophilia B), and FLEXBUMIN 5% (human albumin). In 2015 the FDA approved the company's PHOXILLUM Renal Replacement Solutions (BK4/2.5 and B22K4/0) and antibacterial injection Cefazolin.
  

   Baxter has launched restructuring programs to offset some problems in recent years, including product recalls and harsh competitive conditions in some markets.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   In late 2016, Baxter agreed to buy India-based Claris Injectables from Claris Lifesciences for approximately $625 million. With that purchase, the company will gain capabilities in the production of generic injectable medicines. Baxter will also gain a portfolio of development and marketed injectables, including 11 US-approved molecules. Post-merger, the company expects to launch between seven and nine new products annually.

Price and Consensus View photosBaxter International Inc. Price and Consensus | Baxter International Inc. QuoteGrowth DriversThe latest 52-week high came on the back of the company’s impressive product pipeline. The company has launched a new version of its AK 98 hemodialysis (HD) system to help dialysis providers minimize the operational challenges associated with hemodialysis.Baxter International also recently achieved a regulatory milestone for its advanced dialysis technology. The company received guidance from the FDA clarifying the regulatory pathway for its home peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution system to improve patient access to home dialysis.Notably, Baxter International’s home solution system is the first known technology designed to reduce storage and weight handling requirements that come with traditional PD therapy.

History[edit]
Baxter International was founded in 1931 by Donald Baxter, a Los Angeles-based medical doctor, as a manufacturer and distributor of intravenous therapy solutions.[4] Seeing a need for products closer to the Midwest, the company opened a manufacturing plant in Glenview, Illinois, in 1933.[4] Baxter's interest was bought out in 1935 by Ralph Falk, who established a research and development function. In 1939 the company developed a vacuum-type collection container, extending the shelf life of blood from hours to weeks. In 1954, the company expanded operations outside of the United States by opening an office in Belgium. In 1956 Baxter International introduced the first functioning artificial kidney, and in 1971 became a member of the Fortune 500.
In 1971, Baxter built a major manufacturing plant in Ashdod, Israel, and as a result, the company was placed on the Arab League boycott list in the early 1980s.[5]
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the company expanded to deliver a wider variety of products and services (including vaccines, a greater variety of blood products) through acquisitions of various companies. Sales and production facilities also expanded throughout the world.[4]
In 1982, Baxter acquired Medcom, Inc., a New York-based firm founded by Richard Fuisz and his brother, that had large markets in the United States and Saudi Arabia.[6][7][8] Baxter chief executive Vernon Loucks fired Fuisz who then brought anti-boycott charges against Baxter to the U.S. Commerce Department Office of Anti-Boycott Compliance (OAC). Fuisz alleged that Baxter had sold their profitable Ashdod facility to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1988[9] while simultaneously negotiating the construction of a similar plant in Syria in partnership with the Syrian military in order to be removed from the Arab League blacklist in 1989.[5][10][11] In 1993 Baxter pleaded guilty to a felony in relation to an anti-boycott law in the United States.[9][12]
In July 15, 1985, American Hospital Supply Corporation CEO Karl D. Bays and Baxter's then-CEO Vernon R. Loucks Jr. signed an agreement that merged two of the United States' "largest producers of medical supplies".[13] This was a "one-Baxter approach" in which the company provided "70% to 80% of what a hospital needed."[14]
In 1991, Baxter's home infusion subsidiary, Caremark, "was accused by the government of paying doctors to steer patients to its intravenous drug service"[15] In 1992 Caremark spun off from Baxter International.[15] Caremark was fined $160 million for the "four-year-long federal mail-fraud and kickback" scheme in which the "home-infusion business unit made weekly payments to scores of doctors that averaged about $75 per patient for referring those patients to its services. Some doctors earned as much as $80,000 a year from the kickbacks, according to government documents."[15]
In 1996, the company entered into a four-way, $640 million settlement with haemophiliacs 1999 in relation to blood clotting concentrates that were infected with HIV.[16] Under pressure from shareholders due to poor performance and an unsuccessful merger, Loucks was forced to resign.[12]:115
Baxter acquired medical device firm Baxa on November 10, 2011.[17] In 2011, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC completed the acquisition of Baxter Healthcare Corporation's US generic injectables business (Multi-Source Injectables or MSI).[18][19]
In July 2013, EU antitrust regulators approved Baxter's bid for Sweden's Gambro.[20]
In March 2014, Baxter announced plans to create two separate, independent global health care companies—one focused on developing and marketing bio-pharmaceuticals and the other on medical products. The medical products company retained the name Baxter International Inc. and the bio-pharmaceuticals company is named Baxalta and spun-off as a new public company that showed on trading boards as of July 1, 2015.[21]
In July 2014, Baxter announced that it was exiting the vaccines business—divesting its commercial vaccine portfolio to Pfizer (with sale expected to close by the end of the year) and exploring options for its vaccines R&D program, including influenza.[22] In October 2015, José E. Almeida was named chairman and chief executive officer.[23] In January 2016 Shire PLC agreed to acquire Baxalta for $32 billion.[24]
In December 2016, Baxter announced it would acquire Claris Lifesciences injectables subsidiary, Claris Injectables, for $625 million.[25]
Former employees[edit]
During the tenure of Vernon Loucks, who was Baxter's CEO from 1980 to 1998 and chairman from 1987 to 1999, company sales "more than quadrupled to $5.7 billion while its workforce rose from 30,000 to 42,000." During that time, Loucks hired and groomed a number of staff who went on to become CEOs elsewhere. Baxter alumni groomed by Loucks included Terry Mulligan of MedAssets, Lance Piccolo at Caremark, Mike Mussallem of Edwards Lifesciences Corp and CEOs of Boston Scientific Corp. and Cardinal Health.[14]
Environmental activities[edit]
In 1997, a report produced by the company indicated that changes made to reduce environmental impacts generated savings that exceeded their cost, producing a net profit. Reporting was company-wide, with a variety of aggregation and reporting, including on the company's internet and intranet sites.[26] The company was an early joiner in the "green and greedy" movement, which aims to lessen the environmental impacts of manufacturing its products while saving the company money.[27] In 2009 the company announced it had reached a variety of its environmentally friendly goals, and that it would continue to try to reduce waste, emissions, energy use and environmental incidents over the coming years.[28]

In 2011, Baxter had approximately 61,500 employees. The breakdown of regional employees in 2013 was 36% in the United States; 34% in Europe; 16% in Asia Pacific; 14% in Latin America and Canada. In 2013, Baxter International spent more than $1.2 billion on research and development.[31]
Corporate governance[edit]
In 1953 William Graham became the company's CEO. Vernon Loucks became president and CEO in 1980. Loucks was forced to resign by shareholders.[12] When shareholders forced Loucks to resign,[32]

"In January, as Baxter International Inc.'s Vernon Loucks relinquished his CEO duties after 18 years, directors handed him a special stock-option grant of 950,000 shares "for the specific purposes of motivating" him "to implement a smooth transition of his responsibilities." If Mr. Loucks sells all the 400,000 shares he can exercise at year end and Baxter's stock price remains at its current level, he will make more than $4 million."
— The Wall Street April 29, 1999

Loucks was succeeded by Harry Kraemer, who was succeeded by Robert Parkinson, who took the CEO position in 2004.[4]
H1N1 vaccine[edit]
In June 2009, Baxter International announced it expected to have the first commercial vaccine for the H1N1 ("swine flu") influenza as early as July of the same year. The company has been one of several working with the World Health Organization and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the vaccine, and uses a cell-based rather than egg-based technology that allows a shorter production time.[33]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2008, Baxter launched Science@Work: Expanding Minds with Real-World Science, which supports teacher training and student development in healthcare and biotechnology in Chicago Public Schools.[34]:17
In 2013, the company was included in The Civic 50, a list of the most community-minded companies in America from The National Conference on Citizenship and Points of Light, published by Bloomberg.[35]
In 2014, roughly 6,300 Baxter employees volunteered in their communities through The Baxter International Foundation's Dollars for Doers program, addressing local concerns such as healthcare, the environment and education.[36]:104 In 2014, Baxter and The Baxter International Foundation gave over $50 million.[37]
Baxter was included for the 13th year in Corporate Responsibility magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list in 2014 for its social responsibility performance.[38]
Controversies[edit]
1975 Hemofil hepatitis B outbreak[edit]
In August 1975, Baxter / Travenol withdrew a clotting factor product Hemofil after the product was associated with an outbreak of hepatitis B.[39]
1983 prison plasma collection[edit]
Baxter, unknown to the FDA, continued to use prison plasma in factor concentrate production until October 1983, despite having entered into an agreement with the FDA (11 months earlier) that they would no longer use US prison plasma, which posed a high risk of virus transmission.[40]
1996 Japanese haemophiliac HIV lawsuit[edit]
It was announced in quarter 1 of 1996 that Baxter had agreed to settle a lawsuit involving 200 Japanese haemophilia patients who had become infected with HIV as a result of using contaminated haemophilia products which were unheated. The Japanese courts ordered for each victim to receive $411,460 by March 29 that year.[41]
2001 Althane disaster[edit]
Main article: Baxter Althane disaster
The Baxter Althane disaster in autumn 2001 was a series of 56 sudden deaths of renal failure patients in Spain, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Taiwan, Colombia and the USA (mainly Nebraska and Texas). All had received hospital treatment with Althane hemodialysis equipment, a product range manufactured by Baxter International, USA.[42][43]
2008 Chinese heparin adulteration[edit]
Main article: 2008 Chinese heparin adulteration
In 2008, the quality of blood thinning products produced by Baxter was brought into question when they were linked to 19 deaths in the United States.[44] Upon inspection, one of the raw ingredients used by Baxter was found to be contaminated – between 5 and 20 percent – with a substance that was similar, but not identical, to the ingredient itself. The company initiated a voluntary recall, temporarily suspended the manufacture of heparin, and launched an investigation.
Investigation into the contamination has focused on raw heparin produced by Changzhou Scientific Protein Laboratories, a China-based branch of Scientific Protein Laboratories, based in Waunakee, Wisconsin. Due to procedural errors, Changzhou SPL's facilities were never subjected to inspection by US FDA officials, as required by FDA regulations. In addition, Changzhou SPL's products were also never certified as safe for use in pharmaceutical products by Chinese FDA officials, due to Changzhou SPL's registration as a chemical company rather than a pharmaceutical manufacturer.[45][46][47] Though Baxter was first to recall heparin because of increased adverse reactions, after the contaminant was identified and testing protocols were shared with other manufacturers globally, over a dozen other companies in nearly a dozen countries issued recalls, which linked back to certain supply points in China.
2009 Avian flu contamination[edit]
In early 2009, samples of viral material supplied by Baxter International to a series of European laboratories were found to be contaminated with live Avian flu virus (Influenza A virus subtype H5N1).[48] Samples of the less harmful seasonal flu virus (subtype H3N2) were found to be mixed with the deadly H5N1 strain after a vaccine made from the material killed test animals in a lab in the Czech Republic. Though the serious consequences were avoided by the lab in the Czech Republic,[49] Baxter then claimed the failed controls over the distribution of the virus were 'stringent' and there was 'little chance' of the lethal virus harming humans.[50]
2009 drug cost inflation[edit]
On July 2, 2009, Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway announced a settlement between the state and Baxter Healthcare Corporation, a subsidiary of Baxter International, worth $2 million. The company had been inflating the cost of the intravenous drugs sold to Kentucky Medicaid, at times as much as 1300%.[51]
2010 hepatitis C infections[edit]
In 2010, a jury in Las Vegas, Nevada, ordered Baxter and Teva Pharmaceuticals to pay $144 million to patients who had been infected with hepatitis C after doctors wrongly reused dirty medical supplies to administer propofol to patients, although the label for propofol clearly states that it is for single-patient use only and that aseptic procedures should be used at all times.[52] Per a 2009 indemnity agreement between Teva (the manufacturer) and Baxter (acting as a distributor on behalf of Teva), the litigation and related settlements were defended and paid by Teva.[53]
2010 infusion pump recall[edit]
In 2010, Baxter was ordered by the FDA to recall all of their Colleague infusion pumps from the market due to 87 recalls and deaths associated with the pump.[54]
2008–2010 tax avoidance[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Baxter for spending $10.45 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $66 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $926 million.[55]

Baxter International was founded in 1931 by Donald Baxter, a Los Angeles-based medical doctor, as a manufacturer and distributor of intravenous therapy solutions.[4] Seeing a need for products closer to the Midwest, the company opened a manufacturing plant in Glenview, Illinois, in 1933.[4] Baxter's interest was bought out in 1935 by Ralph Falk, who established a research and development function. In 1939 the company developed a vacuum-type collection container, extending the shelf life of blood from hours to weeks. In 1954, the company expanded operations outside of the United States by opening an office in Belgium. In 1956 Baxter International introduced the first functioning artificial kidney, and in 1971 became a member of the Fortune 500.
In 1971, Baxter built a major manufacturing plant in Ashdod, Israel, and as a result, the company was placed on the Arab League boycott list in the early 1980s.[5]
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the company expanded to deliver a wider variety of products and services (including vaccines, a greater variety of blood products) through acquisitions of various companies. Sales and production facilities also expanded throughout the world.[4]
In 1982, Baxter acquired Medcom, Inc., a New York-based firm founded by Richard Fuisz and his brother, that had large markets in the United States and Saudi Arabia.[6][7][8] Baxter chief executive Vernon Loucks fired Fuisz who then brought anti-boycott charges against Baxter to the U.S. Commerce Department Office of Anti-Boycott Compliance (OAC). Fuisz alleged that Baxter had sold their profitable Ashdod facility to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1988[9] while simultaneously negotiating the construction of a similar plant in Syria in partnership with the Syrian military in order to be removed from the Arab League blacklist in 1989.[5][10][11] In 1993 Baxter pleaded guilty to a felony in relation to an anti-boycott law in the United States.[9][12]
In July 15, 1985, American Hospital Supply Corporation CEO Karl D. Bays and Baxter's then-CEO Vernon R. Loucks Jr. signed an agreement that merged two of the United States' "largest producers of medical supplies".[13] This was a "one-Baxter approach" in which the company provided "70% to 80% of what a hospital needed."[14]
In 1991, Baxter's home infusion subsidiary, Caremark, "was accused by the government of paying doctors to steer patients to its intravenous drug service"[15] In 1992 Caremark spun off from Baxter International.[15] Caremark was fined $160 million for the "four-year-long federal mail-fraud and kickback" scheme in which the "home-infusion business unit made weekly payments to scores of doctors that averaged about $75 per patient for referring those patients to its services. Some doctors earned as much as $80,000 a year from the kickbacks, according to government documents."[15]
In 1996, the company entered into a four-way, $640 million settlement with haemophiliacs 1999 in relation to blood clotting concentrates that were infected with HIV.[16] Under pressure from shareholders due to poor performance and an unsuccessful merger, Loucks was forced to resign.[12]:115
Baxter acquired medical device firm Baxa on November 10, 2011.[17] In 2011, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC completed the acquisition of Baxter Healthcare Corporation's US generic injectables business (Multi-Source Injectables or MSI).[18][19]
In July 2013, EU antitrust regulators approved Baxter's bid for Sweden's Gambro.[20]
In March 2014, Baxter announced plans to create two separate, independent global health care companies—one focused on developing and marketing bio-pharmaceuticals and the other on medical products. The medical products company retained the name Baxter International Inc. and the bio-pharmaceuticals company is named Baxalta and spun-off as a new public company that showed on trading boards as of July 1, 2015.[21]
In July 2014, Baxter announced that it was exiting the vaccines business—divesting its commercial vaccine portfolio to Pfizer (with sale expected to close by the end of the year) and exploring options for its vaccines R&D program, including influenza.[22] In October 2015, José E. Almeida was named chairman and chief executive officer.[23] In January 2016 Shire PLC agreed to acquire Baxalta for $32 billion.[24]
In December 2016, Baxter announced it would acquire Claris Lifesciences injectables subsidiary, Claris Injectables, for $625 million.[25]
Former employees[edit]
During the tenure of Vernon Loucks, who was Baxter's CEO from 1980 to 1998 and chairman from 1987 to 1999, company sales "more than quadrupled to $5.7 billion while its workforce rose from 30,000 to 42,000." During that time, Loucks hired and groomed a number of staff who went on to become CEOs elsewhere. Baxter alumni groomed by Loucks included Terry Mulligan of MedAssets, Lance Piccolo at Caremark, Mike Mussallem of Edwards Lifesciences Corp and CEOs of Boston Scientific Corp. and Cardinal Health.[14]
Environmental activities[edit]
In 1997, a report produced by the company indicated that changes made to reduce environmental impacts generated savings that exceeded their cost, producing a net profit. Reporting was company-wide, with a variety of aggregation and reporting, including on the company's internet and intranet sites.[26] The company was an early joiner in the "green and greedy" movement, which aims to lessen the environmental impacts of manufacturing its products while saving the company money.[27] In 2009 the company announced it had reached a variety of its environmentally friendly goals, and that it would continue to try to reduce waste, emissions, energy use and environmental incidents over the coming years.[28]

Corporate governance[edit]
In 1953 William Graham became the company's CEO. Vernon Loucks became president and CEO in 1980. Loucks was forced to resign by shareholders.[12] When shareholders forced Loucks to resign,[32]

"In January, as Baxter International Inc.'s Vernon Loucks relinquished his CEO duties after 18 years, directors handed him a special stock-option grant of 950,000 shares "for the specific purposes of motivating" him "to implement a smooth transition of his responsibilities." If Mr. Loucks sells all the 400,000 shares he can exercise at year end and Baxter's stock price remains at its current level, he will make more than $4 million."
— The Wall Street April 29, 1999

Loucks was succeeded by Harry Kraemer, who was succeeded by Robert Parkinson, who took the CEO position in 2004.[4]
H1N1 vaccine[edit]
In June 2009, Baxter International announced it expected to have the first commercial vaccine for the H1N1 ("swine flu") influenza as early as July of the same year. The company has been one of several working with the World Health Organization and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the vaccine, and uses a cell-based rather than egg-based technology that allows a shorter production time.[33]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2008, Baxter launched Science@Work: Expanding Minds with Real-World Science, which supports teacher training and student development in healthcare and biotechnology in Chicago Public Schools.[34]:17
In 2013, the company was included in The Civic 50, a list of the most community-minded companies in America from The National Conference on Citizenship and Points of Light, published by Bloomberg.[35]
In 2014, roughly 6,300 Baxter employees volunteered in their communities through The Baxter International Foundation's Dollars for Doers program, addressing local concerns such as healthcare, the environment and education.[36]:104 In 2014, Baxter and The Baxter International Foundation gave over $50 million.[37]
Baxter was included for the 13th year in Corporate Responsibility magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list in 2014 for its social responsibility performance.[38]
Controversies[edit]
1975 Hemofil hepatitis B outbreak[edit]
In August 1975, Baxter / Travenol withdrew a clotting factor product Hemofil after the product was associated with an outbreak of hepatitis B.[39]
1983 prison plasma collection[edit]
Baxter, unknown to the FDA, continued to use prison plasma in factor concentrate production until October 1983, despite having entered into an agreement with the FDA (11 months earlier) that they would no longer use US prison plasma, which posed a high risk of virus transmission.[40]
1996 Japanese haemophiliac HIV lawsuit[edit]
It was announced in quarter 1 of 1996 that Baxter had agreed to settle a lawsuit involving 200 Japanese haemophilia patients who had become infected with HIV as a result of using contaminated haemophilia products which were unheated. The Japanese courts ordered for each victim to receive $411,460 by March 29 that year.[41]
2001 Althane disaster[edit]
Main article: Baxter Althane disaster
The Baxter Althane disaster in autumn 2001 was a series of 56 sudden deaths of renal failure patients in Spain, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Taiwan, Colombia and the USA (mainly Nebraska and Texas). All had received hospital treatment with Althane hemodialysis equipment, a product range manufactured by Baxter International, USA.[42][43]
2008 Chinese heparin adulteration[edit]
Main article: 2008 Chinese heparin adulteration
In 2008, the quality of blood thinning products produced by Baxter was brought into question when they were linked to 19 deaths in the United States.[44] Upon inspection, one of the raw ingredients used by Baxter was found to be contaminated – between 5 and 20 percent – with a substance that was similar, but not identical, to the ingredient itself. The company initiated a voluntary recall, temporarily suspended the manufacture of heparin, and launched an investigation.
Investigation into the contamination has focused on raw heparin produced by Changzhou Scientific Protein Laboratories, a China-based branch of Scientific Protein Laboratories, based in Waunakee, Wisconsin. Due to procedural errors, Changzhou SPL's facilities were never subjected to inspection by US FDA officials, as required by FDA regulations. In addition, Changzhou SPL's products were also never certified as safe for use in pharmaceutical products by Chinese FDA officials, due to Changzhou SPL's registration as a chemical company rather than a pharmaceutical manufacturer.[45][46][47] Though Baxter was first to recall heparin because of increased adverse reactions, after the contaminant was identified and testing protocols were shared with other manufacturers globally, over a dozen other companies in nearly a dozen countries issued recalls, which linked back to certain supply points in China.
2009 Avian flu contamination[edit]
In early 2009, samples of viral material supplied by Baxter International to a series of European laboratories were found to be contaminated with live Avian flu virus (Influenza A virus subtype H5N1).[48] Samples of the less harmful seasonal flu virus (subtype H3N2) were found to be mixed with the deadly H5N1 strain after a vaccine made from the material killed test animals in a lab in the Czech Republic. Though the serious consequences were avoided by the lab in the Czech Republic,[49] Baxter then claimed the failed controls over the distribution of the virus were 'stringent' and there was 'little chance' of the lethal virus harming humans.[50]
2009 drug cost inflation[edit]
On July 2, 2009, Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway announced a settlement between the state and Baxter Healthcare Corporation, a subsidiary of Baxter International, worth $2 million. The company had been inflating the cost of the intravenous drugs sold to Kentucky Medicaid, at times as much as 1300%.[51]
2010 hepatitis C infections[edit]
In 2010, a jury in Las Vegas, Nevada, ordered Baxter and Teva Pharmaceuticals to pay $144 million to patients who had been infected with hepatitis C after doctors wrongly reused dirty medical supplies to administer propofol to patients, although the label for propofol clearly states that it is for single-patient use only and that aseptic procedures should be used at all times.[52] Per a 2009 indemnity agreement between Teva (the manufacturer) and Baxter (acting as a distributor on behalf of Teva), the litigation and related settlements were defended and paid by Teva.[53]
2010 infusion pump recall[edit]
In 2010, Baxter was ordered by the FDA to recall all of their Colleague infusion pumps from the market due to 87 recalls and deaths associated with the pump.[54]
2008–2010 tax avoidance[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Baxter for spending $10.45 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $66 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $926 million.[55]

History[edit]
Baxter International was founded in 1931 by Donald Baxter, a Los Angeles-based medical doctor, as a manufacturer and distributor of intravenous therapy solutions.[4] Seeing a need for products closer to the Midwest, the company opened a manufacturing plant in Glenview, Illinois, in 1933.[4] Baxter's interest was bought out in 1935 by Ralph Falk, who established a research and development function. In 1939 the company developed a vacuum-type collection container, extending the shelf life of blood from hours to weeks. In 1954, the company expanded operations outside of the United States by opening an office in Belgium. In 1956 Baxter International introduced the first functioning artificial kidney, and in 1971 became a member of the Fortune 500.
In 1971, Baxter built a major manufacturing plant in Ashdod, Israel, and as a result, the company was placed on the Arab League boycott list in the early 1980s.[5]
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the company expanded to deliver a wider variety of products and services (including vaccines, a greater variety of blood products) through acquisitions of various companies. Sales and production facilities also expanded throughout the world.[4]
In 1982, Baxter acquired Medcom, Inc., a New York-based firm founded by Richard Fuisz and his brother, that had large markets in the United States and Saudi Arabia.[6][7][8] Baxter chief executive Vernon Loucks fired Fuisz who then brought anti-boycott charges against Baxter to the U.S. Commerce Department Office of Anti-Boycott Compliance (OAC). Fuisz alleged that Baxter had sold their profitable Ashdod facility to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1988[9] while simultaneously negotiating the construction of a similar plant in Syria in partnership with the Syrian military in order to be removed from the Arab League blacklist in 1989.[5][10][11] In 1993 Baxter pleaded guilty to a felony in relation to an anti-boycott law in the United States.[9][12]
In July 15, 1985, American Hospital Supply Corporation CEO Karl D. Bays and Baxter's then-CEO Vernon R. Loucks Jr. signed an agreement that merged two of the United States' "largest producers of medical supplies".[13] This was a "one-Baxter approach" in which the company provided "70% to 80% of what a hospital needed."[14]
In 1991, Baxter's home infusion subsidiary, Caremark, "was accused by the government of paying doctors to steer patients to its intravenous drug service"[15] In 1992 Caremark spun off from Baxter International.[15] Caremark was fined $160 million for the "four-year-long federal mail-fraud and kickback" scheme in which the "home-infusion business unit made weekly payments to scores of doctors that averaged about $75 per patient for referring those patients to its services. Some doctors earned as much as $80,000 a year from the kickbacks, according to government documents."[15]
In 1996, the company entered into a four-way, $640 million settlement with haemophiliacs 1999 in relation to blood clotting concentrates that were infected with HIV.[16] Under pressure from shareholders due to poor performance and an unsuccessful merger, Loucks was forced to resign.[12]:115
Baxter acquired medical device firm Baxa on November 10, 2011.[17] In 2011, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC completed the acquisition of Baxter Healthcare Corporation's US generic injectables business (Multi-Source Injectables or MSI).[18][19]
In July 2013, EU antitrust regulators approved Baxter's bid for Sweden's Gambro.[20]
In March 2014, Baxter announced plans to create two separate, independent global health care companies—one focused on developing and marketing bio-pharmaceuticals and the other on medical products. The medical products company retained the name Baxter International Inc. and the bio-pharmaceuticals company is named Baxalta and spun-off as a new public company that showed on trading boards as of July 1, 2015.[21]
In July 2014, Baxter announced that it was exiting the vaccines business—divesting its commercial vaccine portfolio to Pfizer (with sale expected to close by the end of the year) and exploring options for its vaccines R&D program, including influenza.[22] In October 2015, José E. Almeida was named chairman and chief executive officer.[23] In January 2016 Shire PLC agreed to acquire Baxalta for $32 billion.[24]
In December 2016, Baxter announced it would acquire Claris Lifesciences injectables subsidiary, Claris Injectables, for $625 million.[25]
Former employees[edit]
During the tenure of Vernon Loucks, who was Baxter's CEO from 1980 to 1998 and chairman from 1987 to 1999, company sales "more than quadrupled to $5.7 billion while its workforce rose from 30,000 to 42,000." During that time, Loucks hired and groomed a number of staff who went on to become CEOs elsewhere. Baxter alumni groomed by Loucks included Terry Mulligan of MedAssets, Lance Piccolo at Caremark, Mike Mussallem of Edwards Lifesciences Corp and CEOs of Boston Scientific Corp. and Cardinal Health.[14]
Environmental activities[edit]
In 1997, a report produced by the company indicated that changes made to reduce environmental impacts generated savings that exceeded their cost, producing a net profit. Reporting was company-wide, with a variety of aggregation and reporting, including on the company's internet and intranet sites.[26] The company was an early joiner in the "green and greedy" movement, which aims to lessen the environmental impacts of manufacturing its products while saving the company money.[27] In 2009 the company announced it had reached a variety of its environmentally friendly goals, and that it would continue to try to reduce waste, emissions, energy use and environmental incidents over the coming years.[28]

The company had 2014 sales of $16.7 billion, across two businesses: BioScience (2013 sales - $6.6 billion) and Medical Products ($8.7 billion).[1] Sales in 2013 were 42% in the United States, 30% in Europe, 16% in Asia Pacific, 12% in Latin America and Canada. In 2011, Baxter had approximately 61,500 employees. The breakdown of regional employees in 2013 was 36% in the United States; 34% in Europe; 16% in Asia Pacific; 14% in Latin America and Canada. In 2013, Baxter International spent more than $1.2 billion on research and development.[31]
Corporate governance[edit]
In 1953 William Graham became the company's CEO. Vernon Loucks became president and CEO in 1980. Loucks was forced to resign by shareholders.[12] When shareholders forced Loucks to resign,[32]

"In January, as Baxter International Inc.'s Vernon Loucks relinquished his CEO duties after 18 years, directors handed him a special stock-option grant of 950,000 shares "for the specific purposes of motivating" him "to implement a smooth transition of his responsibilities." If Mr. Loucks sells all the 400,000 shares he can exercise at year end and Baxter's stock price remains at its current level, he will make more than $4 million."
— The Wall Street April 29, 1999

Loucks was succeeded by Harry Kraemer, who was succeeded by Robert Parkinson, who took the CEO position in 2004.[4]
H1N1 vaccine[edit]
In June 2009, Baxter International announced it expected to have the first commercial vaccine for the H1N1 ("swine flu") influenza as early as July of the same year. The company has been one of several working with the World Health Organization and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the vaccine, and uses a cell-based rather than egg-based technology that allows a shorter production time.[33]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2008, Baxter launched Science@Work: Expanding Minds with Real-World Science, which supports teacher training and student development in healthcare and biotechnology in Chicago Public Schools.[34]:17
In 2013, the company was included in The Civic 50, a list of the most community-minded companies in America from The National Conference on Citizenship and Points of Light, published by Bloomberg.[35]
In 2014, roughly 6,300 Baxter employees volunteered in their communities through The Baxter International Foundation's Dollars for Doers program, addressing local concerns such as healthcare, the environment and education.[36]:104 In 2014, Baxter and The Baxter International Foundation gave over $50 million.[37]
Baxter was included for the 13th year in Corporate Responsibility magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list in 2014 for its social responsibility performance.[38]
Controversies[edit]
1975 Hemofil hepatitis B outbreak[edit]
In August 1975, Baxter / Travenol withdrew a clotting factor product Hemofil after the product was associated with an outbreak of hepatitis B.[39]
1983 prison plasma collection[edit]
Baxter, unknown to the FDA, continued to use prison plasma in factor concentrate production until October 1983, despite having entered into an agreement with the FDA (11 months earlier) that they would no longer use US prison plasma, which posed a high risk of virus transmission.[40]
1996 Japanese haemophiliac HIV lawsuit[edit]
It was announced in quarter 1 of 1996 that Baxter had agreed to settle a lawsuit involving 200 Japanese haemophilia patients who had become infected with HIV as a result of using contaminated haemophilia products which were unheated. The Japanese courts ordered for each victim to receive $411,460 by March 29 that year.[41]
2001 Althane disaster[edit]
Main article: Baxter Althane disaster
The Baxter Althane disaster in autumn 2001 was a series of 56 sudden deaths of renal failure patients in Spain, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Taiwan, Colombia and the USA (mainly Nebraska and Texas). All had received hospital treatment with Althane hemodialysis equipment, a product range manufactured by Baxter International, USA.[42][43]
2008 Chinese heparin adulteration[edit]
Main article: 2008 Chinese heparin adulteration
In 2008, the quality of blood thinning products produced by Baxter was brought into question when they were linked to 19 deaths in the United States.[44] Upon inspection, one of the raw ingredients used by Baxter was found to be contaminated – between 5 and 20 percent – with a substance that was similar, but not identical, to the ingredient itself. The company initiated a voluntary recall, temporarily suspended the manufacture of heparin, and launched an investigation.
Investigation into the contamination has focused on raw heparin produced by Changzhou Scientific Protein Laboratories, a China-based branch of Scientific Protein Laboratories, based in Waunakee, Wisconsin. Due to procedural errors, Changzhou SPL's facilities were never subjected to inspection by US FDA officials, as required by FDA regulations. In addition, Changzhou SPL's products were also never certified as safe for use in pharmaceutical products by Chinese FDA officials, due to Changzhou SPL's registration as a chemical company rather than a pharmaceutical manufacturer.[45][46][47] Though Baxter was first to recall heparin because of increased adverse reactions, after the contaminant was identified and testing protocols were shared with other manufacturers globally, over a dozen other companies in nearly a dozen countries issued recalls, which linked back to certain supply points in China.
2009 Avian flu contamination[edit]
In early 2009, samples of viral material supplied by Baxter International to a series of European laboratories were found to be contaminated with live Avian flu virus (Influenza A virus subtype H5N1).[48] Samples of the less harmful seasonal flu virus (subtype H3N2) were found to be mixed with the deadly H5N1 strain after a vaccine made from the material killed test animals in a lab in the Czech Republic. Though the serious consequences were avoided by the lab in the Czech Republic,[49] Baxter then claimed the failed controls over the distribution of the virus were 'stringent' and there was 'little chance' of the lethal virus harming humans.[50]
2009 drug cost inflation[edit]
On July 2, 2009, Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway announced a settlement between the state and Baxter Healthcare Corporation, a subsidiary of Baxter International, worth $2 million. The company had been inflating the cost of the intravenous drugs sold to Kentucky Medicaid, at times as much as 1300%.[51]
2010 hepatitis C infections[edit]
In 2010, a jury in Las Vegas, Nevada, ordered Baxter and Teva Pharmaceuticals to pay $144 million to patients who had been infected with hepatitis C after doctors wrongly reused dirty medical supplies to administer propofol to patients, although the label for propofol clearly states that it is for single-patient use only and that aseptic procedures should be used at all times.[52] Per a 2009 indemnity agreement between Teva (the manufacturer) and Baxter (acting as a distributor on behalf of Teva), the litigation and related settlements were defended and paid by Teva.[53]
2010 infusion pump recall[edit]
In 2010, Baxter was ordered by the FDA to recall all of their Colleague infusion pumps from the market due to 87 recalls and deaths associated with the pump.[54]
2008–2010 tax avoidance[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Baxter for spending $10.45 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $66 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $926 million.[55]
