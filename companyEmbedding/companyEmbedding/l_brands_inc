Associates
In all we do, we lead with our values: working to improve the lives we touch. We strive to win – to win as a business, win for our associates, customers and stakeholders.  But it matters how we play the game.  We believe in our associates, giving back to our communities and putting the customer first. It’s reflective of the moment in 1969 when our founder and chairman, Les Wexner, took the company public with just six stores … a show of confidence in the business and a commitment to giving associates ownership in the success they help to create. That optimism about our future continues today as Les and a team of more than 88,000 associates take our $12.7 billion company into a new era of growth in the U.S. and around the globe.

L Brands is a great place to be.  And NOW is a great time to be here.

L BRANDS, INC. at a Glance


Uppers

Well-known brands like Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works continue to drive revenue



Downers

Economic downturn has consumers buying less
High turn-over in the stores through natural attrition



The Bottom Line

Limited Brands is an international company that sells lingerie, personal care and beauty products, apparel and accessories through its Victoria’s Secret, Pink, Bath & Body Works, La Senza, C.O. Bigelow, White Barn Candle Co. and Henri Bendel catalogs and stores.







About L BRANDS, INC.

   L Brands (formerly Limited Brands) is as much of a shopping-mall mainstay as food courts and teenagers. The company operates 3,005 specialty stores in North America and the UK primarily under the Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works (BBW), and La Senza (in Canada) banners, as well as corresponding websites and catalogs. Originally focused on apparel, L Brands sold its ailing Limited and Express chains -- leaving the company free to focus on two core businesses: Victoria's Secret and BBW. L Brands also owns apparel importer MAST Industries, accessories boutique operator Henri Bendel, apothecary C.O. Bigelow, and The White Barn Candle Co.
   Operations

   In conjunction with the name change, the company also realigned its reportable segments into Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works (BBW), and Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works International. About 60% of sales come from domestic Victoria's Secret stores driven by its eponymous and PINK brands. Nearly a third of sales come from the BBW segment, which also includes White Barn Candle and C.O. Bigelow brands.
  

   MAST Industries (dba Mast Global Fashions) is the company's production, sourcing and logistics arm - it accounts for the rest of sales. Mast is one of the world's largest contract manufacturers, importers, and distributors of apparel. Mast has manufacturing operations and joint ventures in more than a dozen countries including China, Israel, Mexico, and Sri Lanka.
  

   The Victoria's Secret segment sells women's intimate and other apparel, personal care and beauty products under the Victoria's Secret and PINK brand names.
  

   The Bath & Body Works segment sells personal care, soaps, sanitizers and home fragrance products under the Bath & Body Works, White Barn Candle Company, C.O. Bigelow and other brand names.
  

   Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segments include the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works company-owned and partner-operated stores.
  
Geographic Reach

   In addition to its 3,005 US stores, L Brands has retail stores in Canada, the UK, and the Middle East. International sales totaled $1.31 billion in fiscal 2016 (ended January), about 11% of L Brands' total. L Brands has a partnership with M.H. Alshaya (a popular franchise partner for many American retailers, including American Eagle Outfitters and Pottery Barn) to operate stores in the Middle East.
  
Sales and Marketing

   L Brands spent $414 million on advertising expenses in fiscal 2016, down from $436 million and $452 million in  2015 and 2014, respectively.
  

   The company sells its La Senza products at more than 120 La Senza stores in Canada and online at www.LaSenza.com.
  
Financial Performance

   The company's net revenues have been increasing over the last five years. In fiscal 2016 L Brands' net revenues increased by 6% due to increase in all of its segments, particularly Victoria's Secret.
  

   Victoria's Secret segment revenues increased due to higher Victoria's Secret Stores and Victoria's Secret Direct sales, resulting from the performance of PINK brands, core lingerie and sport driven by a compelling merchandise assortment that incorporated newness, innovation and fashion, as well as in-store execution.
  

   In fiscal 2016, the company's net income increased by 20% due to higher net revenues and other income driven by a pre-tax gain due to the divestiture of remaining ownership interest in third-party apparel sourcing business to Sycamore Partners.
  

   L Brands' operating cash inflow increased by 5% to $1.87 billion compared to $1.79 billion in fiscal 2015.
  
Strategy

   The company's goal was for Victoria's Secret to blossom into a $10-billion brand, but the global financial crisis, decline in consumer confidence, and poor performance of the La Senza business in Canada conspired to delay the growth strategy for the bra-and-panty business. The strategy at Victoria's Secret is to capture the teen and college-age female customer with its youth-oriented PINK brand, with the hope that as she matures she will shop for sexier styles, such as Angels and Very Sexy, sold in Victoria's Secret stores. PINK is sold in freestanding stores as well as Victoria's Secret shops. While the retailer doesn't break out PINK sales, the brand is meeting stiff competition from American Eagle's Aerie brand and Gilly Hicks by Abercrombie & Fitch. Both target the youth market. L Brands has been closing La Senza stores and repositioning the brand.
  

   Going forward, L Brands intends to continue international expansion but focus primarily on expanding stores and locations of Victoria's Secret and BBW in North America. It increased the Victoria's Secret footprint by about 5% with 26 new stores and BBW by 3% with 24 new locations in fiscal 2015. Partners also opened an additional 10 new Victoria's Secret stores (in the Middle East) and 50 new BBW stores in the Middle East, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe in 2015.
  

   While the company's first focus is on major growth in North America, it plans to further expand into international markets, including mainland China and other countries, through partner arrangements or company-owned stores.

Early history[edit]
In 1912, Bella Cabakoff emigrated with her parents from Russia to Columbus, Ohio, to escape persecution. At age 21, she became the youngest buyer for the Lazarus department store chain. After spending over 20 years working for Lazarus, in 1951 she and her husband Harry Wexner opened a women's clothing store named Leslie's (after their son) on State Street. This store became the training ground for Leslie "Les" Wexner. In 1963, he borrowed $5,000 from his aunt and $5,000 from the bank and opened a store at the Kingsdale Shopping Center in Upper Arlington, Ohio. This store was named "The Limited" because the store focused on clothing for younger women, unlike his parents' general merchandise store. Later in 1964, Bella and Harry closed their store to join their son in his venture.
The original board consisted of only the three family members and longtime friend Jim Waldron, who served as Senior Vice President. Bella Wexner served as secretary until her death in 2001, Harry as chairman, who served until his death in 1975, and Leslie succeeded his father as the chairman and later became CEO. As of 2014 he and his family continue to own 17% of LB. In 1969, Wexner took The Limited Brands public and sold 47,600 share at $7.25 a share. In 1977, The Limited moved into its main headquarters on Morse Road in Columbus, from which it still operates today. In 1982, The Limited was first listed on The New York Stock Exchange.[4]
Acquisitions[edit]
The 1980s started a string of acquisitions. In 1982, the Victoria's Secret brand, store, and catalogue were purchased from Roy Raymond for $1 million.[5] Also in 1982, 207 Lane Bryant stores were purchased. In 1985, a single Henri Bendel store was purchased for $10 million and 798 Lerner stores for $297 million. Finally, in 1988, 25 Abercrombie & Fitch stores were purchased for $46 million. In 1996 The Limited phased out its ownership of the A&F brand, when it was spun off into a publicly traded company.[6]
The 1990s saw the initial development of the Limited Too, Bath & Body Works, Structure, and Victoria's Secret Beauty. Later in 1998, several Bath & Body Works stores were converted to The White Barn Candle Company stores to begin a home fragrance brand.
In 2005 Limited Brands purchased home fragrance manufacturer Slatkin & Company.[7]
On August 3, 2007, Limited Brands sold 75% ownership of its flagship Limited chain. In 2010, the remaining 25% shares to buyout firm Sun Capital Partners Inc. Stefan M. Selig from Bank of America was involved in these deals.[8] The Limited announced on its website that all the Limited stores in the United States had officially closed their doors on January 7, 2017. The web retail operation of the Limited stores, thelimited.com, will continue to open for business and ship nationwide.[9] The Limited online has officially filed for bankruptcy and discontinued all services.[10]
Brands[edit]
L Brands currently operates the following retail brands:

Victoria's Secret
Bath & Body Works
Pink (sold through Victoria's Secret)
Henri Bendel
La Senza

Although not part of L Brands, they also have distribution rights (exclusive or non-exclusive) for the following brands:

On August 3, 2007, Limited Brands sold 75% ownership of its flagship Limited chain. In 2010, the remaining 25% shares to buyout firm Sun Capital Partners Inc. Stefan M. Selig from Bank of America was involved in these deals.[8] The Limited announced on its website that all the Limited stores in the United States had officially closed their doors on January 7, 2017. The web retail operation of the Limited stores, thelimited.com, will continue to open for business and ship nationwide.[9] The Limited online has officially filed for bankruptcy and discontinued all services.[10]

Originally focused on apparel, L Brands sold its ailing Limited and Express chains -- leaving the company free to focus on two core businesses: Victoria's Secret and BBW. L Brands also owns apparel importer MAST Industries, accessories boutique operator Henri Bendel, apothecary C.O. Bigelow, and The White Barn Candle Co.

Victoria's Secret parent L Brands' shares fall after June sales decline
L Brands Inc.  shares fell 3.9% in Thursday premarket trading after it announced June sales of $1.21 billion, a 6% decline from a year ago. L Brands portfolio includes Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. Same-store sales for the five weeks ending July 1 fell 9%. The company said exiting the swim and apparel categories hurt total company and Victoria's Secret same-store sales by 7 percentage points and 10 percentage points respectively. Sales of $4.42 billion for the 22 weeks ending July 1 were a 6% decline from the $4.73 billion the year prior. Same-store sales for the period fell 9%. L Brands shares are down 21% for the last year while the S&P 500 index  is up nearly 16% for the period.

Macy’s slides 8% and sparks broad selloff of retail stocks

Macy's tumbles 7% on margin warning, dragging other retailers down with it
Shares of Macy's Inc.  slid more than 7% Tuesday to lead S&P 500 decliners, after the company said gross margins will be weaker than they forecast in February. The company made the comment at an investor meeting, according to media reports. It immediately sparked a selloff among department store chains that quickly spread to other retailers. The sector is in a midst of a period of slowing sales and customer traffic as many shoppers move online, mostly to Amazon.com Inc. . Kohl's Corp.  fell 6.9%, Nordstrom Inc.  was down 4.5% and Dollar General Corp.  tumbled 3.8%. Dollar Tree Inc.  fell 3.6% and L Brands Inc.  was down 3.4%. The S&P 500  was down 0.2%.

Nearly two-thirds of U.S. internet users visited Amazon in the first quarter: Wells Fargo
About 155 million people in the U.S. visited Amazon.com Inc.  in the first quarter, which represents 63% of all internet users in the country for the period, according to Wells Fargo. None of the other companies covered by Wells Fargo reached more than 5% of U.S. web users, analysts wrote in a Monday note. Among their companies covered, the highest was L Brands Inc.'s  Victoria's Secret with 3.8%, followed by Gap Inc.'s  Old Navy brand (3.2%) and Nike Inc.  (3.0%). "Even when extending to the department stores (who by definition have a broader customer base than a specialty retailer), only the Kohl's  website attracts more than 10% of total U.S. web users," the Monday note said. For the quarter, Amazon accounted for 67% of addressable-market growth. "Addressable market" is retail sales excluding gas stations and food/beverage stores, according to Wells Fargo. This is lower than the fourth quarter, but "when accounting for seasonality of Amazon's sales (relative to the rest of retail), we see that Amazon's share of industry growth continues to climb higher," the note said. Amazon shares, which topped $1,000 for the first time last week, are up 0.4% in Monday trading. For the year so far, shares are up nearly 35%, outpacing the S&P 500 index , which has grown nearly 9%.

Victoria's Secret parent L Brands' shares fall after June sales decline
L Brands Inc.  shares fell 3.9% in Thursday premarket trading after it announced June sales of $1.21 billion, a 6% decline from a year ago. L Brands portfolio includes Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. Same-store sales for the five weeks ending July 1 fell 9%. The company said exiting the swim and apparel categories hurt total company and Victoria's Secret same-store sales by 7 percentage points and 10 percentage points respectively. Sales of $4.42 billion for the 22 weeks ending July 1 were a 6% decline from the $4.73 billion the year prior. Same-store sales for the period fell 9%. L Brands shares are down 21% for the last year while the S&P 500 index  is up nearly 16% for the period.

Macy’s slides 8% and sparks broad selloff of retail stocks

Macy's tumbles 7% on margin warning, dragging other retailers down with it
Shares of Macy's Inc.  slid more than 7% Tuesday to lead S&P 500 decliners, after the company said gross margins will be weaker than they forecast in February. The company made the comment at an investor meeting, according to media reports. It immediately sparked a selloff among department store chains that quickly spread to other retailers. The sector is in a midst of a period of slowing sales and customer traffic as many shoppers move online, mostly to Amazon.com Inc. . Kohl's Corp.  fell 6.9%, Nordstrom Inc.  was down 4.5% and Dollar General Corp.  tumbled 3.8%. Dollar Tree Inc.  fell 3.6% and L Brands Inc.  was down 3.4%. The S&P 500  was down 0.2%.

Nearly two-thirds of U.S. internet users visited Amazon in the first quarter: Wells Fargo
About 155 million people in the U.S. visited Amazon.com Inc.  in the first quarter, which represents 63% of all internet users in the country for the period, according to Wells Fargo. None of the other companies covered by Wells Fargo reached more than 5% of U.S. web users, analysts wrote in a Monday note. Among their companies covered, the highest was L Brands Inc.'s  Victoria's Secret with 3.8%, followed by Gap Inc.'s  Old Navy brand (3.2%) and Nike Inc.  (3.0%). "Even when extending to the department stores (who by definition have a broader customer base than a specialty retailer), only the Kohl's  website attracts more than 10% of total U.S. web users," the Monday note said. For the quarter, Amazon accounted for 67% of addressable-market growth. "Addressable market" is retail sales excluding gas stations and food/beverage stores, according to Wells Fargo. This is lower than the fourth quarter, but "when accounting for seasonality of Amazon's sales (relative to the rest of retail), we see that Amazon's share of industry growth continues to climb higher," the note said. Amazon shares, which topped $1,000 for the first time last week, are up 0.4% in Monday trading. For the year so far, shares are up nearly 35%, outpacing the S&P 500 index , which has grown nearly 9%.

"The exit of the swim and apparel categories had a negative impact of 10 percentage points and 14 percentage points to total company and Victoria's Secret comparable sales, respectively," said the statement. Shares were not yet active but are down 22% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 8%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (August 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Early history[edit]
In 1912, Bella Cabakoff emigrated with her parents from Russia to Columbus, Ohio, to escape persecution. At age 21, she became the youngest buyer for the Lazarus department store chain. After spending over 20 years working for Lazarus, in 1951 she and her husband Harry Wexner opened a women's clothing store named Leslie's (after their son) on State Street. This store became the training ground for Leslie "Les" Wexner. In 1963, he borrowed $5,000 from his aunt and $5,000 from the bank and opened a store at the Kingsdale Shopping Center in Upper Arlington, Ohio. This store was named "The Limited" because the store focused on clothing for younger women, unlike his parents' general merchandise store. Later in 1964, Bella and Harry closed their store to join their son in his venture.
The original board consisted of only the three family members and longtime friend Jim Waldron, who served as Senior Vice President. Bella Wexner served as secretary until her death in 2001, Harry as chairman, who served until his death in 1975, and Leslie succeeded his father as the chairman and later became CEO. As of 2014 he and his family continue to own 17% of LB. In 1969, Wexner took The Limited Brands public and sold 47,600 share at $7.25 a share. In 1977, The Limited moved into its main headquarters on Morse Road in Columbus, from which it still operates today. In 1982, The Limited was first listed on The New York Stock Exchange.[4]
Acquisitions[edit]
The 1980s started a string of acquisitions. In 1982, the Victoria's Secret brand, store, and catalogue were purchased from Roy Raymond for $1 million.[5] Also in 1982, 207 Lane Bryant stores were purchased. In 1985, a single Henri Bendel store was purchased for $10 million and 798 Lerner stores for $297 million. Finally, in 1988, 25 Abercrombie & Fitch stores were purchased for $46 million. In 1996 The Limited phased out its ownership of the A&F brand, when it was spun off into a publicly traded company.[6]
The 1990s saw the initial development of the Limited Too, Bath & Body Works, Structure, and Victoria's Secret Beauty. Later in 1998, several Bath & Body Works stores were converted to The White Barn Candle Company stores to begin a home fragrance brand.
In 2005 Limited Brands purchased home fragrance manufacturer Slatkin & Company.[7]
On August 3, 2007, Limited Brands sold 75% ownership of its flagship Limited chain. In 2010, the remaining 25% shares to buyout firm Sun Capital Partners Inc. Stefan M. Selig from Bank of America was involved in these deals.[8] The Limited announced on its website that all the Limited stores in the United States had officially closed their doors on January 7, 2017. The web retail operation of the Limited stores, thelimited.com, will continue to open for business and ship nationwide.[9] The Limited online has officially filed for bankruptcy and discontinued all services.[10]
Brands[edit]
L Brands currently operates the following retail brands:

Victoria's Secret
Bath & Body Works
Pink (sold through Victoria's Secret)
Henri Bendel
La Senza

Although not part of L Brands, they also have distribution rights (exclusive or non-exclusive) for the following brands:

C. O. Bigelow
The White Barn Candle Company

Previous brands that were spun off include:

Lane Bryant – sold in 2002 to Charming Shoppes
Abercrombie & Fitch – acquired by The Limited in 1988 and went public as NYSE: ANF in 1996
Lerner New York – sold and became New York and Company
The Limited Too – Tween Brands, Inc., spun off in 1999
Galyan's – Majority interest sold in 1999, remaining shares sold in 2004, merged with Dick's Sporting Goods
Structure – converted to Express Men, brand name later sold to Sears
Aura Science – merged with Victoria's Secret Beauty
Express – on May 15, 2007, Limited Brands sold a 75% stake in Express to Golden Gate Capital Partners[11]
The Limited – on August 3, 2007, Limited Brands transferred 75% ownership of its flagship Limited chain to buyout firm Sun Capital Partners Inc.; in 2010, Sun Capital purchased the remaining shares.

History[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (August 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Early history[edit]
In 1912, Bella Cabakoff emigrated with her parents from Russia to Columbus, Ohio, to escape persecution. At age 21, she became the youngest buyer for the Lazarus department store chain. After spending over 20 years working for Lazarus, in 1951 she and her husband Harry Wexner opened a women's clothing store named Leslie's (after their son) on State Street. This store became the training ground for Leslie "Les" Wexner. In 1963, he borrowed $5,000 from his aunt and $5,000 from the bank and opened a store at the Kingsdale Shopping Center in Upper Arlington, Ohio. This store was named "The Limited" because the store focused on clothing for younger women, unlike his parents' general merchandise store. Later in 1964, Bella and Harry closed their store to join their son in his venture.
The original board consisted of only the three family members and longtime friend Jim Waldron, who served as Senior Vice President. Bella Wexner served as secretary until her death in 2001, Harry as chairman, who served until his death in 1975, and Leslie succeeded his father as the chairman and later became CEO. As of 2014 he and his family continue to own 17% of LB. In 1969, Wexner took The Limited Brands public and sold 47,600 share at $7.25 a share. In 1977, The Limited moved into its main headquarters on Morse Road in Columbus, from which it still operates today. In 1982, The Limited was first listed on The New York Stock Exchange.[4]
Acquisitions[edit]
The 1980s started a string of acquisitions. In 1982, the Victoria's Secret brand, store, and catalogue were purchased from Roy Raymond for $1 million.[5] Also in 1982, 207 Lane Bryant stores were purchased. In 1985, a single Henri Bendel store was purchased for $10 million and 798 Lerner stores for $297 million. Finally, in 1988, 25 Abercrombie & Fitch stores were purchased for $46 million. In 1996 The Limited phased out its ownership of the A&F brand, when it was spun off into a publicly traded company.[6]
The 1990s saw the initial development of the Limited Too, Bath & Body Works, Structure, and Victoria's Secret Beauty. Later in 1998, several Bath & Body Works stores were converted to The White Barn Candle Company stores to begin a home fragrance brand.
In 2005 Limited Brands purchased home fragrance manufacturer Slatkin & Company.[7]
On August 3, 2007, Limited Brands sold 75% ownership of its flagship Limited chain. In 2010, the remaining 25% shares to buyout firm Sun Capital Partners Inc. Stefan M. Selig from Bank of America was involved in these deals.[8] The Limited announced on its website that all the Limited stores in the United States had officially closed their doors on January 7, 2017. The web retail operation of the Limited stores, thelimited.com, will continue to open for business and ship nationwide.[9] The Limited online has officially filed for bankruptcy and discontinued all services.[10]
Brands[edit]
L Brands currently operates the following retail brands:

Victoria's Secret
Bath & Body Works
Pink (sold through Victoria's Secret)
Henri Bendel
La Senza

Although not part of L Brands, they also have distribution rights (exclusive or non-exclusive) for the following brands:

C. O. Bigelow
The White Barn Candle Company

Previous brands that were spun off include:

Lane Bryant – sold in 2002 to Charming Shoppes
Abercrombie & Fitch – acquired by The Limited in 1988 and went public as NYSE: ANF in 1996
Lerner New York – sold and became New York and Company
The Limited Too – Tween Brands, Inc., spun off in 1999
Galyan's – Majority interest sold in 1999, remaining shares sold in 2004, merged with Dick's Sporting Goods
Structure – converted to Express Men, brand name later sold to Sears
Aura Science – merged with Victoria's Secret Beauty
Express – on May 15, 2007, Limited Brands sold a 75% stake in Express to Golden Gate Capital Partners[11]
The Limited – on August 3, 2007, Limited Brands transferred 75% ownership of its flagship Limited chain to buyout firm Sun Capital Partners Inc.; in 2010, Sun Capital purchased the remaining shares.

History[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (August 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Early history[edit]
In 1912, Bella Cabakoff emigrated with her parents from Russia to Columbus, Ohio, to escape persecution. At age 21, she became the youngest buyer for the Lazarus department store chain. After spending over 20 years working for Lazarus, in 1951 she and her husband Harry Wexner opened a women's clothing store named Leslie's (after their son) on State Street. This store became the training ground for Leslie "Les" Wexner. In 1963, he borrowed $5,000 from his aunt and $5,000 from the bank and opened a store at the Kingsdale Shopping Center in Upper Arlington, Ohio. This store was named "The Limited" because the store focused on clothing for younger women, unlike his parents' general merchandise store. Later in 1964, Bella and Harry closed their store to join their son in his venture.
The original board consisted of only the three family members and longtime friend Jim Waldron, who served as Senior Vice President. Bella Wexner served as secretary until her death in 2001, Harry as chairman, who served until his death in 1975, and Leslie succeeded his father as the chairman and later became CEO. As of 2014 he and his family continue to own 17% of LB. In 1969, Wexner took The Limited Brands public and sold 47,600 share at $7.25 a share. In 1977, The Limited moved into its main headquarters on Morse Road in Columbus, from which it still operates today. In 1982, The Limited was first listed on The New York Stock Exchange.[4]
Acquisitions[edit]
The 1980s started a string of acquisitions. In 1982, the Victoria's Secret brand, store, and catalogue were purchased from Roy Raymond for $1 million.[5] Also in 1982, 207 Lane Bryant stores were purchased. In 1985, a single Henri Bendel store was purchased for $10 million and 798 Lerner stores for $297 million. Finally, in 1988, 25 Abercrombie & Fitch stores were purchased for $46 million. In 1996 The Limited phased out its ownership of the A&F brand, when it was spun off into a publicly traded company.[6]
The 1990s saw the initial development of the Limited Too, Bath & Body Works, Structure, and Victoria's Secret Beauty. Later in 1998, several Bath & Body Works stores were converted to The White Barn Candle Company stores to begin a home fragrance brand.
In 2005 Limited Brands purchased home fragrance manufacturer Slatkin & Company.[7]
On August 3, 2007, Limited Brands sold 75% ownership of its flagship Limited chain. In 2010, the remaining 25% shares to buyout firm Sun Capital Partners Inc. Stefan M. Selig from Bank of America was involved in these deals.[8] The Limited announced on its website that all the Limited stores in the United States had officially closed their doors on January 7, 2017. The web retail operation of the Limited stores, thelimited.com, will continue to open for business and ship nationwide.[9] The Limited online has officially filed for bankruptcy and discontinued all services.[10]
Brands[edit]
L Brands currently operates the following retail brands:

Victoria's Secret
Bath & Body Works
Pink (sold through Victoria's Secret)
Henri Bendel
La Senza

Although not part of L Brands, they also have distribution rights (exclusive or non-exclusive) for the following brands:

C. O. Bigelow
The White Barn Candle Company

Previous brands that were spun off include:

Lane Bryant – sold in 2002 to Charming Shoppes
Abercrombie & Fitch – acquired by The Limited in 1988 and went public as NYSE: ANF in 1996
Lerner New York – sold and became New York and Company
The Limited Too – Tween Brands, Inc., spun off in 1999
Galyan's – Majority interest sold in 1999, remaining shares sold in 2004, merged with Dick's Sporting Goods
Structure – converted to Express Men, brand name later sold to Sears
Aura Science – merged with Victoria's Secret Beauty
Express – on May 15, 2007, Limited Brands sold a 75% stake in Express to Golden Gate Capital Partners[11]
The Limited – on August 3, 2007, Limited Brands transferred 75% ownership of its flagship Limited chain to buyout firm Sun Capital Partners Inc.; in 2010, Sun Capital purchased the remaining shares.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
