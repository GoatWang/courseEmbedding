Jeffrey W. Runge, MD, Former Chief Medical Officer for the Department 
      of Homeland Security, Appointed to Conmed Healthcare Management, Inc. 
      Board of Directors




Board of Directors Increased to Six Members






January 18, 2011 07:55 AM Eastern Standard Time



HANOVER, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Conmed Healthcare Management, Inc. (NYSE Amex: CONM - News), a leading 
      full service provider of correctional facility healthcare services to 
      county detention centers, today announced that the Company’s Board of 
      Directors has increased the size of the board to six members and 
      appointed Jeffrey W. Runge, MD to the Company’s board, effective 
      immediately. Dr. Runge is currently a Principal at The Chertoff Group, a 
      firm providing advisory services in business risk management, homeland 
      security and homeland defense. He is also the President and founder of 
      Biologue, Inc., which provides consulting in biodefense, medical 
      preparedness and injury prevention and control.
    


      "Dr. Runge’s background and insights will be a valuable asset to our 
      expanded board,” commented Richard Turner, Chairman and Chief Executive 
      Officer of Conmed. “We welcome him to the board and look forward to 
      having the benefit of his perspective, guidance and counsel as we 
      continue to work toward growing our business and delivering shareholder 
      returns over the long term. Dr. Runge’s experience at the Department of 
      Homeland Security (DHS) will be increasingly important to Conmed’s 
      relationships with those county detention facilities that house 
      detainees for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the principal 
      investigative arm of DHS. Housing and proper care of ICE detainees is an 
      important part of the operational economics of many of our community 
      correctional facilities as well as prospective clients.”
    

      From 2001 through August 2008, Dr. Runge served in the Bush 
      administration, first as the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety 
      Administration, and, beginning in September 2005, as the Department of 
      Homeland Security’s first Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Runge founded the 
      DHS Office of Health Affairs in 2007 and was confirmed by the Senate as 
      DHS’s first Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs in December 2007. Dr. 
      Runge also served as Acting Department of Homeland Security 
      Undersecretary for Science and Technology from February through August 
      2006. In his role at DHS, Dr. Runge oversaw the operations of the 
      Department’s biodefense activities, medical preparedness and workforce 
      health protection, including managing DHS’s role in Project BioShield, 
      working with the various federal departments on medical countermeasure 
      assurance. Prior to joining DHS, Dr. Runge was Assistant Chairman of the 
      Department of Emergency Medicine at the Carolinas Medical Center in 
      Charlotte, N.C., from 1984 through 2001. Dr. Runge earned his medical 
      degree from the Medical University of South Carolina and his 
      undergraduate degree from the University of the South. Dr. Runge has 
      served as a member of the Board of Directors of Pharmathene, Inc. since 
      December 2009.
    

      “I look forward to serving on the Conmed Board of Directors,” commented 
      Dr. Runge. “The Company is dedicated to providing its customers 
      innovative, cost-effective and quality healthcare solutions for inmate 
      populations; they value their employees and are committed to strategies 
      that grow the Company in quality and value for its shareholders.”

*College of Medicine
*College of Pharmacy
*College of Nursing
*College of Graduate Studies
*College of Dental Medicine
*College of Health Professions

The College of Medicine is the oldest of these schools, offering a four-year M.D. program. The College of Graduate Studies features the most varied academics, with programs in Neuroscience, Microbiology and Immunology and Environmental Sciences, to name a few. The other colleges offer a combination of bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral programs.

Because of the Medical University of South Carolina’s vast academic offerings, admissions requirements vary quite a bit from program to program. Generally speaking, master’s and doctoral degrees require a bachelor’s degree to apply. For specific admissions procedures, consult the university’s bulletin.

MUSC offers several financial aid opportunities, including federal grants and loans, work-study and institutional scholarships. The state of South Carolina funds many scholarships as well, including the South Carolina LIFE Scholarship.

Jeffrey W. Runge 



Senior Advisor
Areas of Focus:
Biodefense strategy and countermeasures
Medical preparedness and emergency medical care
Road transportation safety
Injury Prevention and Control

Previous Experience:
Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs and Chief Medical Officer, US Department of Homeland Security (2005 – 2008)
Administrator, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (2001 – 2005)
Clinical Professor of Emergency Medicine

Jeffrey W. Runge has decades of clinical, research, leadership and administrative experience. In addition to seven years as the head of two government agencies with as many as 1000 employees and contractors under his direction, he brings nearly 30 years of experience as an emergency medicine physician. Until 2001 he practiced and taught in North Carolina’s busiest emergency department and trauma center, while performing research in injury prevention, trauma care, and emergency service delivery.
With government administrative experience and rich experience in EMS and trauma management, Dr. Runge was a natural fit to become the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) first Chief Medical Officer, where he led the reorganization of biodefense operations into a new Office of Health Affairs. To execute this mission, Dr. Runge and his team worked across traditional boundaries in government and the private sector to bring together various stakeholders in biodefense and medical preparedness on behalf of DHS. 

“Biodefense is an enterprise with many stakeholders and responsible parties, all of which must contribute to its success. Likewise, the medical response to disasters is largely a private sector responsibility, whether it is medical care delivery or the availability of countermeasures,” Dr. Runge says. “I believe there are ample opportunities for the private sector to lead and take ownership in biodefense and medical preparedness and to profit from it.”
His leadership and innovation in road traffic safety brought him to Washington as the head of NHTSA, where he instituted programs that led to the first absolute declines in U.S. motor vehicle deaths in nearly a decade and the lowest highway fatality rate in history. His emphasis on safety belt use using the innovative “Click It or Ticket” program led to national belt use over 80%, saving over 3000 lives a year. Dr. Runge’s focus on rollover crashes using the 5-star rating program and crash avoidance technology led to an industry-wide redesign of SUVs to improve their safety as family vehicles. His expertise in road safety and emergency medical service delivery remains highly valued by government and the private sector.
Dr. Runge is a 1977 graduate of the University of the South, Sewanee, TN, and received his medical degree from the Medical University of South Carolina in 1981. He has been honored by both institutions in recent years as a Distinguished Alumnus. Dr. Runge is board certified in Emergency Medicine and has published over 60 articles in the medical literature in the fields of emergency medicine, traffic injury control and medical preparedness. He has testified 25 times in Congress and various state legislatures on highway safety and homeland security issues.
