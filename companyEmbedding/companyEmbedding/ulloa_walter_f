(Photo/Getty Images)President Obama will appoint two more Latinos to Kennedy Center Board
 by Nina Terrero, @nina_terrero Follow @NBCLatino5:08 pm on 09/27/2013 President Barack Obama announced that he will appoint two more Latinos to the Kennedy Center Honors board, a move that comes weeks after the organization named Carlos Santana and opera singer Martina Arroyo as recipients of the 2013 Honors.
Amalia Perea Mahoney and Walter F. Ulloa were named among seven appointees for General Trustee of the Kennedy Center late Thursday evening. Other appointees include producer Shonda L. Grimes (“Scandal,” “Grey’s Anatomy”) and Frank F. Islam, a tech entrepreneur and member of the Brookings Institution.
Mahoney and Ulloa’s appointments will bring the number of Latino Kennedy Center Honors board members up to three, including current board member Giselle Fernandez.
“I congratulate Amanda Perea Mahoney and Walter Ulloa on receiving this important assignment to serve on the Board of Trustees of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts,” New Mexico Democratic Congressman Ben Ray Luján, Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus’ Diversity and Inclusion Taskforce said in a statement. “Their depth of experience and commitment to the arts will serve them well as they join with the other board members to uphold the distinguished work of the Kennedy Center and showcase the extraordinary talents of diverse artists from across the country and around the world.”

Mahoney is the owner of a Latin American art gallery in Chicago and is a Loyola University Chicago Graduate. She volunteered for President Obama’s election campaign in 2008 and according to a Jan. 2013 L.A. Times article, raised “between $200,00 and $500,000” dollars for his re-election campaign in 2012.
Ulloa is the Chairman and CEO of Entravision Communications Corporation, a Spanish-language media company. A University of Southern California graduate, he holds a J.D. from Loyola Law School and began his career at KMEX-TV in Los Angeles.
News of the pending appointment represents an “eye opener” by the Obama administration on the need for increased representation of Latinos in media, says Felix Sanchez, Chairman of the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts (NHFA). Sanchez – who helped create a coalition of over 30 Latino advocacy group to petition the Kennedy Center to revise its nomination and selection process of Honorees last fall.

“There has been an acknowledgement by the administration that they need to be more inclusive,” explains Sanchez. “So I’m happy that they are beginning this directional change. It is clear that the numbers of Latinos nationwide are not represented fully on the board, but that doesn’t happen overnight.”
“The last presidential election proved that the Latino numbers could not be ignored ,” Sanchez adds.  “These types of events within the liberal arts community made it clear that the administration was not doing enough.”
