EasyClean®









IntuiTouch™
















Fast, Efficient, Easy Clean Up


				LG's innovative EasyClean® function provides a quick, efficient, effortless way to clean your oven.  Using lower temperatures, a revolutionary interior, and water, simply wipe away the mess after only 20 minutes.  Got a really big mess? The full self clean is  still available to tackle those heavy duty clean up jobs
				

















Bake and Roast Like a Pro


					Great cooking takes time, but at least with this oven it takes less time. The True Convection Oven lets you pre-heat faster and provides even baking and roasting for delicious results.
				

















The Smart Touch


				Easy to use and easy to clean, the IntuiTouch™ Control System makes operating your range a snap. The left side of the panel mirrors the cooktop elements, while the right side controls the oven functions.
				

















Expand Your Options


					The size of your oven shouldn't dictate what you can cook or for how many people. This Large-Capacity Oven gives you more space so you have the flexibility to cook more dishes at the same time. One of the largest oven capacities available at 6.3 cu. ft.
				

















LG's Fastest Boiling Cooktop Elements


				Just when you thought it couldn’t get any faster, it did. With 3200 watts, these dual cooktop elements are our most powerful available.  Not only do they deliver LG’s fastest boil, they let you match the element size to your cookware for the utmost in flexibility.

This product heats up very quickly, it's extremely easy to see inside the oven when cooking because of the blue interior and the burner control is very precise.

Everything is perfect on this product except the fact that you can not turn off the preheat song; song and not sound!

        Good Unit
Had this oven for about 5 months and it seems to be ok.  love the flat top and the oven is very roomy for a lot of food cooking at the same time.  The storage space below the oven gets sacraficed but not really a concern. all in all a good unit.
