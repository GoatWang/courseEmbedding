Early life[edit]
He was born on 10 May 1919 in St. Gallen, Switzerland and died on 16 April 2001 in Verona, Italy.
His father, Otto, was a Lutheran minister, and his mother, Nelly, a violinist who performed in the Capet Quartet as second violinist. His great uncles were conductors Emil and Fritz Steinbach. Peter attended the universities of Zürich, Basel, and Geneva. He was mentored by Karl Barth and Emil Brunner in theology, and Karl Jaspers in philosophy. He studied piano and theory with Czesław Marek in Zürich and received further training on piano with Alfred Cortot in Paris. His conducting mentors were Ernest Ansermet, Wilhelm Furtwängler, and Franz von Hoesslin.
Career[edit]
Association with Furtwängler[edit]
He described his association with Wilhelm Furtwängler to be the most important in his life. He performed as pianist in a Furtwängler concert with Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 4 in G major. As recounted by Maag, Furtwängler told him: “"Why don't you try to conduct? I have observed you while you were playing the concert tonight, staring at the orchestra more than at the keyboard. It was more you than me that have given the entry”. He followed Furtwängler advice to start out at a small theatre. His new career began as répétiteur and then director at the Swiss Theater Biel-Solothurn from 1943 to 1946. After the first season at Biel-Solothurn, he served as an assistant to Furtwängler prior to the opening of his second season there. After Biel-Solothurn, he became Ernest Ansermet's assistant with the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.
Conductor[edit]
Maag was first conductor at the Düsseldorf Opera from 1952 to 1955, and then Generalmusikdirektor of the Bonn City Theater from 1955 to 1959. His first appearance at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden was in 1959, with Mozart's Die Zauberflöte. In the same year he made his debut at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro. His U.S. debut was as guest conductor in 1959 of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, and he made his U.S. opera debut in 1961 at the Lyric Theatre in Chicago with Mozart’s Così fan tutte.
Religious retreat[edit]
In 1962, Maag temporarily abandoned his musical career. Believing he was losing touch with music and theology, he sought guidance first from the Greek Orthodox Church and then planned to spend a few months at a Buddhist monastery near Hong Kong. "I decided it was time to retire because I was having too much success," Maag said. The planned "few months" grew to over two years. “Those two years spent meditating and praying in a small cell purified my soul." Maag’s retreat proved to be a detriment to his career when he returned to the world of conducting.[citation needed]
Return to conducting[edit]
Maag was the chief conductor of the Vienna Volksoper from 1964 to 1968. His Metropolitan Opera debut was made on 23 September 1972 with Mozart's Don Giovanni. He became artistic director of the Teatro Regio di Parma in 1972 and of the Teatro Regio in Turin in 1974. He held posts at the RAI Symphony Orchestra, Turin and the Orquesta Nacional de España. He was the music director of the Berner Symphonie-Orchester from 1984 to 1991. He served as the principal conductor of the Orchestra di Padova e del Veneto from 1983 to 2001. He was also a frequent guest conductor with orchestras and opera houses worldwide.
Recordings[edit]
He began recording for Decca Records in October 1950 with the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. These monaural recordings included Mozart's Symphony No. 29 and Symphony No. 34 and Serenade No. 9 "Posthorn".
Maag's early stereophonic sound recordings for Decca were well received, and many have remained in the catalogs for decades. The original LPs, particularly with the London Symphony Orchestra, have become collector's items. He began recording with the London Symphony Orchestra in February 1957. This included a series of Mendelssohn and Mozart works, and the Schumann Piano Concerto. Maag’s favorite recordings came from this association: Mozart’s Symphony No. 29 and Symphony No. 34. His recording from this period of Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 3 (the "Scottish" symphony) was widely admired, and Maag came to be particularly associated with the piece.
Maag also recorded two LPs with the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire in November 1958 with works of Chopin, Delibes, and Rossini.
For Decca he also recorded Verdi's Luisa Miller with the National Philharmonic Orchestra in June 1975 and Paer's Leonora with the Bavarian Symphony Orchestra (likely the Bavarian State Orchestra) in June and July 1978.
With the Berner Symphonie-Orchester of which he was Music Director, Maag made recordings for Innovative Music Productions in the late 1980s. They were licensed to MCA Records for sale in the USA.
Other labels he recorded for include Arts, Conifer, Deutsche Grammophon, Naxos Records, Nuova Era, RCA Red Seal Records, and Vox Records.
Personal life[edit]
Maag's first wife was Jasmina Božin, a stage designer from Bosnia-Herzegowina. Maag was survived by his second wife, Marica Franchi (Marika); a son Georg, a writer of children's books, and a daughter Costanza, from his second wife.

After the first season at Biel-Solothurn, he served as an assistant to Furtwängler prior to the opening of his second season there. After Biel-Solothurn, he became Ernest Ansermet's assistant with the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.
Conductor[edit]
Maag was first conductor at the Düsseldorf Opera from 1952 to 1955, and then Generalmusikdirektor of the Bonn City Theater from 1955 to 1959. His first appearance at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden was in 1959, with Mozart's Die Zauberflöte. In the same year he made his debut at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro. His U.S. debut was as guest conductor in 1959 of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, and he made his U.S. opera debut in 1961 at the Lyric Theatre in Chicago with Mozart’s Così fan tutte.
Religious retreat[edit]
In 1962, Maag temporarily abandoned his musical career. Believing he was losing touch with music and theology, he sought guidance first from the Greek Orthodox Church and then planned to spend a few months at a Buddhist monastery near Hong Kong. "I decided it was time to retire because I was having too much success," Maag said. The planned "few months" grew to over two years. “Those two years spent meditating and praying in a small cell purified my soul." Maag’s retreat proved to be a detriment to his career when he returned to the world of conducting.[citation needed]
Return to conducting[edit]
Maag was the chief conductor of the Vienna Volksoper from 1964 to 1968. His Metropolitan Opera debut was made on 23 September 1972 with Mozart's Don Giovanni. He became artistic director of the Teatro Regio di Parma in 1972 and of the Teatro Regio in Turin in 1974. He held posts at the RAI Symphony Orchestra, Turin and the Orquesta Nacional de España. He was the music director of the Berner Symphonie-Orchester from 1984 to 1991. He served as the principal conductor of the Orchestra di Padova e del Veneto from 1983 to 2001. He was also a frequent guest conductor with orchestras and opera houses worldwide.
Recordings[edit]
He began recording for Decca Records in October 1950 with the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. These monaural recordings included Mozart's Symphony No. 29 and Symphony No. 34 and Serenade No. 9 "Posthorn".
Maag's early stereophonic sound recordings for Decca were well received, and many have remained in the catalogs for decades. The original LPs, particularly with the London Symphony Orchestra, have become collector's items. He began recording with the London Symphony Orchestra in February 1957. This included a series of Mendelssohn and Mozart works, and the Schumann Piano Concerto. Maag’s favorite recordings came from this association: Mozart’s Symphony No. 29 and Symphony No. 34. His recording from this period of Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 3 (the "Scottish" symphony) was widely admired, and Maag came to be particularly associated with the piece.
Maag also recorded two LPs with the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire in November 1958 with works of Chopin, Delibes, and Rossini.
For Decca he also recorded Verdi's Luisa Miller with the National Philharmonic Orchestra in June 1975 and Paer's Leonora with the Bavarian Symphony Orchestra (likely the Bavarian State Orchestra) in June and July 1978.
With the Berner Symphonie-Orchester of which he was Music Director, Maag made recordings for Innovative Music Productions in the late 1980s. They were licensed to MCA Records for sale in the USA.
Other labels he recorded for include Arts, Conifer, Deutsche Grammophon, Naxos Records, Nuova Era, RCA Red Seal Records, and Vox Records.
Personal life[edit]
Maag's first wife was Jasmina Božin, a stage designer from Bosnia-Herzegowina. Maag was survived by his second wife, Marica Franchi (Marika); a son Georg, a writer of children's books, and a daughter Costanza, from his second wife.

Early life[edit]
He was born on 10 May 1919 in St. Gallen, Switzerland and died on 16 April 2001 in Verona, Italy.
His father, Otto, was a Lutheran minister, and his mother, Nelly, a violinist who performed in the Capet Quartet as second violinist. His great uncles were conductors Emil and Fritz Steinbach. Peter attended the universities of Zürich, Basel, and Geneva. He was mentored by Karl Barth and Emil Brunner in theology, and Karl Jaspers in philosophy. He studied piano and theory with Czesław Marek in Zürich and received further training on piano with Alfred Cortot in Paris. His conducting mentors were Ernest Ansermet, Wilhelm Furtwängler, and Franz von Hoesslin.
Career[edit]
Association with Furtwängler[edit]
He described his association with Wilhelm Furtwängler to be the most important in his life. He performed as pianist in a Furtwängler concert with Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 4 in G major. As recounted by Maag, Furtwängler told him: “"Why don't you try to conduct? I have observed you while you were playing the concert tonight, staring at the orchestra more than at the keyboard. It was more you than me that have given the entry”. He followed Furtwängler advice to start out at a small theatre. His new career began as répétiteur and then director at the Swiss Theater Biel-Solothurn from 1943 to 1946. After the first season at Biel-Solothurn, he served as an assistant to Furtwängler prior to the opening of his second season there. After Biel-Solothurn, he became Ernest Ansermet's assistant with the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.

I will now turn the call over to Peter.
Peter Maag
Thanks, Caroline. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. We've had a busy few months here at CareDx especially with the exciting progress on the AlloSure reimbursement fund. Jim Gleason, President of TRIO, our patient organization dedicated to organ transplantation emphasized, the transplant community looks forward to having the AlloSure test available to support those long-term post-transplant life benefits. A great testimony to the immense patient need for better surveillance solutions for kidney transplantations.
Also as you may have, seen we've a new CFO on board. It's been great working with Mike over this last month with his expertise in both finances and in diagnostics we're working to streamline some of our financial procedures. Mike has also brought in some of his friends from Deloitte to support our financial reporting team and to help and show we got every eye as we move ahead. I’ll have Mike go over our preliminary financial results, but I would like to first update you on the recent development.
Our strong revenue results this quarter reflect continuing growth of our flagship AlloMap test. You recall that AlloMap is a high-value diagnostic testing service that helps monitor heart transplant patients for the risk of rejection. AlloMap revenues were in the range of 7.7 million to 7.9 million this quarter, which reflect a volume increase of 12% compared to the first quarter of 2016. We provided approximately 3,750 AlloMap patients results in the quarter. So, we are very pleased with our performance. We continue to drive activities that increase the number of AlloMap per patient or the adherence to our surveillance protocol.

As discussed before, many centers set their own protocols in adapting AlloMap in line with a standard follow up procedures. We have gathered information through pilot studies in three centers that by supporting centers in organizing the AlloMap component of their surveillance protocol, we have significantly increased their adherence. We enrolled this program out to a total of 10 centers in the first half of this year. But this program in full swing, we will continue to drive AlloMap underlying volume growth.
With the efficiencies generated from this volume increase and the ROSE royalty payments ending after the third quarter, the roughly 65% gross margin in AlloMap will help to support our path to profitability. Preliminary revenues for our pre-transplant Olerup business in the quarter were $3.7 million, which reflect a good quarter. As we have mentioned before our Olerup product, product offer the best-in-class HLA typing solutions for transplant lab that are matching organs to recipients. You can find Olerup product in more than 50% of the roughly 1,000 HLA labs around the world.
Last September, we launched Olerup QTYPE to drive further growth in our pre-transplant business. Reception to QTYPE continues to be very positive and we look forward to reporting back to you with a CE marking progress and validation of additional instruments. So, we have solid revenues in our pre-and post-transplant co-product encompassing the continuum of care as we execute on our strategy to build the transplantation focus, multi-product genomic information company. We are very excited to be adding to our portfolio AlloSure and we have had some recent great news.
AlloSure, the first and only non-invasive test that uses donor-derived cell-free DNA to directly measure organ injury and identify the probability of active rejection. AlloSure is not only bringing transformational sequencing technology to the clinic, AlloSure is also a transformational product for CareDx. With three major scientific publications, the relevant IPE through the [Indiscernible] acquisition, our best-in-class [KLF] and the commercial platform through AlloMap in place, we are extremely well positioned to execute on this opportunity.
Last month, we attained a draft local coverage determination LCD from Palmetto, no radian and other Medicare Administrative Contractor, MAC for AlloSure, the draft local coverage decision that issued following completion of the MolDX, the molecular diagnostic technical assessment process by Palmetto. CMS has awarded Palmetto with the administration of the Molecular Diagnostics Program. During the technical assessment process, subject matter experts and the MolDX team determined, if an essay demonstrates clinical utility and fulfill the centers of Medicare and Medicaid services reasonable and necessary criteria.
For us, Medicare is so important that only because of the expertise of the team at MolDX in regards to high value diagnostic tests evaluation, but also because roughly 80% of all kidney transplantations are covered under Medicare. This means our reimbursement efforts for others who are highly targeted especially compared with other diagnostic tests that need to go through lengthy negotiations with multiple payers.
As we laid out on our last call, there are three important phases of the MolDX process, the technical investment review, the local coverage decision and reimbursement pricing setting. We now have a draft LCD and we're moving towards the reimbursement in price setting phase. Subsequent to a positive final LCD, we will engage in pricing discussion. We anticipate that we will have completed the reimbursement process in the second half of 2017 and are planning for full launch of AlloSure in October this year.

We have shared with you previously that we continue to leverage our existing resources for product launch. As 100 centers account for roughly 80% of the overall kidney transplant volume with a great overlap with our existing AlloMap offering, we are planning for a very efficient launch. On the clinical front, we presented AlloSure data at the 2017 American Transplantation Congress, which was very well received by transplant physicians. Even more important for us where the many interactions that we had with investigators and key personnel from transplant centers who were eager to get their hands on the real life experience with AlloSure.
With that excitement on great data and reimbursement underway, we feel very well positioned for the launch of AlloSure. We are excited about AlloSure's market opportunity and we believe AlloSure has the potential to achieve more than $200 million in revenue. We hope to leverage our established expertise and commercial platform to make this a highly launch. How do we get there? I mentioned that transplant centers are highly concentrated group. We will market AlloSure to the 200 kidney transplant centers in the U.S. starting with centers where CareDX hasn't established presence through AlloMap and the clinical trial presence through DART.
Second, we focus on Medicare as a payer within its established relationship 80% of kidney transplantations are Medicare patients. We have strong relationships with the MolDX program also based on our history with AlloMap. Repeat testing similar to AlloMap patients on AlloSure will follow our surveillance protocol, providing a recurring revenue opportunity with multiple tests provided. And lastly, revolutionary technology targeted sequencing technology provides for fast turnaround time and competitive cost of testing. The approach of measuring cell-free DNA is already a proven game changer in oncology and prenatal testing.
Now, we look forward to updating you further on our launch strategy in providing some reimbursement updates on coming calls. Moving onto a quick update regarding our balance sheet, during the quarter we signed a debt agreement with JCB and we're in discussions to restructure our obligations with former majority shareholders in Sweden. We believe these activities have the potential to increase our financial flexibility in front of our AlloSure launch.
In closing, I'm very pleased that we received the draft LCD from Palmetto and hit that milestone as planned. But looking forward now, I'd like to remind you about our other milestones that we are excited about and you should monitor. The potential restructuring of our obligations to the former majority shareholders of Allenex, the AlloSure pricing which is expected later this year and our launch in October, the Olerup QTYPE activities with CE mark expected later this year as well as continued growth on AlloMap as we rollout our AlloMap at home program.
I will now turn the call over to Mike to discuss our financials.
Michael Bell
Thank you, Peter. Firstly, I'd like to say that I'm pleased to have joined the team at such a critical time and ahead of such large commercial opportunities. While today we're reporting only preliminary results, I look forward to releasing final results in coming weeks and getting our financial protocols on track for more timely reporting in the future.
Preliminary first quarter 2017 revenue is in the range of 11.4 million to 11.6 million, compared to 6.6 million in the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase in revenue reflects three drivers. First, Olerup contributed revenue of 3.7 million in Q1. Note that, we completed the acquisition of the Olerup business in April 2016. Second, AlloMap U.S. tests volume grew 12% in third quarter 2017. And third, we continue to improve our cash collection operations. These two AlloMap-related drivers have resulted in AlloMap revenue in the range of 7.7 million to 7.9 million in Q1, up from 6.5 million in the prior year.

For Q1, our preliminary net loss was in a range of 6.8 million to 5.8 million, compared to a net loss of 9.8 million in the same period of 2016. I wanted to briefly comment on bringing our financial processes in order. The team here has faced some significant challenges because of the various acquisitions over the last 12 months. That together with the late filing of the 10-K impacted our ability to file the 10-Q on time. We expect to file a 10-Q in the very near future and going forward we brought in Deloitte to work with the team to help us improve our financial close process and accounting controls.
I'm already seeing the positive impact from this initiative and I'm confident that our future filings will be back on track for the next quarter. You'll see from the strong revenue performance on AlloMap that the team has successfully enhanced the billing activities. I have two things we can continue to get better in that area. We've already upgraded a lot of the processes and activities, but based on my experience from previous companies, I see room to further improve.
In one of the upcoming calls, I'd be happy to update you on our thinking on how to further increase collections and reduce our DSOs. Turning to guidance, we've no change there. For 2017, we continue to expect revenue to be in the range of 45 million to 50 million. Our guidance is based on AlloMap and Olerup revenue and excludes any potential revenue from AlloSure.
I'll turn the call back to Peter for closing comments.
Peter Maag
Thank you very much, Mike. We appreciate you joining the call. We're now happy to address any questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
Bill Quirk
I guess your first question here you reiterated guidance so, is it safe to assume given you're pretty far in 2Q at this point that volumes continue to track kind of according to your plan?
Peter Maag
Absolutely, AlloMap is doing very well. You see that the 12% growth in the first quarter has been a very good solid growth and we're tracking against our plans, absolutely.
Bill Quirk
And then maybe you could just kind of elaborate a little bit more on the AlloMap growth, obviously the 12% number was I think something higher than the street was looking for so maybe you can just elaborate on pockets of strength there? Is it sustainable maybe how should we be thinking about that metering itself over the balance of the year?
Peter Maag
Our activities to drive protocol adherence have bear or borne a number of fruits in key centers and they have been so positive that we're actually rolling this out in 10 more centers in the first half of this year. We see on average Bill that roughly, if we look at the numbers patients experience about five to six AlloMaps over the lifetime after transplantation, and we think that based on these protocols it could be in the 10 to 12 AlloMaps range, if we activity involve all results in the process.
So translate that into 10 centers, there is going to be continued growth on AlloMap which is very exciting. What we do here is we actually help these centers to schedule the AlloMap blood draw based on a predefined schedule, and by doing that, we ensure that they actually come to the center, gets the blood drawn and the AlloMap is in the Electronic Medical Record prior to the visit of the patient next time at the center. So that has proven to be very exciting and important also medically for this patient to receive the AlloMap prior to the visit.
Michael Bell
Okay great. And then I guess last question from me is just on AlloSure, I am thinking a few steps ahead here in terms of getting to the pricing decision by the MAC. How should we think about this, Peter, gap fill, crosswalk kind of any chatter that you can share at this point will be very helpful? Thank you.

Peter Maag
I think there are really three important elements when thinking about these pricings and you've mentioned the couple. The first one would be a crosswalk type of methodology while MolDX is not using our crosswalk specifically here. I think the really the analog products to be compared to is actually AlloMap is the post-transplant surveillance method on a slightly different technology gene expression profiling. But with the price of 3,600 list and 2,840, I think it sets a nice analog for as type of crosswalk methodology.
When we are thinking about considering the health economic impacts of AlloSure, clearly there is an easy comparison to alleviating the needs of biopsies in kidney transplantation and these biopsies are very invasive and obviously a big issue. And then a bigger health economic impact even is the optimization of immunosuppressive therapy and the issues that are associated with immunosuppressive therapy over long periods of time.
And the third element clearly is what was the investment, what is the cost of producing the test that will come into an equation of an valuation on pricing of this product, and as there is underlying sequencing technology, you can probably appreciate that the experts on the MolDX side are very familiar with cost associated with on the one hand the evidence development, but then also with the cost of producing a result. And we have a lot of experience with that, but I think these are the three major elements for pricing up AlloMap -- AlloSure, sorry.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from line of Kevin Ellich with Craig Hallum. Please proceed.
Kevin Ellich
So just following up on Bill's question on the strong AlloMap volume 4%, do you think you guys should be continue that type growth rate or you should be few more fluctuation as we the years goes on?
Peter Maag
I think if you look over the last few quarters, we have mentioned that we think of AlloMap growth somewhere between 5% and 10% range. This quarter has been a very strong quarter with 12% growth. I think it's a product that has really found its place as a standard of care in heart transplantation. And what we saw actually last year that, there was a bit of an underlying uptick in organ availability, I think that has supported AlloMap growth, and Todd and the team are doing a very good job our Chief Commercial Officer, Todd Whitson who came over from prenatal diagnostics testing company and has really helped to shape our marketing and sales focus and drive volume growth. So, yes, I think the 12% is a good growth and let's see what we can do in the second quarter.
Kevin Ellich
And then just going back to AlloSure, and you know we understand you provided a lot of good detail on the process for the pathway for Medicare reimbursement and also you're looking for, you know and I know 80% of the kidney transplant patients are Medicare. What about the commercial side? They're still 20%, would you expect commercial reimbursement to follow suit very quickly? And do you think it'll be in a same sort of range that you're looking at for Medicare?
Peter Maag
I think we've been very successful in the Company to not contract AlloMap below the Medicare rate, and in hindsight I think that has been proven to be a very wise decision, and so we continue to believe that that's the right way forward. We do have relationships with payers that allow us to see the interest levels and there are few payers that I think are forward leaning and forward thinking about high value molecular diagnostic tests. I think we’re laser sharp focused right now on the Medicare reimbursement because it is 80% and we follow the 80-20 to 20 rule.
What you'll see actually in the draft local coverage decision what is very exciting is that there's not limitation on length of testing, so it actually AlloSure starts two weeks after transplantation and there's no limitation in terms of use. And the second one is actually a relatively broad label where we think that we can actually provide a lot of AlloSure value to patients by monitoring these patients over a long period of time. So, I think that's we're very pleased with the outcome of the draft local coverage decision provided under Medicare.

Kevin Ellich
Great and then on AlloMap, I think Mike mentioned 65% gross margin, I guess have you guys ever provided where do you think those margins can go? And then what should we expect once -- obviously we need to find out what the pricing will be for AlloSure, but you think we should see something similar in terms of gross margin on that product as well, that process as well?
Michael Bell
This is Mike. Yes, currently, the gross margin on AlloMap is between the 60% and 65% and absolutely as we launch AlloSure and that's about to take on some of the overhead related to AlloMap then, you know we're targeting around the 70% gross margin for AlloMap.
Kevin Ellich
Okay and then Mike since I got you one quick one for you. On the balance sheet, do you think you need to you know you mentioned you kind of wanted to structure the balance sheet a little bit? Can you give us any color you know what you bring over the last month since joining the Company? And also what do you want to do with the balance sheet? And where the cash burn lies right now?
Michael Bell
With respect to the cash burn, we're burning around 3 million a quarter on the operations; and with our current cash balance at the moment, that's going to get us well through the AlloSure launch. So, that's our first priority is to get us to that. I think towards the end of the year, we want to strengthen the balance sheet further to allow us to you know to continue the commercialization into 2018. There's nothing specific we can share at the moment on that and when we can we will do.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Please proceed.
Nicholas Jansen
First from me just on that last point Mike, I do believe from the Swedish shareholder perspective there's a deferred payment in July that you're hoping to push out. Can you maybe just give some clarity on when that payment is due? How we should be thinking about the timeline for you guys to get rid of that or delay that?
Michael Bell
I think there're really two components for the Swedish shareholders. The one is the deferred acquisition payment, that's in the neighborhood of 6 million. And then the other one would be a loan agreement in the Allenex organization of roughly -- to make it -- they get to the $4 million. So, there's a total obligation to $10 million. We've been in good relationship with the shareholders. They actually do own a significant portion of CareDx stock at this stage, so we've been in very good conversations, and we see them in the past having deferred some of these payments that we will be able to defer some of these payments going forward. As we get closer to finalizing these agreements, we'll be sharing that news with you.
Nicholas Jansen
And then talking about the AlloSure commercialization I know you're going to be leveraging your sales force pretty aggressively given the overlap, but just wanted to get your thoughts on how we should be thinking about if there's any sort of incremental sales hires, any new incremental marketing programs and dollar spent on the upfront commercialization process as we kind of think about that $3 million per quarter of cash burn? Thanks.
Michael Bell
Actually, we're going to launch this product with seven people in sales and four of the medical sales liaisons. So, 11 people in the field. We've upgraded our marketing team already in the first quarter, so don't expect large expenditures and then changes in terms of cash burn for the organization.
Nicholas Jansen
And then my last question would be, if PAMA was to kind of stick to its word in terms of using commercial rates as a benchmark for Medicare going forward. How do we think about your existing AlloMap franchise, and I believe commercial is currently above what Medicare paid you at a time being, so how much incremental revenue or opportunity would that be, if that did get finalized as constructed?

Peter Maag
Thanks Nic for reminding me. We actually did mention that our calculation have led to a submission of 3,240 AlloMap pricing when we take the commercial contracted price. If we translate this into this roughly 15% sales increase to our overall volume on Medicare, we're talking about roughly 6% to 7% increase on same volume. So, we see this as an upside opportunity. There's a lot of jitter in the market around the implementation of PAMA, but we see this as a key upside going into the next year.
Operator
Thank you. We have follow up questions from the line of Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed.
Kevin Ellich
Peter just one follow-up for me, why does it take two weeks before you can start the AlloSure testing? Our understanding was that prednisone does not impact the testing capability like AlloMap?
Peter Maag
Kevin, I might not have understood your question. Can you repeat it?
Kevin Ellich
Yes, I think in your prepared remarks you said that you can't expect AlloSure testing two weeks following the transplant, is that right?
Peter Maag
Yes, just after transplantation, when -- the procedure of transplanting an organ into an individual is causing a lot of damage of the cells and just to be on the safe side that really the cell-free DNA, so that the damage cells that we are measuring are really coming from a healthy and working organs. There is a two weeks lapse after transplantation before we can perform the first AlloSure test.
Operator
Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue. For now, it is now pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Peter Maag, Chief Executive Officer for closing comments or remarks, sir?
Peter Maag
Well, this is a very quick. And thank you very much for attending the call. I am looking forward to updating you further on our further development. Thank you very much for joining.

I will now turn the call over to Peter Maag. Peter?
Peter Maag
Thanks, Mark. Good afternoon, everyone. As we have done on our previous quarterly calls, I’d like to begin with a patient story. As many of us fly United Airlines, you might have followed the Chicago tribune story about the United CEO, Oscar Munoz. He took over as United CEO in September, suffered a heart attack in October and received a heart transplant in January, back to work in March. This is quite amazing and highlights the life changing potential of successful transplantation.
It is life changing story like this one that inspire us at CareDx. 2015 was the year of substantial progress for CareDx. We closed 2015 having achieved all of our strategic objectives, including further development of cell-free DNA with AlloSure, increasing AlloMap patient adoption and pursuing external growth opportunities, including the transaction we announced to acquire Allenex.
We’ll start this call by covering our cell-free DNA pipeline then I’ll cover our AlloMap business and provide an update on the transaction. Ken will cover the financials for the fourth quarter and full-year 2015 and then we look forward to your questions. Before we discuss operational highlights, I would like to briefly comment on our overall performance.

For the full-year 2015, total revenue for the year was $28.1 million with AlloMap revenue being $27.9 million up 8% over 2014. We provided more than 13,000 AlloMap patient results. AlloMap test volume continues to be a strong foundation for our business. We saw 10% year-over-year volume growth, which underscores the importance of AlloMap as a core product for CareDx. Ken will talk through the dynamics of test growth versus revenue growth in his section. Overall, we believe that having reimbursement and billing in-house is a core capability for a molecular diagnostics company.
We are succeeding in building a strong R&D effort centered on our cell-free DNA technology that promises impact on even more patients with focus on kidney transplant surveillance. The increased R&D effort translated into a ramp of R&D expenses primarily associated with the development of our in-house cell-free DNA Assay AlloSure and our ongoing clinical trials. I’m extremely pleased with the progress that we're making and the investments that we have made since that we first outlined our strategy more than a year ago.
Let me now focus my comments on the three strategic objectives we pursued in 2015: development of cell-free DNA, AlloMap patient adoption, and external growth opportunities. First, I want to highlight the progress we made on AlloSure, our proprietary next-generation sequencing test that measures the percent of donor-derived cell-free DNA in solid organ transplant recipients. Our initial focus for AlloSure will be kidney transplantation.
We completed rigorous analytical validation of AlloSure following professional organization, next generation sequencing guidelines and recommendations such as CAP, AMP, ACMG, and ASHG. We used a specially designed third-party prepared reference standards quantitatively characterized by digital PCR and the National Institute of Standards and Testing human reference genome in the validation to ensure sequence accuracy and quantitation. Computational analysis used customer sample best-in-class software modules and a cloud platform selected by precision FDA, the FDA’s effort in support of President Obama’s precision medicine initiative.
AlloSure is accurate, reproducible, and sets a new bar for thoroughness of analytical validation for a cell-free DNA laboratory-developed test. In 2015, CareDx presented NGS analytical validation recommendations at the FDA sponsored workshop in November in Washington. We also opened a dedicated purpose-built CLIA lab for AlloSure in our Brisbane headquarters. This provides us the ability to offer the latest genomic technologies for our growing pipeline of assays, dedicated to improving transplantation management.
Additionally, we have made significant progress in our DART trial, an observational study designed to demonstrate the clinical validity of cell-free DNA in detecting rejection in kidney allograft recipients. The study is also designed to demonstrate the correlation of circulating cell-free DNA to renal function estimated from serum creatinine. We initially planned to enroll 200 patients in more than 12 centers and collect patient blood samples.
We exceeded plan with 205 patients, enrolled by December 31st, up from 100 in the third quarter in 13 transplant centers, up from 11 reported in Q3. In total, these centers have already collected over 900 samples and associated clinical visit data as of March 19, 2016. We plan to deliver our first analysis in the first half of this year with a timing primarily driven by the number of patient samples that are associated with clinical events, especially rejections.
Following this first analysis of the DART study, we plan to begin a clinical drug called ROSE in the second half of this year. The focus of ROSE will be to demonstrate clinical utility in support of reimbursement in a Medicare population. Medicare covers more than 90% of kidney transplant patients. We continue to be on track with our development plan. These milestones are consistent with previous communication.

In addition to DART, we have two more clinical studies underway: our Outcomes AlloMap Registry study, or OAR, and our cell-free DNA Outcomes AlloMap Registry, or D-OAR. Enrollment continues to grow in the OAR study. At the end of 2015, we had taken almost 3,000 samples, up from 2,300 at the end of the third quarter from 800 patients up from about 600 last quarter from 24 centers.
The long-term outcome data collected will continue to build clinical evidence for the use of AlloMap. We see this not only as a long-term commitment to the field of transplantation, but also as an invaluable source for future scientific insight generation. We are seeing a lot of interest from opinion leaders to use this date to gain further insights into patient management.
We continue to make cell-free DNA results available from our CLIA laboratory in combination with AlloMap through our D-OAR registry. As of December 31, the D-OAR trial was in 18 centers, up from 15 at the end of the third quarter with 340 patients enrolled up from 250 and 900 samples collected up from 650. This effort continues to support evidence generation of cell-free DNA in organ transplantation. We continue to build an invaluable repository of well annotated sample that link genomic data with clinical information.
Now turning to our second strategic initiative, which is to increase the adoption of AlloMap, our surveillance solution for heart transplant recipients. Out of the 130 heart transplant centers in the U.S., AlloMap was used in 120 during the last 12 months. As of the end of the fourth quarter, there were 64 centers with established AlloMap protocols, up from 62 in the previous quarter and 60 in the quarter before that.
During the fourth quarter, we hit an important commercialization milestone in Europe with our partner Diaxonhit, a French leader in specialty in-vitro diagnostics. We completed the technology transfer of AlloMap into Strasbourg University Hospital Central Immunology Laboratory, HUS in France. We established a rigorous multi-step validation process, which demonstrated that AlloMap test results released from the HUS laboratory are equivalent to AlloMap results generated by our laboratory here in Brisbane. Patient samples can now be tested at HUS. This unique partnership with both a prestigious university based laboratory and a strong commercial organization, increases the availability of AlloMap for transplant patients in Europe.
I’m also pleased with the execution of our commercial strategy which coordinates AlloMap patient customer engagement, drives establishment and adherence to protocols and supports transplant centers in optimizing their workflow. The three key initiatives that we have been working on are stakeholder engagement to involve patients and physicians in the direction we take our technology, clinical data and education to continue to build the evidence in support of AlloMap and protocol development and adherence to continue to expand the utility of AlloMap.
A highlight of our ongoing development efforts is our recent release of AlloMap Score Variability for AMV. That’s an additional tool for heart transplant clinicians. In October, research conducted on AMV was published in journal, BMC Cardiovascular Disorders. This published study is the first to report on positive and negative predictive values, key to informing test use in a patient population. The AlloMap variability assay identifies which patients are at risk of future clinical events, thereby, facilitating adjustments of patient management strategies. In other words, AlloMap variability predicts risk of future allograft events. While each single AlloMap identifies the risk of acute rejection at the time of testing.
This is a particularly exciting area for patients that are in the timeframe two years to five years post-transplant. AMV, which is available from for AlloMap test results with in a 24 months period, will provide additional insights to clinicians for patient risk stratification. There are now 40 centers receiving AlloMap variability scores up from nine in the third quarter of 2015.

On the reimbursement front, we continue to have positive coverage decisions from most major carriers. As of December 31, 2015 we had been reimbursed for approximately 80% of all AlloMap results delivered in the 12 month ended June 31, 2015. And just a few weeks ago, we announced TRICARE National Insurance came out with a positive coverage policy for AlloMap. TRICARE covers over nine million lives and is heart of the military health care system. This coverage is need to access back one year to February 2015.
AlloMap continues to be broadly reimbursed in comparison to other high-value molecular diagnostic offerings. In 2015 AlloMap reimbursement was steady at $2,821. In 2015 we received a CPT code, as we are currently going through the CMS caption [ph] process with AlloMap, we expect reimbursement to remain at this price going forward.
On July 1, we brought AlloMap billing and collection activities in-house as we grow and launch new tests we expect to see a reduction in cost of the reimbursement effort and an increase in effectiveness through direct control over the entire process. As mentioned earlier, we think about this as a core competency of a pioneering molecular diagnostic company.
Now moving on to our external growth opportunities, as you most of you are aware in December we reached an agreement to purchase 78% of the outstanding share of Allenex. We are currently working through the conditions of closing. Allenex is a transparent transplant diagnostic company based in Stockholm, Sweden that develops, manufactures, market and sells product that match donor organs with potential recipients prior to transplantation. We anticipate to finish the tender offer period with Swedish stockholders and expect to complete the acquisition in mid-April. This combination will create an international transplantation diagnostics company with expanded distribution and additional overall growth potential.
Let me tell you why I’m excited about Allenex. The Olerup SSP line, which addresses Human Leukocyte Antigen or HLA testing is used to match transplant recipients with donors organs. The Olerup SSP line is established in the marketplace and is complementary to our product. The majority of Allenex operations are in Europe, which represents 70% of the 2015 revenues. They have five direct reps in Europe and five in the U.S. Their team is very knowledgeable, talented and well respected. The Olerup brand is very well known in the field and important relationships have been established over decades.
Pro forma combined revenues for 2015 were approximately $44 million. This represents a unique strategic fit with little over that overlap between our standalone companies, combine CareDx we’ll have product offerings along the pre-post transplant continuum and presence and direct distribution channels in the U.S. and in Europe. We are excited about this combination and look forward to sharing more with you at an Analyst and Investors Day that we are planing to host in mid-April in New York.
Before we move onto financial I would like to speak a little bit more about striving to be a best-in-class transplant focused molecular diagnostic company and how we strengthened our organization by bringing on great people. As an example for an incredible team that we have currently in the company and that we are building. In the beginning of 2015 Dr. John Sninsky joined as Chief Scientific Officer to head our product development initiative. Dr. Sninsky is an expert in the diagnostic space with the wealth of experience. He has made significant contributions leading us through the product development milestones we hit this year. And we expect more to come.
Now I’ll turn the call over to Ken.
Ken Ludlum
Okay. Thanks Peter. AlloMap revenue for the full year 2015 was $27.9 million, up about 8% over 2014. AlloMap volume growth was up 10% for the year. AlloMap revenue in the fourth quarter was $6.7 million flat with the fourth quarter of 2014. Revenues would have been higher, but for a delay in collections of cash basis test from our former billings and collections vendor. As Peter mentioned in July, we transferred this activity to an in-house team. But the prior vendor remained responsible for following the collections on the tests performed through June.

We have now also taken over collections on those tests performed prior to June and expect to collect on a number of these tests and recognize this revenue in 2016. Based on the prior collection history, we estimate that we’ll recognize approximately $500,000 to $800,000 in revenue from these tests.
Collaboration revenue was also lower than a year-ago. I would remind you that in the fourth quarter of 2014 we had a $1.1 million payment due to the winding down of the partnership with LabCorp, which effects comparability of this quarter. In addition, we have decided to change the revenue recognition from accrual accounting to cash revenue recognition for the regular ongoing royalties we received from a technology license. As a result of this change, we reversed the third quarter’s revenue that we had previously recognized and will not recognize the fourth quarter’s revenue until it is actually paid. This amounted to approximately $200,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the reversal of $86,000 from the third quarter of 2015.
Cost of testing in the third quarter was $2.5 million, compared to $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. This translated to a gross margin of 63% in line with recent performance, but down from the fourth quarter of 2014 performance of 67%.
R&D expense was $2.7 million in the third quarter – in the fourth quarter rather compared to $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The change reflects an increase in all clinical trial activities, especially the cell-free DNA clinical area, which did not exist last year and then expanded R&D effort in general.
Sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter were $1.9 million, compared to $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was primarily related to an increase in marketing programs.
G&A expenses were $3.7 million for the quarter, up from $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
As discussed earlier, we brought billing and collection in-house this year which will reduce expenses starting in 2016 after a transition period during, which we ran our old outside service and our in-house activities in parallel. In addition, expenses related to the acquisition and those accounting fees contributed to the increase year-over-year.
Fourth quarter 2015 net loss was $4.8 million, compared to a loss of $5,000 for the same quarter in 2014. Basic and diluted loss per share of $0.40 in the quarter, compared with breakeven EPS numbers in the year-ago quarter. Remember in the year-ago period the beneficial $1.1 million one-time payment from LabCorp, boosted the bottom line significantly.
Shares outstanding for this year’s quarter were $11.9 million, compared to $11.8 million a year-ago.
Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the fourth quarter we had $29.9 million in cash and cash equivalents versus $36.4 million at December 31, 2014. Given proximity to the closing of the Allenex acquisition and how it will affect the size of CareDx, we will not be providing 2016 financial guidance at this time. However, we plan to discuss our outlook for 2016 at the Analysts and Investors Day in mid-April after the Allenex deal closes.
I will now turn the call back to Peter for a few closing remarks.
Peter Maag
As we’re closing on 2015, we are also turning the page by announcing a CFO transition. We announced today that Ken will be leaving the company. And Charles Constanti will be joining us as the CFO.
I’m thankful to Ken for his partnership in the last two years. He was instrumental in guiding us through the IPO process. He has also been a terrific travel companion and I will miss him. I’m pleased that Ken has agreed to remain with the company until June to ensure a smooth transition.
With Charles Constanti, we are bringing a seasoned financial expert on Board that will allow the organization to realize its future growth aspirations. Charles brings with him a lot of international finance and accounting expertise, which will be important as we close and integrate the Allenex acquisition. I’m looking forward to working with Charles. It will be a great addition to the team.

In summary, I’m delighted by the progress we made throughout 2015 and into 2016 as we move towards advancing our mission to improve patient outcomes in transplant care. Our key objectives for 2016 are develop AlloSure into a commercial product for kidney transplantations. Integrate Allenex and further build out an international diagnostics company focused on the transplant continuum. Continue to grow AlloMap our core product in transplant medicine. We look forward to updating you on our progress at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day mid-April and on future calls.
With that, I would now like to open the call up for questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your question please.
Laura Sand
Hi, everyone. This is Laura Sand on for Bill. First question regarding the CFO transition I guess, why is now the right time for the change?
Ken Ludlum
Well, so this is Ken speaking. And I've just decided that. I'm going to rebalance my life a little bit. I'm not leaving for any particular future position or occupation but I told Peter that I wanted to rebalance a little bit and that gave everybody enough time to allow for a smooth transition.
Laura Sand
Okay, thank you for the clarity. And then with the Allenex deal closing in mid-April. How are you looking at top-line synergies and also what is your strategy for the timing of beyond integration process?
Peter Maag
Perfect, Laura. Thank you so much and obviously we are in the midst of finalizing the transaction middle of April as you said and then swiftly going into the integration process. We really see there are two synergies for the business. On the one hand, we have a very strong established U.S. presence with CareDX. We have access to 130 transplant centers that we regularly call on. To give you a bit of an understanding the Allenex organization is really relatively young in the United States with the presence in West Chester, Pennsylvania. So we think there will be cross-selling opportunities on the long run.
There's a slightly different call point as we're calling on to a transplant center more from the clinical and the coordinator perspective and they're calling on the lab head. But more and more we see these centers are coming together with lab directors and clinicians are sitting around the table talking about individual patients.
And then on the other hand, we have the Europe presence of Allenex. They have a very vast distributor network all over the globe. And we believe that with our growing products see AlloSure and all those we can build that presence out on the medium to long-term. So don't expect immediate revenue synergies but on the mid to long-term there is clearly a benefit of being a global transplant business, because transplantation is a pretty global business.
Laura Sand
Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink Partners. Your question please.
Michael Sarcone
Guys this is actually Michael Sarcone on for Dan Leonard.
Peter Maag
Hi.
Ken Ludlum
Hi, Mike.
Michael Sarcone
So it’s look like the AlloMap volumes declined sequentially in the quarter. You think maybe you can kind of elaborate a bit on that and talk about what you were seeing there?
Peter Maag
Yes. I think what’s very important, Mike is that we measure our business more on quarter versus previous year quarter and you see healthy growth in the AlloMap franchise of 8% in terms of volume growth. When you look at revenue recognition I think, Ken was outlining the lack of the revenue recognition because of the transition of the billing process. But in terms of underlying volume growth, you see that we’ve been for the year growing 10% and in the quarter 8%. So I think it’s a healthy, healthy gross for AlloMap given where it is in the lifecycle.

We continue to be successful and very excited around AlloMap variability, which I would consider being like a lifecycle management activity for the product. And we continue to have a few holdouts especially in the Northeast that we hope to penetrate going forward. So that will continue to drive AlloMap volumes in the future.
Michael Sarcone
Okay. So nothing really to call out what the sequential decline, because we haven’t really seen that in the Q4 in the past.
Peter Maag
Our business very much driven by the number of working days and the number of days the patient come in to see clinicians. And given the low numbers – having two working days more or less makes actually a big difference. But in the overall look at it from a quarter over previous year quarter growth which is the 8% growth.
Michael Sarcone
Understood. Thanks. And my second question. Can you give us an update on the QTYPE product launch, I know you guys had some sensors testing the kids. Can you comment on initial feedback?
Peter Maag
Yes, I’d like to reserve that comment until we have concluded the transaction. Please be bear with me that we’ll given where it is today, we’ll only comment on this once we have closed the transaction, Mike.
Michael Sarcone
Sure. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery Scott. Your question please.
Paul Knight
First of all, I enjoyed working with Ken, so I’m sorry to see the transition in some ways so thanks to Ken. And then my question would be on the volumes I mean you had 8% year-over-year in Q4, 10% revenue growth for the year. You’re not providing guidance on 2016 but I guess what you’re implying is that the trend in 4Q seems visible is that a fair assumption?
Ken Ludlum
The trend in Q4 is visible, Paul.
Paul Knight
Well, the Q4 volume growth of 8% and I guess we should assume that 2016 outlook for volume growth is unchanged?
Peter Maag
Yes. Yes. That’s right.
Paul Knight
And then regarding data, I know, you’re looking may be as soon as June on additional AlloSure data, is that – are you still with that, Peter?
Peter Maag
Yes, absolutely. No, we’re right on line, it’s in line with previous communication DART trial is on course. Super excited with the 13 centers end of December. There might be one more center in the first quarter coming in. But we’re well ahead in terms of our first analysis in the first half of this year. And in previous communication we always mentioned in June there is the American Transplant Congress, which is an important date for us as a company.
Paul Knight
And then, I know, there is a chance that the CMS may reimburse patients in these trials under the early innovation program, are you still – is that still a possibility, Peter?
Peter Maag
Yes, I know – the ROSE trial as we are combining this and thinking about it. This initiative under coverage, under data development that Palmetto is spearheading in the U.S. I think our trial or our products will be uniquely positioned for that. It is granted by Palmetto, so it is not something that the company would apply for, but it is granted, that we think it is a unique offering for transplantations and it lends itself to such a program. So we are hopeful for this coverage on the data development program.
Paul Knight
Do you think that coverage is 2017 or is it this year kind of coverage or can you tell?
Peter Maag
Well, I think it really depends on – Paul on the readout of the clinical trial data of DART We will need to build the case that clinicians are using the product and feel comfortable on using the product to – as changing something in the patient treatment algorithm of these post-transplant surveillance patient. So I think, as soon as we know on the DART trial that will give us a very strong handle. But keep in mind, we have very strong academic data in the past. We also have some analysis performed on heart transplantation. So we’ll have a basket of clinical data available for Palmetto and others to make the decision on how this trial should look like and how should we think about outcomes in these transplant patients.

ROSE will be focused on how do we get reimbursement for AlloSure. Because it’s a clinically analytically valid – sorry – it’s an analytically validated test that is available as of today here in our Brisbane lab.
Paul Knight
Okay, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Criscuolo from Mizuho. Your question please.
Eric Criscuolo
Good afternoon. I guess echoing Paul, Ken enjoy your future endeavors there.
Ken Ludlum
Thank you.
Eric Criscuolo
You’re welcome, pleasure working with you. And I guess, can you – about the billing issue that you had as far as the collections as you move to in-house collecting. I think you brought that that whole service inside CareDx in July. So why did that kind of effect you now versus when you first brought everything in-house?
Peter Maag
Well in the – at the start of that, the Medicare payments come in and there are at least half of our revenue. And I mean, everything seem to be going okay in the July through August, September timeframe. And then, we realized about November that things were slowing down. So we took a couple of actions and we finally decided to take over direct supervision of collecting those tests. So we actually hired the team leader from that vendor to head up our effort here to recoup those payments. But there was a – these tests were collected actually, the cash collections, the Medicare payments coming in 45 days. But these cash collected tests can take six months to nine months to collect the majority of them. So, there’s a long tail on the cash collections.
Eric Criscuolo
Got you, okay. And you are pretty certain though that you’ll collect pretty much everything that you’ve been waiting for?
Peter Maag
Yes, we’ve – the figure we gave you has been scrub down and filtered quite a bit from all the potential tests. So we’re trying to get to a realistic number of what we think is collectable. Based on what’s been collectable in the past from the same insurance carriers.
Eric Criscuolo
Got you, okay. Thank you. And I guess, if you could just talk about Allenex maybe and then how they fit in the competitive landscape versus other HLA typing companies. And kind of where you think they are, and maybe where they can go in that whole business?
Peter Maag
Yes – no, I mean, overall we build a clinical diagnostic company with the focus on transplantation. We have a strong presence in the post-transplant heart. With AlloSure we enter all post-transplants or that organ testing. And now with Allenex, we had a pre-transplant component with the focus on HLA matching. What glues all this together is the advances in clinical diagnostics with NGS Solutions, and the push for personalized medicine. I think we need to do a better job in identifying patients that benefit from extremely costly procedures, and then optimize the treatment.
And transplantations are among the highest cost patient, it makes perfect sense to start there. But with Allenex, now we have a pre-post transplant continuum and will be a formidable competitor in that space that’s currently dominated by one company which is One Lambda, which was two years acquired by Thermo Fisher.
So I think we have a unique product offering now that we can have clinicians and lab directors think of CareDx is helping them to manage these patients on the pre-post transplant continuum, something that we do with our clinical expertise. And we expect that there will be a lot of excitement around that space.
Eric Criscuolo
How much bigger is One Lambda versus Allenex?
Peter Maag
They have multiple offering, so think of them as $100 million, $150 million revenue type of company.
Eric Criscuolo
Okay, thank you. And just lastly AlloSure reimbursements, have you started conversations with payers and maybe kind of give an update on where you stand there?

Peter Maag
Eric, it’s a great question. What’s unique and special about transplant patients and especially kidney transplant patients? 90% of transplant patients or these kidney transplant patients are actually Medicare patients. Because they have – most of them have undergone dialysis previously. And by the time they get transplanted, they are Medicare patients. So having reimbursement from Medicare is the sole focus for us as an organization to make the successful.
Now in the past, the Moldex program actually has been advancing reimbursement in these novel diagnostic tests because they have capabilities and individuals that believe on this good clinical data driving better information going forward. So we have had excellent relationships that we established over years with the AlloMap reimbursement, given the value proposition of our product in our company. So there’s very close ties to experts in the field of reimbursement of multicollector diagnostics. And we believe we can leverage this into the AlloSure program.
But keep in mind that we are all about evidence and we believe we need to do the clinical trials to demonstrate the evidence to get the product reimbursed that our trial is a substantial undertaking. The D-OAR trial is very substantial and will drive clinical information and evidence that makes it easy for a payer to say yes. That is truly valuable for transplantations and reimburse the product.
Eric Criscuolo
So I guess you have to wait for those results to come through before you submit some kind of full dossier to Medicare.
Peter Maag
Yes. I think it’s very important, this is all data driven and evidence based and we believe in that. And we have very strong analytical validation data which we’ll share. We now add clinical validation data to that. And then there is a question about how do we think about use of the test and what’s the right time of reimbursement. So we don’t think of this as just such a step function, but actually as we grow in evidence development, their survive time of the reimbursing this product. This coverage under data development might be a good compromise of having early reimbursement, but still continue to build evidence for using the test.
Eric Criscuolo
Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso from Janney Montgomery. Your question please.
Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso
Hi, good afternoon. I only have one question guys. We know that you have a busy year ahead of you, but can you share with us any effects the company is going to make this year towards – if I look in your bioinformatics platform? Thank you.
Peter Maag
Hi, Carolina, thank you so much for that question, because it’s really the mid to long-term strategy for the company. As we think about patient management and transplant surveillance, it really starts linking the HLA data pre-transplant together with the post-transplant surveillance data. And – we for that, we need to have a bioinformatics platform.
We’ve been making excellent progress on establishing web portals with these 130 transplant centers. Some of them are now ordering AlloMap online. And we actually play back the AlloMap result back into these centers. And we’re thinking about even integrating the AlloMap results into the electronic medical record.
We have built relationships with Next-Generation Sequencing data and cloud computing organizations to really form out this bioinformatics network. This is something that will take a couple of years to develop. John Sninsky and his team are actively pursuing that. But we say we’re very excited about building a bioinformatics platform that also links back external databases such as UNOS into this continuum.
We continue to believe that our diagnostic tests are the revenue generator. And so our revenue model will be linked to the testing revenue. But ultimately what is driving the use of our test will be data that we’re providing back to the clinicians for decision making. And providing this data in a better form will be very, very important going forward.

Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso
Thank you.
Operator
