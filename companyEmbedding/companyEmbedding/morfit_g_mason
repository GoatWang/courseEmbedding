Hoping for a raise in 2017? Here’s the outlook for IT pay






















Microsoft yesterday added G. Mason Morfit, president of ValueAct Capital, to its board of directors, making good on its part of the deal it struck with the activist shareholder last year."We've had the opportunity to work with Mason over the past six months, and we look forward to working with him more closely as a member of the board," said John Thompson, Microsoft's chairman, in a statement Tuesday. "Mason brings valuable insights given his financial background, his extensive experience as a public company director and his perspective as a significant Microsoft shareholder."G. Mason Morfit, president of activist investment firm ValueAct Capital, was named to Microsoft's board of directors Tuesday as part of a 2013 deal the two companies reached to ward off a proxy fight. (Image: ValueAct Capital.)What Thompson did not say was that Microsoft's hand was forced. To keep San Francisco-based ValueAct from launching a proxy fight last year, Microsoft offered a board seat to the investment firm and said that Morfit could regularly meet with "selected Microsoft directors and management to discuss a range of significant business issues" before he took his place at the table.In return, ValueAct promised not to acquire more than 4.9% of Microsoft's outstanding shares, not to launch a proxy battle, and not to "make any statement or announcement that constitutes an ad hominem attack on, or otherwise disparages or causes to be disparaged the Company or its affiliates or any of its current or former officers or directors," according to a late August filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Morfit was the first Microsoft director appointed under duress, not by the Redmond, Wash., company's choice. As of February, ValueAct owned less than 1% of Microsoft. At today's current share price, ValueAct's holdings were worth about $2.5 billion, far less than any of the top 10 institutional investors, such as Vanguard ($14.2 billion) and State Street ($13.1 billion).ValueAct got onto the Microsoft board by being the proverbial squeaky wheel. ValueAct's CEO, Jeffrey Ubben, who was linked to calls for former CEO Steve Ballmer's ouster, had agitated for a seat on the board. Like many shareholders, ValueAct had expressed concern over several major mistakes by Microsoft, including falling behind in smartphones and tablets. At an investor conference last year, Ubben also called on Microsoft to make its lucrative Office software franchise more widely available on non-Windows platforms, including Apple's iPad and Google's Android mobile operating system.Some observers expect Microsoft to launch an iPad Office suite this year, perhaps as early as the first half of 2014. For its part, Microsoft has said next to nothing publicly, although last month, Tami Reller, the company's marketing chief -- who is now on her way out the door -- seemed to hedge on a previous promise to bring Office to the iPad.Ballmer stepped aside, announcing his retirement just days before ValueAct and Microsoft came to an agreement, and was replaced in February by insider Satya Nadella. At the same time, co-founder Bill Gates left his chairmanship to focus on helping Nadella with product and technology choices. Thompson, a former IBM and Symantec executive, was named in Gates' place. With the addition of Morfit, Microsoft's board now numbers 11, and includes Ballmer, Gates and Nadella."Microsoft is an iconic global company with tremendous long-term potential," Morfit said in a statement yesterday. "I am honored to be joining the board, and I look forward to working ... to help continue to drive growth and value for all shareholders."ValueAct, while considered an activist investor, is more low-key and behind-the-scenes than Carl Icahn, the billionaire agitator who unsuccessfully took on Apple and Dell last year, and has aimed his latest broadsides at eBay.ValueAct manages $14 billion in assets that also include holdings in Adobe ($1.5 billion), Motorola Solutions ($1.9 billion) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals ($2.2 billion). ValueAct has seats on all three companies' boards.Microsoft has not yet updated its board of directors website with a photograph or biographic sketch of Morfit.This article, Activist investor who wants Office on iPad joins Microsoft board, was originally published at Computerworld.com.Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

He might be the most powerful activist shareholder you haven’t heard of. Early last year, Morfit was a largely unknown stock picker, working at a largely unknown hedge fund. Then in April 2013, he produced a detailed report, delivered by his boss ValueAct CEO Jeff Ubben at an investment conference, on how to fix a lumbering Microsoft. The report won ValueAct and Morfit respect among some of Microsoft’s largest shareholders. Behind the scenes, Morfit rallied support for a change at the top—and within a few months, CEO Steve Ballmer was out and Satya Nadella was in. Earlier this year, Microsoft added Morfit to its board, making him the company’s youngest director by nearly a decade. Morfit’s tip for getting managers much more experienced than he to listen is to prove he’s done his homework. “Please don’t say I dazzle people with data,” says Morfit. “It’s everything I am not. I’m not flashy.”

GeekWire Summit: Early-bird tickets here!





 
ValueAct’s G. Mason Morfit.

Microsoft’s newest board member, G. Mason Morfit, is the president of ValueAct Capital, and at 38 years old, he is by far the youngest member of the board, which is otherwise populated by industry veterans in their 50s and 60s.
His appointment to the board is the result of the “cooperation agreement” struck between Microsoft and ValueAct Capital last August, which included an option for ValueAct to place Morfit on the board. At the time, ValueAct had accumulated Microsoft shares totaling about 0.8 percent of the company.

ValueAct wants Microsoft to reduce its focus on Windows, speeding up its efforts to put Office and other Microsoft applications on competing operating systems including iOS and Android, according to a report by Bloomberg News last month.
But much of Morfit’s work won’t be visible to people outside the company, or even outside the board. During an an April 2012 lecture series sponsored by Stanford Law School, Morfit explained the company’s approach to “activist” investing. Here’s a key excerpt from his remarks.
Everybody wants to talk about the latest scandal of the day, or the sexy conflict in the Wall Street Journal. That is a small, small minority of shareholder activism. As our firm evolved through the last decade, we’ve tried and failed and tried and succeeded at a lot of things. We’ve done proxy fights, we’ve done public campaigns, we’ve done very media-driven efforts. But we’ve found that the most effective thing we can do is working behind the scenes and building on our network, and, in a collegial spirit, influence companies. So the lion’s share of our success is due to stuff that you have no idea ever happened.
He added later, “For us it’s just a truism that people will do want you want if they like you and you haven’t publicly humiliated them. … You’re much better off, in our experience, influencing people through the power of fact-based analysis, relationships, introductions, earning trust.”
Morfit, a Princeton grad who previously worked in equity research, has been with ValueAct since January 2001, serving on a variety of boards at public companies, but none as big as Microsoft. Along with new Microsoft chairman John Thompson and CEO Satya Nadella, he is part of an overall changing of the guard at Microsoft that creates the potential, at least, for a much different type of company in the years ahead. 
Here’s the full video of Morfit and former BlackRock executive Abe Friedman talking about activist investment strategies, part of a three-part lecture series at Stanford two years ago.
