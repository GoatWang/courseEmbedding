Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust

Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

MEMBERS Trust Company
History and Mission
            Since 1987, MEMBERS Trust Company has been providing trust and investment services to members and their families.  Credit Unions across America pooled 
            their resources to form MEMBERS Trust Company with the mission of creating a professional trust and investment company that would exist for the 
            benefit of members and not individual stockholders.  Management and staff of MEMBERS Trust Company are charged with a corporate mandate from our 
            Credit Union owners to look after and protect your best interest.  In today's time of broken promises and uncertainty, it is good that Credit 
            Unions formed a company dedicated to you and not Wall Street or private stockholders.
            

			Members have the opportunity to utilize SECU Trust Services through MEMBERS Trust Company to manage trust assets and oversee the distributions on behalf of 
            beneficiaries. At a low-cost, annual fee of .60% with a minimum fee of $900, and minimum account opening balance of $100,000, these services are available to 
            most SECU members.            
            

            As a corporate trustee, we place a high priority on applying the "Golden Rule" to the people we serve.  We want to understand the "whole 
            story" and to never lose sight of the fact that someone's loved ones are relying on both our professional competency and capacity to care.  
            The question we ask ourselves is: "How would we want our loved one to be treated by a corporate trustee?"
            

            Our owners, America's Credit Unions with over $80 bil in assets, provide the financial strength and strategic direction for MEMBERS Trust Company.  
            From our owners, MEMBERS Trust Company derives its Credit Union philosophy to serve members and leverages the resources of Credit Unions with over 
            20 offices across the United States.  So if you move to a different part of the country, it is likely you will find a MEMBERS Trust Company office.
            

            MEMBERS Trust Company is truly a unique financial institution. Chartered and regulated by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency as a special purpose saving bank, 
            MEMBERS Trust Company is owned and managed by not-for-profit Credit Unions.  One could describe our objective as a hybrid with the 
            goal of making a profit while providing the financial advice, investments and other services under a cooperative umbrella of Credit Unions at 
            the lowest cost possible and always in your best interest.
            

Trust Services offered through MEMBERS Trust Company, a federal thrift regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  Trust products are not credit 
            union deposits, are not insured by the NCUA or any other federal government agency, are not obligations of or guaranteed by the Credit Union, MEMBERS Trust Company or 
            any affiliated entity, and involve investment risks, including the possible loss of principal. The material above is for educational purposes only and is not intended to 
            provide legal or tax advice regarding your situation. For legal or tax advice, please consult your attorney and/or tax professional.

Trust Administration



Selecting a competent and prudent trustee is the cornerstone of a successful estate plan.
Your trustee will not only comply with your wishes, but also manage the assets of your trust.

The Basics
A trustee is someone you can appoint to manage your financial affairs if you're unable to do so. The trustee is responsible for using the trust property for the benefit of the trust beneficiaries according to the terms of the trust document. If those duties are breached, the trustee can be held personally liable.
Choosing a Trustee
You can select an individual or multiple trustee(s). To get started, we recommend that you draft a list of goals and needs.

Here are desirable trustee traits to assist with your selection:

Willing to serve
Dutiful with contract administration
Experienced at investing
Detailed and organized at record-keeping
Informed and comfortable around beneficiaries
Sensitive during trying times
Flexible around changing needs

Establish comprehensive protection and peace of mind for your family by naming MEMBERS Trust Company as your trustee.

MEMBERS Trust Company as Your Trustee
Owned by America's Credit Unions, MEMBERS Trust Company is a great choice for trustees or their agents. 

Since 1987, we've provided personal trust services to members for the following types of trusts:

Revocable living trust: to avoid probate and ensure continual investment management
Special needs trust: to protect the public benefits of a beneficiary with special circumstances 
Spendthrift trusts: to protect a beneficiary  who hasn't exhibited fiscal responsibility 
Charitable trust: to promote or donate to a personal cause
Educational trusts: to ensure funds for educating children or grandchildren 
IRA beneficiary trust: to protect the assets in an IRA for a beneficiary
Marital and credit shelter trust: to minimize or avoid federal estate taxes 
Pro set aside trust: to designate and protect assets for professional athletes




Plan and prepare for the future.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
