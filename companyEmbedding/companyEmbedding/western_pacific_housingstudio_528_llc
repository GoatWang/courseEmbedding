Schuler
Homes,�Inc.
Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors
(as defined below) 
����Re:��Exchange of 93/8% Senior Notes Due 2009 and 101/2% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2011
Ladies
and Gentlemen: 
����We
have acted as counsel for Schuler Homes,�Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and each of the entities listed on  Schedule�1 attached hereto (collectively, the "Subsidiary Guarantors")
(the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors are collectively referred to
herein as the "Registrants"), in connection with the proposed offer by the Company (the "Exchange Offer") to exchange $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 93/8% Senior Notes Due
2009 (the "Senior Exchange Notes") of the Company and $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 101/2% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2011 (the "Senior Subordinated Exchange Notes," and
collectively with the Senior Exchange Notes, the "Exchange Notes") for a like aggregate principal amount of privately placed 93/8% Senior Notes Due 2009 (the "Old Senior Notes") and
101/2% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2011, respectively (the "Old
Senior Subordinated Notes," and collectively with the Old Senior Notes, the "Old Notes"). The Exchange Notes will be guaranteed pursuant to the terms of the Indentures (as defined below) and the
notation thereof endorsed on the Exchange Notes on a senior basis, with respect to the Senior Exchange Notes, and on a senior subordinated basis, with respect to the Senior Subordinated Exchange
Notes, by the Subsidiary Guarantors (the "Subsidiary Guarantees"). The Senior Exchange Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of June�28, 2001 (the "Senior Notes Indenture"),
among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and U.S. Bank Trust National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Senior Subordinated Exchange Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated
as of June�28, 2001 (the "Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture," and collectively with the Senior Notes Indenture, the "Indentures"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the
Trustee. 
����As
such counsel, we have examined, among other things, (i)�the Registration Statement on Form�S-4 (File No.�333-69498), as amended, filed
by the Registrants with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the issuance of the Exchange Notes and the Subsidiary
Guarantees, (ii)�the Indentures, and (iii)�the forms of the Exchange Notes to be issued pursuant to the Indentures. The Exchange Notes and the Indentures, which Indentures contain the
Subsidiary Guarantees, are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the "Note Documents." We have also examined the proceedings and other actions taken by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors
in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of the Indentures and the issuance of the Exchange Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees thereunder. We have also made such other inquiries
and examined, among other things, originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records, agreements, certificates, instruments and other documents as we have
considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. 
����In
rendering this opinion, we have assumed: 
����(a)
The signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, all individuals executing such documents (including, without limitation, individuals executing the Note Documents in
the name and on the behalf of the Registrants) had all requisite legal capacity and competency and were duly authorized, the documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and the documents
submitted to us as certified or reproduction copies conform to the originals; 

 

����(b) Each of the parties to the Note Documents (including, without limitation, the Registrants) is a validly existing corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company in
good standing under the laws of its state of formation and has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each of the Note Documents and related
instruments to which it is a party, and the execution and delivery of such Note Documents and related instruments by such party and performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized
by all necessary action and do not violate any law, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to such party; and 
����(c)
The due and valid execution and delivery of the Indentures by the Trustee, that the Indentures constitute the legal, valid and binding agreements of the Trustee and that there are
no agreements or understandings between or among the parties to any of the Note Documents that would expand, modify or otherwise affect the terms of the Note Documents or the respective rights or
obligations of the parties thereunder. 
����Based
upon the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to receipt by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors from the Commission of an order declaring the Registration
Statement effective, we are of the opinion that: 
����1.
The Exchange Notes, when issued and delivered in exchange for the Old Notes in the manner described in the Registration Statement and when executed and authenticated as specified
in the Indentures, will be legally issued and will constitute binding obligations of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors. 
����2.
The Subsidiary Guarantees, when issued and delivered in connection with the exchange of the Old Notes in the manner described in the Registration Statement and when the Exchange
Notes and such Subsidiary Guarantees have been executed and, in the case of the Exchange Notes, authenticated, as specified in the Indentures, will be legally issued and constitute a binding
obligation of the Subsidiary Guarantors. 
����The
foregoing opinions are subject to the following exceptions, qualifications and limitations: 
����A.
We render no opinion herein as to matters involving the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York and the United States of America. Our opinions set forth herein
are limited to the effect of the present state of applicable laws of the State of New York and the United States of America and to the facts as they presently exist. We assume no obligation to revise
or supplement these opinions should the present laws, or the interpretation thereof, be changed or to revise or supplement these opinions in respect of any circumstances or events which occur
subsequent to this date. 
����B.
Our opinions set forth herein are subject to (i)�the effect of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, arrangement or similar laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors' rights generally (including, without limitation, the effect of statutory or other laws regarding fraudulent transfers or preferential transfers) and (ii)�general principles of
equity, regardless of whether a matter is considered in a proceeding in equity, at law or in arbitration, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair
dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies. 
����C.
We express no opinion regarding (i)�the effectiveness of any waiver (whether or not stated as such) under the Note Documents of, or any consent thereunder relating to, any
unknown future rights or the rights of any party thereto existing, or duties owing to it, as a matter of law, (ii)�the effectiveness of any waiver (whether or not stated as such) contained in
the Note Documents of rights of any party, or duties owing to it, that is broadly or vaguely stated or does not describe the right or duty purportedly waived with reasonable specificity,
(iii)�any provision in the Note Documents relating to indemnification, exculpation or contribution or (iv)�any provision of the Note Documents requiring written amendments or waivers of
such documents insofar as it suggests that oral or other 
2

 

modifications, amendments or waivers could not be effectively agreed upon by the parties or that the doctrine of promissory estoppel might not apply. 
����D.
We express no opinion as to (i)�the effect on the enforceability of any Subsidiary Guarantee against any Subsidiary Guarantor of any facts or circumstances occurring after
the date hereof that would constitute a defense to the obligation of a guarantor or surety or (ii)�the effectiveness of any waiver of any such defense by any Subsidiary Guarantor under the Note
Documents. 
����We
hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, and we further consent to the use of our name under the caption "Legal Matters" in the
Prospectus forming a part of said Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section�7 of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Rules and Regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder. 











Very
truly yours, 
GIBSON,

Second Supplemental Indenture dated
as of September 14, 2012 (“ Supplemental
Indenture ”), to the Indenture dated as of May 1,
2012 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in
accordance therewith, the “ Base Indenture ”),
by and among D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “
Company ”), each of the subsidiaries of the Company
that are signatories hereto as the initial guarantors (the “
Initial Guarantors ”) and American Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as trustee (the “
Trustee ”).

Each party agrees as follows for the
benefit of the other party and for the equal and ratable benefit of
the Holders of Notes (each as defined herein):

WHEREAS, the Company and the Trustee
have duly authorized the execution and delivery of the Base
Indenture to provide for the issuance from time to time of senior
debt securities (the “Securities”) to be issued in one
or more Series as in the Base Indenture provided;

WHEREAS, the Company and the Initial
Guarantors desire and have requested the Trustee to join them in
the execution and delivery of this Supplemental Indenture in order
to establish and provide for the issuance by the Company of a
Series of Securities designated as its 4.375% Senior Notes due
2022, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A
(including any Additional Notes, as defined below, the “
Notes ”), initially guaranteed by the Initial
Guarantors, on the terms set forth herein;

WHEREAS, Section 2.01 of the
Base Indenture provides that a supplemental indenture may be
entered into by the Company, the Initial Guarantors and the Trustee
for such purpose provided certain conditions are met;

WHEREAS, the conditions set forth in
the Base Indenture for the execution and delivery of this
Supplemental Indenture have been complied with; and

WHEREAS, all things necessary to
make this Supplemental Indenture a valid agreement of the Company,
the Initial Guarantors and the Trustee, in accordance with its
terms, and a valid amendment of, and supplement to, the Base
Indenture have been done;

NOW, THEREFORE:

In consideration of the premises and
the purchase and acceptance of the Notes by the Holders thereof the
Company and the Initial Guarantors mutually covenant and agree with
the Trustee, for the equal and ratable benefit of the Holders, that
the Base Indenture is supplemented and amended, to the extent
expressed herein, as follows:

ARTICLE ONE

Scope of Supplemental
Indenture

Section 1.01. General
.

The changes, modifications and
supplements to the Base Indenture effected by this Supplemental
Indenture shall be applicable only with respect to, and govern the
terms of, the Notes and shall not apply to any other Securities
that may have been or may hereafter be issued under the Base
Indenture unless a supplemental indenture with respect to such
other Securities specifically incorporates such changes,
modifications and supplements.



Pursuant to this Supplemental
Indenture, there is hereby created and designated the Notes as a
Series of Securities under the Base Indenture entitled
“4.375% Senior Notes due 2022.” The Notes shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto and will
mature and bear interest as provided in such form and have the
other terms and conditions set forth therein, this Supplemental
Indenture and the Base Indenture (to the extent not superseded
hereby). The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at
4.375%; it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest
at 4.375%. The Notes shall be guaranteed by the Guarantors as
provided in the form of Exhibit B hereto. The Trustee will
initially be the Registrar and Paying Agent for the Notes, and DTC
will initially be the Depositary for the Notes. The covenants
provided in Article Three of this Supplemental Indenture are
applicable (unless waived or amended as provided in the Base
Indenture) so long as the Notes are outstanding or until defeasance
or other discharge pursuant to the Base Indenture. An aggregate
principal amount of $350.0 million of Notes will be issued on the
Issue Date. Additional Notes (the “ Additional Notes
”) in an unlimited amount may be issued in one or more
issuances from time to time on the same terms and conditions,
except for issue date, and if applicable, the issue price and the
first interest payment, either of which may differ from the
respective terms of the previously issued Notes of same Series, and
with the same CUSIP numbers as the Notes offered hereby without the
consent of Holders of the Notes. The Notes initially issued
hereunder and any such Additional Notes shall vote on all matters,
and otherwise be treated as, a single Series for all purposes under
the Indenture.

Section 1.02. Specified
Modifications in Respect of the Notes . (1) Article Six of the
Base Indenture shall apply in respect of the Notes; provided
that with respect to clause (3) under the first paragraph and
the second paragraph of Section 6.01 of the Base Indenture,
Section 3.03 hereof shall be deemed such specified
provision which breach thereof shall constitute, together with
Article Five of the Base Indenture, an Event of Default with notice
but without passage of time.

(2) Section 7.05 of the Base
Indenture shall apply in respect of the Notes; provided that
the Trustee shall not have any discretion to withhold any notice of
the Default with respect to any breach of Section 3.03 hereof,
irrespective of any determination that withholding of such notice
is in the interest of the Holders of the Notes.

(3) Article Ten of the Base
Indenture shall apply in respect of the Notes; provided
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Base
Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture, any amendment or waiver
of Section 3.03 hereof (prior to the occurrence of a Change of
Control Triggering Event) will require consent of Holders of a
majority of the outstanding principal amount of Notes.

ARTICLE TWO

Certain
Definitions

The following terms have the
meanings set forth below in this Supplemental Indenture.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Base Indenture. To the extent terms
defined herein differ from the Base Indenture the terms defined
herein will govern.

“ Attributable Debt
” means, in respect of a Sale and Leaseback Transaction, the
present value (discounted at the weighted average effective
interest cost per annum of the outstanding debt of the Company,
compounded semiannually) of the obligation of the lessee for rental
payments during the remaining term of the lease included in such
transaction, including any period for which such lease has been
extended or may, at the option of the lessor, be extended or, if
earlier, until the earliest date on which the lessee may terminate
such lease upon payment of a penalty (in which case the obligation
of the lessee for rental payments shall include such penalty),
after excluding all amounts required to be paid on account of
maintenance and repairs, insurance, taxes, assessments, water and
utility rates and similar charges.

“ Change of Control
” means:

(1) any sale, lease or other
transfer (in one transaction or a series of transactions) of all or
substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to any Person (other than a Subsidiary of the
Company); provided , however , that a transaction
where the holders of all classes of Voting Stock of the Company
immediately prior to such transaction own, directly or indirectly,
Voting Stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of all
Voting Stock of such Person immediately after such transaction
shall not be a Change of Control;

(2) a “person” or
“group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act (other than (x) the Company or
(y) Donald R. Horton, Terrill J. Horton, or their respective
wives, children, grandchildren and other descendants, or any trust
or other entity formed or controlled by any of such individuals
(each an “ Excluded Person ”))) publicly
discloses, including, without limitation, by filing a Schedule 13D
or Schedule TO, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries publicly
discloses, including without limitation, by filing any other
schedule, form or report under the Exchange Act (including, without
limitation, a Current Report on Form 8-K), facts indicating that
such person or group has become the ultimate “beneficial
owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of
Voting Stock of the Company representing more than 50% of the
voting power of the Voting Stock of the Company; or

(3) the stockholders of the Company
approve any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of
the Company; provided , however , that a liquidation
or dissolution of the Company that is part of a transaction that
does not constitute a Change of Control under the proviso contained
in clause (1) above shall not constitute a Change of
Control.

Any person or group whose
acquisition of beneficial ownership constitutes a Change of Control
under clause (2) of the foregoing definition in respect of
which a Change of Control Offer is made in accordance with the
requirements of the Base Indenture will thereafter, together with
its Affiliates, constitute an additional Excluded
Person.

“ Change of Control
Triggering Event ” means the occurrence of both a Change
of Control and a Ratings Downgrade Event.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Western Pacific Housing carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Western Pacific Housing



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Western Pacific Housing



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.











What else should I know before hiring Western Pacific Housing



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
