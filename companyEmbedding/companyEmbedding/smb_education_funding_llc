Who We Are
Offering you comprehensive trader training in equities, options, futures and automated trading.
 





The Company

Our Mission









SMB Capital, our PnL proprietary trading desk in NYC, is recognized for its success in developing new traders from beginner to consistently profitable and then high performing trader.
We built a PnL trading desk, SMB Capital, by focusing on training new traders.  Then we created SMBU, our education arm, which offers the same trader training in equities, options, futures and automated trading, as we use to develop our firm traders.  







 


Ten years ago, when we started our education arm- SMB Training, we realized that the market was harder to navigate than when we began. It was nearly impossible for a new trader to become profitable, without advanced training and mentoring from professional traders. And thus there was need for professional trader training programs and trader mentoring that delivered these changes. SMB created world-class training programs in equities, options, futures and automated trading, so that new traders are given their best chance to succeed. Now all of the world-class training that we offer our professional proprietary traders is offered to you.
Our mission is to help you discover: How good can you be? 
Most importantly to us, we do all of this with integrity, transparency, and fairness for our trading community at SMBU.

SMB Capital is a proprietary trading desk located in the financial capital of the world, New York City, recognized for our training program.  We use the principles of elite performance to grow new and developing traders.  SMB Traders are committed to getting better everyday and not just as traders.  Our work is to provide the new and developing traders their best chance to become an elite trader.
    
SMB was founded by two well-educated (Wharton, UConn Law School), experienced, and active traders.  Today SMB has two partners:  Mike Bellafiore, author of One Good Trade: Inside the Highly Competitive World of Proprietary Trading (Wiley); and Steve Spencer, whose teaching is broadcasted three times a week on StockTwits TV.  SMB's Partners have collectively traded for 30 plus years. During these years we have learned and internalized different trading styles but continually search for the next trading edge.
	 

You may have seen our training program shot for the television documentary, Wall Street Warriors.  SMB partners have written numerous articles for SFO Magazine, been quoted in various leading financial sites and blogs, and cited in numerous trading books. SMB regularly appears on CNBC.
