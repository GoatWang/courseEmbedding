Non-smokers should stay away

                        This complex allows smoking and the tenants here smoke all day long. The hallway and common areas are filled with second-hand smoke. If I know of this, I won't live here. Non-smokers should stay away from this complex.

Waltham may be perfect for certain students, as this northwestern neighbor of Boston plays host to two universities.  Both Brandeis and Bentley universities are located in Waltham, and their locale makes apartments there an ideal place for students. The University of Massachusetts College of Agriculture is also located nearby.  According to Brandeis University's website, the school was established in 1948 and currently rests on 235 acres. Along with research, its academic offerings include an eye toward a liberal arts education.  Bentley University's website notes the school features two faculties - one that specializes in business and the other in arts and sciences. It also noted that the Princeton Review named its graduate business school as one of the best in the U.S.  Of course, not everyone who looks for apartments in Waltham is going there because they want to go to school. The area also offers access to Boston and Cambridge, meaning people who work in those areas can get where they need to go.  The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority's commuter rail system has a stop in Waltham, which should be accessible to many apartments in the area. Furthermore, the 558 bus route also offers service to downtown Boston.  Waltham apartments also provide residents with the amenities they might expect. Those include access to churches, eateries, nightlife, retail and grocery stores. There are a number of parks in the area, and the city is located near the Charles River.

Waltham Overlook



                                I've had the most amazing experience in this complex. From the beautifully renovated kitchen, to the spacious bedrooms, the well maintained grounds and the pool for that crazy summer heat. Waltham Overlook has everything a tenant can ask for. Unassigned extra parking, you'll never have to worry about finding a spot. This place truly has it all.

                                This complex was gorgeous when we signed our lease July 2016. Soon after we moved in (September) the ownership changed hands, the office emptied out, and residents were forgotten. The maintenance team is still great, but it is IMPOSSIBLE to get ahold of anyone with questions. They shut down the online portal so we could no longer pay rent online which is super inconvenient when we go away over the week when it is due. We are trying to give 60 days notice to move out an no one is answering calls or getting back to us. The leasing agent, Todd, is not helpful at all and just tries passing us off to someone else who doesn't answer calls. We have no email to use to contact anyone.

Other than that, there is no AC unit in the bedroom so the summer is unbearable and the winters extra dry. There is no air flow so the living room unit does not make the bedroom cold at all and we are slowly dying in there. Overall it has been an ok space to live in and is convenient location to my job, but if you want a "community" this is not the place to be.

Neighborhood - Waltham/Watertown







Waltham’s rich heritage as both a pioneering manufacturing center and an idyllic getaway for the Boston elite make the area a goldmine for history buffs. Many grand estates from centuries past now serve as public venues and museums, and several historic factories have been repurposed as well.

The city is rich in culture, with a robust arts council, two universities in town, and a unique international community. Being just a few miles from downtown Boston, apartments in Waltham have direct access to one of America’s most distinctive cities, as well as the benefits of several nearby parks and nature preserves.

Waltham Overlook



                                I've had the most amazing experience in this complex. From the beautifully renovated kitchen, to the spacious bedrooms, the well maintained grounds and the pool for that crazy summer heat. Waltham Overlook has everything a tenant can ask for. Unassigned extra parking, you'll never have to worry about finding a spot. This place truly has it all.

Would Not Recommend



                                This complex was gorgeous when we signed our lease July 2016. Soon after we moved in (September) the ownership changed hands, the office emptied out, and residents were forgotten. The maintenance team is still great, but it is IMPOSSIBLE to get ahold of anyone with questions. They shut down the online portal so we could no longer pay rent online which is super inconvenient when we go away over the week when it is due. We are trying to give 60 days notice to move out an no one is answering calls or getting back to us. The leasing agent, Todd, is not helpful at all and just tries passing us off to someone else who doesn't answer calls. We have no email to use to contact anyone.

Other than that, there is no AC unit in the bedroom so the summer is unbearable and the winters extra dry. There is no air flow so the living room unit does not make the bedroom cold at all and we are slowly dying in there. Overall it has been an ok space to live in and is convenient location to my job, but if you want a "community" this is not the place to be.

Neighborhood - Waltham/Watertown







Waltham’s rich heritage as both a pioneering manufacturing center and an idyllic getaway for the Boston elite make the area a goldmine for history buffs. Many grand estates from centuries past now serve as public venues and museums, and several historic factories have been repurposed as well.

The city is rich in culture, with a robust arts council, two universities in town, and a unique international community. Being just a few miles from downtown Boston, apartments in Waltham have direct access to one of America’s most distinctive cities, as well as the benefits of several nearby parks and nature preserves.

YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksFree 3 Credit ScoresView Your 3 Bureau Credit Scores.See Your Scores Instantly! w/ Trialwww.freescorefinder.comAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection1. Overlook At Lakemont5305 Lakemont Blvd SEBellevue, WA 98006(425) 747-1347ApartmentsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection2. Overlook At Lakemont5409 Village Park Dr SEBellevue, WA 98006(425) 957-3984ApartmentsFurnished ApartmentsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection3. Overlook At Magnolia3401 25th Ave WSeattle, WA 98199(206) 403-1864Apartment Finder & Rental ServiceWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection4. Overlook At Magnolia3601 26th Pl WSeattle, WA 98199(206) 397-4003ApartmentsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection5. Overlook At MagnoliaBBB Rating: A+3520 27th Pl WSeattle, WA 98199(206) 284-7040ApartmentsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection6. Overlook At Westridge600 SW Kenyon StSeattle, WA 98106(206) 763-9982ApartmentsWebsiteBusinesses in related categories to ApartmentsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection7. Elevation Apartments17202 NE 85th PlRedmond, WA 98052(425) 885-1128ApartmentsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection8. The Riverside Apartments7435 159th Pl NERedmond, WA 98052(425) 867-0600ApartmentsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection9. Park Vista Apartments8700 164th Ave NERedmond, WA 98052(425) 881-2523ApartmentsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection10. Sammamish Forest Manors17412 NE 129th StRedmond, WA 98052(425) 747-7200ApartmentsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection11. Village At Overlake StationBBB Rating: A+2580 152nd Ave NERedmond, WA 98052(425) 746-3338ApartmentsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection12. Archstone Redmond Hill(3)BBB Rating: A+6110 186th Pl NERedmond, WA 98052(425) 882-2475ApartmentsWebsiteThe other reviewers are absolutely correct, this place is awful.
