The sale of ETFs is subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). iShares ETFs and Fidelity ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity if held less than 30 days.



$4.95 commission applies to online U.S. equity trades in a Fidelity retail account only for Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC retail clients. Certain accounts may require a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Sell orders are subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.

          1. Strategic Insight Simfund/FI Desktop, data as of 7/31/2013. Based on a comparison of total expense ratios for U.S. sector level ETFs with similar holdings and investment objectives (using the MSCI and S&P Global Industry Classification System — GICS) within the universe of 298 ETFs Morningstar has classified as the Sector Stock asset class.
	
    

          2. BlackRock Global ETP Landscape Report 12/31/2015. Based on AUM, net new flows, and number of ETFs.
	
    

          3. The BlackRock Diversified Income Portfolio is composed of exchange-traded products (ETPs)—primarily exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—but may contain other investment vehicles, such as mutual funds.
	
    

          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities, which may include the risks associated with investing in smaller companies, foreign securities, commodities, and fixed income investments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. ETPs that target a small universe of securities, such as a specific region or market sector, are generally subject to greater market volatility, as well as to the specific risks associated with that sector, region, or other focus. ETPs that use derivatives, leverage, or complex investment strategies are subject to additional risks. The return of an index ETP is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses, and tracking error. An ETP may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV) (or indicative value in the case of exchange-traded notes). The degree of liquidity can vary significantly from one ETP to another and losses may be magnified if no liquid market exists for the ETP's shares when attempting to sell them. Each ETP has a unique risk profile, detailed in its prospectus, offering circular, or similar material, which should be considered carefully when making investment decisions.

Research is provided by independent companies not affiliated with Fidelity. Please determine which security, product, or service is right for you based on your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial situation. Be sure to review your decisions periodically to make sure they are still consistent with your goals.

Free commission offer applies to online purchases of select iShares ETFs in a Fidelity account. Fidelity accounts may require
minimum balances. The sale of ETFs is subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). iShares ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity if held less than 30 days.


Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.


          * Expense ratio is the total annual fund operating expense ratio from the fund's most recent prospectus.
	
    


ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.



IMPORTANT FEE INFORMATION: Certain of Fidelity’s stock and bond index mutual funds have max short-term redemption fees of up to 1.5% for eligible shares held less than a maximum of 90 days. Fidelity may deduct a small-balance maintenance fee of $12 from a fund balance with a value of less than $2,000 in shares, while Vanguard funds may charge an annual account service fee of $20 for fund balances below $10,000. Fidelity and Vanguard offer other share classes of these funds with different investment minimums and expense ratios.
	
    

Please note: When comparing funds, please consider all important factors, including information pertaining to fund fees, fund features, and fund objectives. While funds may track an index, the indices and strategies employed in seeking to achieve an investment goal may be different. Each fund’s investment object and strategy and index tracked to achieve investment goals may differ. For new investors, funding investment minimums may be different.
	
    

Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.



Before investing in any mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, you should consider its investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus, offering circular or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
