If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]




Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante, an early model


Seeking to develop a domestic aircraft industry, the Brazilian government made several investments in this area during the 1940s and '50s.[8] However, it was not until 1969 that Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica (Embraer) was created as a government-owned corporation.[9] Its first president, Ozires Silva, was a government appointee, and the company initially produced a turboprop passenger aircraft, the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante.[10]
Early growth[edit]
The Brazilian Government contributed to Embraer's early growth by providing production contracts.[11] The company sold solely to the domestic market until 1975.
While military aircraft made up the majority of Embraer's products during the 1970s, including the Embraer AT-26 Xavante and the Embraer EMB 312 Tucano,[citation needed] by 1985, it had debuted a regional airliner, the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia.[12] Aimed at the export market, this plane was the first of Embraer's highly successful small airliners.[13]
License-built Pipers[edit]
In 1974, the company started to produce Piper Aircraft light planes under license.[14] Piper first put together knock-down kits in their US factory for Embraer to assemble and market in Brazil and Latin America.[citation needed] By 1978, most of the parts and components were being sourced locally.[14] Between 1974 and 2000, nearly 2,500 license-built Pipers were produced by Embraer.[14]
Privatization[edit]
Born from a Brazilian government plan and having been state-run from the beginning,[8] Embraer began a privatization process during the government of Itamar Franco.[15] This was a period of privatization for many state-controlled companies in Brazil. Embraer was sold on December 7, 1994,[9][16] which helped it avoid a looming bankruptcy.[8] The company continued to win government contracts.[citation needed]
The Brazilian government retains interest through possession of golden shares, which allow it veto power.[13]
Initial public offerings[edit]
In 2000, Embraer made simultaneous initial public offerings on the NYSE and BM&F Bovespa stock exchanges. In 2008 its NYSE-traded shares were American Depositary Receipts representing 4 BM&F Bovespa shares and ownership was : Bozano Group 11.10%, Previ 16.40%, Sistel 7.40%, Dassault Aviation 2.1%, EADS 2.1%, Thales 2.1%, Safran 1.1%, Government of Brazil 0.3%, the remainder being publicly traded.[13]
As of December 31, 2014 the shareholders with more than 5% of the Company´s Capital were :[17]

Oppenheimer Funds, Inc., 12.29%
pt:Caixa de Previdência dos Funcionários do Banco do Brasil, 6.71%
Baillie Gifford, 6.46%
BNDESPAR, 5.31%.

Product line expansion: military, regional and executive[edit]




Embraer 190


In the mid-1990s, the company pursued a product line more focused on small commercial planes over the military aircraft that had previously made up the majority of its manufacturing.[8] It soon expanded to the production of larger regional airliners, with 70–110 seats, and smaller business jets.[13] Today, the company manufactures for both defense and commerce.[13]
Executive jets[edit]
At the 2000 Farnborough Airshow, Embraer launched the Legacy 600, a business jet variant of the ERJ. In 2002, a dedicated business unit was organised as Embraer Executive Jets as the Legacy was introduced. In 2005, the Phenom 100 was then conceptualised as an air taxi like the Eclipse 500, competing with Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft. It was introduced in 2008 and is the basis of the larger Phenom 300. The midsize Legacy 450 and Legacy 500 were jointly developed as clean sheet designs, where the Lineage 1000 is a VIP version of the E190. In 2016, Embraer delivered its 1,000th executive jet and have a market share of 17% by volume, acknowledging it lacks an ultra-long-range large cabin jet.[18]
Military transport[edit]
On April 19, 2007, Embraer announced it was considering the production of a twin-jet military transport, the Embraer KC-390. Work began in May 2009 with funding from the Brazilian Air Force.[19] Correios, the Brazilian postal service, has shown interest in buying this aircraft.[20][21] Using much of the technology developed for the Embraer 190, the C-390 would carry up to 23 tons of cargo[22] and aims to replace Cold War-era cargo aircraft.[23]
While firm orders for this yet-to-be-produced hauler had not yet been made in the fall of 2010,[19] Argentina had asked for six examples and several other South American nations also expressed interest.[24][25]
Government subsidy controversy[edit]
Main article: Bombardier Aerospace and Embraer S.A. government subsidy controversy
Brazil and Canada engaged in an international, adjudicated trade dispute over government subsidies to domestic plane-makers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The World Trade Organization determined that both countries had provided illegal subsidies to what were supposed to be privately owned industries. Brazil ran an illegal subsidy program, Proex, benefiting its national aviation industry from at least 1999–2000, and Canada illegally subsidized its indigenous regional airliner industry, comprising Bombardier Aerospace.
Production bases and facilities[edit]
The company's headquarters and a production base are in São José dos Campos, São Paulo, Brazil. It also has production bases in the State of São Paulo at Botucatu, Eugênio de Melo (a district of São José dos Campos) and Gavião Peixoto. The company has offices in Beijing, Fort Lauderdale, Florida (US), Paris, Singapore, and Washington, DC (US).[26]

Future[edit]
In October 2010, Embraer suggested plans to develop very-long-range business jets, entering a sector currently dominated by Gulfstream, Bombardier, and Dassault.[31] In October 2013, they unveiled the Lineage 1000E.[32]
In May 2011, Embraer announced that it was considering building a larger airliner than the E-jets, with five-abreast seating,[33] but, eventually, choose to develop the second generation of its E-Jet family, as E-jets E2.[34]
In Feb 2014, India's newest airline, Air Costa, announced an order for 50 E-jets E2 aircraft worth $2.94 billion at list price. The order has an option for another 50 planes.[35]

History[edit]




Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante, an early model


Seeking to develop a domestic aircraft industry, the Brazilian government made several investments in this area during the 1940s and '50s.[8] However, it was not until 1969 that Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica (Embraer) was created as a government-owned corporation.[9] Its first president, Ozires Silva, was a government appointee, and the company initially produced a turboprop passenger aircraft, the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante.[10]
Early growth[edit]
The Brazilian Government contributed to Embraer's early growth by providing production contracts.[11] The company sold solely to the domestic market until 1975.
While military aircraft made up the majority of Embraer's products during the 1970s, including the Embraer AT-26 Xavante and the Embraer EMB 312 Tucano,[citation needed] by 1985, it had debuted a regional airliner, the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia.[12] Aimed at the export market, this plane was the first of Embraer's highly successful small airliners.[13]
License-built Pipers[edit]
In 1974, the company started to produce Piper Aircraft light planes under license.[14] Piper first put together knock-down kits in their US factory for Embraer to assemble and market in Brazil and Latin America.[citation needed] By 1978, most of the parts and components were being sourced locally.[14] Between 1974 and 2000, nearly 2,500 license-built Pipers were produced by Embraer.[14]
Privatization[edit]
Born from a Brazilian government plan and having been state-run from the beginning,[8] Embraer began a privatization process during the government of Itamar Franco.[15] This was a period of privatization for many state-controlled companies in Brazil. Embraer was sold on December 7, 1994,[9][16] which helped it avoid a looming bankruptcy.[8] The company continued to win government contracts.[citation needed]
The Brazilian government retains interest through possession of golden shares, which allow it veto power.[13]
Initial public offerings[edit]
In 2000, Embraer made simultaneous initial public offerings on the NYSE and BM&F Bovespa stock exchanges. In 2008 its NYSE-traded shares were American Depositary Receipts representing 4 BM&F Bovespa shares and ownership was : Bozano Group 11.10%, Previ 16.40%, Sistel 7.40%, Dassault Aviation 2.1%, EADS 2.1%, Thales 2.1%, Safran 1.1%, Government of Brazil 0.3%, the remainder being publicly traded.[13]
As of December 31, 2014 the shareholders with more than 5% of the Company´s Capital were :[17]

Oppenheimer Funds, Inc., 12.29%
pt:Caixa de Previdência dos Funcionários do Banco do Brasil, 6.71%
Baillie Gifford, 6.46%
BNDESPAR, 5.31%.

Product line expansion: military, regional and executive[edit]




Embraer 190


In the mid-1990s, the company pursued a product line more focused on small commercial planes over the military aircraft that had previously made up the majority of its manufacturing.[8] It soon expanded to the production of larger regional airliners, with 70–110 seats, and smaller business jets.[13] Today, the company manufactures for both defense and commerce.[13]
Executive jets[edit]
At the 2000 Farnborough Airshow, Embraer launched the Legacy 600, a business jet variant of the ERJ. In 2002, a dedicated business unit was organised as Embraer Executive Jets as the Legacy was introduced. In 2005, the Phenom 100 was then conceptualised as an air taxi like the Eclipse 500, competing with Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft. It was introduced in 2008 and is the basis of the larger Phenom 300. The midsize Legacy 450 and Legacy 500 were jointly developed as clean sheet designs, where the Lineage 1000 is a VIP version of the E190. In 2016, Embraer delivered its 1,000th executive jet and have a market share of 17% by volume, acknowledging it lacks an ultra-long-range large cabin jet.[18]
Military transport[edit]
On April 19, 2007, Embraer announced it was considering the production of a twin-jet military transport, the Embraer KC-390. Work began in May 2009 with funding from the Brazilian Air Force.[19] Correios, the Brazilian postal service, has shown interest in buying this aircraft.[20][21] Using much of the technology developed for the Embraer 190, the C-390 would carry up to 23 tons of cargo[22] and aims to replace Cold War-era cargo aircraft.[23]
While firm orders for this yet-to-be-produced hauler had not yet been made in the fall of 2010,[19] Argentina had asked for six examples and several other South American nations also expressed interest.[24][25]
Government subsidy controversy[edit]
Main article: Bombardier Aerospace and Embraer S.A. government subsidy controversy
Brazil and Canada engaged in an international, adjudicated trade dispute over government subsidies to domestic plane-makers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The World Trade Organization determined that both countries had provided illegal subsidies to what were supposed to be privately owned industries. Brazil ran an illegal subsidy program, Proex, benefiting its national aviation industry from at least 1999–2000, and Canada illegally subsidized its indigenous regional airliner industry, comprising Bombardier Aerospace.
Production bases and facilities[edit]
The company's headquarters and a production base are in São José dos Campos, São Paulo, Brazil. It also has production bases in the State of São Paulo at Botucatu, Eugênio de Melo (a district of São José dos Campos) and Gavião Peixoto. The company has offices in Beijing, Fort Lauderdale, Florida (US), Paris, Singapore, and Washington, DC (US).[26]

Future[edit]
In October 2010, Embraer suggested plans to develop very-long-range business jets, entering a sector currently dominated by Gulfstream, Bombardier, and Dassault.[31] In October 2013, they unveiled the Lineage 1000E.[32]
In May 2011, Embraer announced that it was considering building a larger airliner than the E-jets, with five-abreast seating,[33] but, eventually, choose to develop the second generation of its E-Jet family, as E-jets E2.[34]
In Feb 2014, India's newest airline, Air Costa, announced an order for 50 E-jets E2 aircraft worth $2.94 billion at list price. The order has an option for another 50 planes.[35]

History[edit]




Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante, an early model


Seeking to develop a domestic aircraft industry, the Brazilian government made several investments in this area during the 1940s and '50s.[8] However, it was not until 1969 that Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica (Embraer) was created as a government-owned corporation.[9] Its first president, Ozires Silva, was a government appointee, and the company initially produced a turboprop passenger aircraft, the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante.[10]
Early growth[edit]
The Brazilian Government contributed to Embraer's early growth by providing production contracts.[11] The company sold solely to the domestic market until 1975.
While military aircraft made up the majority of Embraer's products during the 1970s, including the Embraer AT-26 Xavante and the Embraer EMB 312 Tucano,[citation needed] by 1985, it had debuted a regional airliner, the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia.[12] Aimed at the export market, this plane was the first of Embraer's highly successful small airliners.[13]
License-built Pipers[edit]
In 1974, the company started to produce Piper Aircraft light planes under license.[14] Piper first put together knock-down kits in their US factory for Embraer to assemble and market in Brazil and Latin America.[citation needed] By 1978, most of the parts and components were being sourced locally.[14] Between 1974 and 2000, nearly 2,500 license-built Pipers were produced by Embraer.[14]
Privatization[edit]
Born from a Brazilian government plan and having been state-run from the beginning,[8] Embraer began a privatization process during the government of Itamar Franco.[15] This was a period of privatization for many state-controlled companies in Brazil. Embraer was sold on December 7, 1994,[9][16] which helped it avoid a looming bankruptcy.[8] The company continued to win government contracts.[citation needed]
The Brazilian government retains interest through possession of golden shares, which allow it veto power.[13]
Initial public offerings[edit]
In 2000, Embraer made simultaneous initial public offerings on the NYSE and BM&F Bovespa stock exchanges. In 2008 its NYSE-traded shares were American Depositary Receipts representing 4 BM&F Bovespa shares and ownership was : Bozano Group 11.10%, Previ 16.40%, Sistel 7.40%, Dassault Aviation 2.1%, EADS 2.1%, Thales 2.1%, Safran 1.1%, Government of Brazil 0.3%, the remainder being publicly traded.[13]
As of December 31, 2014 the shareholders with more than 5% of the Company´s Capital were :[17]

Oppenheimer Funds, Inc., 12.29%
pt:Caixa de Previdência dos Funcionários do Banco do Brasil, 6.71%
Baillie Gifford, 6.46%
BNDESPAR, 5.31%.

Product line expansion: military, regional and executive[edit]




Embraer 190


In the mid-1990s, the company pursued a product line more focused on small commercial planes over the military aircraft that had previously made up the majority of its manufacturing.[8] It soon expanded to the production of larger regional airliners, with 70–110 seats, and smaller business jets.[13] Today, the company manufactures for both defense and commerce.[13]
Executive jets[edit]
At the 2000 Farnborough Airshow, Embraer launched the Legacy 600, a business jet variant of the ERJ. In 2002, a dedicated business unit was organised as Embraer Executive Jets as the Legacy was introduced. In 2005, the Phenom 100 was then conceptualised as an air taxi like the Eclipse 500, competing with Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft. It was introduced in 2008 and is the basis of the larger Phenom 300. The midsize Legacy 450 and Legacy 500 were jointly developed as clean sheet designs, where the Lineage 1000 is a VIP version of the E190. In 2016, Embraer delivered its 1,000th executive jet and have a market share of 17% by volume, acknowledging it lacks an ultra-long-range large cabin jet.[18]
Military transport[edit]
On April 19, 2007, Embraer announced it was considering the production of a twin-jet military transport, the Embraer KC-390. Work began in May 2009 with funding from the Brazilian Air Force.[19] Correios, the Brazilian postal service, has shown interest in buying this aircraft.[20][21] Using much of the technology developed for the Embraer 190, the C-390 would carry up to 23 tons of cargo[22] and aims to replace Cold War-era cargo aircraft.[23]
While firm orders for this yet-to-be-produced hauler had not yet been made in the fall of 2010,[19] Argentina had asked for six examples and several other South American nations also expressed interest.[24][25]
Government subsidy controversy[edit]
Main article: Bombardier Aerospace and Embraer S.A. government subsidy controversy
Brazil and Canada engaged in an international, adjudicated trade dispute over government subsidies to domestic plane-makers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The World Trade Organization determined that both countries had provided illegal subsidies to what were supposed to be privately owned industries. Brazil ran an illegal subsidy program, Proex, benefiting its national aviation industry from at least 1999–2000, and Canada illegally subsidized its indigenous regional airliner industry, comprising Bombardier Aerospace.
Production bases and facilities[edit]
The company's headquarters and a production base are in São José dos Campos, São Paulo, Brazil. It also has production bases in the State of São Paulo at Botucatu, Eugênio de Melo (a district of São José dos Campos) and Gavião Peixoto. The company has offices in Beijing, Fort Lauderdale, Florida (US), Paris, Singapore, and Washington, DC (US).[26]

Future[edit]
In October 2010, Embraer suggested plans to develop very-long-range business jets, entering a sector currently dominated by Gulfstream, Bombardier, and Dassault.[31] In October 2013, they unveiled the Lineage 1000E.[32]
In May 2011, Embraer announced that it was considering building a larger airliner than the E-jets, with five-abreast seating,[33] but, eventually, choose to develop the second generation of its E-Jet family, as E-jets E2.[34]
In Feb 2014, India's newest airline, Air Costa, announced an order for 50 E-jets E2 aircraft worth $2.94 billion at list price. The order has an option for another 50 planes.[35]

History[edit]




Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante, an early model


Seeking to develop a domestic aircraft industry, the Brazilian government made several investments in this area during the 1940s and '50s.[8] However, it was not until 1969 that Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica (Embraer) was created as a government-owned corporation.[9] Its first president, Ozires Silva, was a government appointee, and the company initially produced a turboprop passenger aircraft, the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante.[10]
Early growth[edit]
The Brazilian Government contributed to Embraer's early growth by providing production contracts.[11] The company sold solely to the domestic market until 1975.
While military aircraft made up the majority of Embraer's products during the 1970s, including the Embraer AT-26 Xavante and the Embraer EMB 312 Tucano,[citation needed] by 1985, it had debuted a regional airliner, the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia.[12] Aimed at the export market, this plane was the first of Embraer's highly successful small airliners.[13]
License-built Pipers[edit]
In 1974, the company started to produce Piper Aircraft light planes under license.[14] Piper first put together knock-down kits in their US factory for Embraer to assemble and market in Brazil and Latin America.[citation needed] By 1978, most of the parts and components were being sourced locally.[14] Between 1974 and 2000, nearly 2,500 license-built Pipers were produced by Embraer.[14]
Privatization[edit]
Born from a Brazilian government plan and having been state-run from the beginning,[8] Embraer began a privatization process during the government of Itamar Franco.[15] This was a period of privatization for many state-controlled companies in Brazil. Embraer was sold on December 7, 1994,[9][16] which helped it avoid a looming bankruptcy.[8] The company continued to win government contracts.[citation needed]
The Brazilian government retains interest through possession of golden shares, which allow it veto power.[13]
Initial public offerings[edit]
In 2000, Embraer made simultaneous initial public offerings on the NYSE and BM&F Bovespa stock exchanges. In 2008 its NYSE-traded shares were American Depositary Receipts representing 4 BM&F Bovespa shares and ownership was : Bozano Group 11.10%, Previ 16.40%, Sistel 7.40%, Dassault Aviation 2.1%, EADS 2.1%, Thales 2.1%, Safran 1.1%, Government of Brazil 0.3%, the remainder being publicly traded.[13]
As of December 31, 2014 the shareholders with more than 5% of the Company´s Capital were :[17]

Oppenheimer Funds, Inc., 12.29%
pt:Caixa de Previdência dos Funcionários do Banco do Brasil, 6.71%
Baillie Gifford, 6.46%
BNDESPAR, 5.31%.

Product line expansion: military, regional and executive[edit]




Embraer 190


In the mid-1990s, the company pursued a product line more focused on small commercial planes over the military aircraft that had previously made up the majority of its manufacturing.[8] It soon expanded to the production of larger regional airliners, with 70–110 seats, and smaller business jets.[13] Today, the company manufactures for both defense and commerce.[13]
Executive jets[edit]
At the 2000 Farnborough Airshow, Embraer launched the Legacy 600, a business jet variant of the ERJ. In 2002, a dedicated business unit was organised as Embraer Executive Jets as the Legacy was introduced. In 2005, the Phenom 100 was then conceptualised as an air taxi like the Eclipse 500, competing with Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft. It was introduced in 2008 and is the basis of the larger Phenom 300. The midsize Legacy 450 and Legacy 500 were jointly developed as clean sheet designs, where the Lineage 1000 is a VIP version of the E190. In 2016, Embraer delivered its 1,000th executive jet and have a market share of 17% by volume, acknowledging it lacks an ultra-long-range large cabin jet.[18]
Military transport[edit]
On April 19, 2007, Embraer announced it was considering the production of a twin-jet military transport, the Embraer KC-390. Work began in May 2009 with funding from the Brazilian Air Force.[19] Correios, the Brazilian postal service, has shown interest in buying this aircraft.[20][21] Using much of the technology developed for the Embraer 190, the C-390 would carry up to 23 tons of cargo[22] and aims to replace Cold War-era cargo aircraft.[23]
While firm orders for this yet-to-be-produced hauler had not yet been made in the fall of 2010,[19] Argentina had asked for six examples and several other South American nations also expressed interest.[24][25]
Government subsidy controversy[edit]
Main article: Bombardier Aerospace and Embraer S.A. government subsidy controversy
Brazil and Canada engaged in an international, adjudicated trade dispute over government subsidies to domestic plane-makers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The World Trade Organization determined that both countries had provided illegal subsidies to what were supposed to be privately owned industries. Brazil ran an illegal subsidy program, Proex, benefiting its national aviation industry from at least 1999–2000, and Canada illegally subsidized its indigenous regional airliner industry, comprising Bombardier Aerospace.
Production bases and facilities[edit]
The company's headquarters and a production base are in São José dos Campos, São Paulo, Brazil. It also has production bases in the State of São Paulo at Botucatu, Eugênio de Melo (a district of São José dos Campos) and Gavião Peixoto. The company has offices in Beijing, Fort Lauderdale, Florida (US), Paris, Singapore, and Washington, DC (US).[26]

Future[edit]
In October 2010, Embraer suggested plans to develop very-long-range business jets, entering a sector currently dominated by Gulfstream, Bombardier, and Dassault.[31] In October 2013, they unveiled the Lineage 1000E.[32]
In May 2011, Embraer announced that it was considering building a larger airliner than the E-jets, with five-abreast seating,[33] but, eventually, choose to develop the second generation of its E-Jet family, as E-jets E2.[34]
In Feb 2014, India's newest airline, Air Costa, announced an order for 50 E-jets E2 aircraft worth $2.94 billion at list price. The order has an option for another 50 planes.[35]

History[edit]




Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante, an early model


Seeking to develop a domestic aircraft industry, the Brazilian government made several investments in this area during the 1940s and '50s.[8] However, it was not until 1969 that Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica (Embraer) was created as a government-owned corporation.[9] Its first president, Ozires Silva, was a government appointee, and the company initially produced a turboprop passenger aircraft, the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante.[10]
Early growth[edit]
The Brazilian Government contributed to Embraer's early growth by providing production contracts.[11] The company sold solely to the domestic market until 1975.
While military aircraft made up the majority of Embraer's products during the 1970s, including the Embraer AT-26 Xavante and the Embraer EMB 312 Tucano,[citation needed] by 1985, it had debuted a regional airliner, the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia.[12] Aimed at the export market, this plane was the first of Embraer's highly successful small airliners.[13]
License-built Pipers[edit]
In 1974, the company started to produce Piper Aircraft light planes under license.[14] Piper first put together knock-down kits in their US factory for Embraer to assemble and market in Brazil and Latin America.[citation needed] By 1978, most of the parts and components were being sourced locally.[14] Between 1974 and 2000, nearly 2,500 license-built Pipers were produced by Embraer.[14]
Privatization[edit]
Born from a Brazilian government plan and having been state-run from the beginning,[8] Embraer began a privatization process during the government of Itamar Franco.[15] This was a period of privatization for many state-controlled companies in Brazil. Embraer was sold on December 7, 1994,[9][16] which helped it avoid a looming bankruptcy.[8] The company continued to win government contracts.[citation needed]
The Brazilian government retains interest through possession of golden shares, which allow it veto power.[13]
Initial public offerings[edit]
In 2000, Embraer made simultaneous initial public offerings on the NYSE and BM&F Bovespa stock exchanges. In 2008 its NYSE-traded shares were American Depositary Receipts representing 4 BM&F Bovespa shares and ownership was : Bozano Group 11.10%, Previ 16.40%, Sistel 7.40%, Dassault Aviation 2.1%, EADS 2.1%, Thales 2.1%, Safran 1.1%, Government of Brazil 0.3%, the remainder being publicly traded.[13]
As of December 31, 2014 the shareholders with more than 5% of the Company´s Capital were :[17]

Oppenheimer Funds, Inc., 12.29%
pt:Caixa de Previdência dos Funcionários do Banco do Brasil, 6.71%
Baillie Gifford, 6.46%
BNDESPAR, 5.31%.

Product line expansion: military, regional and executive[edit]




Embraer 190


In the mid-1990s, the company pursued a product line more focused on small commercial planes over the military aircraft that had previously made up the majority of its manufacturing.[8] It soon expanded to the production of larger regional airliners, with 70–110 seats, and smaller business jets.[13] Today, the company manufactures for both defense and commerce.[13]
Executive jets[edit]
At the 2000 Farnborough Airshow, Embraer launched the Legacy 600, a business jet variant of the ERJ. In 2002, a dedicated business unit was organised as Embraer Executive Jets as the Legacy was introduced. In 2005, the Phenom 100 was then conceptualised as an air taxi like the Eclipse 500, competing with Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft. It was introduced in 2008 and is the basis of the larger Phenom 300. The midsize Legacy 450 and Legacy 500 were jointly developed as clean sheet designs, where the Lineage 1000 is a VIP version of the E190. In 2016, Embraer delivered its 1,000th executive jet and have a market share of 17% by volume, acknowledging it lacks an ultra-long-range large cabin jet.[18]
Military transport[edit]
On April 19, 2007, Embraer announced it was considering the production of a twin-jet military transport, the Embraer KC-390. Work began in May 2009 with funding from the Brazilian Air Force.[19] Correios, the Brazilian postal service, has shown interest in buying this aircraft.[20][21] Using much of the technology developed for the Embraer 190, the C-390 would carry up to 23 tons of cargo[22] and aims to replace Cold War-era cargo aircraft.[23]
While firm orders for this yet-to-be-produced hauler had not yet been made in the fall of 2010,[19] Argentina had asked for six examples and several other South American nations also expressed interest.[24][25]
Government subsidy controversy[edit]
Main article: Bombardier Aerospace and Embraer S.A. government subsidy controversy
Brazil and Canada engaged in an international, adjudicated trade dispute over government subsidies to domestic plane-makers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The World Trade Organization determined that both countries had provided illegal subsidies to what were supposed to be privately owned industries. Brazil ran an illegal subsidy program, Proex, benefiting its national aviation industry from at least 1999–2000, and Canada illegally subsidized its indigenous regional airliner industry, comprising Bombardier Aerospace.
Production bases and facilities[edit]
The company's headquarters and a production base are in São José dos Campos, São Paulo, Brazil. It also has production bases in the State of São Paulo at Botucatu, Eugênio de Melo (a district of São José dos Campos) and Gavião Peixoto. The company has offices in Beijing, Fort Lauderdale, Florida (US), Paris, Singapore, and Washington, DC (US).[26]

Future[edit]
In October 2010, Embraer suggested plans to develop very-long-range business jets, entering a sector currently dominated by Gulfstream, Bombardier, and Dassault.[31] In October 2013, they unveiled the Lineage 1000E.[32]
In May 2011, Embraer announced that it was considering building a larger airliner than the E-jets, with five-abreast seating,[33] but, eventually, choose to develop the second generation of its E-Jet family, as E-jets E2.[34]
In Feb 2014, India's newest airline, Air Costa, announced an order for 50 E-jets E2 aircraft worth $2.94 billion at list price. The order has an option for another 50 planes.[35]

History[edit]




Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante, an early model


Seeking to develop a domestic aircraft industry, the Brazilian government made several investments in this area during the 1940s and '50s.[8] However, it was not until 1969 that Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica (Embraer) was created as a government-owned corporation.[9] Its first president, Ozires Silva, was a government appointee, and the company initially produced a turboprop passenger aircraft, the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante.[10]
Early growth[edit]
The Brazilian Government contributed to Embraer's early growth by providing production contracts.[11] The company sold solely to the domestic market until 1975.
While military aircraft made up the majority of Embraer's products during the 1970s, including the Embraer AT-26 Xavante and the Embraer EMB 312 Tucano,[citation needed] by 1985, it had debuted a regional airliner, the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia.[12] Aimed at the export market, this plane was the first of Embraer's highly successful small airliners.[13]
License-built Pipers[edit]
In 1974, the company started to produce Piper Aircraft light planes under license.[14] Piper first put together knock-down kits in their US factory for Embraer to assemble and market in Brazil and Latin America.[citation needed] By 1978, most of the parts and components were being sourced locally.[14] Between 1974 and 2000, nearly 2,500 license-built Pipers were produced by Embraer.[14]
Privatization[edit]
Born from a Brazilian government plan and having been state-run from the beginning,[8] Embraer began a privatization process during the government of Itamar Franco.[15] This was a period of privatization for many state-controlled companies in Brazil. Embraer was sold on December 7, 1994,[9][16] which helped it avoid a looming bankruptcy.[8] The company continued to win government contracts.[citation needed]
The Brazilian government retains interest through possession of golden shares, which allow it veto power.[13]
Initial public offerings[edit]
In 2000, Embraer made simultaneous initial public offerings on the NYSE and BM&F Bovespa stock exchanges. In 2008 its NYSE-traded shares were American Depositary Receipts representing 4 BM&F Bovespa shares and ownership was : Bozano Group 11.10%, Previ 16.40%, Sistel 7.40%, Dassault Aviation 2.1%, EADS 2.1%, Thales 2.1%, Safran 1.1%, Government of Brazil 0.3%, the remainder being publicly traded.[13]
As of December 31, 2014 the shareholders with more than 5% of the Company´s Capital were :[17]

Oppenheimer Funds, Inc., 12.29%
pt:Caixa de Previdência dos Funcionários do Banco do Brasil, 6.71%
Baillie Gifford, 6.46%
BNDESPAR, 5.31%.

Product line expansion: military, regional and executive[edit]




Embraer 190


In the mid-1990s, the company pursued a product line more focused on small commercial planes over the military aircraft that had previously made up the majority of its manufacturing.[8] It soon expanded to the production of larger regional airliners, with 70–110 seats, and smaller business jets.[13] Today, the company manufactures for both defense and commerce.[13]
Executive jets[edit]
At the 2000 Farnborough Airshow, Embraer launched the Legacy 600, a business jet variant of the ERJ. In 2002, a dedicated business unit was organised as Embraer Executive Jets as the Legacy was introduced. In 2005, the Phenom 100 was then conceptualised as an air taxi like the Eclipse 500, competing with Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft. It was introduced in 2008 and is the basis of the larger Phenom 300. The midsize Legacy 450 and Legacy 500 were jointly developed as clean sheet designs, where the Lineage 1000 is a VIP version of the E190. In 2016, Embraer delivered its 1,000th executive jet and have a market share of 17% by volume, acknowledging it lacks an ultra-long-range large cabin jet.[18]
Military transport[edit]
On April 19, 2007, Embraer announced it was considering the production of a twin-jet military transport, the Embraer KC-390. Work began in May 2009 with funding from the Brazilian Air Force.[19] Correios, the Brazilian postal service, has shown interest in buying this aircraft.[20][21] Using much of the technology developed for the Embraer 190, the C-390 would carry up to 23 tons of cargo[22] and aims to replace Cold War-era cargo aircraft.[23]
While firm orders for this yet-to-be-produced hauler had not yet been made in the fall of 2010,[19] Argentina had asked for six examples and several other South American nations also expressed interest.[24][25]
Government subsidy controversy[edit]
Main article: Bombardier Aerospace and Embraer S.A. government subsidy controversy
Brazil and Canada engaged in an international, adjudicated trade dispute over government subsidies to domestic plane-makers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The World Trade Organization determined that both countries had provided illegal subsidies to what were supposed to be privately owned industries. Brazil ran an illegal subsidy program, Proex, benefiting its national aviation industry from at least 1999–2000, and Canada illegally subsidized its indigenous regional airliner industry, comprising Bombardier Aerospace.
Production bases and facilities[edit]
The company's headquarters and a production base are in São José dos Campos, São Paulo, Brazil. It also has production bases in the State of São Paulo at Botucatu, Eugênio de Melo (a district of São José dos Campos) and Gavião Peixoto. The company has offices in Beijing, Fort Lauderdale, Florida (US), Paris, Singapore, and Washington, DC (US).[26]

Future[edit]
In October 2010, Embraer suggested plans to develop very-long-range business jets, entering a sector currently dominated by Gulfstream, Bombardier, and Dassault.[31] In October 2013, they unveiled the Lineage 1000E.[32]
In May 2011, Embraer announced that it was considering building a larger airliner than the E-jets, with five-abreast seating,[33] but, eventually, choose to develop the second generation of its E-Jet family, as E-jets E2.[34]
In Feb 2014, India's newest airline, Air Costa, announced an order for 50 E-jets E2 aircraft worth $2.94 billion at list price. The order has an option for another 50 planes.[35]

SAO JOSE DOS CAMPOS, Brazil, Feb. 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Widerøe, the largest regional airline in Scandinavia, will be the first airline in the world to receive the brand-new E190-E2 jet, the first member of the E-Jets E2, the second generation of the E-Jets family of commercial aircraft. As the launch operator of the model, Widerøe will receive their first aircraft in the first half of 2018.








Widerøe has a contract with Embraer for up to 15 E2 family jets consisting of three firm orders for the E190-E2 and purchase rights for 12 further E2 family aircraft. The order has a potential list price value of up to USD 873 million, with all orders being exercised.
"The market is keen to know the identity of the E190-E2 launch operator, and we're pleased to end that suspense on this Valentine's Day - Widerøe is the 'perfect match'. The airline has a special place in our hearts; Widerøe are proven pioneers in their field who have achieved major success and still remain hugely ambitious, similar in many ways to the path taken by Embraer", said John Slattery, President & CEO, Embraer Commercial Aviation. "The E2 program remains on target with technical specification guidance, on time and on budget. Our team remains focused on a successful delivery to Widerøe in the first half of next year."
Widerøe is configuring the E190-E2s in a comfortable single-class layout with 114 seats. With the Norway's airline order, the E-Jets E2 backlog has 275 firm orders plus Letters of Intent, options and purchase rights covering another 415 aircraft giving a total of 690 commitments from airlines and leasing companies.
Stein Nilsen, Chief Executive Officer of Widerøe, said, "We are very proud we will be the first airline in the world to operate the E190-E2. Knowing the hard-work Embraer is doing in the certification campaign, especially in terms of maturity, we have every confidence in a smooth entry into service. The E190-E2 will be a big leap in Widerøe's history, and our planning for the first deliveries is now well underway."
Embraer is the world's leading manufacturer of commercial jets with up to 130+ seats. The Company has 100 customers from all over the world operating the ERJ and the E-Jet families of aircraft. For the E-Jets program alone, Embraer has logged more than 1,700 orders and over 1,300 deliveries, redefining the traditional concept of regional aircraft by operating across a range of business applications.
