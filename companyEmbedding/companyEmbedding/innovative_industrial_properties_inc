Our Business







Our Team
Industry Leaders
Our Executive Chairman, Alan Gold, is a 30-year veteran of the real estate industry, including co-founding two New York Stock Exchange-listed REITs: BioMed Realty Trust (formerly NYSE: BMR), a REIT focused on acquiring, leasing, developing and managing laboratory and office space for the life science industry, where he served as chairman, chief executive officer, and president until Blackstone’s acquisition of BioMed Realty in 2016 for $8 billion; and Alexandria Real Estate Equities (NYSE: ARE), an urban office REIT focused on collaborative science and technology campuses, where he served as president and a director. Our senior management team has significant experience in all aspects of the real estate industry, including acquisitions, dispositions, construction, development, management and lending.
Our Market
The Licensed Medical-Use Cannabis Industry
We target medical-use cannabis facilities for acquisition, including sale-leaseback transactions, with tenants that are licensed growers under long-term triple-net leases. We believe this industry is poised for significant growth in coming years, and we are focused on being a creative capital provider to this industry through the long-term ownership of cultivators’ mission-critical facilities.
According to The ArcView Group, sales of legal cannabis in North America grew to $6.8 billion in 2016, up 34% from 2015.  Of the $6.8 billion in estimated sales in 2016, over $5.0 billion were medical-use sales.
As of December 31, 2016, 29 states and the District of Columbia allow their citizens to use medical cannabis, with an estimated combined population of over 200 million. We expect other states to approve medical-use cannabis in coming years as well, fueled by changing public attitudes in the United States.  A 2016 poll by Quinnipiac University found that 89% of Americans support patient access to medical-use cannabis, if recommended by a doctor. This follows a 2015 poll by Harris, which found 81% of Americans support the legalization of cannabis for medical use.
Our Properties
Medical-Use Cannabis Cultivation and Processing Facilities
We acquire specialized industrial real estate assets that are used for growing medical-use cannabis and operated by state-licensed growers. We focus on properties with sophisticated technology and infrastructure to meet rigorous quality standards for medical-use cannabis. Concurrently with our acquisition of these properties, we enter into leases with the state-licensed growers under long-term, triple-net lease agreements. We act as a source of capital to these licensed medical-use cannabis growers by entering into sale-leaseback transactions with them for their specialized industrial real estate.
Our Tenants
Sophisticated, Best-in-Class Medical-Use Cannabis Growers
We work with growers who have been among the top candidates in the rigorous state licensing process.
Through thorough research and analysis of the companies and their management teams, we identify what we consider to be the best licensed medical-use cannabis growers that would benefit from financing for their properties to raise capital to meet their growing needs. Our research expertise is instrumental to uncovering opportunities with the most qualified growers.
Our Leases
Long-Term, Triple-Net Arrangements
Our leases with tenants are generally long-term triple-net lease arrangements, where the tenant is responsible for taxes, maintenance, insurance and structural repairs, in addition to base rent. Our lease terms are generally fifteen years or more, with renewal options exercisable by the tenant, and with contractual annual rent adjustments. By selling the property and building to us, and then leasing it back from us, growers are able to redeploy the proceeds into their company’s core operation and yield a higher return than they would otherwise get from owning their own real estate.

Innovative Industrial Properties IPO Is First Shot at Pot | Time.comBusinessSearchSearchSign InSenateVulnerable GOP Senators May Pay A Price For Obamacare VotePoliticsObamacare SurvivesCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDWhite HouseJeff Sessions Wants to Mend His Tattered Relationship With President TrumpDave Warden, a bud tender at Private Organic Therapy (P.O.T.), a non-profit co-operative medical marijuana dispensary, displays various types of marijuana available to patients on October 19, 2009 in Los Angeles, California.  David McNew—Getty ImagesCompaniesInvestors Hoping To Ride High On Trailblazing Marijuana CompanyKevin KelleherNov 30, 2016With several states passing measures to legalize marijuana in 2016, the cannabis business looks poised to finally to take off. But for investors, there remains a quandary: How do you find a way to get in on the ground floor of this new growth industry?While wealthy Silicon Valley investors have been seeking out cannibis startups this year, the options are few and far between for public investors, who often lack the high net worth needed to access the private markets. That may begin changing this week as the first cannabis company plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).The company, named Innovative Industrial Properties, won't grow or sell any marijuana itself. Instead, it will lease facilities where cannabis companies can grow and process their product for sale. It's a Real Estate Investment Trust, or REIT, which functions like a mutual fund, only with a portfolio of real estate assets. But it could be the first chance everyday investors have to buy a piece of the emerging cannabis economy on a stock exchange.RelatedCompaniesHow Toymaker Mattel Plans to Win Over iPad-Obsessed KidsCompaniesHow Toymaker Mattel Plans to Win Over iPad-Obsessed KidsAfter decades of life as a black market staple, cannabis has become a nascent industry poised for rapid growth. California, Massachusetts, Nevada and Maine this month legalized marijuana through ballot measures, joining four other states and the District of Columbia. Another 23 states have legalized medical marijuana. A quarter of Americans now live in states that have legalized recreational use, while two thirds are in states allowing medical marijuana.Last year, sales of legal cannabis grew 24% to $5.7 billion, with 78% of that coming from medical marijuana, according to a report by ArcView Market Research and New Frontier Data. Sales are projected to grow to $7.1 billion this year and to $22 billion by 2020, when medical pot will make up less than half the total.  “Legalization of cannabis is one of greatest business opportunities of our time, and it’s still early enough to see huge growth,” said ArcView CEO Troy Dayton.  A separate report from Cowen & Co. projects a $50 billion market in 10 years.Getting in on the ground floor of the cannabis industry hasn't been easy. Nasdaq lists a handful of biotech companies that develop cannabinoid medicines. Arena Pharmaceuticals, for example, produces a therapy treating chronic pain, while GW Pharmaceuticals has a cannabis-based drug to treat epilepsy. But these companies won't benefit from the growth of the retail marijuana market.There are also several dozen pot-themed companies trading over the counter — that is, outside formal exchanges like the NYSE or Nasdaq. These include companies that sell smoking devices, produce medical marijuana or do lab testing. Many have colorful names, like Pineapple Express, Bud Genius and Namaste Technologies. The problem? The OTC markets are high risk: illiquid and volatile at best, a wild west of fraud and manipulation at worst. Although it's listing on the NYSE, Innovative Industrial Properties carries its own share of risk. The San Diego company has no revenue to date. But it plans on buying a 37-acre property in New York's Hudson Valley shortly after the IPO for $30 million, and it's working to spend another $88 million on several other properties after that. Most of its revenue will come from rents to licensed medical marijuana startups.Perhaps more importantly, IIP's IPO will be watched as an interesting test case for other cannabis companies that want to list on public exchanges. In May, Nasdaq denied an IPO bid by a marijuana-centric social network, MassRoots, citing federal laws that prohibit the drug's use.Because marijuana remains classified as a Schedule I drug, some banks and financial institutions have been reluctant to finance the fledgling industry. That may worsen under a Trump Administration, which could overrule state laws that have already legalized marijuana. The incoming U.S. Attorney General has called cannabis “a very real danger” and said, “good people don't smoke marijuana.”Indeed, there are already signs that IIP's trailblazing offering may be hitting speed bumps. The company filed for its IPO in October and initially planned to raise $175 million by going public before Thanksgiving. After the offering was delayed, IIP refiled Monday for a more modest $100 million offering. On Tuesday, it filed yet again for an $80 million offering.Startups that pioneer new industries typically offer a shot at big returns with the tradeoff of high risk. Cannabis startups are no different, except the regulatory concerns could make them even riskier. Still, many investors practicing the old dictum “invest in what you know” might be eager to have an opportunity to invest in a business they patronize. If IIP's IPO doesn't offer that chance, it could open the door to other startups that can.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

IIP: Home | Innovative Industrial Properties



























Innovative Industrial Properties™
Removing Financial Barriers For Licensed Medical-Use Cannabis Growers™
We target medical-use cannabis facilities for acquisition, including sale-leaseback transactions, with tenants that are licensed growers under long-term triple-net leases. We believe this industry is poised for significant growth in coming years, and we are focused on being a creative capital provider to this industry through the long-term ownership of cultivators’ mission-critical facilities.













Sale/Leaseback Opportunities


Innovative Industrial Properties acquires freestanding properties that are used for growing licensed medical-use cannabis and operated by state licensed growers. The properties are then leased back to the growers under long-term, net lease agreements. We target growers that have gone through the rigorous state licensing process and have been granted a license in the state where the property is located.
How does it work?
Our acquisition strategy is to act as a source of capital to these licensed medical-use cannabis growers by acquiring and leasing back their real estate locations. By selling the property and building to IIP, and then leasing it back from us, growers have the opportunity to redeploy the proceeds into their company’s core operation and yield a higher return than they would otherwise get from owning their own real estate.
