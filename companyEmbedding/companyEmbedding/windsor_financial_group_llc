Community

















At Windsor Financial Group, we have created a culture of service to not only our clients but to the community as well. We feel it is important to give back through financial contributions as well as volunteering in both good and bad economic times. Over the years, we have made financial contributions and volunteered our time at Second Harvest Heartland, People Serving People and the Emergency Foodshelf Network. We have found that this time has not only benefited the charities and their beneficiaries but it has also made our firm stronger through team building.


In addition to financial contributions and time spent volunteering we encourage members of our team to become active in non-profit organizations which have special importance to them. This includes board participation, providing financial knowledge to foundations and endowments and mentoring.

FAQ'S
 







Invest with WFG
 
Contact us to find out more information about investing with WFG














                
                Why should I hire Windsor Financial Group?                +



You should hire Windsor for three reasons. First, your privacy is our utmost concern. Secondly, from the outset our team will work with you to define your goals and objectives. Lastly, our interests are parallel with yours and as a result you will affirm that Windsor cares about you and your money as much as you do.







                
                Do I have direct access to investment management and wealth planning professionals?                +



Yes, as a client of Windsor Financial Group you have direct access to the investment management and wealth planning professionals making decisions on your behalf. 







                
                What type of investments does Windsor utilize?                +



Windsor utilizes several asset classes in the management of client portfolios.  While the asset classes have a wide range of risk and return expectations, a common thread in all investments is the valuation-oriented approach Windsor employs in selecting both individual investments as well as outside managers. The firm has a team of domestic equity analysts that focus on a multi-cap strategy.  The strategy emphasizes high-quality companies with a history of strong capital allocation decisions.  Our fixed income style utilizes a relative value approach, strong credit research and effective yield curve management.  In the international arena both developed and emerging market funds are employed.  We also incorporate real estate, commodities and other alternative investments based on each clients specific risk profile.
The percentages invested in each of these asset classes will vary from client to client.  There are no one-size-fits-all or cookie-cutter portfolios at Windsor.  Client portfolios are tailored to their unique goals and objectives.  Individual securities are utilized in domestic equity and taxable / non-taxable fixed income sectors to provide greater tax efficiency and sector control.







                
                What wealth planning services do you provide?                +



We provide guidance on many complex financial planning decisions.  Some of these areas include:

Retirement Analysis


 Estate planning strategies


 Employee Benefits 


Income tax planning strategies


 Risk Management


Intergenerational Planning


Education funding  


Executive Compensation Planning

 







                
                Do you have a minimum account portfolio size?                +



Our services are best suited for those with $1,000,000 to invest.  However, we will consider relationships below this amount with unique circumstances for growth. 







                
                How is Windsor different than other investment advisors?                +



Many investment advisors have some of the attributes that comprise Windsor.  Few, if any, have them all.  The differentiating attributes include:
Limited number of relationships per team
Use of both traditional and non-traditional investment asset classes
Sophisticated asset allocation and retirement cash flow planning software
Deep investment talent base in several specialties that allow us to navigate volatile financial markets
Use of proprietary products managed internally as well as outside independent managers in international equities, taxable fixed income, real estate and alternative investments
Purchasing power for fixed income investments
Wealth Planning professionals with experience in tax, estate planning, insurance, retirement, gifting and education planning
We simplify our clients lives administratively

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.
