 MetaStat, Inc. Announces Memorandum Of Understanding To Transfer Its Therapeutic Business
Download PDF
MONTCLAIR, NJ. / ACCESSWIRE / MetaStat, Inc. (OTCQB: MTST), a life science company focused on understanding and treating systemic metastasis, announced today that on July 14, 2014 it entered into a binding Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to transfer its therapeutic assets to a newly formed private company, ASET Therapeutics. ASET will be led by David Epstein, former chief scientific officer of OSI Pharmaceuticals, who will remain as a director of MetaStat for at least 6 months following consummation of the transaction.
In exchange for the transfer of the therapeutic assets, ASET has agreed to make an equity investment in MetaStat of $1.25 million, and MetaStat has agreed to make an equity investment in ASET of $1 million in exchange for a 20% ownership interest in ASET. Transfer of the therapeutic assets (including licenses, know-how, personnel and laboratory space) is expected to occur within 90 days upon entering into definitive documentation, whereupon ASET will be responsible for funding all future therapeutic activities. MetaStat will have exclusive worldwide rights to develop and market companion diagnostics for all therapeutic programs developed at ASET and can garner a future royalty stream and milestone fees upon further monetization of ASET programs and technologies. In addition, MetaStat has the right to participate in future financings in order to maintain its 20% equity ownership.
David Epstein, Ph.D. commented, "We believe this transaction is a key step towards optimizing the growth of each standalone company. As two separate companies, both MetaStat and ASET Therapeutics will be better positioned to capitalize on respective market opportunities and further enhance the creation of shareholder value."
Dr. Oscar Bronsther, chief executive officer of MetaStat, stated "We believe this transaction offers the best utilization of our scientific and financial resources. MetaStat will focus on the near-term commercialization of its breast cancer diagnostics, which is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015." Dr. Bronsther continued "After completion of this transaction, MetaStat will be a pure play diagnostic company with a platform of cancer diagnostics and companion biomarkers for multiple cancer indications."
About MetaStat, Inc.
MetaStat is a life sciences company that develops and commercializes diagnostic products and novel therapeutics for the early and reliable prediction and treatment of systemic metastasis, the process by which cancer spreads from a primary tumor through the bloodstream to other areas of the body. MetaStat is focused on breast, prostate, lung and colorectal cancers, where systemic metastasis is responsible for approximately 90% of all deaths. The Company’s function-based diagnostic platform technology is based on the identification and understanding of the pivotal role of the mena protein and its isoforms, a common pathway for the development of systemic metastatic disease in all epithelial-based solid tumors. Both the MetaSite Breast(TM) and MenaCalc(TM) product lines are designed to accurately stratify patients based on their individual risk of metastasis and to allow clinicians to better "customize" cancer treatment decisions by positively identifying patients with a high-risk of metastasis who need aggressive therapy and by sparing patients with a low-risk of metastasis from the harmful side effects and expense of chemotherapy.

(MTST), a life science company focused on understanding and treating systemic metastasis, today announced that CEO Dr. Oscar Bronsther was recently interviewed on The Wall Street Analyst discussing the company’s diagnostic technologies and competitive positioning in the marketplace.The Wall Street Analyst interviews CEOs and industry leaders to provide informative interviews that help investors understand companies, and make informed decisions on purchasing stock. Investors rely on The Wall Street Analyst to deliver unbiased, unfiltered, and candid interviews, which unlock possible investment opportunities before the rest of the market discovers them.Interviewed by host Michael Noonan, Dr. Bronsther discusses MetaStat’s position in diagnosing and preventing metastatic cancer using the underlying biology of the tumor, which he expects, will help to provide the foundation for the company’s success. He also provides an update on the company’s recent developments, upcoming milestones, and the MenaBloc™ Therapeutic Platform.To listen to the podcast, visit http://thewallstreetanalysts.com/metastat-inc-otcbbmtst-ceo-interview/About MetaStat, Inc.MetaStat is focused on developing and commercializing novel diagnostic technologies and therapeutics for the early and reliable prediction and treatment of systemic metastasis - cancer that spreads from a primary tumor through the bloodstream to other areas of the body. Systemic metastasis is responsible for ~90% of all solid tumor cancer related deaths and as such, we believe that more effective treatment of metastatic disease and/or the prevention of systemic metastasis is needed to improve patient outcomes.Our MetaSite Breast™ and MenaCalc™ diagnostic product lines are designed to accurately predict the probability of systemic metastasis and to allow clinicians to better "customize" cancer treatment decisions by positively identifying patients with a high-risk of systemic metastasis who need aggressive therapy and by sparing patients with a low-risk of systemic metastasis from the harmful side effects and expense of chemotherapy. Furthermore, we believe our MenaCalc™ diagnostic platform may be applicable in up to 80% of all solid epithelial cancers, including breast, prostate, lung and colorectal, which account for over 50% of all new cancer cases in the U.S. each year.Additionally, we are developing our MenaBloc™ therapeutic platform, with the goal of discovering inhibitors of the Mena pathway that can be advanced as anti-cancer therapeutics in multiple epithelial-based tumor types.Forward-Looking Statements:This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and such forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
