Dr. Wilson joined Quanterix in 2010 to lead the development of breakthrough diagnostic products using single molecule detection technology. Dr. Wilson brings 20 years of leadership experience in in-vitro diagnostics product development at Abbott Laboratories where he developed and commercialized over 20 new products across the major clinical diagnostic areas. His technical accomplishments include a groundbreaking product for hemoglobin A1c monitoring using novel capture and detection technologies (U.S. patent and $80MM in revenue). He also has extensive partnership experience including leading a successful companion diagnostic venture with Wyeth. Most recently, Dr. Wilson pioneered an entrepreneurial accelerated product development model partnering with smaller diagnostics firms that cut time-to-market by half and cost by two-thirds. He is lead author of over 25 articles and abstracts, inventor on two U.S. patents, and recipient of numerous awards, including three Chairman Awards and four Entrepreneurial Awards. Dr. Wilson received his Ph.D. in biophysical chemistry and his M.S. in chemistry from the University of Illinois/Chicago. He obtained his B.A. in chemistry from the University of South Florida.

Free Shipping.*EXTRA 15% OFFSelect Area Rugs*Shop NowRelated Product ReviewsIt is and will continue to be their favorite toy. My kids (my daughter 5 and my son is 7) are having a grand ol’ time with this pitching machine! In the first week they could barely hit a single ball but now after a few weeks they have improved immensely!  Especially with the baseball which is their favorite! It is teaching them that practice makes perfect and I couldn’t be happier.  They are practicing indoors since the weather is a bit too chilly but I can’t wait until they get to use it in the summer! It is and will continue to be their favorite toy. Thank you!Baseball bat!Great item! I'm almost always able to find anything I need on Overstock...it's always my "go to" place! There is always a coupon available, and then combined with what always seems like expedited free shipping and accrual of Overstock $s this is my place. The hat itself is great and as expected. It's a good weight for anyone 7-9 year sure old, is estimate.baseball shirt loved tiGrandson loved the shirt. It arrived last night right before his game and he wore it. Great price tooswing analyzermy husband coaches and he said this works amazing. great product!! really helped our son tooGrandson Loves This!This is an excellent product.  Our Grandon plays with this all the time and is becoming a much better fielder while having fun!   Worth the money.This screen is light enough to carry around for practices and it is sturdy enough to protect you from young teen baseball players and younger. It doesn't require any tools to setup but it will take you 5 minutes or so before practice to get it ready. I use mine to protect myself when throwing BP or to protect the first baseman during BP. This is not a screen for soft toss or Tee work. Nice size bagLooks great and holds my son's catchers gear, bats, and gloves nicely. Used it one season so far holding up great.Great for batting practiceIt sure saved this tired old arm.lol Great for baseball or softball.Very stiff  This glove is much different than I imagined it would be especially since it is small in size    Sponsored LinksWhat's This?Quick ViewFavorite$8449 -

Could the 2017 Wilson A2K David Wright 12'' Baseball Glove: A2KRB17DW5GM be used by a 13 year old kid in the outfield?

                    Asked by Leo




The 2017 Wilson A2K David Wright 12" Baseball Glove: A2KRB17DW5GM could certainly be used by a 13 year old playing the OF.  The A2K models feature additional padding and a higher leather quality so it will require some time to break it in properly.

Pro Soft Glove Conditioner 






DIRECTIONS:
(1) - First remove any existing dirt by wiping the glove with a clean, dry cloth.
(2) - When clean, rub a small amount of conditioner into the leather with hands or clean cloth.
(3) - Work it into the web, palm, laces, inside of the glove, & any other area that has become dry or is starting to crack.
(4) - When finished, place your glove in a warm, dry area (70 - 90 F) & allow the leather to absorb the conditioner for 24 hrs.
(5) - Re-treat your glove when you notice the leather is starting to dry out. Prior to the off-season, apply a light coat of conditioner to keep the leather from becoming brittle.
Note: Excessive glove conditioner/oil can damage or shorten the life of a new glove. Use it sparingly.

Description for 2017 Wilson A2K David Wright 12" Baseball Glove: A2KRB17DW5GM


New for 2017! The Wilson A2K is the premier baseball glove from Wilson. This is the one top players turn to when they want a long lasting glove that breaks in without breaking down. These models are meticulously crafted and constructed with a focus on durability and shaping. Made up of Pro Stock Select Leather, the best ball glove leather out there, the A2K only uses the top 5% of Wilson's leather for guaranteed consistency and flawlessness. This leads to a stronger pocket and an all around higher quality baseball glove. Adding to the greatness is the fact that master technicians spend three times longer pounding and shaping the A2K by hand for a reduced break-in period. With the combination of the additional shaping and Wilson's Rolled Dual Welting, which is where thin strips of Pro Stock leather are skived thin and rolled, the A2K retains its shape much better over the long haul. Another great feature of the Wilson A2K is the Double Palm Construction. A thin strategically cut piece of leather is placed between the palm liner and outer shell, providing maximum pocket stability and shock resistance. Wilson and their glove technicians are devoted to handcrafting the hardest working gloves in the game. Time and passion are put into every single glove whether it's made for play on an MLB field or your local diamond. It's no surprise that Major League Baseball players choose to use Wilson to get them through a 162 game season. That should be all the proof you need that the Wilson A2K is created with unparalleled craftsmanship. Wilson: Leather With Major Presence!
 
This 2017 Wilson A2K Baseball Glove (A2KRB17DW5GM) features a 12.00 pattern, a dual post web, and it is the game day model of MLB third baseman, David Wright. It is not only worn by him, he designed the glove to his own specifications and style. Purchase your A2K baseball glove today with free shipping and a 100 Day Money-Back Guarantee right here at JustBallGloves.com! We're here for you from Click to Catch!
