Meet Great-Grandfather James Ott
Monthly Monitor, August 2001 - Newsworthy Neighbor
By: Mary Krein        

Every time I travel on the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, I will think of James Ott of West Collingswood Heights whose father, Pierson M. Ott, was a structural steel worker and foreman of the work crew on the New Jersey side during its construction from 1922 to 1926.  Ott says his father was a daredevil!
James Ott was born in Camden and lived in the Kresson Gardens (Fairview) section.  He and his wife, Marian, then moved to Bellmawr Park.  When four homes were being built in West Collingswood Heights, they bought one before it was finished.  They have lived there since 1950.
 He attended school at St. Peter and Paul’s in Camden, St. Joan of Arc in Fairview and then went to vocational school to learn welding.  He started to work as a butcher and left that field because of the influx of supermarkets and went to work with RCA  as a maintenance welder.  He retired from there after 40 years.  He and his wife are the parents of James, Jr. and Robert.  “James, Jr. is much like his grandfather because he loves boats,” Mrs. Ott noted.  “He and his grandfather both lived and breathed their jobs.”
          “James, Jr. is the top civil engineer for all the forts rebuilding and remodeling them,” Ott, Sr. says.  “The Army hired him right out of Christian Brothers College because of his good record there and he worked his way up to being top man.  He travels from one fort to another.  Fort Monmouth is historical and I think it is the oldest.”
James, Jr. has won awards from the United States federal government for running the best fort in the United States, Fort Monmouth.  He also won another award which was the third highest award the government gives a civilian.  
 Their grandchildren are Danielle, Kathy, Regina, Robert and Angela and their great-grandchildren are Madison and Conner.  Mrs. Ott has always worked around restaurants.  Her mother built Country Gardens which is now called Lambert’s and she helped her to run that for a long time.  She also ran South Jersey Vending for 16 years.  
Ott remembers that his father was very successful in his work and that he was very clever.  “They wanted him to be on the Bridge Commission and he refused because it was a political job,” Ott explained.  “So P.C. Hull Steel Erection hired him as a superintendent and he worked for them until he died.  He wouldn’t let me follow him.  He wouldn’t let me work outside.  I wanted to get a union card and he threatened to have me flagged if I did.”
Ott has a lot of his father’s tools and memorabilia.  He has a piece of cable from the bridge which his Dad had one end pressed into a letter opener and the other end has a handle made from a coupling.  He told him, “Don’t lose this, Jimmy. It is part of the bridge!”
 There are pictures of the bridge in progress in his collection.  “I have pictures of the towers going up,” he commented.  “For its height and length, it is still the strongest bridge in the world.  It had its history for the strongest bridge for its height and length up until four years ago and there is another bridge similar to it but it is not as strong as this one.  This has a lot of steel in it.  It is really built!
 “The cable comes down to the anchorage,” he continued.  “In the anchorage there is an elevator that goes down to the street.  They intended to have that as the entrance to go up to the trolleys.  They intended to put trolleys there years ago.  Inside that anchorage all the walls are marble with paintings on them.  They were going to have a shopping center there while the people waited for a trolley.
 “It seems that the rails that were put on when the bridge was built were different from PTC at that time and the Bridge Commission was in authority.  PTC said that they were not running over there unless the rails were changed.  The commission said they should change the rails and they were not changing them.  So, they held off until the Port Authority took over and there were no questions asked.  The Port Authority changed the rails on the bridge.  That is when the Speedline started. 
“When the Speedline came in, the first stop was Broadway in Camden,” he added.  “They bypassed the anchorage.  The spot they fixed up all went to waste money thrown away.  If the trolleys had been used, there would have been one stop at the anchorage where you got on at Linden Street in Camden to go up the elevator to catch the trolley and go across the bridge.  It is still there but it is closed to the public.  I have pictures of the anchorage showing big arms coming out and down in the casings that hold the cable.  The arms move, that cable moves two inches and the bridge also sways.  They have to keep that oiled and greased and they have to keep it open for maintenance.”  
 After Ott’s father crossed straddling a cable, with no net beneath him, he lost the name Pierson and he was called “Jersey Ott!”
One of the jobs he did when he was contracting was to fix the clock on the City Hall in Camden.  He lowered himself in a boatswain’s chair and set the clock.  The newspaper reported it by saying, “Jersey’s time is the right time!”
Ott likes West Collingswood Heights because it is a nice quite area.  He keeps in touch at the township meetings, which he attends.  He belongs to the West Collingswood Heights Fire Company. 
“They didn’t have any fire hydrants from the Black Horse Pike in and I lived two blocks in from the Pike,” he says.  “The township was unsuccessful in getting hydrants.  So, I went to the state and got in touch with the Insurance Association.  They like to know if properties have protection.  They came to a township meeting and they made them put the hydrants in on Wilson Avenue.  It was a struggle but I was very successful. 
“What amazes me is how remarkable the engineer was to figure that all out all those years ago,” he concluded.  “It is a proud thing to know that my Dad was such a major part of it.”
          “He was a great man, a good father; he took care of his family and was very strict.  If you walked the wrong side of the chalk line, you were going down to the cellar!”  It is the other way now, children sue their parents!”
Ott says that the story of his father is on the Internet.  “I did all this to more or less honor my Dad because he was a wonderful man and he was great to us,” he added.  “The least I can do is having some remembrance of him.  I loaned my pictures to the Port Authority to use for the birthday of the bridge.  Sitting on that cable, he had more nerve than I have!”

Who First Crossed New River Bridge?
Ah, That’s the Question- One Admits Shinning it, Another Confesses He Beat’em All - BUT BOSS WALKED OVER
Who first crossed the Delaware over the new suspension bridge is likely to prove a mooted question.
Four gangs of workmen labored feverishly for two weeks to finish the first footpaths.  Each man had a secret desire to be the first to cross, that he might relare it to his grandchildren, and stand along with Washington.  Yesterday they were within speaking distance of each other.  Then the big bosses dimmed their dream with an order to suspend any man attempting to cross before the formal opening by Chief Engineer Modjeski.  But what is the loss of a job to men who work in constant danger of their lives?
With ninety feet still to be completed Pierce Ott, foreman of the south span of the Camden side, declares he shinned across the swaying cable.  This was at 9 A. M. and it didn’t phase him a bit he said. 
“I just tossed a leg across the cables, grabbed hold with both hands and worked my way over,” he said casually.  “Nobody who works up there cares about the height.  It only took mea couple of minutes.”
Ott lives at 50 Spruce St, Camden, is married and has two sons Matthew five and William Four.  Matthew, who shows promise of being as frisky as his wiry father, said that this was no feat and demonstrated his ability to skip along the porch railing until his mother saw him.  
But foreman have more liberties than do laborers.  George Morgan, an iron worker, who lives in Blackwood, N.J., stole his crossing during the lunch hour.  
Morgan tells how he waited on the top of the Philadelphia tower after his fellow workmen went down in the “basket.” The gap had shortened by this time to twenty feet.
Dangling from the swaying cable in much the same manner as Ott, he gained the Camden side.  
Now, the distinction of being the first in literally walk across the Delaware seems to belong to George Bowers superintendent of construction.  He is a veteran bridge builder and is credited with being the first to walk across the Hudson over the Poughkeepsie Bridge.  Bowers walked the entire 3,200 feet from tower to tower beginning on the Philadelphia side just after the last section of planking had been laid at 3 o’clock.  It was a 20 minute trip he said. 
All this, however, is behind the back of officialdom so to speak.  The bridge commission knows nothing about it. 
 Who says he was first to cross the Delaware over the new suspension bridge.  He shinned ninety feet of cable between the unfinished foot paths.  Two others claim the honor of being first to cross the span. 
Bridge Awaits Cable Spinners        
Workmen of Twin Towers Divided by Eager Rivalry
With the footbridge between Camden and Philadelphia over the Delaware River complete, workmen today started on preliminary tasks of constructing the main cables which will carry the completed span.  
The footbridge completed yesterday consists of two festoons of boardwalk stretched from the cable
The footways look like two great yellow ribbons stretched across the 1,750 feet curve from shore to shore. Each is eight feet wide.  
 Much rivalry has developed between the two sets of workers at the end of the bridge during their months of work in preparation for linking the two cities.  
 The men on the Jersey side are jubilant over the fact that they finished their end of the river yesterday several hours before the Philadelphia end was complete.  
The honor of the first crossing on the new bridge was taken by a man from the Philadelphia gang, George C. Morgan, 24 years, of Blackwood.  This Jersey man made the dizzy passage over the center of the river on the bare cable for a distance of 50 feet.  He crossed to the Jersey side and back at noon yesterday while the other men were at lunch.  
Pierce Ott, 24 years, 550 Spruce Street, Camden, foreman or “pusher,” of the gang that claimed the honor of finishing the first of the Camden side had declared he would be the first to cross and that he would not wait for the boardwalk to be complete.  His intentions were wrecked early yesterday when an accidental blow on his nose by a timber sent him off the work for a day. 
 Other foremen under Superintendent Greene on the Camden side are George Bowers, Jr., son of the veteran bridge worker at the head of the Philadelphia workers: '
Bill Salders, of Maple Shade, and J.O. Strom, 2414 South Seventh Street, Camden.

SPOTLIGHT On... Robert J. Ott
8.27.2010 - At the age of six, Robert Ott put on his first martial arts uniform. Little did he realize that this uniform was going to be a uniform of life. By the age of sixteen, he had earned his first degree black belt. Two years later, he became the Chief Instructor of the Dragon Gym under Grand Master Goh Chae Teok, and went on to operate his own school. In 1990, he was the victim of a violent crime that left him completely blind as well as without the ability to smell or taste. Worse, the tragic incident erased his passion to make a difference in life. After several years of searching and questioning, he began to discover purpose in his life once again. Today, he is a motivational speaker, father, and martial arts instructor. In his biography, Certain Victory, he shares his story and addresses several issues, including disability, being a victim, financial loss and depression. You can meet Robert Ott at the Collingswood Book Festival. And find out more about him when you visit his website, www.certainvictory.com

The Poem of The Flowering Warrior
Hear the poem in mp3 format
When the wind and the cold air cuts through the skin while the 
	      endless surrounding of blackness encompasses our existence in life 
	      we must then learn to see the true light.

	    For in life no one can take away our lust, passions, drives and 
        dreams.

	    Nor can they take away the strength, courage and indomitable spirit 
        that we all carry inside.

	    Ultimately the love of life and others will persevere through all 
        of the challenging journeys that are faced.

	    In all we hold that of a Flowering Warrior who will never surrender.

Certain Victory Food Services, Inc.
Certain Victory Food Services, Inc. is one of the leading contractors 
	      providing food service to the military. This company has a unique 
	      distinction over many other food service contractors for the military: 
	      the President/CEO, Robert J. Ott, is completely blind.
Blinded from a gunshot wound in 1990, Mister Ott was determined 
	      to obtain the food service contract from the federal government 
	      (DOD) to run full food-service dining facilities on Fort Lewis, 
	      Washington. Along with the help of Cantu Services, the leading consulting 
	      company for the blind in the country, Certain Victory Food Services’ 
        team of employees has demonstrated professionalism time and time 
	      again! Being a company that hires 400 to 800 workers (depending 
	      on the time of the year) whose goal is to feed the Soldiers is something 
	      that brings great pride.
The company handles every aspect of food service in the dining 
	      facilities it runs; ranging from the cooks to the attendants all 
	      the way to the menu planning and food ordering. Certain Victory 
	      Food Services is committed to not only providing outstanding food 
	      service to the United States Army but also emphasizes employment 
	      opportunities to individuals with disabilities. Currently, 23% of 
	      the Certain Victory family is comprised of people with some type 
	      of disability and that percentage is apt to grow as more positions 
	      open within the company.
Our goal is now, and always will be, to feed the soldiers while 
	      at the same time proving to the world that people with disabilities 
	      can work in, grow with, and even own a company that provides such 
	      an important service; and do it just as good as any other contractor 
	      for food service.
Those handling the administrative aspects of Certain Victory Food 
	      Services are: 
Robert J. Ott, President/CEO
Jim Stevens, consultant/contract manager (Rolmar)
Russell Woosley, contract manager
Erwin De La Cruz, assistant contracts manager 
Mable Thompson, office manager
Carmen Armstrong, area manager (Rolmar)
Bill Phillips, payroll analyst 
Shay Benoit, payroll clerk 
Although each employee has specific job duties to perform daily, 
	      the office staff continually works together to ensure the most effective 
	      and efficient performance of Certain Victory Food Services/Rolmar 
	      . In the minds of the staff we demonstrate a well oiled machine 
	      called “team work.

YOUR FOCUS DETERMINES YOUR REALITY 

BE BOLD, BE PRESENT, BE INSPIRED !!! 







YOUR FOCUS DETERMINES YOUR REALITY 

BE BOLD, BE PRESENT, BE INSPIRED !!! 



 










Robert’s Story
At an early age Robert learned a valuable lesson to “learn from others mistakes.” A few of Robert’s older sisters got mixed up with the wrong crowd and struggled for many years with substance abuse, physical abuse and trouble with the law. Almost on a monthly basis the cops were called to his house. Because of Robert’s home life, he struggled to focus on school and became disorganized and uninterested in learning. He let his anger get the best of him and realized that he had no real direction in life.
One day everything changed. Robert had been trying things his own way and life never seemed to improve. By the grace of God, Robert had a desire to change within.  He researched the top successful people in the world and learned the key to being truly free and happy. Robert found some amazing mentors like Tony Robbins, Brendon Burchard, and many others. They inspired him to live a fulfilled life, being fully present in every moment. Robert learned to build the habits and strategies to be successful in business, in relationships, and in life. Once he discovered these simple concepts he knew his mission was to share it with the world.



Robert’s efforts have inspired people around the globe:

His weekly Youtube show is viewed by over one thousand people per week.
His motivational podcast, The Focused Life, debuted at #1 on iTunes across all categories in the United States.
His blog posts rank as many of the most liked and shared in the motivational genre.

Robert is also the founder of  Focused  Academy, the personal development program for high achievers, and Life on your Agenda, the world’s most comprehensive training for people wanting to take back control of their life. Though best known as a motivational speeches and high performance trainer,  Robert also is a Life Coach for many around the world. Recognized as a thought leader in human motivation and business, Robert says he believes everyone has the ability to change and the first step is to take action.

Bobby Jayz

ROBERT J. OTT
OWNER/OPERATOR
robert@bobbyjayz.com
Born and raised in Southern New Jersey by a strong, single mother and one of a kind grandmother, Robert was destined to be a people person. His first business experience was in the mid- 70’s at a clothing store owned by his mother, Ann. Robert would greet customers at the door with a smile and would always get the same in return.
At age 6 he put on his first Martial Arts uniform, unaware that it was to be a way of life for him.
From delivering newspapers, operating boardwalk games, working in cafés and truck driving, a strong work ethic was obviously in his blood. From 1986 to 1989, Robert held the position of Chief Instructor/Office Manager for the Dragon Gym, whose main headquarters was located in Exton, Pennsylvania. The school had over 1,500 students and spent over $25,000 per month in yellow pages advertising alone. It was during this time while managing, teaching and learning, Robert’s natural abilities in working with people began to blossom.
In time, Robert returned to New Jersey and opened his own school named the Traditional Martial Arts Institute. With the great success and growth the school demonstrated within the first year, he began to realize his strengths and the positive changes that he could offer to others.
On October 6, 1990, Robert’s life took a tragic turn. While out with a good friend, a confrontation occurred which Robert did his best to avoid. Sadly, when all was said and done, a man cracked open a door, put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.
Through the divine providence, the love of family and friends, a special nurse, a wonderful and very talented neurosurgeon and an ancient principle he learned in his Martial Art study called “Pil-Sung”, Robert survived. However, he was far from unscathed. The bullet took away his ability to taste, smell and see. The darkness and uncertainty also brought him great fear and pain. Through strength, courage and indomitable spirit deriving from his study of Pil-Sung (Certain Victory), Robert turned the page and moved on with his life.
In 1995, Robert kissed his family goodbye and with two gym bags and $500 in his pocket, hopped on a one way flight to the Great Northwest. On March 13th, 1995, he opened his first business since his he became blind; the Modern Day Café. The café provided breakfast and lunch for over 900 employees of the Western Regional Center of the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, located just north of the Children’s Hospital in Seattle, Washington.
During the 10 years that followed, he began to find both vision and purpose in life once again. He began to work with others who suffered horrific injuries similar to his own while at the same time sharing his story to all walks of life.
His catering varied from small meetings to international conferences, with professional men and women from all walks of life. Along with this business, he initiated a contract which fed 52 children a day, at the daycare center, located at the same government complex, where Modern Day Café was located.
Also during those years, Robert put his Korean Martial Arts uniform back on and began to teach and share his story to others all over the country. Most important, than all the rest during those years, Robert found love in his life and is a proud parent of two beautiful children.
On September 1, 2004 after a two year court battle, the Washington State Department Services for the Blind, Business Enterprise Program and Robert J. Ott were awarded the contract to become the ones in charge, of providing the labor, which feeds the 3rd largest US Military Site in the United States, known as, Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Through this Robert became the President/CEO of the corporation with all of the responsibilities required through the contractual agreement.
Robert’s number of employees have been as high as 830 and his dedication to the US Soldiers became well known. He named this business, Certain Victory Food Services Inc., which follows his beliefs in strength, courage and indomitable spirit. He has been a speaker for the Wounded Warriors numerous times, and has spoken at many events, including speaking to many students across the nation, along with the schools located on base. In December of 2008, he was the Key Note Speaker for all 600 Doctors and Nurses at Madigan Hospital. Each day Robert always shows his appreciation and recognition to his destiny in life. Often he feels that there is more vision in his heart and spirit today, than ever before.
In 2007, Robert completed his book, titled “Certain Victory” and has shared his story of going from a victim to a survivor, to countless people all over the world. Currently, Robert is an official member of the Washington State Department Services for the Blind, Business Enterprise Program Committee. He shares to all, his great respect for the program and values it, as a great importance in his life. His admiration to the State Agency for the blind, along with his support, to both the clients and staff, are displayed often through the volunteering of his personal time.
When asked to take over the Owner/Operator position, for the food services of the OB2 building here, in Olympia under a two year contract, Robert embraced it. He views this as an opportunity to build the professionalism and customer service to the level it needs to be for all of the hard working and dedicated State Employees who work in that building.
When asked what he was going to name this business, Robert had no idea. That was until he heard his son called out by his nickname, “Bobby J.” Needless to say for a boy who at the time was turning 4 years old and having a Café named after him, the future will surely have no limitations.
On August 31, 2013, the 5 year contract with the Washington State Department Services for the Blind and Robert J. Ott, ended with Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Since then, the business was on several extensions with great uncertainty. Wednesday April 20, 2011 Robert received a phone call, at 11:00AM, informing him that he was just awarded the new Full Food Service Contract to feed the US Army, at Joint Base Lewis-McChord for another 5 years. It took much strength, courage, indomitable spirit and teamwork to achieve this success, along with the Past Performance Evaluations, which made it all come together. Once again, another story of Certain Victory!

MURPH MINER
CHEF
chefmurph@bobbyjayz.com
Chef Murph Miner was raised in Gig Harbor, Washington and has worked in the restaurant industry for over two and a half decades. His father was a local businessman who put Murph to work at an early age in the family business. Working for the family taught Murph the importance of commitment and dedication in every task and challenge he came to face. In 1978, Murph found himself with a desire to make a change so he decided to venture into the food service business. Starting off as a dishwasher at the Shoreline restaurant in Gig Harbor, it did not take him long before he began to work his way to the top. By 1980 Murph had advanced through all stations in the kitchen and was given the title of kitchen manager. During his career in the foodservice industry he also pursued an education at the University of Puget Sound. Murph held the position of Kitchen Manager at the Shoreline location until 1987 which earned him the title of “Chef.”
During the year of 1987 Murph moved on to become a leading member of the team employed by the Ram International. Murph dedicated 17 years of strong work ethics to the Ram International opening numerous new locations throughout the Pacific Northwest. He was often sent to various facilities to problem-solve challenging issues. Within those years he was found in both the fine-dining and casual themed locations, sharing his natural desires to give customers the experience and service they deserve.
In 2005, Murph expanded his experiences and began working for a large catering company. He held the titles of both the Catering Coordinator and official Banquet Chef for Allenmore Hospital located in Tacoma, Washington. While holding this set of titles he brought full-service quality food to an institutional setting. Through his hard work and passion for making a difference, he received many personal commendations for attention to detail, menu diversity and quality service. Following a merger of companies and a centralization of the catering operations prompted Murph to make a change in his employment. Through persistence, interviews and a demonstration of his food service skills, Murph became employed as the Kitchen Supervisor for the rooftop restaurant called Altezzo. The Altezzo is known for its fantastic location, overlooking the Puget Sound in the city of downtown Tacoma.
Following the sale of the hotel business, Murph was quickly picked up by the Great American Casino in the city of Lakewood. Within a short period of time Murph was promoted to the Kitchen Manager/Banquet Chef for the formal steak house (Goodfellow’s). It was during his time of holding that position and the pleasure of having a fine dinner at that location, the owner/operator of Bobby Jayz Café had the opportunity of meeting Chef Murph Miner. After seeing the numerous strengths in his menu design, cooking expertise, customer service, team leadership and catering background, it was clear that Chef Murph Miner would be a positive asset to the business, in both customer service and for growth in the foodservice industry.
LISA THAL
KITCHEN MANAGER
lisa@bobbyjayz.com
Lisa began working in the food service business 10 years ago. As a mother of four with a passion for cooking and entertaining guests, she was a natural that easily fit right into the food service industry. Lisa would volunteer her time and skills to her children’s’ school and various sports fundraisers. She was also involved with the local senior citizen center to prepare and serve lunch several times a week. Her cooking skills began to blossom each and every day and Lisa continued her volunteerism to include the Union Gospel  Mission in Seattle preparing lunch for women and children. In 2008, Lisa met Tina Brown, who worked with Robert at the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Seattle prior to him leaving to take on the contract at Joint Base Lewis McChord. After Robert left NOAA, Tina also decided to get involved with government contracts in food service. The first opportunity was the Northwest Regional Department of Transportation in Shoreline, Washington where Lisa began her professional food service career. This contract was Lisa’s first opportunity in food services for the government. Eventually, Tina moved onto other projects and Lisa was once again searching for the right place to share and utilize her talent. Her next adventure was the Seatac airport where she advanced into management. During this time, call from Tina brought the news that Robert was searching for someone new to add to his team. The rest is history!
Today, Lisa works with Robert and Chef Murph and together the team continuously strives to improve customer service and communication. Feel free to contact Lisa with any food service questions that Bobby Jayz Café can assist you with.
