Antonio O. Garza Jr.
Antonio O. Garza, Jr. is a partner of ViaNovo, a leading management and communications consultancy. He will also serve as Chairman of ViaNovo Ventures. In addition to his roles at ViaNovo, Tony will serve as Counsel in the Mexico City office of White & Case. His work with White & Case, a premiere global law firm with 34 offices in 23 countries, affords his clients access to specialized practice and the firm's long track record of success in structuring emerging market financings and other complex cross-border transactions.
Prior to joining ViaNovo and White & Case, Tony served as the United States Ambassador to Mexico from 2002 to 2009, focusing his work on US interests in Mexico, international business development, and broadening and deepening the dialogue between the two countries. He is credited as being amongst the primary proponents of the landmark Merida Initiative aimed at addressing critical regional security concerns.
Ambassador Garza also has held a number of key positions in his home state of Texas. He was a partner in a leading Texas-based international law firm and was elected to the Texas Railroad Commission in 1998. As Chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission in the late 1990s, he oversaw the state's energy industry which employs more than 365,000 Texans and is responsible for more than $82 billion in Gross State Product. During his tenure on the Railroad Commission, he also served as vice chairman of the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, representing the governors of 30 member and eight associate states.
In 1994, then-Governor elect George W. Bush appointed Ambassador Garza as Texas' 99th Secretary of State and a Senior Policy Advisor to the governor. As Texas Secretary of State, he played a pivotal role in policy development and served as the governor's lead liaison on border and Mexico affairs. Ambassador Garza also served six years as Cameron County Judge, the county's top executive, championing crucial infrastructure projects related to water and sanitation services to lower income areas and overseeing the permitting and development of two international bridges.
Tony serves on the Board of Directors of Basic Energy Services (NYSE: BAS) and on the SMU Board of Trustees. He is a member of the State Bar of Texas, the District of Columbia Bar and is admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court. In 2009, he received the Azteca Aguila, the Mexican government's highest honor bestowed upon a non-citizen.
Tony holds a B.B.A. from The University of Texas at Austin and a Doctor of Jurisprudence from Southern Methodist University School of Law and has been honored as a distinguished alumnus at both institutions.

Department History







Department History
Since its creation in 1789, the Department of State has carried out a series
                        of reorganizations and has created new offices and bureaus to deal with new
                        diplomatic challenges.
This portion of our website contains a short history of the
                            department, biographies of the Secretaries of State, a database of Principal
                            Officers and Chiefs of Mission, and a history of the buildings of the Department
                            of State.
The Department of State has grown significantly over the years. The first
                        Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, oversaw a small staff of one chief
                        clerk, three other clerks, a translator, and a messenger and only maintained
                        two diplomatic posts, in London and Paris, as well as 10 consular posts. 
World War I (1914–1918) and World War II (1939–1945) brought vastly increased
                        global responsibilities to the United States as it emerged as a preeminent
                        power. New challenges after the end of the Cold War and the fall of the
                        Soviet Union, included: 
the newly independent states,
the global economy,
terrorism, and
the security of the American overseas presence. 

To address these changing global circumstances, the number of domestic and
                        overseas employees (not counting local employees) grew to: 
1,228 in 1900,
1,968 in 1940,
13,294 in 1960,
and 15,751 in the year 2000.

The number of diplomatic posts increased from 41 in 1900 to 168 in 2004 and
                        continues to grow.

My ViewsMexico: Pushing Past PessimismWith drug kingpin El Chapo’s escape from a maximum-security prison and a disappointing first-round energy auction, Mexico’s summer was far from idyllic.A Brief RespiteAfter several challenging months, Mexico finally has a bit of positive news. Last week marked the second bidding phase in Round 1 of the country’s energy reform, and unlike the first stage, this auction was widely deemed a success. The government awarded three of the five shallow-water production fields in a transparent and efficient process. […]Wanted: Bold Steps and Rule of LawLess than two months after the PRI gained a marginal victory in Mexico’s midterm elections, the administration of Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has been hit by two stinging setbacks. First was the humiliating escape of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzman, the head of the infamous Sinaloa Cartel, and soon after was the energy reform’s less […]Mexico’s Midterm, Washington’s GridlockJust over a week ago, Mexican voters headed to the polls to cast their votes...North America: King of the roadWhen Americans think about Mexico’s economic ties with the United States, popular exports like tomatoes, avocados, and Mexican soccer may come to mind.My Exclusive Interview on Mexico’s Energy ReformI recently sat down with GC Grapevine for an exclusive interview on the state of energy reform in Mexico and the key challenges for both Mexico and US companies in light of lower oil prices. You can read our conversation online now. For the Spanish version, you’ll find it here. The interview is part of […]Mexico: Looking Ahead to 2015As we count down to 2015, I want to wish you all the very best for the upcoming holiday season. It also seems like a good time to take a moment to reflect on some of the events in Mexico over the past twelve months. In this newsletter, I’ve outlined three takeaways from what has […]A New Mindset NeededFor the past twelve years, my work has taken me back and forth across the United States’ and Mexico’s shared border. I’ve watched as the two countries took steps forward, and sometimes back, steadily tying together communities from Mexico’s southern states up through northern Canada. It is clear to me that as Americans, we live in the world’s most dynamic region. But we have yet to fully capitalize on what can be achieved by working together.A Look at Mexico’s Tech SectorThere’s something else going on in Mexico that’s worth following, and I wanted to share some thoughts on the country’s tech sector with you.Mexico: An Energy FutureAlmost one year in, what Mexico has accomplished is nothing short of historic. Study Abroad: Opportunities AboundOver the past few months I’ve written on Mexican President Peña Nieto’s commitment to reform, tourism in Mexico, and lately I’ve been focused on the transformation and opening up of the country’s energy sector. A Summer Tourism PerspectiveYou’re no doubt familiar with the energy and market updates on Mexico that I provide from time to time in my newsletters. I thought I might change it up a bit, as you start to think about your summer travel.Energy Reform: RealityWith final Congressional approvals in place, Mexico and President Peña Nieto can begin celebrating the passage of the secondary legislation necessary to codify constitutional amendments that opened the energy sector to private investment.
