Ensuring that Dataram's financial results fairly reflect the results of our operations is of paramount importance to this company and our investors.

We are committed to providing financial information that is transparent, timely, complete, relevant and accurate.
We are also committed to rigorously and diligently exercising our oversight responsibilities throughout the company, managing our affairs consistent with the highest principles of business ethics, and exceeding the corporate governance requirements of both federal law and the NASDAQ. The steps we have taken to fulfill this commitment include:

Our board has adopted clear corporate governance policies
Our board has adopted majority voting for uncontested elections of directors
A majority of our board members are independent of Dataram and its management
All members of our key board committees (audit, compensation and nomination committees) are independent
The independent members of our board meet regularly without the presence of management
We have a clear code of business conduct and corporate governance
The charters of our board committees clearly establish their respective roles and responsibilities
We have an ethics office with a hotline available to all employees, and our audit committee has procedures in place for the anonymous submission of employee complaints on accounting, internal controls, or auditing matters
We have adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer and all members of our finance department, including the principal financial officer and accounting officer

Dataram is dedicated to maintaining the high standards of financial accounting and reporting we have established.

RAMDisk


 
















   
What is RAMDisk?
RAMDisk is a program that takes a portion of your system memory and uses it as a disk drive. The more RAM your computer has, the larger the RAMDisk you can create.
What is the benefit?
In a word: SPEED! The performance of a RAMDisk, in general, is orders of magnitude faster than other forms of storage media, such as an SSD (up to 100X) and hard drive (up to 200X).
Most users use RAMDisk to speed up applications like:
- Games
- Browser cache for faster web surfing
- Audio and Video editing
- CAD programs
- Software compilers
- Databases
- Speeding up CD duplication
- SETI processing
- TEMP files
- Swap space
- Web server cache
- Security - all information can be wiped upon power loss or shutdown
- Custom applications with high I/O, high bandwidth, or high security requirements
An additional feature of a RAMDisk is that it will never wear out. You can access it at maximum bandwidth 24/7/365 without fear of mechanical failure, or fragmentation (while a RAMDisk can become fragmented just like any other disk, but it does not take a performance hit like a physical disk does when it becomes fragmented). A RAMDisk operating at maximum bandwidth does not produce excessive heat, noise or vibrations. RAMDisk can also out-perform solid state disks (SSDs).

RAMDisk


 
















   
What is RAMDisk?
RAMDisk is a program that takes a portion of your system memory and uses it as a disk drive. The more RAM your computer has, the larger the RAMDisk you can create.
What is the benefit?
In a word: SPEED! The performance of a RAMDisk, in general, is orders of magnitude faster than other forms of storage media, such as an SSD (up to 100X) and hard drive (up to 200X).
Most users use RAMDisk to speed up applications like:
- Games
- Browser cache for faster web surfing
- Audio and Video editing
- CAD programs
- Software compilers
- Databases
- Speeding up CD duplication
- SETI processing
- TEMP files
- Swap space
- Web server cache
- Security - all information can be wiped upon power loss or shutdown
- Custom applications with high I/O, high bandwidth, or high security requirements
An additional feature of a RAMDisk is that it will never wear out. You can access it at maximum bandwidth 24/7/365 without fear of mechanical failure, or fragmentation (while a RAMDisk can become fragmented just like any other disk, but it does not take a performance hit like a physical disk does when it becomes fragmented). A RAMDisk operating at maximum bandwidth does not produce excessive heat, noise or vibrations. RAMDisk can also out-perform solid state disks (SSDs).

RAMDisk Extreme - Up to 64 GB!


RAMDisk Extreme unlocks the freeware and enables features such as Background Update. This option greatly reduces time to shut down RAMDisk by keeping the RAMDisk backed up continuously. This is also great for data protection as the RAMDisk *.img file is as up to date as possible at any given time. Get yours today!  For personal use only.

In 1969, then President John W. Dymecki stated ‘that product performance and excellence, and employee commitment were key words upon which all of at Dataram will continue to build on for the future.’ We have remained true to this commitment made nearly 50 years ago and will continue to build on these.  As we begin our journey for the next 50 years, we do so with the merger with U.S. Gold Corp., an acquisition that is intended to accomplish our diversification and growth objectives and also improve the value delivered to our shareholders.  These are exciting times and I am looking forward to them. ”The closing of Dataram's acquisition of U.S. Gold Corp. is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and deliverables.About Dataram CorporationDataram is a manufacturer of memory products and provider of performance solutions that increase the performance and extend the useful life of servers, workstations, desktops and laptops sold by leading manufacturers such as Dell, Cisco, Fujitsu, HP, IBM, Lenovo and Oracle.
