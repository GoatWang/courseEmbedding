Spark Networks Inc (NYSEMKT:LOV) Strikes An Alliance With Nokia Oyj (ADR) (NYSE:NOK) To Upgrade Spark’s Core Infrastructure

Spark Networks Inc (NYSEMKT:LOV) has formed an alliance with Nokia Oyj (ADR) (NYSE:NOK). The two are planning to partner over a duration of three years where Spark hopes to succeed at upgrading its core infrastructure. One of the top officials working with Spark said that the industry-leading 7250 Interconnect Router R6 (IXR-R6) was going to help much towards helping address capacity and embrace architectural evolution.
Unprecedented growth in demand for mobile and fixed broadband is as a matter of fact sparking about the great need to establish major upgrades. At the moment, Spark is positioning itself on the pathway to attaining the 5G, ubiquitous ultra-broadband connectivity and rapid growth in IoT.
While speaking to a number of top news reporters, one of the top executives working with Spark outlined that the company remained committed to making New Zealand one of the first countries around the globe to receive and use 5G.Currently, the provider has witnessed  a tenfold increase in network traffic. This has come about as a result of the introduction of its broadband over wireless service. It was fundamentally linked to a Nokia IP/MPLS network.
According to Yahoo.com, Spark has plans underway to further expand the capacity and agility of its transport network. It will be engaging in this in the next two years and that will be in preparation for 5G.
New Zealand continues to witness an accelerated demand for mobile and ultra-broadband services. The new applications, such as augmented and virtual reality have received credit for being the major driving forces behind the accelerated demand. The government also hopes to fulfill its goals for rural expansion of broadband services.  It is confident that the expansion to 5G will help a great deal. Spark is also expected to lower its delivery costs.
The expanded capacity and agility of the network according to some top analysts will help spur innovation and new services, more so revolving around the promising application of IoT technologies. The Nokia IP solutions continue to provide the industry’s most elaborate portfolio of purpose-built IP/MPLS mobile solutions. This follows the continued deployment of the company’s solutions in numerous networks globally.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 06/04/1999
            

                BBB has determined that Spark Networks, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.

1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means:

                            2. disclose the nature and terms of shipping, including any known delays or shortages of stock

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Spark Networks, Inc. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 13 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

I have seen nothing from positive progress since the new management team has come on board. These people are true leaders that care about having a great company with great people.

They are also very future focused and data driven. They acknowledge a lot of work is ahead of us but have been taking steps to make sure people are happy with regular social gatherings with open bar, Bagels on Fridays, stocked snacks and drinks, Equinox subsidized membership, review salaries to make sure they are fair.The team (non-management) are some of the hardest working and most dedicated people I've ever worked with. Everyone is willing to go the extra mile and yes, there were layoffs, but they were needed in order to change and survive.ConsThe office could use updating. The carpets look filthy and the kitchen feels like I'm in a trailer park... its clean but the environment could be better.The chairs and desks are very uncomfortable. I don't mind working 10+ hours to help us succeed but at least give me something that doesn't make my back hurt! I can't count how many days I left work because my butt and back hurt :(Advice to ManagementKeep being transparent and fair. Please update the office chairs and desks.

It felt like a family. The former CEO (Greg Liberman) was integral, kind, and attempted to create a positive atmosphere. At one time, the company even subsidized a gym membership at Equinox.ConsSeveral rounds of layoffs have made this a place that people are desperate to leave. There's no real leadership, just a board of directors who are anxious to increase the bottom line at any cost.Advice to ManagementA business is successful thanks to its employees.

Also the software dev team and our Utah counterparts... We always did what we could with the limited tools and technology that we had.... But thats just it... LIMITED.. I mean cmon.. If you call yourself a technology company but cant afford to buy some new firewalls, switches or servers then theres a big problem... While spending all that time cutting corners and finding out how to save cost.. The manpower and wages that it took to figure that out could have paid for a new infrastructure... Geta clue "C" levels. At least the old upper management team you could go with and explain why the stuff was needed.ConsTotal disconnect with the worker bees and even supervisors up to the CEO. CEO said he cared when he came in but after spending a few months with the new regime it was so obvious that we were catering to a bunch of dufus investors who only care about getting their original investment back and not to grow or even make the company great. And in reaponse to ppl stating that certain parties like HR are unreachable...cmon... Try juggling 100+ employees across 3 different sites in 3 different regions with just 1 hr person when in the beginning we actually had a real HR department and the CEO would actually sit down and have group lunch discussions with employees who were interested in whats going on at the company. Nope... New CEO has his team of minions who are at the most.... Semi intelligentAdvice to ManagementGet a clue!!!!! Youve laid off twice.. Youve brought in people who cost way less.. then laid them off too... Youve done so much research in cost cutting and you still think youre doing a good job? Listen to your employees and dont just pretend. Maybe you can put your egos aside and actually learn something for once in your career.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (7) Spark Networks Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Spark Networks 2016-06-11 13:16 PDT May 19, 2016"Historically a great place to work"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsFormer Employee - Project Manager in Los Angeles, CAFormer Employee - Project Manager in Los Angeles, CADoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookApproves of CEOProsGreat staff, fun products, good location, well supported.

Websites[edit]
Most of Spark Networks’ websites are considered special-interest online personals sites. Former CEO Adam Berger has referred to these services as "niche" dating.[2] Exceptions include DailyBibleVerse.com, Faith.com and ChristianCards.net, which cater to other Christian interests, and Spark.com, a general-interest online personals site. Today, ChristianMingle and JDate are Spark Networks' most popular dating sites.
ChristianMingle[edit]
Main article: ChristianMingle
Initially launched in 2001, ChristianMingle.com is the largest and fastest growing online community of Christian singles. The site serves singles who are looking to date and marry within the Christian faith. Today, ChristianMingle has more than 9 million registered members.[3]
In addition to bringing together Christian singles, this site also fosters an online community where members can share their faith and values in a like-minded environment. The site partners with other Spark Networks properties, including DailyBibleVerse.com, to enhance the faith-based offerings for the online community. ChristianMingle's Statement of Faith is as follows: "The basis for our faith is Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Lord and Savior of the world and God’s written Word, the Bible. We believe that embracing what God said allows us to live in freedom, joy and purpose.”[3]
The plot of the film Christian Mingle, features the website.
JDate[edit]
Launched in 1997, JDate.com is a niche dating site that caters to Jewish singles. It has more than 750,000 members worldwide.[4] In addition to the U.S. site, there are also JDate websites with unique domain names for Israel, the United Kingdom and France JDate.co.il, JDate.co.uk and JDate.fr).
ResearchNow, an independent research company, found that JDate is responsible for 52 percent of Jewish marriages that started online. This makes JDate responsible for more Jewish marriages than all other online dating sites combined.[4]
Other websites[edit]
In addition to ChristianMingle and JDate, a number of properties are included in Spark Networks’ portfolio:[5]
History[edit]
The company was founded by Joe Y. Shapira in 1997 under the name MatchNet plc.[6]
JDate.com, founded in 1997, was the company's first venture into online dating. The other key web property, ChristianMingle.com, was introduced in 2004.[7]
In January 2005, the company changed its name to Spark Networks because management felt that the new name more sharply distinguished the company in the marketplace.[8]
On November 10, 2014, JDate launched a dating app designed for Jewish singles.[9]
On October 14, 2015, Spark Networks announced the acquisition of Smooch Labs, owner of the popular millennial Jewish dating app JSwipe.[10] Spark Networks launched CROSSPATHS, a dating app that helps like-minded Christians find matches, on October 8, 2015.[11]
Redesigns of the JDate and ChristianMingle websites were announced in 2015. In addition to revamped branding, the site makeovers featured technology changes (including expanded mobile capabilities), a re-designed inbox and a new “daily matches” feature. JDate’s redesign went live on November 18, 2015, while ChristianMingle’s went live on December 17, 2015.[12][13]
Operations[edit]
David Siminoff formerly served as Chief Executive Officer of the company. The current Spark Networks leadership team [14] consists of:

Danny Rosenthal, Chief Executive Officer & Director
David Budworth, Chief Technology Officer
Lisa McLafferty, Chief Revenue Officer
Robert W. O’Hare, Chief Financial Officer

Previously based in Beverly Hills, California, Spark Networks is now based in Los Angeles, California with additional offices in Lehi, Utah and Hertzelia Pituach, Israel.[15]
In 2013, the company authorized the repurchase of $5 million of its outstanding common stock as a reflection of confidence in the long-term business.[16]

Initially launched in 2001, ChristianMingle.com is the largest and fastest growing online community of Christian singles. The site serves singles who are looking to date and marry within the Christian faith. Today, ChristianMingle has more than 9 million registered members.[3]
In addition to bringing together Christian singles, this site also fosters an online community where members can share their faith and values in a like-minded environment. The site partners with other Spark Networks properties, including DailyBibleVerse.com, to enhance the faith-based offerings for the online community. ChristianMingle's Statement of Faith is as follows: "The basis for our faith is Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Lord and Savior of the world and God’s written Word, the Bible. We believe that embracing what God said allows us to live in freedom, joy and purpose.”[3]
The plot of the film Christian Mingle, features the website.
JDate[edit]
Launched in 1997, JDate.com is a niche dating site that caters to Jewish singles. It has more than 750,000 members worldwide.[4] In addition to the U.S. site, there are also JDate websites with unique domain names for Israel, the United Kingdom and France JDate.co.il, JDate.co.uk and JDate.fr).
ResearchNow, an independent research company, found that JDate is responsible for 52 percent of Jewish marriages that started online. This makes JDate responsible for more Jewish marriages than all other online dating sites combined.[4]
Other websites[edit]
In addition to ChristianMingle and JDate, a number of properties are included in Spark Networks’ portfolio:[5]
History[edit]
The company was founded by Joe Y. Shapira in 1997 under the name MatchNet plc.[6]
JDate.com, founded in 1997, was the company's first venture into online dating. The other key web property, ChristianMingle.com, was introduced in 2004.[7]
In January 2005, the company changed its name to Spark Networks because management felt that the new name more sharply distinguished the company in the marketplace.[8]
On November 10, 2014, JDate launched a dating app designed for Jewish singles.[9]
On October 14, 2015, Spark Networks announced the acquisition of Smooch Labs, owner of the popular millennial Jewish dating app JSwipe.[10] Spark Networks launched CROSSPATHS, a dating app that helps like-minded Christians find matches, on October 8, 2015.[11]
Redesigns of the JDate and ChristianMingle websites were announced in 2015. In addition to revamped branding, the site makeovers featured technology changes (including expanded mobile capabilities), a re-designed inbox and a new “daily matches” feature. JDate’s redesign went live on November 18, 2015, while ChristianMingle’s went live on December 17, 2015.[12][13]
Operations[edit]
David Siminoff formerly served as Chief Executive Officer of the company. The current Spark Networks leadership team [14] consists of:

Danny Rosenthal, Chief Executive Officer & Director
David Budworth, Chief Technology Officer
Lisa McLafferty, Chief Revenue Officer
Robert W. O’Hare, Chief Financial Officer

Previously based in Beverly Hills, California, Spark Networks is now based in Los Angeles, California with additional offices in Lehi, Utah and Hertzelia Pituach, Israel.[15]
In 2013, the company authorized the repurchase of $5 million of its outstanding common stock as a reflection of confidence in the long-term business.[16]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
