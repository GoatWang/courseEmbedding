Find CompaniesORCHIDS PAPER PRODUCTS7 reviewsAbout7Reviews23SalariesPhotos1Jobs2Q&AAbout ORCHIDS PAPER PRODUCTSOrchids Paper Products hopes to leave its end users smelling like a rose. The company makes bulk tissue paper and converts it into bathroom tissue, paper napkins, and paper towels for the consumer market. Most of the company's products are sold as private-label items by discount retailers; Orchids Paper products also are sold under the company's Colortex – more... and Velvet brands. Dollar General is Orchids Paper's largest customer; other big customers include Family Dollar and Wal-Mart. Orchids Paper sells most of its products within a 900-mile radius of its manufacturing plant in northeastern Oklahoma.Orchids has been focused on increasing efficiency, and in 2007 it began producing its own parent rolls, which is the material processed into its other products, such as tissue. The move was a successful effort to limit the the company's reliance on outside sources for parent rolls and the subsequent price fluctuations that have characterized that market in recent years.Going forward, the company plans to maximize production with its older equipment in a strategic move that deviates from typical paper product makers that have been shutting down older equipment. Orchids has also invested in new equipment. The result of these efforts will be an increase in capacity that the company hopes to sell through new channels, namely grocery and drug store chains. – lessReviewsOverall3.9Based on 7 reviews5 stars4 stars3 stars2 stars1 starWork/Life Balance3.0Compensation/Benefits3.3Job Security/Advancement3.0Management2.8Culture3.2Featured ReviewDecent pay but not well managedOperator Technician, Pryor, OK - January 10, 2017A typical day consisted of constantly fight a machine to keep it running.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-Looking Information  The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to, among other things:  ? our business strategy;  These statements relate to future events or future financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "should," "could," "expects," "plans," "intends," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. These statements are only predictions.  You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond our control and that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Factors that could materially affect our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements include, but are not limited to, those detailed under the caption "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, as filed with the SEC on March 9, 2015, subsequent filings made with the SEC, and those identified in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, which include but are not limited to the following items:  ? failure to bring the new paper making machine and new converting line in Pryor, Oklahoma, to full capacity in a timely manner; ? failure to complete in a timely and cost efficient manner the construction planned in Barnwell, South Carolina; ? intense competition in our markets and aggressive pricing by our competitors could force us to decrease our prices and reduce our profitability;  If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what we projected. Any forward-looking statement you read in the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflects our current views with respect to future events and is subject to the risks listed above and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, growth strategy, and liquidity. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  Overview of the Business  We are a customer focused, national supplier of high quality consumer tissue products. We produce bulk tissue paper, known as parent rolls, and convert parent rolls into finished products, including paper towels, bathroom tissue and paper napkins. We sell any parent rolls not required by our converting operation to other converters. Our integrated manufacturing facilities have flexible production capabilities, which allow us to produce high quality tissue products with short production times across all quality tiers for customers in our target regions. We predominately sell our products under private labels to our core customer base in the "at home" market, which consists primarily of dollar stores, discount retailers and grocery stores that offer limited alternatives across a wide range of products. Our focus to date has been the dollar stores (which are also referred to as discount retailers) and the broader discount retail market because of their overall market growth, consistent order patterns and low number of stock keeping units ("SKUs"). The "at-home" tissue market consists of several quality levels, including a value tier, premium tier and ultra-premium tier. To a lesser extent, we service customers in the "away from home" market. Our core customer base in the "away from home" market consists of companies in the janitorial market and food service market. Most of the products we sell in the "away from home" market are included in the value tier. While we expect to continue to service this market in the near term, we do not consider the "away from home" market a growth vehicle for us.  Our strategy is to capitalize on positive market trends by leveraging our industry experience, customer relationships and low cost, strategic operating footprint to drive growth and profitability for the business. Our facilities have been designed to have the flexibility to produce and convert parent rolls across different product tiers and to use both virgin and recycled fibers to maximize quality and to control costs. We own an integrated facility in Pryor, Oklahoma which has the capacity to supply 74,000 tons per year primarily to service the central United States. Since 2006, we have consistently invested to modernize the paper making and converting equipment at this location and provide the flexibility discussed above. Furthermore, over the past several years, we have invested approximately $39 million at this facility for a new paper machine and a new converting line. The new paper machine commenced operations in the second quarter of 2015 and provides us with an additional 17,000 tons of parent roll capacity. We believe the new paper machine will improve our margins by reducing our manufacturing cost and by providing us additional parent roll capacity. Our new converting line is expected to commence operations in the second quarter of 2015 and add 12,500 tons of converting capacity. In June 2014, we expanded our geographic presence to service the United States West coast through a strategic transaction with Fabrica de Papel San Francisco, S.A. de C.V. ("Fabrica"), one of the largest tissue manufacturers by capacity in Mexico. The transaction with Fabrica ("Fabrica Transaction") provided us access to its U.S. customers, which we believe will allow us to further penetrate the region, and the supply agreement ("Supply Agreement") we entered into with Fabrica has provided access to up to 19,800 tons of product each year (up to 27,500 tons in the first two years of the agreement).  As part of our strategy to be a national supplier of high quality consumer tissue products, we announced plans in April 2015 to begin construction on a world-class integrated tissue operation in Barnwell, South Carolina. We believe that this new facility will allow us to better serve our existing customers in the Southeast United States, while also enabling us to penetrate new customers in this region. The facility is designed to provide highly flexible, cost competitive production across all quality tiers with paper making capacity of between 35,000 and 40,000 tons per year and converting capacity of between 30,000 and 32,000 tons per year. We expect construction on the site will begin in the second quarter of 2015 with the first converting line to be operational by the end of 2015 and the second converting line to be operational by the end of the second quarter of 2016. The paper machine will utilize a highly versatile process capable of producing ultra-premium tier products, and is expected to be operational by the beginning of 2017. We estimate the total costs of the project to be approximately $110 to $127 million, which will be financed through a combination of bank debt and the proceeds from our recent follow-on stock offering.  Since our inception, we have strategically expanded capacity in both paper manufacturing and finished product converting to meet market demand and customers' quality requirements. The installation of a new paper machine in our Oklahoma facility, which started up in early March 2015, and installation of a new converting line in our Oklahoma facility, which is expected to start up in mid-2015, is expected to bring our manufacturing capacity in line with our paper production capacity, at approximately 74,000 tons. However, any parent rolls in excess of converting production requirements are sold into the market. We adjust our paper making production based on our internal converting needs for parent rolls and the open market demand for parent rolls. Our strategy is to sell all of the parent rolls we manufacture as converted products, which generally carry higher margins than non-converted parent rolls. The capacity obtained under the previously described Fabrica Transaction will be sold in converted product form and we do not plan to sell any excess capacity arising from this transaction in parent roll form. Parent rolls are a commodity product and thus are subject to market pricing. We plan to continue to sell any excess parent roll capacity from Oklahoma on the open market as long as market pricing is profitable. When converting production requirements exceed paper mill capacity, we will purchase parent rolls in the open market to meet those converting requirements.  We supply both national and regional customers, with a focus on regions of the United States with high population growth. We focus our sales efforts on areas within approximately 500 miles of either our manufacturing facility in Oklahoma or Fabrica's manufacturing facility in Mexicali, Mexico, as we believe this radius maximizes our freight cost advantage. Because we are one of the few integrated tissue paper manufacturers in the areas around both our Oklahoma facility and Fabrica's Mexicali facilities, we typically have lower freight costs to our customers' distribution centers located in our target regions. Our target region around our Oklahoma facility includes Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Arkansas. The transaction with Fabrica has allowed us to more effectively service customers that are located on the West Coast by directly shipping them products that are produced in Mexico under the Supply Agreement. As a result, we have expanded our target region to include California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Our planned manufacturing facility in Barnwell, South Carolina is intended to help us meet the growing demand in the South Eastern region of the United States. Demand for tissue in the "at-home" tissue market has historically been closely correlated to population growth and as such, performs well in a variety of economic conditions. Our expanded target region has experienced strong population growth for the past fourteen years relative to the national average, and these trends are expected to continue.  Our products are sold primarily under our customers' private labels and, to a lesser extent, under our brand names such as Colortex(R), My Size(R), Velvet(R), Big Mopper(R), Linen Soft(R), Soft & Fluffy(R), and Tackle(R). The Fabrica Transaction gave us the exclusive right to sell products under Fabrica's brand names into the United States, including under the names Virtue(R), Truly Green(R), Golden Gate Paper(R) and Big Quality(R). All of our converted product net sales are derived through truck load purchase orders from our customers. Parent roll net sales are derived from purchase orders that generally cover a one-month time period. We do not have supply contracts with any of our customers, which is normal practice within our industry. Because our products are a daily consumable item, the order stream from our customer base is fairly consistent with limited seasonal fluctuations. However, we typically experience some mild seasonal softness in the first and fourth quarters of each year, primarily due to the effects of winter weather on consumers' buying habits and occasional effects of holidays on shipping schedules. Changes in the national economy, in general, do not materially affect the market for our converted products due to their non-discretionary nature and high degree of household penetration.  Our profitability depends on several key factors, including but not limited to:  ? the volume of converted product sales; ? the cost of fiber used in producing paper; ? the market price of our products;  The private label market of the tissue industry is highly competitive, and many discount retail customers are extremely price sensitive. As a result, it is difficult to affect price increases. We expect these competitive conditions to continue.  Our Strategy  Our strategy is to be a customer focused national supplier of high quality consumer tissue products. We believe we will achieve this strategy by:  ? strengthening and expanding our customer base through cooperative and innovative product development and superior customer service;  ? focusing on higher growth geographic regions and private label channels;  ? maintaining flexible, low cost integrated facilities able to produce a broad product spectrum;  ? expanding our manufacturing footprint via our transaction with Fabrica and our announced expansion in South Carolina; and  ? employing a disciplined capital strategy by focusing on growing free cash flow, maintaining a low leverage balance sheet and targeting high return capital projects with paybacks of less than five years.  Our strategy is to sell all of our parent roll capacity as converted products (such as paper towels, bathroom tissue and napkins), which generally carry higher margins than non-converted parent rolls. To help achieve that strategy, we are placing significant focus on improving our sales efforts to sell all of our converting capacity. In addition, we continue to focus considerable efforts to improve our converting efficiencies.  We continue to focus our efforts on growth of our converted product sales and expansion of our product offerings through development of premium tier and ultra-premium tier products. The following graph shows shipments of our premium tier and ultra-premium tier products as a percentage of total cases shipped:  [[Image Removed]]  Comparative Three-Month Periods Ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 Net Sales Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 2014 (in thousands, except tons) Converted product net sales $ 37,415 $ 26,154 Parent roll net sales - 1,605 Net sales $ 37,415 $ 27,759 Converted product tons shipped 18,837 12,234 Parent roll tons shipped - 1,786 Total tons shipped 18,837 14,020  Net sales in the quarter ended March 31, 2015, increased $9.7 million, or 35%, from $27.8 million in 2014 to $37.4 million in 2015. Net sales figures represent the gross selling price, including freight, less discounts and pricing allowances.  Net sales of converted product increased $11.3 million, or 43%, from $26.2 million in 2014 to $37.4 million in 2015. The increase in converted product net sales is primarily due to a 54% increase in tonnage shipped, which was partially offset by a 7% decrease in net selling price per ton. Converted product tons shipped increased due to the effect of the U.S. business acquired from Fabrica, which accounted for 85% of the increase in tonnage shipped. Net selling price per ton decreased due to the mix of products sold, primarily due to the effects of the "away-from-home" business acquired in the Fabrica transaction, which have a lower selling price than "at-home" sales.  There were no net sales of parent rolls in 2015, a decrease of $1.6 million from 2014. The decrease in parent roll net sales was due to the demolition of two paper machines in September of 2014 in conjunction with our new paper machine project. The new paper machine started up in early March 2015, but all parent rolls produced were used in our converting operation during the quarter.  Cost of Sales Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 2014 (in thousands, except gross profit margin % and paper cost per ton consumed) Cost of goods sold $ 30,541 $ 19,532 Depreciation 2,088 2,209 Cost of sales $ 32,629 $ 21,741 Gross profit $ 4,786 $ 6,018 Gross profit margin % 12.8 % 21.7 % Total paper cost per ton consumed $ 969 $ 740  The major components of cost of sales are the cost of internally produced paper, raw materials, direct labor and benefits, freight costs of products shipped to customers, insurance, repairs and maintenance, energy, utilities, depreciation and the cost of converted products purchased under the Supply Agreement with Fabrica.  Cost of sales increased $10.9 million, or 50%, to $32.6 million in the 2015 period, compared to $21.7 million in the same period of 2014, due primarily to increased sales, higher paper production costs and higher per case converting production costs. Paper production costs in our Oklahoma facility increased primarily due to the demolition of two paper machines in September 2014, which resulted in (i) lower production levels, thereby causing a negative effect on absorption of fixed overhead costs, and (ii) the need to purchase parent rolls in the open market to supplement our paper making capacity, which totaled $3.0 million in the quarter. Paper production costs in Oklahoma also increased due to higher fiber prices and $300,000 of costs incurred to repair wastewater equipment during the quarter. Converting production costs in Oklahoma increased on a per case basis due to an 8% decrease in production in the first quarter of 2015. Higher labor and maintenance and repairs costs were partially offset by lower outside warehousing expenses and lower employee relocation expenses. As a result, cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 87.2% in the 2015 quarter from 78.3% in the 2014 quarter.  As noted above, paper production costs in our Oklahoma facility were negatively affected by the previously discussed shutdown in September of two paper machines, which increased production costs per ton primarily due to the effect of reducing fixed cost absorption, and a 4% increase in average fiber prices across our fiber basket in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same quarter in 2014, which increased our cost of sales by approximately $700,000 in the quarter-over-quarter comparison.  Gross Profit  Gross profit in the quarter ended March 31, 2015, decreased $1.2 million, or 20%, to $4.8 million compared to $6.0 million in the same period last year.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 2014 (in thousands, except SG&A as a % of net sales) Commission expense $ 329 $ 444 Other S,G&A expenses 2,168 1,735 Selling, General & Adm exp $ 2,497 $ 2,179 SG&A as a % of net sales 6.7 % 7.8 %  Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, commissions to brokers and other miscellaneous expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $318,000, or 15%, in the quarter ended March 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 primarily due to $153,000 of additional non-cash compensation expense related to options granted to management during 2014, increased professional fees and increased wages related to salespeople required to support sales related to the Fabrica Transaction, which were partially offset by lower commission expense due to the mix of converted products sold and lower artwork and product packaging design fees. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 6.7% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to 7.8% in the same period of 2014.  Amortization of Intangibles  The Company recognized $377,000 of amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired in the Fabrica Transaction during the quarter ended March 31, 2015.  Operating Income  As a result of the foregoing factors, operating income for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, was $1.9 million compared to operating income of $3.8 million for the same period of 2014.  Interest Expense and Other Income Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 2014 (in thousands) Interest expense $ 214 $ 13 Other (income) expense, net $ (186 ) $ 1 Income before income taxes $ 1,884 $ 3,825  Interest expense includes interest on all debt and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. Interest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 totaled $214,000 compared to interest expense of $13,000 in the same period of 2014. Interest expense for 2014 excludes $73,000 of interest capitalized on significant projects during the quarter. Interest expense was higher in the quarter ended March 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014 primarily due to higher debt balances in the first quarter of 2015 due primarily to additional debt incurred in conjunction with the Fabrica Transaction in the second quarter of 2014 and additional borrowings under our line of credit to finance capital expenditures.  Income Before Income Taxes  As a result of the foregoing factors, income before income taxes decreased $1.9 million to $1.9 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2015, compared to $3.8 million in the same period in 2014.  Income Tax Provision  As of March 31, 2015, our annual estimated effective income tax rate is 34.4%, compared to an annual estimated effective income tax rate of 31.1% as of March 31, 2014. The annual estimated effective tax rate in 2015 is higher than the 2014 effective tax rate primarily due to the effect of foreign and state income taxes related to the Fabrica Transaction. The annual estimated effective tax rate for 2015 differs from the statutory rate due primarily to U.S. manufacturing tax credits and foreign and state income taxes. The annual estimated effective tax rate for 2014 is lower than the statutory rate due primarily to U.S. manufacturing tax credits.  Future Expected Stock Option Expense  In 2014, the Board of Directors granted options to purchase 145,000 shares of the Company's common stock to certain members of management. Additionally, on April 9, 2014, the Company's shareholders approved the option to purchase 400,000 shares of the Company's common stock granted to Mr. Jeffrey S. Schoen, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, on November 8, 2013. These options will become exercisable in four equal tranches, if at all, if and when the share price of the common stock closes at a certain percentage of the purchase price of the option for three consecutive business days, in accordance with the following vesting schedule:   Share price required to achieve vesting Tranche 1 $ 34.788 Tranche 2 $ 42.350 Tranche 3 $ 51.425 Tranche 4 $ 60.500  The grant of these options will have a material impact on the Company's future results of operations and on the comparability of the Company's results from period to period. The Company expenses the cost of these options granted on a straight-line basis over the implicit, or derived, service period of the option based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company expects to expense the compensation cost associated with these options based on the following schedule:   2015 2015 2016 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Total Total (in thousands) Tranche 1 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - Tranche 2 134 104 1 1 240 - Tranche 3 73 72 72 72 289 59 Tranche 4 47 48 47 47 189 136 Total expense $ 254 $ 224 $ 120 $ 120 $ 718 $ 195  However, if the market condition is achieved for any tranche of these options prior to the end of the derived service period, all remaining expense related to that tranche would be recognized in the period in which the market condition is achieved.

19.4%Jeff Schoen, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Despite  intense competitive pressures, year-over-year adjusted EBITDA increased 2%, the adjusted EBITDA margin increased from 19.4% to 20.3%, and Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation, decreased 4.4% while Sales declined only 2.3%. In other words, improved cash margins and cost cutting helped offset the impact of the decline in sales. On the whole, the fourth quarter of
2016 was characterized by a continuation of trends previously noted in the second and third quarters, principally competitive pressures that did not abate. As discussed in the third quarter earnings calls, Orchids has been active in several retailers' private label bids as part of our plan to increase breadth and depth in Orchids customer base. As previously announced, Orchids recently won private label bids and branded business that, all things being equal, are expected to increase sales volumes of converted products by over 35% in the second half of 2017. These developments lead us to remain optimistic about our ability to achieve our goal to grow Orchids' annual earnings per share (EPS) to within the approximate range of $2.50 to $3.50. We estimate that, based on current trends, our running rate EPS figure will enter this range by early 2018 and be toward the higher end of
this range by the end of 2018.   I am also pleased that, as previously announced, our bankers agreed to relax our covenant restrictions for a temporary period and increase our debt availability to allow us to bridge the next few quarters to our greater level of operations, inclusive of the completion of the capacity expansion in Barnwell, South Carolina. Regarding this project, the two converting lines are ramping-up to meet the new demand, and the paper mill is still scheduled for completion around the end of the first quarter of 2017, with the major ramp-up of the paper mill occurring in second quarter of 2017. The total projected expenditure for the facility remains at $150 million of which approximately $119.2 million had been expended as of December 31, 2016."Fourth Quarter 2016, relative to Fourth Quarter 2015Net sales decreased $4.2 million,
or 10%, primarily due to heavy promotional activity by brand-competitors and other competitive pressures. Parent roll sales increased by $0.7 million while converted product sales decreased by $4.9 million. Of the $4.9 million decrease, $3.7 million was attributable to the decreased number of tons sold, and $1.2 million was due to a decline in the average price per ton that principally reflects the mix of customers buying the products.Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation, decreased $2.1 million, or 7%. The decrease in sales volumes, contributed to the relative decrease in Cost of sales, as did spreading fixed overhead over a lower volume and approximately $0.6 million in additional costs for our Mexicali operations, which reflected increased costs for fiber, electricity, and overhead that were only partially offset by favorable foreign exchange impacts upon peso-denominated
costs.Interest expense increased $0.3 million, or 112%, due principally to increased debt levels and financial leverage.Other expenses increased $0.5 million principally due to the recognition of a $0.4 million foreign exchange loss on the valuation of VAT and income tax receivables. As the balances of these receivables have been diminished, this economic loss is not expected to be reoccurring to this extent.As discussed further below, the Company's recognition of tax credits lessened tax expense by $2.1 million, contributing this greater amount to net income. As a consequence, principally of these factors, net income declined from $3.7 million to $2.6 million, or 29%.Twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016 compared to same period in 2015Net sales decreased $4.0 million or 2%. Parent roll sales decreased by $1.0 million, and
converted product sales decreased by $3.0 million. Of the $3.0 million decrease, all $3.0 million was attributable to the decreased number of tons sold, as the average selling price did not change year-over-year.Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation, decreased $5.6 million, or 4%.  Overall, lower fiber costs in the United States are estimated to have saved the Company $2.5 million during 2016. We estimate that the devaluation of the peso reduced year-over-year costs by roughly $1.4 million. The Company received $1.1 million of business interruption insurance proceeds in the second quarter of 2016, which was applied to Cost of sales. Cost reductions in our Oklahoma converting operation, product-mix impacts, and lower sales volumes also contributed to the lower Cost of sales. Offsetting these favorable cost changes to a degree, Barnwell's (fixed) overhead expense (before
being allocated to the inventory produced) in 2016 was $4.8 million, relative to $0.3 million in 2015, following from the start-up and ramp-up of those operations. Depreciation expense increased $2.0 million, or 21%, due to the improvement and expansion projects placed into service.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million, or 7%. Administrative compensation expenses decreased $0.4 million while sales compensation increased $0.3 million. Recruiting and relocation expenses increased $0.3 million. A variety of increases in professional and consulting expenses largely led to the balance of the change.   Interest expense increased $1.2 million, or 222%, due principally to increased debt levels and financial leverage.Other income decreased $0.5 million principally, as noted above, due to a $0.4 million foreign exchange loss on the
valuation of VAT and income tax receivables that was recognized. As the balances of these receivables have been diminished, this economic loss is not expected to be reoccurring to this extent.Tax expense decreased by $1.6 million or 27%. As of December 31, 2016, our effective tax rate was 25.6% as compared to 30.9% for 2015.  The effective rate was less than statutory rates due principally to Oklahoma, South Carolina, Indian Employment, and Foreign tax credits. Current income taxes in fiscal year 2016 provided a benefit of $3.2 million whereas current income taxes for the 2015 period were $1.8 million. The change was driven by accelerated tax depreciation and other timing differences recognized in 2016. The Company ended 2016 with a tax receivable balance of $8.7 million. The Company expects its effective tax rate for 2017 to return to the range of 30% to
34%.Liquidity

$     4,361At December 31, 2016, Debt, not having been netted with unamortized deferred debt issuance costs, was $142.0 million and the Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio reportable to our bankers was 4.3.Fourth quarter 2016 relative to fourth quarter 2015: Operating cash flows excluding changes in working capital decreased $6.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting a decrease in tax payments and to
a lesser extent, the decrease in net income. Changes in working capital contributed $1.6 million to operating cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus having used $6.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This largely reflects the collection of accounts receivable, decreased inventory levels, and the draw-down of prepaid expenses, partially offset by pay-downs of accounts payable. Increased borrowings in both periods were used to finance investments in the Barnwell facility and to upgrade line 6 at the Pryor facility. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company received $12.0 million of restricted cash from financings, which was set aside for the Barnwell project and was, accordingly, included in Investing activities. The Company paid dividends of $3.6 million in both quarters, which are included in Financing activities.Twelve months ended December 31, 2016 relative to
the same period in 2015: Operating cash flows excluding changes in working capital increased $2.9 million year over year, reflecting increases in cash-earnings and the deferral of tax payments. Additionally, a net decrease in the change in working capital accounts of $6.1 million as compared to 2015 was principally due to the timing of receivable collections. Increased borrowings in both periods were used to finance investments in the Barnwell facility.

A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") in the United States in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of a company. The non-GAAP financial measures used within this press release are: (1) EBITDA, (2) Adjusted EBITDA, (3) Operating Cash Flow, less changes in working capital, and (4) Changes in working capital.    EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Cash Flow less changes in working capital, and Changes in working capital are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should
not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, diluted net income per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity. EBITDA represents net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization.  Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA less stock-based compensation expense. Changes in working capital is the subtotal of changes in operating assets and liabilities shown on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Operating Cash Flow less changes in working capital is Net Cash provided by operating activities less Changes in working capital. Management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA facilitate operating performance comparisons between periods and between companies by eliminating potential differences caused by variations in
capital structures (affecting relative interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses), the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense), and non-cash compensation (affecting stock-based compensation expense). These measures are also commonly used in the industry and are used by our lenders in monitoring adherence to covenants. Management believes that Changes in working capital provides an indication of the cash invested in or provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities and therefore may indicate trends in operating performance and may call out a significant source or use of cash during any period. Operating Cash Flow less changes in working capital is believed to provide an estimate of the cash generated from all operating activities,
prior to investments in or liquidations of operating assets and liabilities and therefore may indicate trends in operating performance and may call out significant changes in the generation of cash through operating activities.

tis_10k_2017-03-15_42_130Financial - Cash FlowCash flows provided by financing activities increased from $11.1 million in 2014 to $59.7 million in 2015, primarily due to $32.1 million of net proceeds received from a follow-on offering of 1.5 million shares of the Companys common stock in April 2015.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_40_126Revenue - ProductThe increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the timing of sales to customers and related cash receipts.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_24_79Other - OtherThis rate is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to a change in estimate recognized in 2014, as we believe our deferred assets and liabilities will be recognized at rates other than previously estimated, manufacturing tax deductions and OITC associated with investments in our manufacturing operations.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_60_180Financial - EarningsUnder the excess earnings method, we must estimate future revenues, including growth and attrition rates, income tax rates, a rate of return on assets, and discount rates.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_72_208Financial - DebtBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or to reduce our indebtedness.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_15_61Financial - ExpenseThe reduction in SG&A was primarily due to lower commissions in 2015 related to mix of products sold and lower non-cash compensation expense related to stock options granted to management.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_41_127Financial - Cash FlowCash flows used in investing activities increased from $37.4 million in 2014 to $75.2 million in 2015 due to $63.2 million of capital expenditures, including $41.8 million for our South Carolina facility, and $12.0 million of cash restricted in the NMTC transaction.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_4_20Revenue - ProductThe lower volume of parent roll sales in 2016 reflects parent roll product that was used in part for the Barnwell, South Carolina start-up, thereby forgoing margin we would have received on parent roll sales in favor of margin on tonnage sold as converted product.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_10_47Financial - ExpenseProduction costs in our converting operation were higher primarily due to higher labor and higher repair and maintenance expenses.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_83_238Other - OtherFactors that could materially affect our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements include, but are not limited to, those detailed under the caption Risk Factors and the following items:
tis_10k_2017-03-15_40_123Financial - Cash FlowCash flows provided by operating activities decreased from $20.2 million in 2014 to $18.8 million in 2015 primarily due to an increase in deferred income taxes and income taxes receivable, an increase in inventories and an increase in accounts receivable.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_74_211Revenue - ProductAdjusted EBITDA as a percent of net sales increased from 19.4% in 2015 to 20.3% in 2016.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_42_132Financial - DividendThese inflows were partially offset by dividend payments to stockholders of $13.8 million in 2015, $2.7 million of debt principal repayments, a decrease in bank overdrafts of $1.7 million, and $1.3 million of debt issuance costs incurred.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_39_122Financial - DividendThese inflows were partially offset by dividend payments to stockholders of $13.8 million, $2.7 million of debt principal repayments, a decrease in bank overdrafts of $1.7 million, and $1.3 million of debt issuance costs incurred in 2015.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_78_230Other - OtherThe increase in cash was primarily due to increased cash provided by operating activities in 2016 and increased borrowings under our credit facility.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_14_57Financial - ExpenseSG&A expenses increased $0.7 million, or 7%, to $10.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $9.5 million in 2015.

tis_10k_2017-03-15_69_200Other - OtherWe use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_70_205Financial - ExpenseWe believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting relative interest expense, tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses, the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense, non- cash compensation and valuation affecting stock compensation expense and sporadic expenses including costs of business acquisitions, demolition costs and change in estimated state tax liabilities.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_60_179Revenue - ProductThe with and without method requires assumptions related to the probability of competition in the absence of the non-compete agreement, the loss of future revenues due to competition and discount rates.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_68_261Financial - DebtIn addition to our GAAP results, we also consider non-GAAP measures of our performance for a number of purposes including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt, each of which is defined below.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_27_87Financial - Shares / EquityHowever we may issue equity to decrease leverage, which would also provide head-room that could be used to support the Barnwell ramp-up and later be used to facilitate growth opportunities.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_28_92Financial - Shares / EquityFinancing for this project was provided through a combination of: i a follow-on offering of 1.5 million shares of our common stock, which provided net proceeds of $32.1 million ii refinancing and expansion of our credit facility with U.S. Bank, and iii a New Market Tax Credit  NMTC  transaction, under which we received $16.2 million of proceeds.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_15_60Financial - ExpenseSG&A expenses decreased $2.1 million, or 18%, to $9.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $11.7 million in 2014.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_70_204Financial - ExpenseAdjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before non-cash stock compensation expense and sporadic expenses, such as costs of business acquisitions and costs to demolish property, plant and equipment.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_10_45Financial - ExpenseWe consumed approximately 3,000 tons of parent rolls during the project period, which increased our cost of goods sold by approximately $3.4 million.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_39_121Financial - Shares / EquityIn comparison, in 2015 we received $32.1 million of net proceeds from a follow-on offering of 1.5 million shares of the Companys common stock, borrowed $41.9 million under our credit facility and term loans with U.S. Bank and received $5.1 million of net proceeds under the NMTC transaction.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_22_75Revenue - GeographyThis rate is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to South Carolina Investment Tax Credits  SCITC  and Oklahoma Investment Tax Credits  OITC  associated with investments in the Companys manufacturing operations in Barnwell, South Carolina and Pryor, Oklahoma, respectively, and federal credits, including Indian Employment Credits  IEC , foreign tax credits and research and development credits.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_5_29Revenue - ProductThe increase in parent roll shipments was primarily due to the new paper machine project in Oklahoma, which resulted in a higher amount of tons produced and available for sale in the open market.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_12_54Revenue - ProductAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased to 18.1% in 2015 compared to 18.7% in 2014.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_69_201Financial - EarningsEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_78_228Financial - DebtNet Debt increased from $71.2 million on December 31, 2015 to $133.2 million on December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in total debt, which was partially offset by an increase in our total cash.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_34_110Other - OtherSignificant future expansion or capacity improvement projects beyond those discussed would likely be funded consistent with our past practices.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_73_262Financial - EarningsThe following table reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:
tis_10k_2017-03-15_5_30Other - OtherThe increase in selling price per ton was primarily due to strong demand for parent rolls in 2015.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_72_209Other - OtherWe compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_16_245Financial - ExpenseThe Company recognized $1.2 million, $1.5 million and $0.8 million of amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired in the Fabrica Transaction during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

tis_10k_2017-03-15_40_125Other - OtherThe increase in inventories was primarily due to an increase in parent roll inventory as we prepared for the start-up of the converting lines in our South Carolina facility.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_5_25Revenue - ProductA full-year of sales under the Fabrica Transaction accounted for 72% of the increase in tonnage shipped.

tis_10k_2017-03-15_9_42Financial - ExpenseThese factors were partially offset by lower paper production costs in our Oklahoma facility following the start-up of the new paper machine in March 2015.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_62_187Other - OtherIntangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives ranging from two to twenty years.

tis_10k_2017-03-15_75_218Revenue - ProductEBITDA as a percent of net sales increased from 16.7% in 2014 to 18.6% in 2015.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_12_55Financial - EarningsThe decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to higher fiber costs, the effect of the new paper machine project on our first quarter 2015 results, higher production costs in our converting operation, higher depreciation, and an incident in our converting operation in the fourth quarter of 2015 that curtailed production and resulted in lost sales.
tis_10k_2017-03-15_58_166Financial - ExpenseHowever, if the market condition is achieved for any tranche of these options prior to the end of the derived service period, all remaining expense related to that tranche would be recognized in the period in which the market condition is achieved.
