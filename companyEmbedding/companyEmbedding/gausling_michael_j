Thompson.OraSure said Thompson resigned his position and his seat on the company's board of directors to pursue other opportunities.The leadership change comes less than two weeks after OraSure announced Jan. 18 that it had disappointing sales in 2001 and would report an annual loss of between $3 million and $3.2 million.The announcement had a devastating impact on OraSure stock. Shares are down 45 percent since then and closed Thursday at $5.68. Shares traded as high as $15 in July.Gausling wouldn't comment on the reasons behind Thompson's departure, but acknowledged that the company's recent performance played a part."One could connect the dots if one wanted to," Gausling said. "There are high expectations in the marketplace for our company. It's a terrific opportunity for me to take [it] to the next level."In addition to his new leadership role, Gausling will continue to sit on OraSure's board of directors.Gausling had served as OraSure's president and chief operating officer since the company was formed in September 2000. It was founded by a $255 million merger of STC Technologies of Bethlehem and Epitope Inc. of Beaverton, Ore.Gausling co-founded STC in 1987 and was the company's president and CEO. Thompson was Epitope's CEO, and assumed leadership of the combined companies.OraSure specializes in oral fluids medical testing. Products include the world's only saliva-based HIV test, as well as saliva-based tests for drug and alcohol abuse. The company makes tests for other diseases and cryosurgical equipment for the treatment of skin lesions such as warts.OraSure is developing technology that could lead to the introduction of more testing products, including tests for heart disease, cancer, allergies, thyroid problems and DNA.The company, which trades on the Nasdaq stock exchange, employs about 225 people, including 150 in Bethlehem, Gausling said.OraSure got off to a successful start after the merger and grew quickly.Last October, the company reported its first quarterly profit and broke ground on a 45,000-square-foot manufacturing center adjacent to its headquarters in south Bethlehem."It's bigger than our current needs but it's not bigger than our plans," Gausling said at the time. "We feel very bullish about our future."Since then, OraSure has encountered financial challenges. When OraSure announced lower-than-expected sales earlier this month, Thompson blamed the results on several factors, including a merger last year between two of its biggest customers, LabOne and Osborn Group.The combined company reduced its orders and now operates with less inventory than the two companies individually, he said.Also, sales of OraSure's wart-removal product were down in Europe.And a weak economy hurt employment hiring, which in turn hurt sales of OraSure's drugs-of-abuse tests. Employers use the products to test job candidates for drug use.Gausling said he remains optimistic about OraSure and believes 2002 will be a much better year.A Lehigh Valley native, Gausling said he is enthusiastic about leading the company in a place he calls home."I am one of the founders of STC and I am one of the largest shareholders of this public company," Gausling said. "I love what I do, and I love doing it in this community."christian.berg@mcall.com610-820-6517
