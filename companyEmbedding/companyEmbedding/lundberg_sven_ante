Farming Practices"Leave the land better than you found it," Albert Lundberg used to say. In 1937, Albert and Frances moved to California from Nebraska after experiencing the devastation of the Dustbowl. The growing and processing techniques of Lundberg Family Farms have developed out of the family's experience. Albert recognized the role short-sighted farming techniques played in the Dustbowl. He became committed to working in partnership with nature by using ecological farming techniques that care for the soil, wildlife, air and water. Albert shared his respect for the land with his four sons, who in turn passed their deep-rooted beliefs about the land onto their children. Since 1937, the Lundberg family has been faithful to Albert's farming philosophy. To this day, we use the following farming techniques on family fields in order to ensure we leave the land better than we found it.

Path Towards SustainabilityLundberg Family Farms has been an early leader in organic farming, in energy conservation and renewable energy, in providing safe and fair working conditions, and many other practices that are environmentally and socially responsible.  However, we know there is much more we could do to move our company towards sustainability and inspire greater changes beyond just us. In 2008 we hired our first Environmental Coordinator to develop environmental goals for us and help realize those goals.  In 2009, we signed onto the “Declaration of Sustainability in the Organic Food Trade”, created by the Sustainable Food Trade Association (SFTA, formerly known as FTSLA or the Food Trade Sustainability Leadership Association). This organization provides businesses in the organic food trade with guidelines and recommendations for how to embody sustainability in their own operations. The SFTA spent two years compiling input from organic growers, distributors, processors, retailers and certifiers to create an 11-point action plan. Lundberg Family Farms has signed a pledge committing to continual improvement and transparency around practices in 11 actionable areas including: organic, distribution, energy, climate change, water, packaging, labor, animal care, consumer education and governance.

Each year, Lundberg Family Farms will strive for continuous, progressive, improvement and to practice transparency in annually auditing performance by selecting reporting metrics that are relevant.

How does the Annual Paid Membership and Free 30 Day Trial work?


The Membership
By joining Thrive Market as an annual member, you’ll be joining hundreds of thousands of Americans across the country who are already enjoying wholesome products at wholesale prices. Because of the membership, we don’t have to mark up our products like other retailers and can pass along those savings to our members. As a result, the average member makes back their $59.95 annual membership fee (that’s just $5/month) in savings in just 2 orders. For each paid membership, Thrive Market provides a free membership to a family in need, teacher, veteran, or first responder. Together we can make healthy options affordable and accessible to everyone.


The Free 30 Day Trial
We’re so confident in the value of the annual membership, that we let new shoppers try Thrive Market for free for the first 30 days. We’ve found overwhelmingly that this allows first time Thrivers to shop, discover, save, and quickly see the value of becoming an annual paid member at just $59.95 for the full year.

Is your question more specific?

Yes
No


We're glad this helped and resolved your issue





What is Thrive Gives?


Thrive Gives is our way of making healthy living affordable and accessible to everyone. We understand that paying our annual membership fee may not be possible for everyone, so for every paid membership we sell, we give a free membership to someone in need. Thrive Market members and Thrive Gives members enjoy the same access to wholesome products at wholesale prices. We distribute these free memberships through our Thrive Gives program and our nonprofit partners. Learn more  here.

Is your question more specific?

Yes
No

How can I invite my friends to Thrive Market?


Any friend of yours is a friend of ours! Please log into your account and go to the Invite Friends section of your account. From there, you can invite friends to join by email, Facebook, or by copying and sharing your unique referral link. For each person you invite who becomes a paid member, you'll earn $25 in Thrive Cash. There is no limit to the number of friends you can invite to join—the more the merrier!
