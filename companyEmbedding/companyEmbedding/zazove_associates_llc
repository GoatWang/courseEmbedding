Alternative Credit – Zazove



































 Alternative Credit Convertibles 
The Zazove Alternative Credit Convertibles Strategy takes advantage of an inefficient (or “busted”) segment of the convertible market. The strategy in an absolute return approach to convertible bond investing that realizes high current income and capital appreciation. The investment objective is accomplished by constructing and managing a diversified portfolio of higher yielding convertibles, generally issued by companies with sub investment grade credit ratings. The investment team utilizes a bottom-up, fundamental credit research and investment process to identify issuers with viable business models and acceptable credit risk that are undervalued, out-of-favor, or overlooked. The portfolio is constructed to offer a substantial risk-adjusted yield advantage and capital appreciation as compared to similarly rated straight debt investments.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Suncoast Credit Union


                                            Once again Suncoast has shown itself to be a preschooler in the land of credit unions.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

Woodforest National Bank


                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            It's not the worst, but it's certainly deceptive. I can't trust a company that lies to me for two bucks.

Veridian Credit Union


                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

                                            Grange Insurance added a 58% surcharge to our auto policy after a icy bridge weather related accident.  The increase totaled of $1042.00.

I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!
