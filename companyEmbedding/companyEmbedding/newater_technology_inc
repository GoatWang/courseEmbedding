After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
expenses of this offering payable by us, we expect net proceeds from this
offering of approximately $4.9 million (or $5.8 million if the underwriters’
option to purchase additional common shares from us is exercised in full), based
on an assumed initial public offering price of $4.50 per share, the midpoint of
the estimated price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus. The
net proceeds from this offering must be remitted to China before we will be able
to use the funds to grow our business. The procedure to remit funds may take
several months after completion of this offering, and we will be unable to use
the offering proceeds in China until remittance is completed.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows after we complete
the remittance process:

. approximately $4.4 million for the purchase of equipment and supplies 
  including assembly line, process and testing equipment, membranes and modules,
  and the construction of our automatic DTRO membrane production line in Yantai
  City;

. approximately $500,000 in escrow for indemnity claims of the underwriters, 
  which sum could be returned to us after two years from the date of this 
  offering; and

. any balance for additional working capital. 

The precise amounts and percentage of proceeds we devote to particular 
categories of activity, and their priority of use, will depend on prevailing
market and business conditions as well as on the nature of particular
opportunities that may arise from time to time. Accordingly, we reserve the
right to change the use of proceeds that we presently anticipate and describe
herein. Pending remitting the offering proceeds to China, we intend to invest
our net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing, and investment-grade
obligations. 

Indemnification Escrow Agreement 

We have agreed with the underwriters to establish an escrow account in the
United States and to fund such account with $500,000 from this offering that may
be utilized by the underwriters to fund any bona fide indemnification claims of
the underwriters arising during a two-year period following the offering. The
escrow account will not be interest bearing, and we will be free to invest the
assets in certain securities during the two-year period. All funds that are not
subject to an indemnification claim will be returned to us after the two-year
period expires.


We face significant competition in our market from numerous large companies and
many smaller regional competitors. In some instances, our primary competition
comes from alternative, often older technologies, such as chemical additives,
sand filtration, and pasteurization as opposed to the finer level of membrane
filtration that we provide. There are barriers to entry in our market limiting
the number of qualified competitors. These barriers result from stringent
product performance standards, product qualification protocols and requirements
for consistent levels of service and support. We believe that our broad array of
products and product designs coupled with our engineering and manufacturing
expertise enables us to provide customers with differentiated product
performance and value and customer support. 

Many large foreign corporations have entered the Chinese market, including Pall
Corporation, Rochem Group, General Electric, and Koch Industries, Inc. Large
foreign corporations have a competitive advantage over us with regard to capital
and technology. We also compete with a domestic company, Beijing Tiandiren
Environmental Protection Co., Ltd. 

Our products are generally customized. Customers’ needs and requirements vary
from project to project. As a result, technical solutions at bidding create
price driven competition. We attempt to mitigate this price pressure by
differentiating ourselves from our competition based on the value we bring to
clients through the quality of our products and projects and the ability to
provide tailored solutions for their needs. 

We believe we have competitive advantages in the market we serve due to our
ability to identify smaller-sized projects occurring throughout China due to Mr.
Li’s network and experience. Many of these opportunities are not as widely
publicized as larger-scale projects, which often opt for foreign systems
manufactured by large corporations. We are able to maximize our deal flow by
being aware of all opportunities due to information provided by our sales team.
In addition, we enjoy the advantage of being able to provide products to
intermediate users that are unable to produce their own filtration products. 

The principal competitive factors in our markets include: 

. the ability to provide projects and products that are innovative and 
  attractive to customers;

. product functionality, quality and performance; 

. pricing; 

. ability to find projects; 

. reputation in the market; 

. ability to introduce new products to the market in a timely manner; and 

. ability to address unique client needs.


Company Description
We are a wastewater purification treatment company that focuses on the 
development, manufacture and sale of disk tube reverse osmosis (“DTRO”) and disk
tube nanofiltration (“DTNF”) membrane filtration products that are used in the
treatment, recycling and discharge of wastewater. We also supply


 hardware and
engineered systems necessary to implement integrated solutions with our DTRO and
DTNF products. We provide engineering support and installation, technical advice
and service, and other project-related solutions to filter wastewater into
valuable, clean water. Our DTRO expertise enables us to develop an array of core
materials and technologies that can be applied in a variety of ways to solve
complex filtration, separation and purification challenges related to wastewater
treatment. We also offer traditional wastewater treatment solutions, such as
activated carbon and resins. Our products can be used across a wide spectrum of
industries that include a wastewater treatment component and applications to
treat wastewater for discharge or filtration into high quality, re-useable clean
water, including: 

. Treatment of leachate from landfills; 

. Treatment of power plant wastewater; 

. Treatment of wastewater from oilfields; 

. Treatment of wastewater from gas production; 

. Treatment of high acid wastewater; 

. Treatment of high alkali wastewater; and 

. Desalination.

We currently service the waste (garbage), chemical and energy industries. Our
deep customer process knowledge, scientific expertise, and related engineering
know-how enable us to provide cost-effective solutions for our customers, with
products that are specifically targeted to meet their needs. 

Yantai Jinzheng Eco-Technology Co., Ltd (“Jinzheng”) was founded in 2012 by our
Chief Executive Officer, Yuebiao Li, and our Chief Financial Officer, Zhuo
Zhang. 

We rely on our technology patents to protect our domestic business interests and
ensure our competitive position in our industry. We have placed a high priority
on the management of our intellectual property. Some products that are material
to our operating results incorporate patented technology. Although patented
technology is important to the continued success of our products, we do not
believe that our business, as a whole, is dependent on, or that its
profitability would be materially affected by the revocation, termination,
expiration or infringement upon any particular patent. 

We own eight patents in China covering our water filtration production
technology, and we rely on a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret
laws and non-disclosure agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual
property rights.

The Energy-passive Groundwater Recharge Product (EGRP®)  is a patented breakthrough innovation that manages surface and underground water in an eco-friendly and sustainable way.

 



Promotes infiltration
The EGRP® increases infiltration by establishing a connection between the surface and soil and rebalances the hydrologic cycle that was disrupted by impervious surfaces.



Promotes drainage
The EGRP® reduces stress on overburdened stormwater drainage systems by mitigating stormwater runoff and removing excess rain and groundwater from the surface.



Facilitates the movement of water
The EGRP® provides a path for water molecules to move by harnessing energy from the ground to push and pull the water to nearby soil particles.






Manages waterThe EGRP® helps rebalance groundwater conditions by establishing new ways water can move to, and through, the soil. The EGRP® also enhances the balance between wet and dry areas and distributes water in greater volumes of soil.



Improves moisture content The EGRP® equalizes soil moisture content by establishing a connection between the surface and soil. It also nourishes the root system by bringing moisture towards the surface during dry seasons.



Recharges groundwater
Groundwater recharge is a hydrologic process where water moves downward from surface water to groundwater. This process usually occurs in the vadose zone below plant roots and is often expressed as a flux to the water table surface. Through the facilitation of water movement and infiltration of water, the EGRP® provides more water volume underground.

7 Great Ways to Save on your Cell Phone Bill








These days the big 4 cell phone companies seem to charge a fortune for service. While they give you much more than a few years ago a lot of their features are unnecessary. These 7 tips will help to find a lower price, and you may even notice that you're paying for things you don't even use.

1.  Go Prepaid
Many times they offer significant discounts on prepaid plans. First, you need to look at what you actually need. For many years I had a prepaid plan. It gave me the flexibility to change plans when ever I needed to, and I could easily reload credit with prepaid cards available at almost every store.

2. Don't Go Unlimited ~ Unless you need to
Many times people buy plans that are much bigger than they need because they don't want to have to worry about going over the limit. If you look at your plan's usage and could save money by dropping to a lower rate tier, it's usually worth while since chances are you won't suddenly change how much you're using. You can always consider the money you saved if you ever do have to pay an overage fee on a certain month.

3. Add a Line to your Families Plan
This is what I currently do. Since many plans have very cheap add a line offers I took advantage of that. This allows my plan to be essentially only $10 a month with T-Mobile, but you can allow both parties to benefit by contributing more to the overall plan than the add a line cost.

4. Check if a carrier is offering you a deal to switch
Many times reward sites offer significant cash back for joining a new carrier. Currently, Swagbucks is offering cash back on most of the major carriers. Including more than $28.50 cash back for starting new service with Verizon Wireless.

5. Go to a Smaller Carrier 
Many times you can save money by going with a smaller carrier that doesn't own or maintain their own towers. This can save you a lot of money. Right now Boost offers 4 unlimited lines for $25 each. They use Sprint's network, so if you currently have excellent service from them, it might be worth giving Boost a look. 

6. See if you qualify for a Student or Employee Discount
Many companies and schools have agreements that allow their member to get discounts. I've even seen discounts as high as 15% for members of certain organizations. Just make sure you read the fine print since there are often a lot of exclusions and terms to get that price.

7. Ask if your Carrier can Give you a Lower Price
You can always ask if they can make you a better offer. There is a lot of competition between the wireless carries and a lot of times rather than lose you they would rather give you a better price.

Five Great Inexpensive Laptop Accessories






1. AmazonBasics Laptop Sleeve 
This is a great basic laptop sleeve that offers protection from things like scratches and dings when you're carrying your laptop. It's nice and compact so your laptop should still fit into any normal laptop slot while still being protective since its made out of neoprene.




2. Logitech Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo
There many times when it's easier to have a full keyboard and a wireless mouse. There are plenty of programs that are not compatible or have limited compatibility for trackpads and offer a big productivity boost when using a mouse. This option is inexpensive so its worth having even if you won't use it every day.



3. AmazonBasics HDMI Cable
Its nice to have an HDMI cable for presentions and possibly any other adapters you may need. AmazonBasics offers a lot of essential cables that work well but are at a fraction of the price of name brand cables. With HDMI cables there are only a few rare cases that it's actually worth spending more since you will see no difference in picture quality by spending more money.



4. Lexar JumpDrive
Even though I use these much less than I used to since I save most files in the cloud there are still many cases where it is much more convenient to save your files to a flash drive. Personally, I like the compact size and the cheap price of these Lexar ones, but there are many other options available that work just as well. Its worth even having one to back up your most important files and storing it our of your home in case of a fire.

5. Mixcder Bluetooth Headphones
I have written a review about these previously. You won't find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones at this price anywhere. They even have a ShareMe feature allowing you to connect a second pair. If you would like to read a full review check out this post.





These days you don't have to spend a fortune to get great everyday tech products. Many times you won't even be able to tell the difference if you spend 4 times as much. Its certainly worthwhile checking these out. If you would like to see what laptop I am using check out my previous post Review of Dell Inpsiron 13 7000 Series.

First, its compact and light. It allows me to carry my full laptop in lots of situations where I otherwise would have just brought my Ipad Mini. It is also a 2-in-1 which means the screen can rotate completely around a give some table functionality although I am not the biggest fan of using many windows apps with the touchscreen. The hinges do feel very strong and have a nice smooth but stiff feel. The tent mode is also nice for watching movies with it on a table, although not much better than just having it open.

The screen quality is great. It can get plenty bright and is quite high resolution. In fact I personally don't think it would be worth the higher battery drain of a 4K display. If you want to dock it to a larger high resolution display at home the 7th Gen Core i5 or i7 Processors works great for displaying 4K. I find I no lag or slow downs when I attach it to my 4K TV . If you would like to learn more about my TV set up check out this post.

Using the computer feels great. The touch-pad is fairly large and has a texture that allows for smooth movements without being too rough. The keyboard keys have a nice feel and have just the right amount of give. The back-light is also great since it allows you work in any lighting. I do still often need a mouse and keyboard especially when docked to a monitor or TV. For this I just use a cheap Logitech mouse and Keyboard. I also need it because most 13 inch laptops not have the numeric keyboard and  I often have to enter data quickly.

This is a great laptop certainly the best I have ever had. It has a wonderful premium look and the metal body makes it beautiful. It's perfect for travel and the daily commute yet powerful enough to use for everything most people do.

Tesla is about to release the Model 3








Tesla is planning to roll the first Model 3 off its production line this Friday. The Model 3 is an electric car with a 215-mile range and a price of $35,000. While this is two weeks earlier than initially planned, don't expect to be driving a Model 3 anytime soon. If you haven't pre-ordered a car yet, Tesla is estimating mid-2018 or later. My guess is much later since they are expecting to be making about 20,000 cars a month by December. Even if you have already put in an order for the car, they received 276,000 orders in the first two days after pre-orders opened last year.

So whats all the hype about this car?

Well, a huge factor is that it includes all the hardware for full self-driving capabilities, but who knows when they will finish the software for that. I think the biggest selling point is that they offer a lot of the features you expect from Tesla in their most affordable car yet. You get supercharging capabilities, lots of storage and a premium car feel. It will be interesting to see what the final specs of the car are upon release, but I have no doubt that they will give everything that people expect as usual.

Choosing a Home Security Camera





There are many of options these days when choosing home security cameras and many different reasons to have them. I recently needed to purchase a set to monitor my home while I am away and it also offers you the ability to spy on your pets. For me, there were a few necessary requirements. First, they need to be able to be viewed remotely. Second, they need to be able to record at least some footage in a way that's easy to review. Third I would prefer that multiple cameras can be synced together. Obviously, I am also concerned about price, video quality and whether they require an ongoing subscription. Here are some of the options I looked at and their key features.







The Nest Cam IQ Security Camera

The Good

Ability to view high-quality remote video
Three-hour snapshot history
Ability to detect unknown people and send alerts


The Bad


Requires a monthly subscription to record video history
 No mounting hardware included


This is a great camera. It's one of the best options available. This does come with some drawbacks particularly in requiring you to purchase a plan. 





The Netgear Arlo Pro

The Good


Wireless design, easy to install
Weatherproof
Includes cloud recording and live 


The Bad


Require 123 batteries and poor battery life
No audio
Unreliable


While this looked like the perfect solution to me. I could place them anywhere and easily monitor my home and pets. The problem is that it's not nearly reliable enough and the battery life is too poor. It's ideal for someone that doesn't need continuous footage.





Canary Home Security Device


The Good


Last 24 hour of video recordings included in free plan
Also, monitors air quality and temperature
High-quality night vision


The Bad


No two-way audio
No continuous recording
Glitchy app


While this camera seems to be the most glamorous of all, it still has a lot of issues. Once they work through some of the reliability issues and improve their app it could be great. It was one of my top choices, but it doesn't offer continuous recording or and its remote app is glitchy. 






Overall, it seems like the top pick is the Nest camera. While it has the least negatives it does require an expensive plan to unlock its full capabilities. It is the most reliable and offers the ability to continuously record if you purchase a plan. This is a great camera whether you want to watch your pets, your kids or keeps your home secure.

Beware of Technology Claiming to Save the Environment








These days we find technology in many aspects of our lives. They often make things cheaper and easier, but how are they affecting the environment. We have electric cars, solar panels and smart thermostats claiming to reduce our impact. Are we actually helping the environment or just letting us go on overconsuming with a clear conscience?

Let's start by looking at home heating. Putting in a smart thermostat may seem like an obvious choice.  Nest makes claims that it will save 10 to 12% off your heating consumption and 15% off your cooling use. This is far from insignificant, but there are lots of factors involved. First, if you don't keep your temperatures within an appropriate range, it may risk your pet's health or damage your home. In my case, if I let my home warm up too much during the summer and then cool it off too quickly I risk my air conditioning unit freezing up because I live in a very humid environment.  The other factor is whether people are around or not. If your home is occupied almost continuously like mine, you may not even see a difference at all. They do make options like the Eccobee that has sensors to detect whether a room is occupied and optimally control the temperatures for occupied spaces. While this would improve your home's temperature control, it may actually use more power to keep the more distant rooms comfortable.

Overall, smart thermostats are great at reducing power usage for the right people. They can even pay for themselves over a couple of years. They work best in an average home where everyone is gone for a reasonable amount of time during the day.

 Next, on my list would have to be solar panels. The pinnacle of green technology. The ability to produce solar panels with minimal environmental impact has increased about ten-fold over the years. Solar panels installed in around 1975 would have taken about 20 years to break even. Now according to The Economist, it's more in the range of 2-4 years depending on where the panels are produced, with European panels being produced more efficiently on average than those manufactured in China. While this is great its based mainly on carbon emissions. There is still a substantial potential to pollute the environment in other ways such as chemical leaks, and there is still virtually no recycling infrastructure for old panels yet.

Solar panels have come tremendously far. It will be especially interesting to see how efficiently made something like Tesla's roof tiles will be considering that they will literally be a roof tile and a solar panel. Either way from an environment standpoint, solar panels are more environmentally friendly than they ever have been.

Electric cars are even more challenging. They are quite efficient with models like the Chevy Bolt offering 119 MPGe which is great, but their environmental impact still depends greatly on how power is produced in your area. Compared to gasoline-powered cars they are tremendously more efficient, they also have the benefit of being more flexible because electricity can be produced from many sources. Cars, in general, are not the most efficient things. They require a lot of resources to make and the infrastructure to use them is tremendous. Things could be much more effective if we were to focus on mass transit, but this really isn't consumer friendly, since you are limited by schedules and routes.

Technology has made great strides in improving the quality of life while minimizing the impact on the environment. We still greatly depend on fossil fuels as a society, and I don't see that changing any time soon even with the ability to harvest energy from a number of renewable sources such as wind and solar.

Mobile Payments in 2017: Are we ready to leave our wallets home?







These days you can use your phone to pay in most places. When I go for fast food, I can use Apple Pay directly at McDonald's or Subway, but if I want to use it at my local Krispy Kreme, it becomes challenging. Things become even more complicated when purchasing items at retailers like Walmart or when I need to buy gas.

First on my list is Restaurants. You can use Apple Pay directly at many fast food places. For those you can't, you can easily use either their designated app or purchase a gift card and scan that from your device. Both options can offer a significant discount either from the store or by buying discount gift cards from places like Raise, which is also almost instant.

Sit down restaurants are still a big problem. Some chain restaurants have brought on table terminals, making mobile payments easy. Most places I go to still require the usual process of asking for a bill and either paying with cash or giving them your credit card. Not the most secure thing to do. I still have yet to find a good alternative for these situations, but am welcome to any suggestions.

On the topic of food. Things are much easier when it comes to groceries. In fact, all of the local grocery stores I shop at offer mobile payments including Giant and Weis. This makes things convenient, and I don't even have to pull out my wallet to pay.

Gas stations and other forms of transportation are troubling. This is tricky because it's so hit or miss. To keep all options available you still have to carry a traditional credit card and sometimes even cash.

ExxonMobil came up with a creative solution for pay at the pump. They offer an app that allows you to either scan or select a pump and pay with Apple Pay or a credit card loaded into the app. This is great because it also automatically links with your Plenti rewards card. At least in my area, no other gas stations have any pay at the pump solution for mobile devices. This is something that will hopefully change with time, but many gas stations still offer discounts for paying with cash.

Public transportation is even more challenging. Many buses in my area still require either a card, cash or a pass. Trains are a similar situation. They require you to either purchase tickets from a kiosk using a credit card or ordering the tickets in advance.

Department stores are the most difficult. Many have no solutions in place other than buying gift cards which you can scan on your device, which works with only mixed results. This also requires you to keep track of partial gift card values. Walmart does have plans to offer an app for mobile payments which is expected to be released soon. They do currently offer an app to scan items while you shop and skip the checkout if you're lucky enough to live near the four stores that accept it.

Overall mobile payments are accepted at many more locations than a year or two ago. We are still in no situation to leave are wallets behind, but we are getting close. Mobile payments are convenient in many cases since our phones are always close at hand and are frequently more secure. It's still somewhat redundant if you have to carry other forms of payment anyway.
