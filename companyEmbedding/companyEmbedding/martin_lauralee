Lauralee Martin
Irvine, Calif.—HCP, the largest healthcare REIT in the U.S., has announced that CEO Lauralee Martin, who assumed the role in 2013, has stepped down. Executive Chairman Michael McKee has assumed the additional role of interim president & CEO. The board will begin the process of appointing a permanent CEO, which is expected to take between three and six months.
“With the completion of our strategic portfolio review in May and the resulting spin-off transaction that is well underway, the board felt now is the appropriate time to advance the process of developing HCP’s next generation of leadership. We have made substantial progress towards rebuilding our executive team to align with our strategic vision for the future, and identifying our next CEO represents the cornerstone of that effort.” McKee said in prepared remarks.
McKee became HCP’s executive chairman in May 2016, and has served as independent chairman & lead director prior to that. He was CEO of Bentall Kennedy U.S. LP, one of the largest privately owned real estate investment advisory firms in North America, from 2010 to 2016. Prior to that, McKee was the CEO & vice chairman of The Irvine Co., a privately held real estate development and investment company, where he had been an executive officer since 1994. Prior to that, McKee was a partner with the law firm of Latham & Watkins LLP from 1986 to 1994.

“I remain confident and excited about our recent C-suite appointments and the broader management team,” McKee added. “Our portfolio performance and business outlook are consistent with our plan across all investment sectors, and the spin-off of our HCR ManorCare portfolio remains on track to be completed later this year.”
The company expects to record a severance charge of approximately $0.03 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2016 related to Martin’s departure.
Martin’s departure is another major leadership shakeup for the company, which earlier this year announced the departure of Timothy Schoen, the company’s former executive vice president & CFO, who became president of BioMed Realty.

Lauralee Martin


When Lauralee Martin was a college English major, she didn't dream of rising to the top of the real estate industry. But that's exactly what happened.
As chief financial and operating officer at Jones Lang LaSalle � one of the world's largest real estate services firms, with $2 billion in revenue � Ms. Martin has presided over five years of spectacular growth. The company's stock price soared from $20 a share in 2005 to around $120 last week.
Before joining Chicago-based Jones Lang in January 2002, she was CFO at Heller Financial Inc., where she was involved in the Chicago firm's 1998 IPO and its 2001 sale to General Electric Capital Corp. for $5.3 billion.
"It's no surprise that Lauralee has hit two home runs," says Richard Almeida, former CEO of Heller Financial. "She got high marks from investors for her candor and practical approach to discussing Heller's finances."
Ms. Martin, 56, got into real estate by accident. After getting her MBA from the University of Connecticut, she joined GE Capital as a financial analyst in its consumer products division, then was transferred to its real estate group.





Today, Ms. Martin's biggest challenge is dealing with what she calls the "cultural complexity" of globalization � a key to Jones Lang's growth strategy as it operates in more than 50 countries. Nearly 60% of the company's portfolio is overseas and, in the coming year, Jones Lang will expand its investments in China and India, where it already has a presence in major cities.
"It's important for us to be global because our clients are global, and we're matching their capabilities," Ms. Martin says.
In 2007, her priority will be overseeing the implementation of a $35-million technology system to better track projects as the company adds clients across the world.
The system will be free to Jones Lang clients, who can use its features to analyze real estate expenditures from rent and energy costs to the price of light bulbs.
WHY WE SHOULD WATCH HER: She's a driving force behind Jones Lang's global expansion, which the firm is using to sustain growth and insulate itself from a downturn in the U.S. commercial real estate market.CROSSROAD: In 1995, she was reluctant to become CFO at Heller Financial � she enjoyed her job running Heller's real estate business. But she accepted the promotion, which launched her career in another direction.

Jones Lang LaSalle names new CEO of the Americas



















 November 27, 2012 06:00PM












Lauralee Martin, Jones Lang LaSalle’s current chief operating and financial officer, has been named the commercial real estate brokerage’s chief executive officer of the Americas, CoStar Group reported.
Peter Roberts, the company’s current CEO for the past 10 years, will assume the role of chief strategy officer. Martin joined the firm in 2002 as CFO after working at Heller Financial and GE Capital.
“Lauralee’s combined experience, and her quick and decisive approach, make her uniquely qualified to lead the Americas into a period of further rapid revenue growth,” Colin Dyer, CEO of Jones Lang, said in a statement released by the firm. “At a time when our business is increasingly characterized by the need for clarity and speed, she will focus the Americas on driving client services, increasing productivity and investing in our people.”
During Roberts’ 10-year reign as CEO, annual revenues in the region grew six-fold through growth and mergers. Jones Lang’s Americas region includes 15,500 employees in 80 offices. [CoStar] — Hayley Kaplan

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
