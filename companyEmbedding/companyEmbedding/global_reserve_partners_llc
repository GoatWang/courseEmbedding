  Island One, Inc.Western Reserve acted as financial advisor to Island One, Inc. in its reorganization by Timeshare Acquisitions LLC.
Island One, based in Orlando, Florida, is one of the largest privately-held timeshare developers in the U.S.  At the time of the transaction, the company had grown from a single site to an organization that had acquired, developed and re-developed nine properties in Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Island One’s affiliate, Club Navigo, allowed customers to gain access to a larger network of 29 affiliate resorts.
Initially engaged in 2009, Western Reserve represented Island One in a pre-bankruptcy recapitalization process and eventually a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case.  During bankruptcy, Western Reserve executed both a bankruptcy recapitalization process and a fee for service sale process, producing the chosen reorganization partner, Timeshare Acquisitions LLC.  Timeshare Acquisitions LLC is a holding company owned and formed by a hedge fund to acquire the reorganized equity interest in Island One.  Western Reserve collaborated with the existing creditors and the reorganization partner to develop an innovative solution that was satisfactory to the bankruptcy court.  Island One retained operation of its eight resorts in Florida and divested of certain other inventory and assets, and the company’s executive team remained intact.
Deborah Linden, Board Co-Chair of Island One, said, “Western Reserve was instrumental in finding and maintaining the interest of a capital partner that understands the industry and can integrate and implement our growth strategy.  For the past 20 months, the team has provided great service and advice, helping our company to arrive at the best possible outcome for all vested parties.  We are now financially and structurally well-positioned to capitalize upon a very deliberate strategy for growth.”
