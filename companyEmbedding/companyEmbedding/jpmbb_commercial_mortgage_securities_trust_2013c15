Commercial Financing
If you have never had to deal with commercial real estate financing, you may find it intimidating. That is certainly the case for most first-time commercial borrowers. Commercial real estate mortgages are quite different from their residential cousins in terms of both complexity and cost. But getting the facts before you apply for a loan should eliminate any fears about this fantastic business financing technique.

The Basics of Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial real estate financing is very similar to residential mortgage lending in that real property is pledged as collateral against a loan to either buy or refinance the property. A business may also borrow against the equity in property it owns, which like its residential counterpart can take the form of a business line of credit or a lump sum payment for any business purpose. Commercial real estate mortgages generally require regular payments of principal and interest -- commercial mortgage rates can be either fixed or variable -- until the loan is paid in full. Moreover, a commercial lender retains a security interest in the property throughout the loan term, with the same right to foreclose if the borrower defaults as a residential lender. 

What distinguishes commercial mortgage lending from residential lending are the characteristics of the property and the borrower. Unlike residential mortgages, which are geared toward the individual and 1-4 unit residential dwellings, commercial property financing is designed for business entities -- both for profit and not-for-profit -- to mortgage nearly any type of retail, office, industrial, multi-unit (5+) unit residential, or just about any other commercially zoned real property.

Because of these property and borrower characteristics, commercial real estate mortgages are viewed as higher risk transactions by the lending industry. The limited marketability of commercial property and higher risk of borrower default translates to less generous terms and more conservative underwriting by commercial mortgage lenders than those found in the residential arena. If a lender has to take possession of a commercial property through foreclosure, it will generally have much more difficulty selling it to recoup its money than it would a house. To compensate for the greater risk, commercial mortgage rates are substantially higher as are down payment requirements, and loan terms are shorter (typically a maximum of 25/30 years). 

Commercial mortgage lenders prefer a solid business borrower, but for newer businesses or companies that cannot meet the required financial performance standards, a personal guarantee of repayment from one or more of the firm's principals may be used to compensate. 

A final important difference between commercial real estate financing and the residential variety is that commercial real estate mortgages are more expensive to process and close. Not only are they much larger loans on average than residential mortgages, but nearly every aspect of the "due diligence" phase -- from valuation, to title, to underwriting -- is more complicated and, therefore, more costly. 

An Illustration: The "Vanilla" Commercial Mortgage Loan

To help you understand how commercial mortgage lending works in practice, here are the major characteristics of a standard "vanilla" commercial mortgage loan.

Debt Coverage Ratio

Commercial real estate financing is based primarily on the income of the property rather than the borrower. The lender will want evidence that the property will produce more than enough income to cover the mortgage payments. Generally, commercial mortgage lenders require the property to produce from 1.1 to 1.25 times the monthly mortgage payment in net rental income. For example, if the monthly mortgage payment is $2,000, the property should be producing $2,200 to $2,500 after all expenses are paid. 

Down Payment

Commercial mortgage loans typically require a borrower to put a minimum of 25% down. A higher down payment may be required for certain properties that carry greater risk, newer companies or those without a solid track record of consistent profitability.

Prepayment Penalties

Commercial real estate mortgages normally carry deescalating prepayment penalties, that is, a fee due to the lender if the loan is paid off within a certain period of time after it is made. For example, the fee might be 5% of the outstanding balance during the first year, 4% the second year, and so on, with no penalty after the fifth year. For obvious reasons, prepayment penalties are a particularly important consideration for a business that may not wish to -- or be able to -- own the property long enough to avoid them.

Although these characteristics illustrate a “standard” in commercial real estate mortgages, you can find many lenders with flexibility in any of them. Generally, deviating from a standard will entail an offsetting adjustment in others to compensate for the increased risk. For example, an up-front fee or higher interest rate might reduce or entirely eliminate a prepayment penalty, while a personal guarantee from one or more company owners might reduce the required down payment.
Where to Go For Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial mortgage lending is widely available throughout the U.S. The three most common sources of commercial real estate mortgages are:
1. Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities2. Regional Banks3. Private Equity Companies - i.e. Life Insurance Companies / Pension Manager / Hedge Funds4. Specialty Finance Companies - i.e. Third-Party ("Conduit") and Hard Money Lenders
Commercial Mortgage Brokers
Naturally, most business owners turn to banks -- particularly ones with whom they have established relationships -- for their commercial real estate financing. On the one hand, banks tend to offer the lowest commercial mortgage rates; on the other, they are the most rigid in their lending. Many banks will refuse loans on certain classes of property or exclude companies from specific industries. They also require more documentation and may charge higher fees than other commercial mortgage lending sources.

Conduit and hard money lenders can fund commercial mortgage loans with less documentation and more quickly than banks. Because their money comes from private sources, insurance companies, and commercial lines of credit, they can be much more flexible in their lending. You will find that hard money lenders, in particular, will loan money at lightning speed on virtually any type of property with much less stringent criteria for their borrowers -- all at a cost: Hard Money Lenders charge significantly higher mortgage rates than banks.

For larger capital needs, companies often turn to private equity companies. Private equity companies can provide critical commercial real estate financing on the total cost of a project. The equity range is the difference between the total cost of the real estate and the amount the senior lender is willing to provide -- normally no more than 75 percent of costs. So, for a $5 million project, commercial mortgage lenders would typically loan no more than $3.8 million, leaving $1.2 million in the equity range for the borrower to fund. If the borrowing entity has $200,000 in cash to put into the project, it could consider a mezzanine loan or an equity capital investment to come up with the remaining $1 million. Private Equity Companies are quite versatile and they can provide creative, flexible financing solutions, but they expect a good return on investment, so their interest rates are considerably higher than those charged by commercial lenders. Commercial mortgage brokers don't fund loans directly. Instead, a good broker will conduct a thorough assessment of your needs and research the programs offered by other commercial mortgage lending sources to find you the right mortgage solution with the most competitive rates and fees. A good commercial mortgage broker will have established relationships with many different lenders offering a wide variety of lending programs, giving you access to financing you might not be able to find on your own. As an added benefit, commercial mortgage brokers handle the tedious details of loan processing and packaging, making an otherwise complex transaction less stressful and saving you much time and energy. Using just any commercial mortgage broker could cost you either in up-front fees, a higher than market interest rate, or both. A good one, though, will orchestrate a smooth transaction with an optimal loan suited to your company's specific needs at a competitive rate.

With so many choices, it is important that you shop around, but the goal of your shopping should not be just to get the best rate. As is the case in residential mortgages, commercial mortgage rates and terms will vary from one lending source to the next. But with such a big financial commitment at stake, unless you have expertise in commercial real estate financing, you need a trusted advisor to both help you understand and to guide you through the complex process that defines a commercial mortgage loan. 

Regardless of the source you ultimately use, a little preparation before you begin your search for commercial real estate financing will go a long way towards reducing stress and assuring a good outcome.

Preparation: The Key to a Smooth Commercial Mortgage Lending Process

When you are ready to begin your search for a commercial mortgage lender, some advance preparation will serve you well. The complex nature of commercial real estate financing means you cannot expect to "rate shop" multiple lenders with a few minutes on the telephone -- at least, not with any reliability. 
Any prospective lender you contact should ask you for the following information, which is needed to give you an informed, accurate decision about your company's ability to borrow and the approximate rates and terms you can expect: 1. Year-to-date profit & loss statement and balance sheet 2. Three years business income tax returns 3. Projected cash flow for the next 36 months
4. Personal Financial Statement and Resume for the Principal5. Property information
6. Written business plan
Having these items available will not only make your task easier, it will make it more likely you receive both an accurate quote and solid feedback on your loan request. Be wary of any prospective lender who will quote rates and terms without the required information. You could be in for nasty surprises later!

Commercial real estate financing is another of the business financing power tools available to your company. Unlike other types of credit for business, which typically have less attractive terms and a relatively short repayment period, commercial mortgage loans offer an excellent means to acquire property and manage risk with long-term, asset based financing, at attractive interest rates and with favorable tax treatment.

Fitch Affirms JPMBB 2013-C15 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms JPMBB 2013-C15
    





September 17, 2015 05:19 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 16 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Trust (JPMBB) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates series 2013-C15. A detailed list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations reflect the overall stable performance of the 
      underlying collateral. As of the August 2015 distribution date, the 
      pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 1.6% to $1.17 
      billion from $1.19 billion at issuance. Approximately 51% of the pool is 
      either partial-term or full-term interest only. Four loans (2.8%) were 
      designated as Fitch Loans of Concern and no loans have been in special 
      servicing since issuance.
    

      The largest loan (10.1% of the pool) is secured by the Veritas 
      Multifamily Portfolio, a 45-property portfolio of multifamily properties 
      in San Francisco, CA. The portfolio contains 1,230 residential 
      apartments and 22 commercial units across eight San Francisco 
      neighborhoods. The loan has a pari passu A-note for total debt 
      outstanding on the portfolio of $211.5 million. The collateral is 
      performing in line with underwritten expectations with occupancy of 
      89.3% (as of March 2015) and a 1.50x net operating income (NOI) debt 
      service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.50x as of year-end 2014.
    

      The next largest loan (9.4% of the pool) is secured by the Miracle Mile 
      Shops, a 448,835 square foot (sf) retail mall located along Las Vegas 
      Boulevard, at the base of the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, in Las 
      Vegas, NV. The location is a high foot traffic area along the Las Vegas 
      Strip and includes tenants such as V Theatre, Planet Hollywood and H&M. 
      The loan has an additional five pari passu notes for total debt 
      outstanding on the Miracle Mile Shops of $580 million. The collateral is 
      performing in line with underwritten expectations with occupancy of 96% 
      (as of March 2015) and a year-end (YE) 2014 NOI DSCR of 1.42x. The 
      rolling 12 month in-line sales as of February 2015 are $773 per square 
      foot (psf) compared to $868 psf in June 2013.
    

      The third largest loan (8.5% of the pool) is secured by 1615 L Street, a 
      417,383-sf office building located in downtown Washington, D.C., four 
      blocks from the White House. The property is 13 stories, was built in 
      1984 and extensively renovated in 2009. The property features a 
      renovated six-story marble lobby, full-service fitness center, common 
      area event space, roof-top patio and dining area, 24-hour security, a 
      restaurant, and a 287-space below-grade parking garage. In early 2014, 
      the largest tenant, Pew Research renewed their lease for 73,960 sf 
      through 2029, with scheduled rent abatements through January 2015. 
      Occupancy as of March 31, 2015 was 95.4%. The servicer reported NOI DSCR 
      as of YE 2014 was 1.24x but increased to 1.63x as of first quarter 2015 
      due to the rent concessions burning off. The loan remains on the 
      servicer watchlist due to the low DSCR as a result of the abatements, 
      and will remain until the DSCR stabilizes at the first quarter 2015 
      level or better. The full term interest-only loan has an additional 
      $34.25 million in pari passu debt for total debt outstanding on the 
      property of $134.25 million.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable. Due to the recent 
      issuance of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not 
      foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic 
      or asset-level event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics. 
      Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in the report 
      'J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2013-C15' (Oct. 
      9, 2013), available at www.fitchratings.com.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:

      --$285.3 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$76 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$44.7 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$59.6 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$23.9 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$11.9 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$909.5 million class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$76.0 million class X-B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable.

Document Custody

Important Updates
November 9, 2016 – Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide (Guide) Bulletin 2016-12 announced revised Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae ARM Notes and Riders and Freddie Mac ARM Notes and Riders that impose a Lifetime Floor equal to the ARM's Margin effective for ARMs with a Note Date on or after October 1, 2016.
As stated in Guide Bulletin 2016-12, there are no new verification elements for Document Custodians to certify ARMs with Lifetime Floors except regarding ARMs originated using Fannie Mae ARM Notes and ARM Riders amended to add a Lifetime Floor.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust (JPMBB) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2013-C15. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations reflect the overall stable performance of the underlying collateral. As of the August 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 12.7% to $1.04 billion from $1.19 billion at issuance. Approximately 46% of the pool is either partial-term or full-term interest only. Two loans (2%) were designated as Fitch Loans of Concern and no loans have been in special servicing since issuance. There is notable retail and office exposure within the transaction; 32% of the pool is secured by retail properties and 31.6% is secured by office properties. Since Fitch's last rating action the largest loan in the pool, Veritas Multifamily Portfolio, paid off with yield maintenance.The largest loan (10.6% of the pool) is secured by the Miracle Mile Shops, a 448,835 square foot (sf) retail mall located along Las Vegas Boulevard, at the base of the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, in Las Vegas, NV. The location is a high foot traffic area along the Las Vegas Strip and includes tenants such as V Theatre, Planet Hollywood and H&M. The loan has an additional five pari passu notes for total debt outstanding on the Miracle Mile Shops of $580 million. The collateral is performing in line with underwritten expectations with occupancy of 98% (as of March 2016) and a year-end (YE) 2015 NOI DSCR of 1.45x. The trailing 12 month in-line sales as of February 2016 are $842 per square foot (psf) compared to $868 psf in June 2013.The second largest loan (9.6% of the pool) is secured by 1615 L Street, a 417,383-sf office building located in downtown Washington, D.C., four blocks from the White House. The property is 13 stories, was built in 1984 and extensively renovated in 2009. The property features a renovated six-story marble lobby, full-service fitness center, common area event space, roof-top patio and dining area, 24-hour security, a restaurant, and a 287-space below-grade parking garage. Occupancy as of March 31, 2016 was 96%. The servicer-reported NOI DSCR as of YE 2015 was 1.53x compared to 1.24x as of YE 2014. The loan was previously on the servicer watchlist and has been removed as the DSCR stabilized due to rent concessions burning off. The full term interest-only loan has an additional $34.25 million in pari passu debt for total debt outstanding on the property of $134.25 million.The Marriott Spring Hill Suites Vernal (0.91% of the pool) is a Fitch Loan of Concern. The loan is secured by a 97 room, limited service hotel located in Vernal, UT that was built in 2009. The property is located in the Uintah Basin which is a source of oil and gas production. Due to the price of crude oil declining significantly since 2014 the area is experiencing a reduction in the number of active drilling rigs. The hotel has suffered a large drop in occupancy due to a loss in the corporate segment, which declined over 40% in 2015. The servicer-reported NOI DSCR as of YE 2015 dropped to 0.81x compared to 1.67x as of YE 2014. As of the March 2016 STAR Report the trailing 12 month occupancy, ADR, RevPAR declined by 25.3%, 12.6%, and 34.7% respectively.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable. Due to the recent issuance of the transaction and its stable performance, Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:--$216.3 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$21.4 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$110 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$206.9 million class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$67.7 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$60.7 million class A-2FL at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$ class A-2FX at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;Read More--$93.9 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$76 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$44.7 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$59.6 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$23.9 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$11.9 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable;--$777 million class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$76 million class X-B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable.The class A-1 certificates have paid in full.

Why do we ask for your Social Security Number

Freddie Mac takes protecting your privacy seriously. We ask for your Social Security Number (SSN) to help us confirm that the requested information is being given to the mortgage holder or to someone authorized by the mortgage holder to receive the information.
We ask for your SSN because it allows us to quickly and accurately determine if your mortgage is held by Freddie Mac and to deliver an answer to you immediately. Providing a SSN increases the speed and accuracy of the look-up response.
We take measures to protect the SSN that you deliver to us (see below).

How do we handle your SSN after you enter it?

The SSN you enter within this form is only used to answer your specific look-up request. We do not save the number you enter or distribute it to a third party for any other purpose.
All information you enter in this form is transmitted from your web browser to our site via an encrypted communication channel. Please review our privacy policy for more details.

Do you have to provide your SSN number?

No. If you wish, you may submit an email request that does not require your SSN. Our customer service representatives will respond as quickly as they can, but given current demand it may take several days. Please be patient.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
