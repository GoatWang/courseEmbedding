  Michael Kors (NYSE:KORS), a global luxury lifestyle brand, is pleased to announce that effective October 1, Krista McDonough will be promoted to the position of Senior Vice President, General Counsel, reporting to John Idol, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer.  Krista McDonough joined Michael Kors in 2011, and has been Deputy General Counsel since June 2015. Previously she was at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP. She has a law degree from New York Law School.  "Since joining Michael Kors, Krista has been an integral part of the Legal Department. She brings many strengths to this position," says Mr. Idol, "including valuable experience in corporate governance, securities law, employment matters and intellectual property enforcement."  Ms. McDonough succeeds Lee Sporn who, after 13 years as Michael Kors' General Counsel, is retiring to become a full-time law professor. "I am very grateful for Lee's many contributions to Michael Kors," says Mr. Idol. "He has been a strong and important partner to me and to the leadership team."   About Michael Kors   Michael Kors is a world-renowned, award-winning designer of luxury accessories and ready-to-wear. His namesake company, established in 1981, currently produces a range of products under Michael Kors Collection, MICHAEL Michael Kors and Michael Kors Mens, including accessories, footwear, watches, jewelry, ready-to-wear and a full line of fragrance products.

Forward-Looking Statements   This press release contains forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on such statements because they are subject to numerous uncertainties and factors relating to the Company's operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company's control. Forward-looking statements include information concerning the Company's possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of its business strategy. These statements often include words such as "may," "will," "should," "believe," "expect," "seek," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "estimate" or similar expressions. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that the Company has made in light of management's experience in the industry as well as its perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. You should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Although the Company believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect its actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. These factors are more fully discussed in the "Risk Factors" section and elsewhere in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2016 (File No. 001-35368), filed on June 1, 2016 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Krista McDonough Promoted to General Counsel for Michael Kors
























LONDON, Sep 30, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Michael Kors                 

/quotes/zigman/7705184/composite KORS
+2.12%


, a global luxury lifestyle brand, is pleased to 
      announce that effective October 1, Krista McDonough will be promoted to 
      the position of Senior Vice President, General Counsel, reporting to 
      John Idol, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer.


                                        








Krista McDonough joined Michael Kors in 2011, and has been Deputy 
      General Counsel since June 2015. Previously she was at Paul, Weiss, 
      Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP. She has a law degree from New York Law 
      School.


                                        








“Since joining Michael Kors, Krista has been an integral part of the 
      Legal Department. She brings many strengths to this position,” says Mr. 
      Idol, “including valuable experience in corporate governance, securities 
      law, employment matters and intellectual property enforcement.”


                                        








Ms. McDonough succeeds Lee Sporn who, after 13 years as Michael Kors’ 
      General Counsel, is retiring to become a full-time law professor. “I am 
      very grateful for Lee’s many contributions to Michael Kors,” says Mr. 
      Idol. “He has been a strong and important partner to me and to the 
      leadership team.”


                                        








About Michael Kors

Forward-Looking Statements

                                        








This press release contains forward-looking statements. You should not 
      place undue reliance on such statements because they are subject to 
      numerous uncertainties and factors relating to the Company’s operations 
      and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many 
      of which are beyond the Company’s control. Forward-looking statements 
      include information concerning the Company’s possible or assumed future 
      results of operations, including descriptions of its business strategy. 
      These statements often include words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” 
      “believe,” “expect,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate” 
      or similar expressions. The forward-looking statements contained in this 
      press release are based on assumptions that the Company has made in 
      light of management’s experience in the industry as well as its 
      perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future 
      developments and other factors that it believes are appropriate under 
      the circumstances. You should understand that these statements are not 
      guarantees of performance or results. They involve known and unknown 
      risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Although the Company believes that 
      these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, 
      you should be aware that many factors could affect its actual financial 
      results or results of operations and could cause actual results to 
      differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements. These 
      factors are more fully discussed in the “Risk Factors” section and 
      elsewhere in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal 
      year ended April 2, 2016 (File No. 001-35368), filed on June 1, 2016 
      with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
