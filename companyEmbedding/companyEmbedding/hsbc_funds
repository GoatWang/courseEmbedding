1 Foreign securities can be subject to greater risks than U.S. investments, including currency fluctuations, less liquid trading markets, greater price volatility, political and economic instability, less publicly available information, and changes in tax or currency laws or monetary policy.  These risks are likely to be greater for emerging markets than in developed markets.  Prices of securities in emerging markets can fluctuate more significantly than the prices of companies in more developed countries.  Securities of emerging market issuers generally have more risk than securities issued by issuers in more developed markets.  The less developed the country, the greater affect the risks  may have in an investment, and as a result, an investment may exhibit a higher degree of volatility than either the general domestic securities market or the securities markets of developed foreign countries.

Investing in Mutual funds







What are mutual funds?

Mutual funds are a type of pooled investment  vehicle.  Shareholders of a mutual fund  invest their money by purchasing shares of the fund.  The money that they pay for the shares is  pooled together and invested in a portfolio of securities, such as stocks,  bonds, or money market instruments. Mutual funds are professionally managed and operated by money managers, who maintain the portfolio in accordance with the fund's investments objectives as stated in the prospectus. 
Mutual funds, money market funds, and Exchange Traded Funds are sold by prospectus. Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus, which contains this and other information, can be obtained by calling your HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Financial Professional or call 866.586.4722. Read it carefully before you invest.
An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. Although a money market fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund.
Popular investment disciplines which can involve mutual funds include:

Asset allocation1: a disciplined approach to long-term investing, designed to seek consistent exposure to markets. This  approach does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss. It also cannot  eliminate the risk of fluctuating prices and uncertain returns. However, it may  be used in an effort to manage risk and enhance returns.
Dollar cost averaging2: a strategy  in which securities, typically mutual funds, are purchased in fixed dollar amounts at regular intervals, regardless of what direction the market is moving. While this method doesn't guarantee against losses, over time, this can help to reduce the average cost of acquired shares.  
Target date ("life cycle") investing3: investors choose a fund with a specified target date near a personal need or goal (such as retirement) for which they will need to access their invested funds. Though target date investing does not protect against loss of principal, the fund's risk exposure is gradually reduced as a target date draws nearer to prepare for the approaching liquidity needs. 

HSBC Global Asset Management fund options
Our World Selection Funds4offer asset allocation solutions–designed to help reduce the roller-coaster ride that volatile market conditions can generate. The five different fund strategies are aligned to the full spectrum of risk profiles:

Income Strategy Fund, 

Conservative Strategy Fund,

Moderate Strategy Fund,

Balanced Strategy Fund and 
 
Aggressive Strategy Fund. 


Explore our other exclusive asset allocation solutions.



In addition, the suite of HSBC Funds5 includes domestic money market funds and domestic and international equity and debt funds6. The 

HSBC Emerging Markets Debt Fund, 
HSBC Emerging Markets Local Debt Fund, HSBC Frontier Markets Fund and the HSBC Total Return Fund
 all provide access to some of the world's fastest growing markets through the lens of HSBC's deep global knowledge and experience. 

Additional funds from leading managers
A financial professional7 from HSBC Securities can also help you choose from a broad selection of third-party mutual funds. Each of these funds is thoroughly screened and regularly reviewed by the HSBC Global Funds Approvals & Research team8 - a global team of research analysts dedicated to helping enhance our clients' portfolios by identifying third party money managers that show sustainable competitive advantages within their asset class.
Take advantage of our mutual fund experience
Mutual funds offer a convenient avenue for entering financial markets and can also become integral parts of a broader investment strategy. To fully understand your personal investment objectives and help determine which funds may be suited for your needs, an HSBC Securities financial professional8 will take the time to conduct a thorough financial review. To schedule your review, or to receive information on funds offered through HSBC Securities, please call 866.586.4722 or schedule a consultation online.

1 Asset allocation is a method of diversification that positions assets among major investment categories. This tool may be used in an effort to manage risk and enhance returns. However, it does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss. It also cannot eliminate the risk of fluctuating prices and uncertain returns.
2 Dollar Cost Averaging is a plan of investing which allows you to take advantage of market fluctuations, but it does not assure a profit or protect against a loss in declining markets.
3 Target date funds invest in other funds, so performance can vary significantly based on the investment restrictions of the target date fund. A target date fund may have losses and does not guarantee that sufficient assets will be available for retirement or any specific return.
4 HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. is the investment adviser for the HSBC World Selection Funds. Foreside Distribution Services, L.P., a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"), serves as the distributor of the Funds' shares.
5 HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. serves as the investment adviser to the HSBC Funds. Foreside Distribution Services, L.P., member FINRA, is the distributor of the HSBC Funds and is not affiliated with the Advisor. HSBC Global Asset Management (UK) Limited serves as investment subadviser to the HSBC Frontier Markets Fund. HSBC Global Asset Management (Hong Kong) Limited serves as subadviser to the HSBC RMB Fixed Income Fund.  HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., member NYSE, FINRA, SIPC is a sub-distributor of the HSBC Funds. Affiliates of HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. receive fees for providing various services to the funds.
6 International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility that is heightened when investing in emerging or frontier markets. Foreign securities can be subject to greater risks than U.S. investments, including currency fluctuations, less liquid trading markets, greater price volatility, political and economic instability, less publicly available information, and changes in tax or currency laws or monetary policy. The risks of investing in emerging-market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Frontier market countries generally have smaller economies and even less developed capital markets or legal and political systems than traditional emerging market countries. As a result, the risks of investing in emerging market countries are magnified in frontier market countries. Fixed income investments are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall.
7 Financial professional refers to Premier Wealth Advisors (PWA), Premier Relationship Advisors (PRA) and Financial Advisors (FA).  PWA/PRAs primarily focus on a full suite of Premier products and services while FAs primarily focus on a full suite of Advance products and services.  Both offer bank products through HSBC Bank (USA) N.A., investments and certain insurance products, including annuities, through HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and traditional insurance products through HSBC Insurance Agency (USA) Inc.
8 HSBC Global Funds Approvals & Research  team is a research and asset management capability utilized by certain HSBC companies in various regions around the world. In the U.S. the company offering these capabilities is HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc.
United States persons (including U.S. citizens and residents) are subject to U.S. taxation on their worldwide income and may be subject to tax and other filing obligations with respect to their U.S. and non–U.S. accounts – including, for example, Form TD F 90–22.1 (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts ("FBAR")). U.S. persons should consult a tax adviser for more information.

Funds with a wide range of asset classes, investment styles and geographical regions
HSBC Global Investment Funds cover a wide range of asset classes, investment styles and geographical regions. The funds are suited to
		investors who like to make their own investment decisions, or want to invest in a particular market. And can be approached in three distinct ways.




By asset classYou can invest through equity and bond funds as well as other types of funds that invest in freely
				traded securities, money market instruments and other liquid assets.
By investment objectives or themeThe specialist and thematic mandates let you invest in markets that may be of
				particular interest to you, like climate change or regional and single country funds.
Emerging marketsHSBC's comprehensive global emerging markets offering is backed by our emerging markets and Asian
				equity research teams; and is managed by lead managers with local knowledge and regular access to the companies they invest in.



Full details



Please remember that the value of investments, and any income received from them can fall as well as rise, is not guaranteed and you may not get back the amount you invested. 

This could also happen as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, particularly where overseas securities are held or where investments are converted from one currency to another. We always recommend that any Investments held should be viewed as a medium to long-term investment, at least five years.



Economies in emerging markets generally are heavily dependent upon international trade and, accordingly, have been and may continue to be
				affected adversely by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed
				or negotiated by the countries with which they trade.

Ready to start building the future you want?We can offer you quality advice on a range of HSBC and non-HSBC products and help you build a bespoke financial plan.


Eligibility criteria £50,000

Key features

We have chosen to offer restricted advice. This means we don't recommend products from the whole of the market, but rather a limited range of products from a limited number of carefully selected companies, including HSBC.
We charge for our service - our fees vary depending on your individual needs. Our expert advisers will clearly explain our fees upfront and the type of advice we offer. That way, you know exactly how much you will pay and what you’re paying for.
We'll explore your current financial goals and personal circumstances at length before creating a bespoke financial plan. 
We use sophisticated risk profiling software and modelling techniques to help you identify the level of investment risk you're comfortable with.
Our advisers are supported by a worldwide team of analysts who use powerful local knowledge to hand select products from a wide range of investments.

The value of investments, and any income from them, can fall as well as rise and you may not get back what you invested. For some investments this can happen as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, as shares and funds may have an exposure to overseas markets.
Investments in emerging markets are by their nature higher risk and potentially more volatile than those inherent in established markets.
We recommend that you should regard stock market investments as medium to long term commitments (by which we mean that you should be prepared to hold them for a period of not less than 5 years).


Eligibility requirements
HSBC Premier Financial Advice Service is only available to UK residents who have £50,000 or more in savings and investments and who are at least 18 years old.

        You'll also need an HSBC or First Direct current account or savings account* for us to be able to deduct your fee.
        * Excluding HSBC Online Bonus Saver, HSBC Online Saver, any HSBC or First Direct Cash ISA, First Direct E- Savings or First Direct Everyday Saver.
    

        If you don't qualify for HSBC Premier Financial Advice Service, or if you'd prefer not to pay for advice, see other ways we can help.
        If you are not a UK resident, see our HSBC Expat service.

If you prefer to take no investment risk you may wish to consider the range of HSBC Savings Accounts which includes the Loyalty Cash ISA.


Existing Selected Investment Funds customers
If you hold an existing Selected Investment Funds ISA or Investment Plan you can top up into your existing fund or any alternative fund - view more information.










Time commitment
Most investments should be considered as a medium to long-term commitment, 
                                                meaning you should be prepared to hold them for at least five years.


Investment risk
All investments carry some risk. The value of investments (and any income received from them) can fall as well as rise and you may not get back what you invested. For some investments this can also happen as a result of exchange rate fluctuations as shares and funds may have an exposure to overseas markets.


Tax benefits
The value of any tax benefits this product can offer will depend 
                                                on your individual circumstances – tax rules may change in future.















Our top 5 FAQs

What is the difference between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA?


What is the difference between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA?
With a cash ISA, you make cash deposits similar to any other savings account, except that all interest earned is received tax free.
With a stocks and shares ISAs, you invest your money into either a collective investment scheme (eg, 'investment funds' which invest in a range of different assets such as shares, government bonds, gilts and even other investment funds), or directly into individual stocks and shares (eg, equities or bonds). 
stocks and shares ISAs are not investments in their own right, they are tax wrappers that surround an investment to provide the tax efficient returns. The value of your stocks and shares ISA will depend on how well the underlying investments (ie, investment funds or individual stocks and shares) perform, and whether you choose to have any income re-invested or paid out at regular intervals.
All UK residents are able to save in cash ISAs from the age of 16 years. From the age of 18, you can start investing in stocks and shares ISAs, although do bear in mind that your investment can go down as well as up. This means that you could get back less than the amount you originally invested.



Where can I get advice on my investments?


Where can I get advice on my investments?
If you have at least £50,000 in savings and investments, we can offer advice on a range of HSBC and non-HSBC products and will build a bespoke financial plan, tailored to your individual needs.
If you do not meet the qualifying criteria, we can offer advice on our savings, mortgage and protection products but we can no longer provide you with advice on investments, pensions, protection and estate planning via one of our Premier Client Managers.

Do I need to have an account with HSBC to be able to invest?


Do I need to have an account with HSBC to be able to invest?
Yes, you will need an HSBC current account or savings account for us to be able to deduct your fee, should you decide to proceed with advice. We can also accept payment from First Direct current and savings accounts. We charge for our advice service - our fees vary to reflect your individual needs. All our fees will be made clear up front. That way you know what to expect from the outset.

You can do this online via Personal Internet Banking.
To do this, sign into Personal Internet Banking and from the 'My accounts' screen select the Pension section to 'expand' it. This will show all your HSBC pensions and their value at the date specified.



What are the ISA subscription limits?


What are the ISA subscription limits?
The overall ISA subscription limit is £20,000 for the 2017/18 tax year. You can subscribe to any combination of permitted ISAs in the same tax year, subject to the subscription limits and eligibility requirements for each type of ISA, but you cannot exceed the overall maximum ISA allowance of £20,000 for the 2017/18 tax year.
The value of the tax benefits described depends on individual circumstances. The tax treatment of ISAs could change in the future.

Key features

We have chosen to offer restricted advice. This means we don't recommend products from the whole of the market, but rather a limited range of products from a limited number of carefully selected companies, including HSBC.
We charge for our service - our fees vary depending on your individual needs. Our expert advisers will clearly explain our fees upfront and the type of advice we offer. That way, you know exactly how much you will pay and what you’re paying for.
We'll explore your current financial goals and personal circumstances at length before creating a bespoke financial plan. 
We use sophisticated risk profiling software and modelling techniques to help you identify the level of investment risk you're comfortable with.
Our advisers are supported by a worldwide team of analysts who use powerful local knowledge to hand select products from a wide range of investments.

The value of investments, and any income from them, can fall as well as rise and you may not get back what you invested. For some investments this can happen as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, as shares and funds may have an exposure to overseas markets.
Investments in emerging markets are by their nature higher risk and potentially more volatile than those inherent in established markets.
We recommend that you should regard stock market investments as medium to long term commitments (by which we mean that you should be prepared to hold them for a period of not less than 5 years).


Eligibility requirements
HSBC Premier Financial Advice Service is only available to UK residents who have £50,000 or more in savings and investments and who are at least 18 years old.

        You'll also need an HSBC or First Direct current account or savings account* for us to be able to deduct your fee.
        * Excluding HSBC Online Bonus Saver, HSBC Online Saver, any HSBC or First Direct Cash ISA, First Direct E- Savings or First Direct Everyday Saver.
    

        If you don't qualify for HSBC Premier Financial Advice Service, or if you'd prefer not to pay for advice, see other ways we can help.
        If you are not a UK resident, see our HSBC Expat service.

Existing Selected Investment Funds customers
If you hold an existing Selected Investment Funds ISA or Investment Plan you can top up into your existing fund or any alternative fund - view more information.










Time commitment
Most investments should be considered as a medium to long-term commitment, 
                                                meaning you should be prepared to hold them for at least five years.


Investment risk
All investments carry some risk. The value of investments (and any income received from them) can fall as well as rise and you may not get back what you invested. For some investments this can also happen as a result of exchange rate fluctuations as shares and funds may have an exposure to overseas markets.


Tax benefits
The value of any tax benefits this product can offer will depend 
                                                on your individual circumstances – tax rules may change in future.















Our top 5 FAQs

What is the difference between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA?


What is the difference between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA?
With a cash ISA, you make cash deposits similar to any other savings account, except that all interest earned is received tax free.
With a stocks and shares ISAs, you invest your money into either a collective investment scheme (eg, 'investment funds' which invest in a range of different assets such as shares, government bonds, gilts and even other investment funds), or directly into individual stocks and shares (eg, equities or bonds). 
stocks and shares ISAs are not investments in their own right, they are tax wrappers that surround an investment to provide the tax efficient returns. The value of your stocks and shares ISA will depend on how well the underlying investments (ie, investment funds or individual stocks and shares) perform, and whether you choose to have any income re-invested or paid out at regular intervals.
All UK residents are able to save in cash ISAs from the age of 16 years. From the age of 18, you can start investing in stocks and shares ISAs, although do bear in mind that your investment can go down as well as up. This means that you could get back less than the amount you originally invested.

What are the ISA subscription limits?


What are the ISA subscription limits?

You can subscribe to any combination of permitted ISAs in the same tax year, subject to the subscription limits and eligibility requirements for each type of ISA, but you cannot exceed the overall maximum ISA allowance of £20,000 for the 2017/18 tax year.
The value of the tax benefits described depends on individual circumstances. The tax treatment of ISAs could change in the future.

HSBC Global Asset Management is the marketing name for the asset management businesses of HSBC Holdings Plc. HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. serves as the investment adviser to the HSBC Funds. Foreside Distribution Services, L.P., member FINRA, is the distributor of the HSBC Funds and is not affiliated with the adviser. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., member NYSE, FINRA and SIPC, is a sub-distributor of the HSBC Funds. Affiliates of HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. may receive fees for providing various services to the funds.

Risk Considerations: 
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective or will work under all market conditions. The value of investments may go down as well as up and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Portfolios may be subject to certain additional risks, which should be considered carefully along with their investment objectives and fees. Equity investments fluctuate in value based on changes to an individual company’s financial condition and overall market conditions. Investments in foreign markets involve risks such as currency rate fluctuations, potential differences in accounting and taxation policies, as well as possible political, economic, and market risks. These risks are heightened for investments in emerging markets which are also subject to greater illiquidity and volatility than developed foreign markets. Frontier markets generally have smaller economies or less developed capital markets than traditional emerging markets, and therefore investing in frontier markets can magnify the risks of investing in emerging markets. Fixed income is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed income security that result from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, a portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Investments in high yield securities (commonly referred to as “junk bonds”) are often considered speculative investments and have significantly higher credit risk than investment grade securities. The prices of high yield securities, which may be less liquid than higher rated securities, may be more volatile and more vulnerable to adverse market, economic or political conditions. Risk is inherent in all investing. You could lose money by investing in the Money Market Fund (‘MM Fund’). Although the MM Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the MM Fund is not a deposit of HSBC Bank USA, N.A. and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The MM Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the MM Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the MM Fund at any time. For complete risk considerations, please refer to the fund's prospectus.

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company and the mutual fund. For clients of HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., please call 1-888-525-5757 for more information. For other investors and prospective investors, please call the Funds directly at 1-800-782-8183. You can download the fund prospectus from this site.  Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
US persons (both entities and individuals) are subject to US taxation on their worldwide income and may be subject to tax and other filing obligations with respect to their US and non-US accounts. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a US law designed to prevent the use of non-US accounts or non-US entities to avoid US taxation of income and assets. To meet this objective, FATCA imposes on US and non-US entities certain documentation, due diligence, withholding and reporting requirements with respect to accounts and certain payments. Investors should consult their independent tax advisors about investment tax implications.

HSBC Global Asset Management is the marketing name for the asset management businesses of HSBC Holdings Plc. HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. serves as the investment adviser to the HSBC Funds. Foreside Distribution Services, L.P., member FINRA, is the distributor of the HSBC Funds and is not affiliated with the adviser. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., member NYSE, FINRA and SIPC, is a sub-distributor of the HSBC Funds. Affiliates of HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. may receive fees for providing various services to the funds.

Risk Considerations: 
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective or will work under all market conditions. The value of investments may go down as well as up and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Portfolios may be subject to certain additional risks, which should be considered carefully along with their investment objectives and fees. Equity investments fluctuate in value based on changes to an individual company’s financial condition and overall market conditions. Investments in foreign markets involve risks such as currency rate fluctuations, potential differences in accounting and taxation policies, as well as possible political, economic, and market risks. These risks are heightened for investments in emerging markets which are also subject to greater illiquidity and volatility than developed foreign markets. Frontier markets generally have smaller economies or less developed capital markets than traditional emerging markets, and therefore investing in frontier markets can magnify the risks of investing in emerging markets. Fixed income is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed income security that result from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, a portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Investments in high yield securities (commonly referred to as “junk bonds”) are often considered speculative investments and have significantly higher credit risk than investment grade securities. The prices of high yield securities, which may be less liquid than higher rated securities, may be more volatile and more vulnerable to adverse market, economic or political conditions. Risk is inherent in all investing. You could lose money by investing in the Money Market Fund (‘MM Fund’). Although the MM Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the MM Fund is not a deposit of HSBC Bank USA, N.A. and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The MM Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the MM Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the MM Fund at any time. For complete risk considerations, please refer to the fund's prospectus.

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company and the mutual fund. For clients of HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., please call 1-888-525-5757 for more information. For other investors and prospective investors, please call the Funds directly at 1-800-782-8183. You can download the fund prospectus from this site.  Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
US persons (both entities and individuals) are subject to US taxation on their worldwide income and may be subject to tax and other filing obligations with respect to their US and non-US accounts. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a US law designed to prevent the use of non-US accounts or non-US entities to avoid US taxation of income and assets. To meet this objective, FATCA imposes on US and non-US entities certain documentation, due diligence, withholding and reporting requirements with respect to accounts and certain payments. Investors should consult their independent tax advisors about investment tax implications.

In a declining interest rate environment, a portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Investments in high yield securities (commonly referred to as "junk bonds") are often considered speculative investments and have significantly higher credit risk than investment grade securities. The prices of high yield securities, which may be less liquid than higher rated securities, may be more volatile and more vulnerable to adverse market, economic or political conditions. Real Estate investments are subject to many of the risks associated with direct real estate ownership, such as changes in economic conditions, credit risk, property taxes, zoning laws, and interest rate fluctuations. Derivatives can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on performance. Non-diversification occurs when portfolio assets are invested in fewer securities, industries, currencies or countries than in diversified investment portfolios, Non-diversification increases risk because each investment has a greater effect on portfolio performance and can also be affected by single economic, political or regulatory occurrences. Geographic concentration occurs when a portfolio concentrates its investments in one country or region. Portfolio performance is expected to be closely tied to the social, political, and economic conditions in that country or region, and may therefore be more volatile than the performance of more geographically diversified funds.
        
        Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

Things to bear in mind
It is important to remember

You need to have an HSBC current or savings account to buy funds via our Global Investment Centre. 
The Global Investment Centre is offered without advice, on an execution only basis. HSBC is not required to assess the suitability of this service for you, which means that the protection offered by the Financial Conduct Authority's rules on assessing suitability will not apply. If you have any doubts about whether this service is suitable for your needs, you should seek advice from a Financial Adviser (you may be charged for any advice you receive)
Investments should be considered as a medium to long-term commitment. This means you should be prepared to hold them for at least five years. 
Investing through our Global Investment Centre involves taking some investment risk. The value of investments can go down as well as up and you may get back less than you invested. For some investments this can also happen as a result of exchange rate fluctuations as shares and funds may have an exposure to overseas markets. 
You should carefully consider the specific risks of investing in emerging market securities. 
The value of any tax benefits described depends on your individual circumstances. Tax rules may change in the future. 
Additional risks may apply, please refer to our Key Features of Funds Portfolio and ISA Funds Portfolio document for further information. 

Apply online (via Personal Internet Banking)
Please read and save the following documents before applying for Global Investment Centre:

More details/FAQs


How it works


Once you've registered for the Global Investment Centre, you can open a Funds Portfolio in which to buy, sell and hold your investments.
You can also apply for an ISA Funds Portfolio so you can hold your investments within a tax-efficient ISA.
There are no new passwords to remember because you access your Global Investment Centre through Internet Banking. Simply log on and select 'Investments'.
You can see the current value of your investment and track its performance online.
Interactive research tools help you make informed decisions about what to invest in and when.
Anyone with an HSBC current or savings account can register for our Global Investment Centre.
Global Investment Centre integrates seamlessly with your nominated bank account as the money for your purchases and the proceeds from your sales will be taken from and paid into that account.
You can choose to buy, sell or switch funds either online or by phone. Please note that purchases or sales you make from 4pm onwards on a business day will be processed the following business day. The minimum initial investment is £100 for each class of fund shares for each portfolio. The minimum additional investment is also £100.
Please note online trades through the Global Investment Centre are limited to £99,999. If you would like to place a trade of £100,000 or more, please call us on 03456 076180**.




How much does it cost?


There is no charge for setting up the Global Investment Centre service.
An Account Fee of 0.39% per annum applies when investing in clean share class funds.
There is no initial charge on any funds in the Global Investment Centre.
An annual management charge and other expenses will apply.
In the past fund managers, including HSBC, have used several different methods to illustrate charges. To make these charges clearer and comparisons simpler for you, we’re moving to the Ongoing Charges Figure (OCF), which is being adopted throughout the investment fund industry. The OCF incorporates the Annual Management Charge (AMC) as well as any other additional charges from the fund provider.
Full details of the annual management charge and any other expenses (including the Account Fee) are available in the Key Features of Funds Portfolio and ISA Funds Portfolio Document. Specific fund charges are available in the relevant Key Investor Information Documents for each fund.




What types of funds can I hold?


There is a wide range of open ended investment company (OEIC) and unit trust clean share class funds that you can hold within each of your account(s).




What are the charges?


An Account Fee of 0.39% per annum applies when investing in clean share class funds. There is no initial charge on any funds in the Global Investment Centre; however an annual management charge and other expenses will apply.
The Account Fee will be charged as an annual percentage rate and calculated using the value of any holdings in clean share classes within your account. The annual percentage rate for the Account Fee will be 0.39% per annum. The charge will be taken on a monthly basis from your default settlement account for your Funds Portfolio in arrears. The Account Fee will be payable by you for the services we provide when arranging the sale and purchase of fund shares in clean share classes as well as custody and administration of those fund shares when they are held in your account.
Full details of charges, including annual management charges and any other expenses are available in the Key Features Document and the individual Fund Details.




Is there a minimum amount that I have to invest?


The minimum initial investment is £100 for each class of fund shares for each portfolio. The minimum additional investment is also £100.




What happens after I have placed a buy instruction?


If a Buy instruction is placed prior to the dealing deadline (for individual dealing deadlines please see the Fund Details Document for the specific fund) then your order will normally be placed with the fund provider before the fund's next valuation point. The valuation point for each fund is shown in the Fund Details.
You can then view the status of an instruction by clicking on 'Details' located within the 'My order status' section. Once we receive confirmation that the instruction has been executed by the fund provider, your new holding will be reflected within 'My fund portfolio' section. When you place a Buy instruction a hold will be placed on the required monies in your chosen settlement account or in the case of your ISA this will be the Uninvested cash account. The money will be taken from your settlement account or your Uninvested cash account on settlement day.
We will send you a confirmation of the number of fund shares purchased for you and the price you paid.




Can I make regular contributions to a fund or make a joint application?


No. We don't currently offer this service for Global Investment Centre. However, you may invest as often as you like subject to the minimum investment amount of £100 for each fund for each account.








Investment risk
All investments carry some risk. The value of investments (and any income received from them) can fall as well as rise and you may not get back what you invested. For some investments this can also happen as a result of exchange rate fluctuations as shares and funds may have an exposure to overseas markets.


Time commitment
Most investments should be considered as a medium to long-term commitment, meaning you should be prepared to hold them for at least five years.


Tax benefits
The value of any tax benefits described depends on your individual circumstances. Tax rules may change in the future.

For your information
The value of most investments and any income they generate can go down as well as up, meaning you may not get back the full amount you invested.
This may in part be caused by exchange rate variations where overseas investments are held. Investors are advised to consider carefully the special risks of investing in emerging market securities. Investments in emerging markets are by their nature higher risk and potentially more volatile than those in more established markets.
Most investments should be considered as a medium- to long-term commitment, meaning you should be prepared to hold them for at least five years.
Some investments have a fixed term or may not be accessible until you reach your retirement age. For products with a fixed term you may get back significantly less than originally invested if you make an early withdrawal.
The value of any tax benefits described depends on your individual circumstances. Tax rules may change in the future.
