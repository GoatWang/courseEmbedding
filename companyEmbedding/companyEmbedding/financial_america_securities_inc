About Financial Amercia Securities
When you partner with Financial America Securities, Inc., (FASI), you have immediate access to a firm of professionals dedicated to strengthening your financial future.
Cleveland-based and locally-owned, FASI founded in 1970.  Our 40 account executives and support staff average over fifteen years experience in the brokerage and investment banking fields.
Thanks to our optimal size and regional base, we are able to give personalized attention to a full range of investment services.  We focus on low-to-mid capitalized companies and special situation research, investment banking, tax, incentive investments and retirement and estate planning.
What we do
Since 1970, FASI has provided a much needed alternative to the more traditional investment services of large-scale brokerage firms.
Most of our clients are experienced investors who choose us for our personalized services coupled with our large-firm capabilities, including access to the research of Southwest Securities, Credit Swiss First Boston and Argus Research.
FASI provides fast and efficient order execution on all major exchanges made possible through our Cleveland-based market-making and order execution department.
Our firm has a contractual agreement with Southwest Securities (SWS) to serve
as our clearing firm. This fully disclosed agreement states the responsibilities of each party. Prior to the
agreement becoming effective, Southwest Securities is responsible for making all disclosures to our firm's
designated examining authority as required by NYSE Rule 382. Each client of our firm is notified of the
relationship via a disclosure letter. The disclosure letter details the responsibilities that our firm (the
introducing broker-dealer) and Southwest Securities (the clearing firm) have to the client. Although client assets
are held by Southwest Securities, Southwest Securities does not have responsibility
for the financial condition or performance of our firm or our Financial Consultants.


SIPC & Additional Coverage for Client Accounts
Our clearing firm, Southwest Securities (SWS) is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). SIPC is a nonprofit
membership corporation funded by its member security broker-dealers. SIPC protects the securities
clients of its members in the event of the failure of a member firm. SIPC reimburses clients the cash
value of their securities up to $500,000 per client. Any cash in a client's account would be reimbursed by
SIPC up to $100,000 (reducing the $500,000 above).

Note: Neither SIPC protection, nor protection in excess of that offered by SIPC, covers a decline in the
value of a clients assets due to market loss. Additional information is available upon request or at
www.sipc.org.

Services Offered
Special Situation Investments
One of the key strengths of FASI is Special Situation Investments  investments which have the potential to increase substantially in value over the long term.  A broadly defined special situation could be an emerging company in a turn-around position, an emerging growth company or a company of undiscovered value.  Special Situation Investments are offered to clients who have a higher degree of risk tolerance and are willing to assume the risks associated with this type of investment while awaiting the potential rewards.
In addition to special situation research, for many years we have been focusing on investment opportunities in northern Ohio companies.  Throughout the year, our research department publishes reports on companies located in northern Ohio.
Investment Banking
We provide financially qualified individuals with early stage venture capital investment opportunities.  We specialize in servicing small and micro-cap companies both public and private.  Our firm has been active in underwriting public offerings and private placements to institutional and private networks.
Tax Incentive Investments
FASI can help you realize a better return on your income through a variety of tax incentive investments; including tax-free bonds and bond funds, single premium tax-deferred annuities, variable annuities and limited partnerships.  We can tailor an investment portfolio for you to take full advantage of these incentives.
Our Direct Participation Department continually seeks quality programs with experienced general partners which provide both economic return and tax incentives.  Our objective is to offer qualified investors the highest quality product while seeking optimal tax savings.
Fixed Income Investments
FASI provides both taxable and non-taxable fixed income investments.  Investors frequently approach such investments without sufficient awareness of the risk and return relationships involved.  We strive to educate investors on fixed-income investments that can be tailored to meet specific portfolio estate-building objectives.
We provide access to individual corporate bonds and bond funds, U.S. Government Treasury securities, and certificates of deposit.  If your objective is income, our experts can tailor your investment portfolio to provide the yield you seek.
Competitive Commission Practices
Many brokerage firms charge full commission whether you use their services or not.  FASI believes that people making their own investment decisions should not pay the same rate as those requiring full personal investment service.  Our policy is to charge commissions based on the extent of service provided. Our account executives have the flexibility to customize commissions based on our expertise coupled with your insight.
Retirement and Estate Planning
FASI offers a full range of retirement planning of retirement planning for individuals, including Simple IRAs, IRA Rollover Accounts and Roth IRAs.  Our professionals also can help develop 401(k) Plans and Simple IRA Plans for corporate clients.  These provide tax deductions for employers as well as tax deferrals for their employees.
Estate planning can involve the use of trusts in order to avoid probate costs, estate taxes and public disclosure  in probate.  FASI can also provide guidance with plans to help you protect assets from catastrophic long-term care costs.
The Financial America Difference in Total Financial Planning
When you open an account with Financial America Securities, Inc., you receive important and tangible rewards.  Your primary broker is an experienced professional, not a rookie.  Our seasoned brokers work together to serve you.  At FASI, we do not have conflicts of interests  some large brokerage firms must favor other organizations with which they have unstated but long-standing relationships.

Independent financial consultants
Whether you need to invest for retirement, your child’s education or for that dream vacation, look to an independent financial consultant from Securities America. When you work with an independent consultant, you can rest assured that the advice and guidance you receive is based on what’s best for YOU, and not because your advisor is hindered by a limited range of products or a corporate mandate dictating what they can sell or do.

Investing Clients Resources
Securities America Financial Corporation and its family of affiliated companies are committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of investors. We want you to be fully informed when it comes to making investment decisions, and to be aware of how those choices and associated costs may impact you. Safeguarding your personal information and keeping it secure and private is a top priority for us.

Bank Deposit Sweep Programs
The Bank Deposit Sweep Program is a core account investment vehicle used to hold your cash balance while awaiting reinvestment. The cash balance in your Brokerage Account(s) will be automatically deposited or “swept” into an interest-bearing FDIC-insured Program deposit account. Greater safety and competitive yield on the cash in your investment account – that’s why Securities America created the Bank Deposit Sweep Program, which provides up to $1.5 million maximum cumulative FDIC coverage and a competitive yield with deposits held at a network of multiple banks. Please refer to the Disclosure Document in Program Resources for additional information.
