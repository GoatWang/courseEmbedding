ATLANTA, May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. (NYSE:    IVR) (the "Company") today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, reporting basic earnings of $0.78 per common share, core earnings* of $0.40 per common share and book value per diluted common share** of $17.95.


The Company's high quality asset portfolio benefited from credit spread tightening which contributed to a 2.7% increase in book value per diluted common share** for the quarter. Our equity is allocated 61% to residential and commercial credit assets and 39% to Agency RMBS as of March 31, 2017. "During the first quarter we increased our allocation to lower coupon Agency RMBS where the relative return opportunities were the most compelling," said John Anzalone, Chief Executive Officer.  "Importantly, our improvement in core earnings to a level in line with our common stock dividend was achieved without an increase in credit risk."  Average earning assets increased 5.4%, along with a modest rise in leverage, resulting in a corresponding increase in effective net interest income* of $7.3 million during the quarter.
The Company delivered a 5.0% economic return*** for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 to its stockholders, up from -1.1% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.   
Highlights

Q1 2017 net income attributable to common stockholders of $87.1 million or $0.78 basic earnings per common share and $0.73 diluted earnings per common share  
Q1 2017 core earnings* of $44.9 million, core earnings per common share* of $0.40, and a common stock dividend of $0.40 per share  
Q1 2017 book value per diluted common share** of $17.95 vs. $17.48 at Q4 2016 and $16.53 at Q1 2016  
Economic return*** for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 of 5.0% vs -1.1% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016  
Q1 2017 comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders was $97.2 million or $0.87 basic comprehensive income per common share vs. comprehensive loss attributable to common stockholders of ($22.7) million or ($0.20) basic comprehensive loss per common share for Q4 2016

Financial Summary
Net income attributable to common stockholders for the first quarter of 2017 was $87.1 million, compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of $270.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased primarily due to lower net gains on derivative instruments totaling $5.5 million during the first quarter of 2017 compared to $230.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. Book value per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2017 increased by 2.7% to $17.95 primarily due to interest rate swap spreads widening and higher valuations of the Company's credit risk transfer securities portfolio. 
During the first quarter of 2017, the Company generated $44.9 million in core earnings, an increase of $5.1 million or 12.8% from the fourth quarter of 2016.   Higher first quarter core earnings were driven by a $7.3 million increase in effective net interest income that was partially offset by first quarter 2017 losses on unconsolidated ventures of $1.5 million compared to fourth quarter 2016 gains of $0.4 million.
Average earning assets increased to $16.3 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 compared to $15.5 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.  During the first quarter of 2017, the Company purchased $1.7 billion of 30 year fixed-rate Agency RMBS in response to a steeper yield curve, rising interest rates and a corresponding anticipated slowdown in prepayment speeds.  Our 30 year fixed-rate Agency securities accounted for 27% of our average earning assets as of March 31, 2017 compared to 21% of our average earnings assets as of December 31, 2016.  
Total interest income increased to $124.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 compared to $114.6 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2016. In addition, average earning asset yields increased 10 basis points to 3.06% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 from 2.96% in the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The increase in average earning asset yields was driven by slower prepayment speeds and higher index rates on our floating and adjustable rate assets.  Net premium amortization declined to $27.2 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 compared to $32.7 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2016. 
The Company modestly increased leverage to 6.1x during the first quarter to fund additional asset purchases and to retire $150.0 million of its Exchangeable Senior Notes (the "Notes"). 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company had average borrowings of $14.2 billion compared to $13.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016 and total interest expense of $38.4 million compared to $34.4 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The Company's cost of funds was 1.08% and 1.01% for the first quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.  The Company's total interest expense and cost of funds rose during the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to increased borrowings and higher interest rates as a result of the December 2016 and March 2017 increases in the federal funds interest rate. The Company's repurchase agreement interest expense for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 includes amortization of net deferred gains on the Company's de-designated interest rate swaps totaling $6.3 million and $6.2 million, respectively, that is recorded as a reduction in repurchase agreements interest expense under U.S. GAAP.  During the next 12 months, the Company estimates that $25.8 million of net deferred gains on de-designated interest rate swaps currently recorded in other comprehensive income will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense.
Total expenses for the first quarter of 2017 were approximately $10.9 million, compared to $10.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. General and administrative expenses were $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.6 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. General and administrative expenses rose during the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to transaction fees related to new interest rate swaps added during the quarter and higher professional fees.
The ratio of annualized total expenses to average equity (1) was 2.05% for the first quarter of 2017, relatively flat compared to 2.06% for the fourth quarter of 2016.
As previously announced, the Company declared the following dividends on March 15, 2017: a common stock dividend of $0.40 per share paid on April 26, 2017; a Series A preferred stock dividend of $0.4844 per share paid on April 25, 2017; and a Series B preferred stock dividend of $0.4844 per share that will be paid on June 27, 2017. 




 (1) 
 The ratio of annualized total expenses to average equity is calculated as the annualized sum of management fees plus general and administrative expenses divided by average equity. Average equity is calculated based on the weighted month-end balance of total equity excluding equity attributable to preferred stockholders.

 See Note 16 of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements filed in Item 1 of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 




Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this release contains the non-GAAP financial measures of core earnings (and by calculation, core earnings per common share), effective interest income (and by calculation, effective yield), effective interest expense (and by calculation, effective cost of funds), effective net interest income (and by calculation, effective interest rate margin), and repurchase agreement debt-to-equity ratio. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its internal analysis of results and believes these measures are useful to investors for the reasons explained below. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (and by calculation basic earnings (loss) per common share), total interest income (and by calculation, earning asset yield), total interest expense (and by calculation, cost of funds), net interest income (and by calculation, net interest rate margin) and debt-to-equity ratio.  Certain prior period U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures have been revised to correct immaterial errors in accounting for premiums and discounts on non-Agency RMBS not of high credit quality.  For further information, see Note 17 of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements filed in Item 1 of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.  
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be made in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate.
Core Earnings
The Company calculates core earnings as U.S. GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders adjusted for (gain) loss on investments, net; realized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net; unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net; realized and unrealized (gain) loss on GSE CRT embedded derivatives, net; (gain) loss on foreign currency transactions, net; amortization of net deferred (gain) loss on de-designated interest rate swaps; net loss on extinguishment of debt; and cumulative adjustments attributable to non-controlling interest. The Company records changes in the valuation of its mortgage-backed securities, excluding securities for which the Company elected the fair value option and the valuation assigned to the debt host contract associated with its GSE CRTs, in other comprehensive income on its condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The Company believes the presentation of core earnings provides a consistent measure of operating performance by excluding the impact of gains and losses described above from operating results. The Company believes that providing transparency into core earnings enables its investors to consistently measure, evaluate and compare its operating performance to that of its peers over multiple reporting periods. However, the Company cautions that core earnings should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP), or as an indication of the Company's cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP), a measure of the Company's liquidity, or an indication of amounts available to fund its cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions.
The table below provides a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to core earnings for the following periods:

Effective Interest Income/ Effective Yield/ Effective Interest Expense/Effective Cost of Funds/Effective Net Interest Income/Effective Interest Rate Margin
The Company calculates effective interest income (and by calculation, effective yield) as U.S. GAAP total interest income adjusted for GSE CRT embedded derivative coupon interest recorded as realized and unrealized credit derivative income (loss), net. The Company accounts for GSE CRTs purchased prior to August 24, 2015 as hybrid financial instruments, but has elected the fair value option for GSE CRTs purchased on or after August 24, 2015. Under U.S. GAAP, coupon interest on GSE CRTs accounted for using the fair value option is recorded as interest income, whereas coupon interest on GSE CRTs accounted for as hybrid financial instruments is recorded as realized and unrealized credit derivative income (loss). The Company adds back GSE CRT embedded derivative coupon interest to its total interest income because the Company considers GSE CRT embedded derivative coupon interest a current component of its total interest income irrespective of whether the Company has elected the fair value option for the GSE CRT or accounted for the GSE CRT as a hybrid financial instrument.
The Company calculates effective interest expense (and by calculation, effective cost of funds) as U.S. GAAP total interest expense adjusted for net interest expense on its interest rate swaps that is recorded as gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net and the amortization of net deferred gains (losses) on de-designated interest rate swaps that is recorded as repurchase agreements interest expense. The Company views its interest rate swaps as an economic hedge against increases in future market interest rates on its floating rate borrowings. The Company adds back the net payments it makes on its interest rate swap agreements to its total U.S. GAAP interest expense because the Company uses interest rate swaps to add stability to interest expense. The Company excludes the amortization of net deferred gains (losses) on de-designated interest rate swaps from its calculation of effective interest expense because the Company does not consider the amortization a current component of its borrowing costs.
The Company calculates effective net interest income (and by calculation, effective interest rate margin) as U.S. GAAP net interest income adjusted for net interest expense on its interest rate swaps that is recorded as gain (loss) on derivative instruments, amortization of net deferred gains (losses) on de-designated interest rate swaps that is recorded as repurchase agreements interest expense and GSE CRT embedded derivative coupon interest that is recorded as realized and unrealized credit derivative income (loss), net.
The Company believes the presentation of effective interest income, effective yield, effective interest expense, effective cost of funds, effective net interest income and effective interest rate margin measures, when considered together with U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding the Company's borrowing costs and operating performance.
The following table reconciles total interest income to effective interest income and yield to effective yield for the following periods:

Repurchase Agreement Debt-to-Equity Ratio
The following tables show the allocation of the Company's equity to its target assets, the Company's debt-to-equity ratio, and the Company's repurchase agreement debt-to-equity ratio as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The Company presents a repurchase agreement debt-to-equity ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure of leverage, because the mortgage REIT industry primarily uses repurchase agreements, which typically mature within one year, to finance investments. The Company believes presenting the Company's repurchase agreement debt-to-equity ratio when considered together with U.S. GAAP financial measure of debt-to-equity ratio, provides information that is useful to investors in understanding the Company's refinancing risks, and gives investors a comparable statistic to those other mortgage REITs who almost exclusively borrow using short-term repurchase agreements that are subject to refinancing risk.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

This is a new Fund and has no full-year Fund performance to report as of most recent quarter end.  

Market returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance data quoted. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. After Tax Held and After Tax Sold are based on NAV. Returns less than one year are cumulative.

Distribution Information



Fund Distributions

Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid either quarterly or monthly, depending on the Fund. For Funds on a quarterly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the third Friday of each March, June, September and December, payable the last business day of the month. For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. 
The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments.
Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market. 
Taxes on Distributions
In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. Dividends paid out of the Fund’s income and net short-term gains, if any, are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Shares. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly. The Fund may also pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements. 
Under the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Tax Act”), long-term capital gains tax rates have generally been reduced for individuals to a maximum of 15% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009. In addition, some ordinary dividends declared and paid by the Fund to individual shareholders may qualify for taxation at the lower reduced tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that holding period and other requirements are met by the Fund and the shareholder. 
Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares, and as capital gain thereafter. A distribution will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 
By law, the Fund must withhold a percentage of your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number. The backup withholding rate is currently 28%.

 Floating rate securities overview 









 Risk & Other Information 
 
† Ratings are based on S&P, Moody's or Fitch, as applicable. A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. NR indicates the debtor was not rated, and should not be interpreted as indicating low quality. If securities are rated differently by the rating agencies, the higher rating is applied. Credit ratings are based largely on the rating agency's investment analysis at the time of rating and the rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection of the issuer's current financial condition. The rating assigned to a security by a rating agency does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. For more information on the rating methodology, please visit the following NRSRO websites: standardandpoors.com and select 'Understanding Ratings' under Rating Resources on the home page; moodys.com and select 'Rating Methodologies' under Research and Ratings on the home page; fitchratings.com and select 'Ratings Definitions' on the home page. The Bloomberg Barclays US Floating Rate Note Index measures the performance of US dollar-denominated, investment grade floating rate notes.  There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Actively managed ETFs do not necessarily seek to replicate the performance of a specified index. Actively managed ETFs are subject to risks similar to stocks, including those related to short selling and margin maintenance. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. The investment techniques and risk analysis used by the portfolio managers may not produce the desired results. Fixed-income investments are subject to credit risk of the issuer and the effects of changing interest rates. Interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise and vice versa. An issuer may be unable to meet interest and/or principal payments, thereby causing its instruments to decrease in value and lowering the issuer's credit rating. Junk bonds involve a greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the issuer's credit quality. The values of junk bonds fluctuate more than those of high quality bonds and can decline significantly over short time periods. Investments focused in a particular industry or sector are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. The Fund invests in short-term instruments which generally provide lower returns than longer-term fixed income securities.  Active trading of portfolio securities may result in added expenses, a lower return and increased tax liability.  The Fund is non-diversified and may experience greater volatility than a more diversified investment.  The Fund may hold illiquid securities that it may be unable to sell at the preferred time or price and could lose its entire investment in such securities. The Fund currently intends to effect creations and redemptions principally for cash, rather than principally in-kind because of the nature of the Fund's investments. As such, investments in the Fund may be less tax efficient than investments in ETFs that create and redeem in-kind. If interest rates fall, it is possible that issuers of callable securities will call or prepay their securities before maturity, causing the Fund to reinvest proceeds in securities bearing lower interest rates and reducing the Fund's income and distributions. Risks of collateralized loan obligations include the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments, the quality of the collateral may decline in value or default, the collateralized loan obligations may be subordinate to other classes, values may be volatile, and disputes with the issuer may produce unexpected investment results. Defaulted securities involve the substantial risk that principal will not be repaid and may be subject to restrictions on resale. An investment in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may trade at a discount to net asset value, fail to develop an active trading market, halt trading on the listing exchange, fail to track the referenced index, or hold troubled securities. ETFs may involve duplication of management fees and certain other expenses. Certain of the ETFs the fund invests in are leveraged, which can magnify any losses on those investments. For mortgage-backed securities, if interest rates rise, borrowers may prepay mortgages more slowly than originally expected. This may further reduce market value and lengthen durations. Instruments issued by government agencies, including the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"), are generally only backed by the general creditworthiness and reputation of the issuing government agency and are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. As a result, there is uncertainty as to the current status of many obligations that are placed under conservatorship of the federal government. Income generated from the Fund is based primarily on prevailing interest rates, which can vary widely over the short- and long-term. If interest rates drop, the Fund's income may drop as well. Preferred securities may include provisions that permit the issuer to defer or omit distributions for a certain period of time, and reporting the distribution for tax purposes may be required, even though the income may not have been received. Further, preferred securities may lose substantial value due to the omission or deferment of dividend payments. Reinvestment risk is the risk that a bond's cash flows (coupon income and principal repayment) will be reinvested at an interest rate below that on the original bond. Obligations issued by US Government agencies and instrumentalities may receive varying levels of support from the government, which could affect the fund's ability to recover should they default.
