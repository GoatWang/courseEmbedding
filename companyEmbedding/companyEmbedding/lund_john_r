Mr. Lund focuses his practice on challenging litigation and trial work throughout the West. With a 30 year jury trial record that is both extensive and successful, he has earned his place as a go-to attorney for clients with high-stakes cases.  In 2011, Mr. Lund obtained one of the largest jury verdicts ever awarded in Utah, over $54 million in lost profit damages for his client’s resort development rights. In 2014, he represented the landlord of the Park City ski terrain in successfully terminating the lease of the prior operator, which led to Vail Resort’s combination of Park City and Canyons into the largest single ski area in the country.
Mr. Lund uses all the tools of the litigation process to efficiently achieve the best outcome at the best time for his client – whether that is a settlement or a full-blown trial.   Mr. Lund also provides trial consulting, including mock trials, focus groups, theme development and presentation techniques, to help other lawyers as well as clients prepare for and navigate the real-life experience and risk of trial by jury.
Mr. Lund is recognized by Chambers USA as one of Utah's leading lawyers for commercial litigation. He is also named as one of the Best Lawyers in America for Products Liability Litigation. Chambers USA writes: “John Lund's recent trial successes have served to bolster his already healthy reputation in the local market. He is experienced at dealing with the most complex of commercial disputes.”
Mr. Lund is also a leader of the Bar serving as a Utah Bar Commissioner and chairing the Supreme Court’s Advisory Committee on Evidence.  He also serves as the Bar’s representative on the Utah Judicial Council.
