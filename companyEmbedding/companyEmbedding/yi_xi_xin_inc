	PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS




	 




	YI XI XIN, INC.




	 




	1,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT $2.00
	PER SHARE



	 


	This Prospectus relates to the offering by
	YI XI XIN, INC. ("YXX," "we," "our," the "Company" or the "Registrant") of a)
	a total of 1,000,000 shares (the "Shares") of our common stock on a "self-underwritten" basis at a fixed price
	of $2.00 per share. The Company is offering our shares at a fixed price of $2.00 for the duration of the offering. There is no
	minimum for this Offering. The Offering will commence promptly on the date upon which this prospectus is declared effective by
	the SEC and will continue for 180 days. At the discretion of our board of directors, we may discontinue the offering before expiration
	of the 180 day period or extend the offering for up to 180 days following the expiration of the 180 day offering period. We will
	pay all expenses incurred in this offering. We are an “emerging growth company” under applicable Securities and Exchange
	Commission rules and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.


	 


	The offering of the 1,000,000 shares is a “best
	efforts” offering, which means that our Officers and Directors will use their best efforts to sell the common stock and there
	is no commitment by any person to purchase any shares. The shares will be offered at a fixed price of $2.00 per share for the duration
	of the offering. The shares will be sold at the fixed price until the common stock becomes quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, OTCQX,
	OTCQB or listed on a securities exchange. There is no minimum number of shares required to be sold to close the offering, therefore
	the net proceeds may range between $0 and $2,000,000.00. Proceeds from the sale of the shares will be used to fund the initial
	stages of our business development. We have not made any arrangements to place funds received from share subscriptions in an escrow,
	trust or similar account. Any funds raised from the offering will be immediately available to us for our immediate use. We have
	agreed to bear all of the expenses incurred in connection with the registration of these shares.


	 


	This is a direct participation offering since
	we are offering the stock directly to the public without the participation of an underwriter. Our Officers and Directors will be
	solely responsible for selling shares under this offering for the Company and no commission will be paid on any sales.


	 


	There is no minimum offering of the YXX shares.


	 


	We are a development stage company focusing on early-stage business
	activities. 


	This fact may impose some limitations on our shareholders' ability
	to re-sell their shares in our company. Accordingly, investors should consider our shares to be a high-risk illiquid investment
	(see "Risk Factors" section).


	 






	 









	 






	We are not a blank check company and have no plans or intentions
	to engage in a business combination following this offering.


	 


	These securities involve a high degree of risk, and prospective
	purchasers should be prepared to sustain the loss of their entire investment. There is currently no public trading market for the
	securities.


	 


	Management will have sole control over company's accounts. We have
	not made arrangements to place the funds in an escrow account with a third party escrow agent due to the costs involved. As a result,
	investors are subject to the risk that creditors could attach these funds during the offering process (see "Use of Proceeds"
	and "Plan of Distribution" sections)


	 


	This is our initial public offering. Prior to this offering there
	has been no public market for our common stock and we have not applied for listing or quotation on any public market. After the
	effective date of the registration statement, we intend to list our common stock on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB),
	which is maintained by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA).


	 


	This Offering of shares will terminate 180 days from the effective
	date of this Prospectus, although we may close the Offering on any date prior if the Offering is fully subscribed.


	 


	Our President will market our common stock and offer / sell the
	securities on our behalf. This is the best effort direct participation offering that will not utilize broker-dealer arrangement.
	No Officer or Director will receive any compensation for herrole in selling shares in the offering.  


	Our Officers and Directors have not acted as promoters nor do they
	have a controlling interest in any companies (either viable or dormant).


	 


	The Company is considered an "emerging growth company"
	as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.


	 


	Before purchasing any of the common stock covered by this Prospectus,
	carefully read and consider the risk factors included in the section entitled "RISK FACTORS".


	 


	Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities
	commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this Prospectus. Any representation
	to the contrary is a criminal offense.

	RISK FACTORS



	 


	An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk.
	You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Prospectus before investing in our common
	stock. If any of the risks disclosed below occur, our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed.



	 




	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS




	 




	AS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY, AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMPANY
	IS CONSIDERED A HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WHEREBY YOU COULD LOSE YOUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT



	 


	We will incur significant expenses in order to implement our business
	plan, including estimated $30,000 in federal securities law compliance costs for the 12-month period following the effectiveness
	of our registration statement. As an investor, you should be aware of the difficulties, delays and expenses normally encountered
	by an enterprise in the development stage, many of which are beyond our control (such as unanticipated developmental expenses,
	employment costs, advertising and marketing expenses). We cannot assure you that our proposed business plan as described in this
	Prospectus will materialize or prove successful.



	 




	OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE FUNDS TO BE RAISED
	IN THIS OFFERING.



	 


	As of January 31, 2017, we have $0 in cash on hand. We will require
	the proceeds from this Offering in order to operate for at least one year. We intend to use the proceeds from this Offering to
	expand our operations. It will enable us (after paying the expenses of this Offering) cover all related licensing fees and the
	SEC compliance and filing expenses including legal fees.


	 


	We may need additional funds in the future to further our business
	activities and to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations and expansion can be funded out of profits. There
	is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.




	 






	BUSINESS EVALUATION IS DIFFICULT SINCE WE HAVE NOT YET COMMENCED
	SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES



	 


	We were incorporated on November 22, 2016 and to date have been
	involved primarily in organizational activities. To date we have entered into a Patent License Agreement with our founder, effective
	January 1, 2017. The Patent License Agreement attached to the Registration Statement as Exhibit 10.2 herein provides the Company
	with the right to market Chinese Patent No. Zl20152051857.2 (the “Licensed Patent”) for a period of Five (5) Years
	beginning on January 1, 2017. We require additional funds in order to implement our marketing and sales plan to capitalize on the
	Licensed Patent.


	 


	We generated revenue of $0 and incurred total losses of Twenty Thousand
	Dollars ($20,000) from inception to January 31, 2017.

	OTHER THAN OUR LICENSED PATENT, OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS
	NOT CURRENTLY PROTECTED BY TRADE MARKS, PATENTS OR COPYRIGHTS



	 




	If we are unable to protect our intellectual
	property, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.




	 


	The Patent License Agreement attached to
	the Registration Statement as Exhibit 10.2 herein provides the Company with the right to market Chinese Patent No. Zl20152051857.2
	(the “Licensed Patent”) for a period of Five (5) Years beginning on January 1, 2017. However, we have not filed for
	trade mark, other patent, or copyright protection of our own. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary
	rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us. Any future trademark and patent applications may not be approved.


	 


	In addition, effective intellectual property
	protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these
	cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights.


	 


	Although we have taken measures to protect
	our proprietary rights, including the use of incryption, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts
	that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business
	and financial results.


	 




	We are not currently, but in the
	future, could become a party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming,
	and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.




	 


	Companies in the internet,
	technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enter
	into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights.
	In addition, various “non-practicing entities” that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt
	to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies. We presently are not involved in any such
	lawsuits, but in the future, as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, including in connection with
	our initial public offering, it is possible that patent and other intellectual property claims against could arise. In addition,
	from time to time we may introduce new products, including in areas where we currently do not compete, which could increase our
	exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities.


	 


	Although the results
	of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of intellectual property
	claims will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.


	 


	However,
	defending patent and other intellectual property claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees,
	we may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings in the course of litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable
	final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable
	to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment
	that may not be reversed upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations
	or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in
	violation of a third party’s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As
	a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices. The
	development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible.
	Our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected as a result.

	You cannot evaluate our business or our future prospects due to
	our lack of operating history. To-date, we have been involved in limited business activities. Potential investors should be aware
	of the difficulties normally encountered by development stage companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. In addition,
	there is no guarantee that we will commence full business operations.


	 


	Furthermore, we anticipate that we will incur increased operating
	expenses without realizing any significant revenue. We therefore expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future.
	We recognize that if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from selling color panels, we will not be able to continue operations.



	 




	IF OUR PRESIDENT LEAVES THE COMPANY PRIOR TO SECURING REPLACEMENTS,
	WE WILL BE LEFT WITHOUT MANAGEMENT AND OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS WOULD CEASE



	 


	We depend on the services of our President, Ping Zhou, and our success
	depends on the decisions made by our President. The loss of the services of our President could have an adverse effect on our business,
	financial condition and results of operations. There is no assurance that our President will not leave the company or compete against
	us in the future, as we presently have no employment agreement with her. In such circumstance, we may have to recruit qualified
	personnel with competitive compensation packages, equity participation and other benefits that may affect the working capital available
	for our operations. Our failure to attract additional qualified employees or to retain the services of Our President could have
	a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. We will fail without appropriate replacements.



	 




	ALTHOUGH OUR PRESIDENT IS NOT CURRENTLY RECEIVING COMPENSATION
	FOR HER SERVICES, SHE MAY DECIDE TO PAY HERSELF, WHICH WILL ADVERSELY IMPACT ANY POTENTIAL NET PROFIT THAT WE MAY GENERATE



	 


	We are not currently compensating our President for providing management
	services to us. In the future we might pay our President compensation if the cash flow generated from operations significantly
	exceeds our total expenses. Our President, has the power to set her own compensation as he sees fit. If she determines to compensate
	herself, it could have an adverse effect on our net profit, if any.



	 




	THE LACK OF PUBLIC COMPANY EXPERIENCE OF OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS
	COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF U.S. SECURITIES LAWS



	 


	Our Officers and Directors, have had no responsibility
	for managing a public company in the United States, which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements
	such as those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Such responsibility includes complying with federal securities laws and
	making required disclosures on a timely basis. In addition, our Officers and Directors may not be able to implement programs and
	policies in an effective and timely manner or in a manner which adequately responds to such increased legal, regulatory compliance
	and reporting requirements, including establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses
	or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the Exchange
	Act, which is necessary to maintain our public company status. If we were to fail to fulfill those obligations, our ability to
	continue as a U.S. public company would be in jeopardy, in which event you could lose your entire investment.

	OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS DO NOT RESIDE IN THE UNITED STATES.



	 


	Our executive Officers do not reside in the United States. The U.S.
	stockholders would face difficulty in:


	 




	*

	WE ARE AN "EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY" AND INTEND TO TAKE
	ADVANTAGE OF REDUCED DISCLOSURE AND GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES; AS A RESULT, OUR COMMON STOCK
	MAY BE LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS



	 


	We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the
	Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements
	that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Such exemptions include, but not limited
	to: not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure
	obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; exemptions from the requirements of
	holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously
	approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer considered an emerging growth company, which
	in certain circumstances could be up to five years. There may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock
	price may be more volatile.


	 


	As an emerging growth company, exemptions from the following provisions
	are available to us:


	 




	1.




	Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires auditor attestation
	of internal controls;






	2.




	Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require companies
	to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation;






	3.




	Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires
	companies to disclose the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the company;






	4.




	Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act (which has not yet been implemented), which
	requires companies to disclose the ratio between the annual total compensation of the CEO and the median of the annual total compensation
	of all employees of the companies; and






	5.




	The requirement to provide certain other executive compensation disclosure under Item
	402 of Regulation S-K. Instead, an emerging growth company must only comply with the more limited provisions of Item 402 applicable
	to smaller reporting companies, regardless of the issuer's size.

	RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK




	 




	BECAUSE OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS, WHO ARE ALSO OUR
	SOLE PROMOTERS, WILL OWN 96% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES AFTER THIS OFFERING, THEY WILL RETAIN SIGNIFICANT CONTROL OF THE COMPANY,
	WHICH IN TURN COULD DECREASE THE PRICE AND MARKETABILITY OF THE SHARES

	 


	After all 1,000,000 shares of common stock of this Offering are
	sold Our President will own 25,000,000 or 96 % of total outstanding shares and will retain significant control. As a result, Our
	President will have an ability to influence the Company as follows:


	 




	*




	elect or defeat the election of our Directors;






	*





	amend or prevent amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws;






	*




	effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and






	*




	affect the outcome of any other matter submitted to the stockholders for vote




	 


	Moreover, our sole Officer and Director owns 25,000,000 shares,
	and because of the significant ownership position held by our insiders, new investors may not be able to effect a change in the
	Company's business or management, and therefore, shareholders would be subject to decisions made by management and the majority
	shareholder.


	 


	In addition, sales of significant amounts of shares held by our
	Officers and Directors or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Management's
	stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the
	Company; this could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.



	 




	WE ARE SELLING SHARES IN THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER
	AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ALL OF THE SHARES; WE MAY HAVE TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE FINANCING TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLANS



	 


	This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not engaging
	the services of an underwriter to sell the shares. We intend to sell them through our Officers and Directors, who will receive
	no commissions. He will offer the shares to friends, relatives, acquaintances and business associates; however, there is no guarantee
	that he will be able to sell any/all of the shares. In the event we do not sell all of the shares before the expiration date of
	the Offering, we will have to seek alternative financing sources. There is no provision to refund all or portion of the funds to
	our existing shareholders raised by selling company shares.




	 






	SHARES SOLD BY THE SELLING SHAREHOLDERS
	MAY LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF PROCEEDS RAISED IN THE PRIMARY OFFERING




	 



	As the Company is only selling 1,000,000 of
	the _______________________________________ shares being registered in this offering, this may result in competition between the
	Company and the Selling Shareholders who may offer to the same investor groups. As such, it may limit the amount the Company is
	able to raise in the primary offering.

	YOU WILL INCUR IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION OF THE PRICE
	YOU PAY FOR YOUR SHARES



	 


	Our existing Affiliate stockholders acquired their shares at a cost
	of $0.001 per share, , a cost per share that is substantially less than the amount you will pay for the shares you purchase in
	this offering. Accordingly, any investment you make in these shares will result in the immediate and substantial dilution of the
	net tangible book value of those shares from the $2.00 you pay for them (see the Dilution table).



	 




	THE PROCEEDS OF OUR OFFERING WILL BE HELD IN A STANDARD CORPORATE
	CHECKING ACCOUNT (RATHER THAN AN ESCROW ACCOUNT) UNTIL THE OFFERING CLOSES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CREDITORS OF THE COMPANY COULD
	ATTACH THESE FUNDS



	 


	Our management will have sole control over the withdrawal of funds.
	We have not made arrangements to place the funds in an escrow account with a third party escrow agent due to the costs involved.
	As a result, investors are subject to the risk that creditors could attach these funds during the offering process.



	 




	THERE IS CURRENTLY NO PUBLIC MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, THERE
	CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY PUBLIC MARKET WILL DEVELOP OR THAT OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE QUOTED FOR TRADING




	 




	There is no public market for our securities and there can be no
	assurance that an active trading market for the securities offered herein will develop after this offering by the selling stockholders,
	or, if developed, be sustained. After the effective date of the registration statement of which this Prospectus is a part, we intend
	to identify a market maker to file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to have our common stock
	quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. We will have to satisfy certain criteria in order for our application to be accepted.
	We do not currently have a market maker that is willing to participate in this application process, and even if we identify a market
	maker, we cannot assure you that we will meet the acceptance criteria. Our common stock may never be quoted on the Over-the-Counter
	Bulletin Board, or, if quoted, a public market may not materialize. 


	 



	RISK OF LOSING INVESTMENT



	 


	If our securities are not eligible for initial quotation, or if
	quoted, are not eligible for continued quotation on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, or a public trading market does not develop,
	purchasers of the shares of common stock may have difficulty selling or be unable to sell their securities, rendering their shares
	effectively worthless and resulting in a partial or complete loss of their investment.



	 




	PURCHASING PENNY STOCK LIMITS INVESTOR'S ABILITY TO RE-SELL



	 


	The shares offered by this Prospectus constitute "penny stock"
	under the Exchange Act. The shares will remain "penny stock" for the foreseeable future. "Penny stock" rules
	impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers
	and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together
	with a spouse). For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the
	purchase of such securities and have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase.

	Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless
	exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a disclosure schedule prescribed by the Commission relating
	to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered
	representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information
	on the limited market in penny stocks. Consequently, the "penny stock" rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers
	to sell our shares of common stock. The market price of our shares would likely suffer as a result.



	 




	FINRA SALES REQUIREMENTS MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER'S ABILITY TO
	BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK



	 


	FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment
	to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior
	to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts
	to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations
	of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for
	certain customers. FINRA requirements will likely make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy
	our common stock, which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in our common stock. As a result, fewer broker-dealers
	may be willing to make a market in our common stock, reducing a stockholder's ability to resell shares of our common stock.



	 




	STATE SECURITIES LAWS MAY LIMIT SECONDARY TRADING, RESTRICTING
	THE STATES WHERE YOU CAN RESELL THE SHARES OFFERED BY THIS PROSPECTUS



	 


	If you purchase shares of our common stock sold pursuant to this
	offering, you may not be able to resell the shares in a certain state unless and until the shares of our common stock are qualified
	for secondary trading under the applicable securities laws of such state or there is confirmation that an exemption, such as listing
	in certain recognized securities manuals, is available for secondary trading in such state. There can be no assurance that we will
	be successful in registering or qualifying our common stock for secondary trading, or identifying an available exemption for secondary
	trading in our common stock in every state. If we fail to register or qualify, or to obtain or verify an exemption for the secondary
	trading of our common stock in any particular state, the shares of common stock could not be offered or sold to, or purchased by,
	a resident of that state. In the event that a significant number of states refuse to permit secondary trading in our common stock,
	the market for the common stock will be limited, which could drive down the market price of our common stock and reduce the liquidity
	of the shares of our common stock and a stockholder's ability to resell shares of our common stock at all or at current market
	prices, which could increase a stockholder's risk of losing some or all of her investment.



	 




	IF QUOTED, THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE VOLATILE; YOU
	MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR SHARES AT OR ABOVE THE ACQUISITION PRICE



	 


	Even if our shares are quoted for trading on the Over-the-Counter
	Bulletin Board following this offering and a public market develops for our common stock, the market price of our common stock
	may be volatile. It may fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors:


	 


	* variations in quarterly operating results;


	* our announcements of significant progress and achievement of milestones;


	* our relationships with other companies or capital commitments;


	* additions or departures of key personnel;


	* sales of common stock or termination of stock transfer restrictions;


	* changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, if any;
	and


	* fluctuations in stock market price and volume.


	 


	Your inability to sell your shares during a decline in the price
	of our stock may increase losses that you may suffer as a result of your investment.

	SINCE WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY ANY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON SHARES,
	STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD RELY ON STOCK APPRECIATION FOR ANY RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT



	 


	We have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock since
	inception; we do not anticipate paying any such dividends for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, holders of our common stock
	will have to rely on capital appreciation, if any, to earn a return on their investment in our common stock.




	 






	ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES OF OUR SECURITIES MAY RESULT IN IMMEDIATE
	DILUTION TO EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS



	 


	We plan to raise additional capital in order to expand our business.
	Our most likely source of additional capital will be through the sale of additional shares of common stock. We are authorized to
	issue up to 75,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 25,000,000 shares of common stock are currently issued and outstanding.
	Our Board of Directors has the authority over issuing additional shares of common, and to determine the rights, preferences and
	privilege of such shares, without consent of any of our stockholders. We may issue shares in connection with financing arrangements
	or otherwise. Any such issuances will result in immediate dilution to our existing shareholders' interests, which will negatively
	affect the value of your shares.



	 




	WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL RISKS RESULTING FROM NEW REQUIREMENTS
	UNDER SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002



	 


	Pursuant to Section 404 of the SOX Act, we will be required to include
	in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting once this registration
	statement becomes effective and we commence filing financial reports with the Securities & Exchange Commission. We expect to
	incur additional expenses and diversion of management's time as a result of performing the system and process evaluation, testing
	and remediation required in order to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements.


	 


	We currently do not have a sufficient number of employees to segregate
	responsibilities and may be unable to afford increasing our staff or engaging outside consultants. During the course of our testing,
	we may identify other deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the SOX Act Section
	404. As such standards are modified, supplemented or amended; it may be difficult to ensure effective internal controls over financial
	reporting. Effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable
	financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent
	fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information,
	and the trading price of our common stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly.



	 




	THE OFFERING PRICE HAS BEEN ARBITRARILY SET BY COMPANY; YOU MAY
	NOT REALIZE A RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT UPON RESALE OF YOUR SHARES



	 


	The offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the
	Company's shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any
	other objective criteria of value. Additionally, as the Company was formed on November 22, 2016 and has only a limited operating
	history and the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings and no investment banker, appraiser or other independent
	third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the
	shares, as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common
	stock.

	CAUTIONARY DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
	STATEMENTS



	 


	This Prospectus contains forward-looking statements and information
	relating to our business that are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions made by us or based upon information currently available
	to us. These statements reflect our current views and assumptions with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
	Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: "believe," "expect," "estimate," "anticipate,"

	cases, you can also identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may", "will", "should",
	"plans", "predicts", "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other
	comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors,
	including the risks in the section entitled "Risk Factors" that may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels
	of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or
	achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In addition, you are directed to factors discussed in the
	"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation" section, and the section entitled
	"Description of Our Business", as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Prospectus. Other factors include, among
	others: general economic and business conditions; industry capacity; industry trends; competition; changes in business strategy
	or development plans; project performance; availability, terms, and deployment of capital; and availability of qualified personnel.


	 


	These forward-looking statements are relevant as of the date of
	this Prospectus. We believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, we cannot
	guarantee future results, levels of activity, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws
	of the United States, we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any update or revisions of any of the
	forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or to conform these statements to actual
	results.




	 








	USE OF PROCEEDS



	 



	The principal purposes of
	our initial public offering are to create a public market for our common stock and thereby enable future access to the public equity
	markets by us and our employees, obtain additional capital, and facilitate an orderly distribution of shares for the selling stockholders.
	We intend to use the net proceeds to us from our initial public offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes;
	however, we do not have any specific uses of the net proceeds planned.



	 


	Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum
	number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per share is $2.00. There is no assurance
	that we will raise the full $2,000,000 as anticipated. The Company current has $0 cash on hand and will not be able to pay meet
	all anticipated expenses for at least twelve months without the funds raised in this Offering.

	DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE



	 


	There is no established market for our stock. The offering price
	of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings,
	or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering
	price, we took into consideration our capital structure and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plans.
	Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of our securities.



	 






	MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER
	MATTERS



	 


	Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this
	Prospectus forms a part, we intend to seek a market maker to file an application with the FINRA to have our stock quoted on the
	OTC Bulletin Board. However, we cannot assure you that our shares will be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or, if quoted, that
	a public market will materialize.


	 


	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules that regulate
	broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price
	of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided
	that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or quotation
	system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk
	disclosure document prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, that:


	 




	a.




	contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks
	in both public offerings and secondary trading;






	b.




	contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the
	rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the securities
	laws;






	c.




	contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and
	ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price;






	d.




	contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions;






	e.




	defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading
	in penny stocks; and






	f.




	contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type, size
	and format, as the Securities and Exchange Commission shall require by rule or regulation.




	 


	The broker or dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction
	in a penny stock, the customer with:


	 




	(a)




	bid and offer quotations for the penny stock;






	(b)




	the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction;






	(c)




	the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information
	relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and






	(d)




	a monthly account statement showing the market value of each penny stock held in the
	customer's account.




	 


	In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction
	in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny
	stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure
	statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a suitably written statement.


	 


	These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the
	trading activity in the secondary market for our stock. Therefore, if our common stock becomes subject to the penny stock rules,
	stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities.

	SECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION
	PLANS



	 


	We do not have any securities authorized for issuance under any
	equity compensation plans.


	 



	PENNY STOCK REGULATION



	 


	The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define "penny
	stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of
	less than $5.00 per share. Such securities are subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers
	who sell them. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the
	purchaser of such securities and have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally,
	for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a disclosure
	schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to
	both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the
	sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer presumed control over the market. Finally, among
	other requirements, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account
	and information on the limited market in penny stocks. As the Shares immediately following this Offering will likely be subject
	to such penny stock rules, purchasers in this Offering will in all likelihood find it more difficult to sell their Shares in the
	secondary market.




	 








	DIVIDEND POLICY



	 


	We have not paid any cash dividends to shareholders. The declaration
	of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of Directors and depends upon our earnings, if any, our capital
	requirements and financial position, general economic conditions, and other pertinent conditions. It is our present intention not
	to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in our business operations.



	 






	DILUTION



	 


	Dilution represents the difference between the offering price and
	the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that
	results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary
	determination of the offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result
	of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders.


	 


	In this offering, the level of dilution is increased as a
	result of the relatively low book value of YXX's presently issued and outstanding stock. This is due to the shares of common
	stock issued to the Company's officers and directors totaling 25,000,000 shares at $0.001 per share for $20,000.00 cash (and
	$5,000 recorded as a subscription payable), versus the current offering price of $2.00 per share.


	 


	The Company's net tangible book value on January 31, 2017 was $0
	or approximately $0 per share, based upon 25,000,000 shares outstanding. Upon completion of this offering, but without taking into
	account any change in the net tangible book value after completion of this offering other than that resulting from the sale of
	the shares and receipt of the total proceeds of $2,000,000, the net tangible book value of the 26,000,000 shares to be outstanding
	will be $2,000,000 or approximately $0.08 per share.

	DILUTION TABLE



	 


	The price of the current offering is fixed at $2.00 per common share.
	This price is significantly higher than the price paid by our Directors and Officers for common equity since the Company's inception
	on November 22, 2016.


	 


	Our Officers and Directors invested $20,000 in November 2016, paying
	$0.001 per share for 25,000,000 common shares, with $5,000 being recorded as a subscription receivable.


	 


	 


	Assuming completion of the offering, there will be up to 26,000,000
	common shares outstanding. The following table illustrates the per common share dilution that may be experienced by investors at

	TERMS OF THE OFFERING



	 


	This Prospectus Offering consists of a) a total of 1,000,000 shares
	(the "Shares") of our common stock on a "self-underwritten" basis at a fixed price of $2.00 per share. The
	Company is offering our shares at a fixed price of $2.00 for the duration of the offering. There is no minimum for this Offering.
	The Offering will commence promptly on the date upon which this prospectus is declared effective by the SEC and will continue for
	180 days. At the discretion of our board of directors, we may discontinue the offering before expiration of the 180 day period
	or extend the offering for up to 180 days following the expiration of the 180 day offering period. We will pay all expenses incurred
	in this offering. We are an “emerging growth company” under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules and
	will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.


	 


	The offering of the 1,000,000 shares is a “best efforts”
	offering, which means that our Officers and Directors will use their best efforts to sell the common stock and there is no commitment
	by any person to purchase any shares. The shares will be offered at a fixed price of $2.00 per share for the duration of the offering.
	The shares will be sold at the fixed price until the common stock becomes quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, OTCQX, OTCQB or listed
	on a securities exchange. There is no minimum number of shares required to be sold to close the offering, therefore the net proceeds
	may range between $0 and $2,000,000. Proceeds from the sale of the shares will be used to fund the initial stages of our business
	development. We have not made any arrangements to place funds received from share subscriptions in an escrow, trust or similar
	account. Any funds raised from the offering will be immediately available to us for our immediate use. We have agreed to bear all
	of the expenses incurred in connection with the registration of these shares.


	 


	This is a direct participation offering since
	we are offering the stock directly to the public without the participation of an underwriter. Our Officers and Directors will be
	solely responsible for selling shares under this offering for the Company and no commission will be paid on any sales. The Selling
	Shareholders will be responsible for selling their own shares. 


	 



	PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBSCRIPTION



	 


	If you decide to subscribe for any shares in this offering, you
	will be required to execute a Subscription Agreement and tender it, together with a check or certified funds to us. Subscriptions,
	once received by the company, are irrevocable.

	or in part, for any reason or for no reason. All monies from rejected subscriptions will be returned immediately by us to the subscriber,

	SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE RESALE




	 




	GENERAL



	 


	There is no public market for our common stock. We cannot predict
	the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale
	will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could
	adversely affect the market prices of our common stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through the sale of
	our equity securities.


	 


	Upon completion of this offering, based on our outstanding shares
	as of April 5, 2017, we will have outstanding an aggregate of 26,000,000 shares of our common stock. Of these shares, upon effectiveness
	of the registration statement of which this Prospectus forms a part, the 1,000,000 shares covered hereby will be freely transferable
	without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act.


	 


	The remaining 25,000,000 restricted shares of common stock
	to be outstanding are owned by our Officers and Directors, known as our "affiliate," and may not be resold in the public
	market except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or under an exemption under Rule 144 or Regulation
	S under the Securities Act, if available, or otherwise.








	INTERESTS OF NAMED EXPERTS AND COUNSEL

	or certified any part of this Prospectus or having given an opinion upon the validity of the securities being registered or upon
	other legal matters in connection with the registration or offering of the common stock was employed on a contingency basis, or
	had, or is to receive, in connection with the offering, a substantial interest exceeding $50,000 directly or indirectly, in the
	Company or any of its parents or subsidiaries nor was any such person connected with YI XI XIN, INC. or any of its parents or subsidiaries
	as a promoter, managing or principal underwriter, voting trustee, Director, Officer, or employee.



	 






	EXPERTS



	 


	Anton & Chia, LLP, our independent registered public accounting
	firm, has audited our financial statements included in this Prospectus and registration statement to the extent and for the periods
	set forth in their audit report.




	 








	LEGAL MATTERS




	 




	RULE 144 SHARES



	 


	Currently, none of our securities may be resold pursuant to Rule
	144.


	 


	The securities sold in this offering can only be resold through
	registration under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 4(1), if available, for non-affiliates or by meeting the conditions
	of Rule 144(i). A holder of our securities may not rely on the safe harbor from being deemed statutory underwriter under Section
	2(11) of the Securities Act, as provided by Rule 144, to resell his or her securities. "Form 10 information" is, generally
	speaking, the same type of information as we are required to disclose in this Prospectus, but without an offering of securities.


	 


	Matheau J. W. Stout, Esq. has opined on the validity of the shares
	of common stock being offered hereby.


	 


	Instruction 1 to Item 509 of Regulation S-K requires disclosing
	whether the interest of any expert or counsel named in the Prospectus exceeds $50,000. The interest of any expert or counsel named
	in the Prospectus does not exceed $50,000 according to Instruction 1 Item 509 of Regulation S-K.

	DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS




	 




	OVERVIEW



	 


	We were incorporated on November 22, 2016 in the State of Nevada.
	We have never been involved in any reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets
	nor have we ever declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or been involved in any legal action or proceedings.



	 




	EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY STATUS



	 


	Because we generated less than $1 billion in total annual gross
	revenues during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an "emerging growth company" under the Jumpstart
	Our Business Startups ("JOBS") Act.


	 


	We will lose our emerging growth company status on the earliest
	occurrence of any of the following events:


	 




	1.




	on the last day of any fiscal year in which we earn at least $1 billion in total annual
	gross revenues, which amount is adjusted for inflation every five years;






	2.




	on the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of
	the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement;






	3.




	on the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than
	$1 billion in non-convertible debt; or






	4.




	the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a `large accelerated filer', as defined
	in section 240.12b-2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto."




	 


	A "large accelerated filer" is an issuer that, at the
	end of its fiscal year, meets the following conditions:


	 




	1.




	it has an aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and non-voting common equity
	held by its non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of the issuer's most recently completed second
	fiscal quarter;






	2.




	It has been subject to the requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act for a
	period of at least twelve calendar months; and






	3.




	It has filed at least one annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
	Act.




	 


	As an emerging growth company, exemptions from the following provisions
	are available to us:


	 




	1.




	Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires auditor attestation
	of internal controls;






	2.




	Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require companies
	to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation;






	3.




	Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires
	companies to disclose the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the company;






	4.




	Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act (which has not yet been implemented), which
	requires companies to disclose the ratio between the annual total compensation of the CEO and the median of the annual total compensation
	of all employees of the companies; and






	5.




	The requirement to provide certain other executive compensation disclosure under Item
	402 of Regulation S-K. Instead, an emerging growth company must only comply with the more limited provisions of Item 402 applicable
	to smaller reporting companies, regardless of the issuer's size.




	 


	Pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company
	may choose to forgo such exemption and instead comply with the requirements that apply to an issuer that is not an emerging growth
	company. We have elected under this section of the JOBS Act to maintain our status as an emerging growth company and take advantage
	of the JOBS Act provisions relating to complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act.

	COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS



	 


	We do not presently have a separately constituted audit committee,
	compensation committee, nominating committee, executive committee or any other committees of our Board of Directors. Nor do we
	have an audit committee "financial expert." As such, our entire Board of Directors acts as our audit committee and handles
	matters related to compensation and nominations of Directors.




	 






	POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST



	 


	Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised
	of independent Directors, such functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our Officers and Directors.
	Thus, there is an inherent conflict of interest.



	 




	DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE



	 


	As of the date of this Registration Statement filed on Form S-1,
	we have no independent Directors.



	 




	SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYEES



	 


	We have no significant employees other than the executive Officers
	described earlier.



	 






	INVOLVEMENT IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



	 


	No Director, person nominated to become a Director, Executive Officer,
	promoter or control person of our company has, during the last ten years: (i) been convicted in or is currently subject to a pending
	a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (ii) been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial
	or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or
	final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to any federal or state securities or
	banking or commodities laws including, without limitation, in any way limiting involvement in any business activity, or finding
	any violation with respect to such law, nor (iii) any bankruptcy petition been filed by or against the business of which such person
	was an executive Officer or a general partner, whether at the time of the bankruptcy or for the two years prior thereto.



	 




	STOCKHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD



	 


	We have not implemented a formal policy or procedure by which our
	stockholders can communicate directly with our Board of Directors. Nevertheless, every effort will be made to ensure that the views
	of stockholders are heard by the Board of Directors, and that appropriate responses are provided to stockholders in a timely manner.
	During the upcoming year, our Board will continue to monitor whether it would be appropriate to adopt such a process.

	EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION



	 


	Since our incorporation on November 22, 2016, we have not compensated
	and have no arrangements to compensate our Officers and Directors for their services. However, we anticipate that our Officers
	and Directors will receive compensation from the Company once cash flow that we generate from operations significantly exceeds
	our total expenses. We have not granted any stock options to anyone; there are no stock option, retirement, pension, or profit
	sharing plans for the benefit of our Officers and Directors; we have not entered into any employment or consulting agreements with

	SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL
	OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT



	 


	On November 23, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares
	of our common stock to our sole Officer and Director for aggregate consideration of $25,000, with $20,000 being paid in cash and
	$5,000.00 being recorded as a subscription receivable.


	 


	The following table sets forth the information regarding the beneficial
	ownership of our common stock as of April 5, 2017 for our Officers and Directors. There is no other person or group of affiliated
	persons, known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our common stock.


	 


	We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules
	of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess
	sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities. The person is also deemed to be a beneficial
	owner of any security of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Unless otherwise indicated,
	the person identified in this table has sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned
	by her, subject to applicable community property laws.


	 


	The percentage ownership information shown in the table below is
	calculated based on 25,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of April 5, 2017. We do not have any outstanding
	options, warrants or other securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common stock.


	 


	All figures in this table assume the issuance and subsequent disposition
	of all shares. As represented to us by the Selling Shareholders, none of the Selling Shareholders are broker-dealers or affiliates
	of broker-dealers. The percentage in the column “Percentage of Share Owned Before Offering” was calculated by dividing
	the total number of shares owned prior to offering by the total issued and outstanding number of shares prior to the offering equivalent
	to 25,000,000shares as of April 5, 2017.

	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
	Act of 1933, as amended, may be permitted to our Directors, Officers or persons controlling us, we have been advised that it is

	MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS



	 


	You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial
	condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial
	information included elsewhere in this Prospectus. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth
	elsewhere in this Prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing,
	includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the "Risk Factors" section
	of this Prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results
	described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.


	 


	Our cash balance was $0as of January 31, 2017. We have been utilizing
	funds received from our Officers and Directors in the form of loans and the purchase of shares. Being a development stage company,
	we have very limited operating history. After twelve months period we may need additional financing, for which we currently don't
	have any arrangements. We do not currently have an office in the United States but our address for service of process in Nevada
	is

	1805 N. Carson Street, Suite X Carson City, NV 89701.

	Our principal executive office
	is located at 28 Xibahe Xili, Building B-30A, Chaoyang, Beijing, China 100028.


	 


	We generated revenues of $0 up to January 31, 2017.


	 


	In order to fund our planned operations, we are attempting to raise
	money from this offering. We believe that we will be able to raise enough money through this offering to expand our proposed operations.
	At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering.


	 


	We are an "emerging growth company" as defined in the
	JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public
	companies that are not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited to: not required to comply with the auditor
	attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation
	in our periodic reports and proxy statements; exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual non-binding advisory vote on
	executive compensation and nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.


	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an "emerging
	growth company" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act
	for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an "emerging growth company" can delay the adoption
	of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have taken advantage of the
	extended transition period provided by Section 107 of the JOBS Act and that the election is irrevocable.

	As of January 31, 2017, the Company had $0 cash and liabilities
	of $0. The Company has a cash balance of $0 and thus no available capital reserves. Without raising capital through this Offering,
	the Company will be unable to remain operational for at least a year.


	 


	Since inception, we have sold 25,000,000 shares of common stocks
	to our sole Officer and Director, at a price of $0.001 per share, for aggregate amount of $25,000, with $20,000 being paid in cash
	and $5,000 being recorded as a subscription receivable.


	 



	LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY



	 


	We have no historical financial information upon which to base an
	evaluation of our performance. We are in a start-up operation stages and have generated revenues of $0. We cannot guarantee we
	will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business
	enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.

	DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION

	FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES



	 


	The Nevada General Corporation Law requires to indemnify Officers
	and Directors for any expenses incurred by any Officer or Director in connection with any actions or proceedings, whether civil,
	criminal, administrative, or investigative, brought against such Officer or Director because of his or her status as an Officer
	or Director, to the extent that the Director or Officer has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of the action
	or proceeding. The Nevada General Corporation Law permits a corporation to indemnify an Officer or Director, even in the absence
	of an agreement to do so, for expenses incurred in connection with any action or proceeding if such Officer or Director acted in
	good faith and in a manner in which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation
	and such indemnification is authorized by the stockholders, by a quorum of disinterested Directors, by independent legal counsel
	in a written opinion authorized by a majority vote of a quorum of Directors consisting of disinterested Directors, or by independent
	legal counsel in a written opinion if a quorum of disinterested Directors cannot be obtained.


	 


	The Nevada General Corporation Law prohibits indemnification of
	a Director or Officer if a final adjudication establishes that the Officer's or Director's acts or omissions involved intentional
	misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation of the law and were material to the cause of action. Despite the foregoing limitations
	on indemnification, the Nevada General Corporation Law may permit an Officer or Director to apply to the court for approval of
	indemnification even if the Officer or Director is adjudged to have committed intentional misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation
	of the law.


	 


	The Nevada General Corporation Law also provides that indemnification
	of Directors is not permitted for the unlawful payment of distributions, except for those Directors registering their dissent to
	the payment of the distribution.


	 


	According to Article 11 of our Bylaws, we are authorized to indemnify
	our Directors to the fullest extent authorized under Nevada law subject to certain specified limitations. 


	  


	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
	Act may be provided to Directors, Officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed
	that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore,
	unenforceable.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
	FIRM




	 



	To the Board of Directors


	 


	Yi Xi Xin, Inc.


	28 Xibahe Xili,Building B-30A, 

	Chaoyang, Beijing, China 100028 




	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
	of Yi Xi Xin, Inc. (the “Company”) as of January 31, 2017 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders’
	equity and cash flows for the period from November 22, 2016 (Inception) to January 31, 2017. These financial statements are the
	responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
	on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with
	standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
	audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company was
	not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included
	consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
	circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Company’s internal control over financial
	reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
	and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
	made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred
	to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2017 and the results
	of its operations and its cash flows for the period from November 22, 2016 (Inception) to January 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, these
	conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these
	matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
	classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be
	unable to continue as a going concern.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	JANUARY 31, 2017






	 






	NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS




	 



	Yi xi Xin, Inc. (the
	“Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 22, 2016. The Company is in the development stage, and
	was formed in order to market the Patent per Patent License which provides the Company with the right to market Chinese Patent
	No. Zl20152051857.2 (the “Licensed Patent”) for a period of Five (5) Years beginning on January 1, 2017.


	 



	NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 




	Development Stage Company




	 


	The Company is considered to be in the development
	stage as defined in ASC 915 “

	Development Stage Entities.

	” The Company is devoting substantially all of its efforts
	to the development of its business plans. The Company has elected to adopt early application of Accounting Standards Update No.
	2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements; and does not present
	or disclose inception-to-date information and other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915.


	 




	Basis of Presentation




	 


	The accounting and reporting policies of the
	Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).


	 




	Use of estimates




	 


	The preparation of financial statements in
	conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
	and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues
	and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 




	Start-Up Costs




	 


	In accordance with ASC 720, “

	Start-up Costs”,

	the Company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the start-up and organization of the Company.


	 




	Cash




	 


	Cash includes cash in banks, money market funds,
	and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception, which are readily convertible to known
	amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	JANUARY 31, 2017





	 





	NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)





	 






	Income Taxes






	 




	The Company accounts for income taxes
	using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. The asset and
	liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of
	temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax
	credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that
	will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred
	tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. As of January 31, 2017, the Company did not
	have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.


	 




	Fair Value Measurements




	The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic
	820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, which  defines fair value as used in numerous accounting
	pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements.


	 


	The estimated fair value of certain financial
	instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because
	of the short-term nature of these instruments.


	 


	ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange
	price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
	market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes
	a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
	inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:


	 


	Level 1 — quoted
	prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities


	 


	Level 2 — quoted
	prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable


	 


	Level 3 — inputs
	that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)


	 


	The Company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on
	a recurring basis.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	JANUARY 31, 2017




	 




	NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN



	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
	normal course of business.  The Company has not generated any revenues since inception and sustained a net loss of $20,000
	for the period from inception (November 22, 2016) to January 31, 2017. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about
	the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.  The Company’s continuation
	as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to generate revenues and its ability to obtain capital from
	third parties.  No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.


	 


	The financial statements do not include any
	adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities
	that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.



	 






	NOTE 4 - INCOME TAXES



	 


	The reconciliation of income tax benefit at the U.S. statutory rate
	of 34% for the period from inception to January 31, 2017 to the Company’s effective tax rate is as follows:


	 





	Income tax expense at statutory rate



	 



	$




	(6,800




	)






	Change in valuation allowance



	 


	 



	6,800



	 





	Income tax expense



	 


	 



	$                              -

	)




	 





	 


	The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the Company’s
	net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2014 are as follows:






	 


	 


	 


	 


	 





	Net Operating Loss



	 



	$




	6,800



	 





	Valuation allowance



	 


	 



	(6,800




	)






	Net deferred tax asset



	 


	 



	$                             -

	)




	 





	 


	The Company has approximately $20,000 of net
	operating losses (“NOL”) carried forward to offset taxable income, if any, in future years which expire commencing
	in fiscal 2037. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that
	some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be




	 




	 




	realized. The ultimate realization of
	deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
	differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future
	taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a
	full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely
	than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

	UNDERTAKINGS



	 


	The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:


	 


	(a)(1) To file, during any period in which
	offers or sales of securities are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement to:


	 


	(i) Include any Prospectus required by Section
	10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;


	 


	(ii) To reflect in the Prospectus any facts
	or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof)
	which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement.
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities
	offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering
	range may be reflected in the form of Prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 383(b) (ss.230.383(b) of this chapter)
	if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price
	set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration statement.


	 


	(iii) To include any material information
	with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to
	such information in the registration statement;


	 


	(2) That, for the purpose of determining any
	liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement
	relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial
	bona fide offering thereof.


	 


	(3) To remove from registration by means of
	a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.


	 


	(4) That, for the purpose of determining liability
	under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:


	 


	(i) If the registrant is subject to Rule 430C,
	each Prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 383(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration
	statements relying on Rule 430B or other than Prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included
	in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in
	a registration statement or Prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed
	incorporated by reference into the registration statement or Prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to
	a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration
	statement or Prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date
	of first use.


	 


	(5) That, for the purpose of determining liability
	of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned
	registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement,
	regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such
	purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will
	be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: 


	 




	II -

	3








	Table of Contents

	 





	(i) Any preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus
	of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 383;


	 


	(ii) Any free writing Prospectus relating to
	the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;


	 


	(iii)The portion of any other free writing
	Prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or our securities provided
	by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and


	 


	(iv) Any other communication that is an offer
	in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.


	 


	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities
	arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") may be permitted to our Directors, Officers and controlling persons
	pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against
	public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable.


	 


	In the event that a claim for indemnification
	against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our Directors, Officers, or controlling
	persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our Directors, Officers, or controlling
	persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled
	by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public
	policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	Section 7 - Proxies: (Section 78.355)


	Each shareholder entitled to vote or to express consent or

	by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, a facsimile signature, or by his attorneyin-fact there unto duly authorized
	in writing. Every proxy shall be revocable at will unless the proxy conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and the proxy is
	coupled with an interest. A telegram, telex, cablegram, or similar transmission by the shareholder, or a photographic, photostatic,
	facsimile, shall be treated as a valid proxy, and treated as a substitution of the original proxy, so long as such transmission
	is a complete reproduction executed by the shareholder. If it is determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission
	is valid, the persons appointed by the Corporation to count the votes of shareholders and determine the validity of proxies and
	ballots or other persons making those determinations must specify the information upon which they relied. No proxy shall be valid

	be exhibited to the Secretary at the meeting and shall be filed with the records of the Corporation. If any shareholder designates
	two or more persons to act as proxies, a majority of those persons present at the meeting, or, if one is present, then that one

	Corporation, except however if a different proportion of voting power is required by law, the Articles of Incorporation or
	these Bylaws, than that proportion of written consents is required. Such written consents must be filed with the minutes of
	the proceedings of the shareholders of the Corporation.

	permitted by law, of scrip in registered or bearer form over the manual or facsimile signature of an officer or agent of the Corporation

	any rights of shareholder, except as therein provided. The scrip may contain provisions or conditions that the Corporation deems
	advisable. If a scrip ceases to be exchangeable for full share certificates, the shares that would otherwise have been issuable
	as provided on the scrip are deemed to be treasury shares unless the scrip contains other provisions for their disposition.

	Ping Zhou


	Chief Executive Officer


	YI XI XIN, INC.


	 


	Re:           Registration
	Statement on Form S-1 (the "Registration Statement")


	 


	Ping Zhou:


	 


	I have acted as counsel
	to YI XI XIN, INC. (the "Company") in connection with its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of a Registration
	Statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration Statement”), pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”).
	The Registration Statement relates to the proposed sale of up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock held by the Company (the “Shares”).


	 


	In connection therewith,
	I have examined and relied upon original, certified, conformed, photostat or other copies of (a) the Articles of Incorporation
	and Bylaws of the Company; (b) Resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company; (c) the Registration Statement and the exhibits
	thereto; and (d) such corporate records of the Company, certificates of public officials, certificates of officers of the Company
	and other documents, agreements and instruments as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions herein contained.


	 


	In all such examinations,
	I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures on original documents, and the conformity to originals or certified documents
	of all copies submitted to us as conformed, photostat or other copies. In passing upon certain corporate records and documents
	of the Company, I have necessarily assumed the correctness and completeness of the statements made or included therein by the Company
	as to all matters of fact, and I express no opinion thereon.


	 


	Based on my examination
	mentioned above, I am of the opinion that the Shares, when issued, will be legally and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.


	 


	I am an attorney admitted
	to practice in Maryland. I am familiar with the applicable provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes, the applicable provisions
	of the Nevada Constitution and reported judicial decisions interpreting these laws, and I have made such inquiries with respect
	thereto as I consider necessary to render this opinion with respect to a Nevada corporation. This opinion letter is opining upon
	and is limited to the current federal securities laws of the United States and, Nevada law, including the statutory provisions,
	all applicable provisions of the Nevada Constitution and reported judicial decisions interpreting those laws, as such laws presently
	exist and to the facts as they presently exist. I express no opinion with respect to the effect or applicability of the laws of
	any other jurisdiction.


	 


	I hereby consent to the
	filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to my firm under the caption "Legal

	AS AMENDED (“THE SECURITIES ACT”)) AND WITHOUT REGISTRATION WITH THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

	(10)           The
	undersigned consents to the Company making a notation on its records or giving instructions to any transfer agent of the Company
	in order to implement the restrictions on transfer of the Shares set forth in this Section 2.


	 


	(k)           

	Accredited
	Investor

	.  The undersigned is an “accredited investor” as that term is defined in Rule 501 of the General
	Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act by reason of Rule 501(a)(3).


	 


	(l)           

	Potential
	Loss of Investment; Risk Factors

	.  The undersigned understands that an investment in the Shares is a speculative
	investment which involves a high degree of risk and the potential loss of his entire investment. The undersigned understands
	that the following factors, among others, could cause the loss of any or all of his investment.


	 


	(1)           The
	Company is a development stage company with no operating history for the undersigned to evaluate its business.  The Company
	was incorporated in the State of Nevada in October 2015, and as a result is only in the very early stages of development.  Because
	the Company has no operating history, it is difficult to evaluate its business and future prospects.  The undersigned
	has also considered the uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by companies, such as the Company, in their early
	stages of development.  The Company’s revenue and income potential is non-existent and its business model is still
	emerging.  If its business model does not prove to be profitable, the undersigned may lose all of his investment.


	 


	(2)           The
	Company currently does not have enough working capital to satisfy its capital needs.  The Company is dependent upon its
	management team to fund its ongoing operations, and cannot be certain that future financing will be available to it on acceptable
	terms when it needs it.  The Company can give no assurances that it will be able to sell any portion of this offering
	or that management will continue to fund its ongoing operations.  This, along with the possibility of other factors and
	circumstances the Company cannot predict, may require it to seek additional financing faster than anticipated.  If the
	Company is unable to obtain financing to meet its needs, the undersigned may lose of his investment. 


	 


	(3)           The
	Company’s officers and directors will only devote a limited amount of time to the Company.  Their divided interests
	may hinder the Company's ability to generate revenue.  This could result in missed business opportunities and worse-than-expected
	operating results.  The undersigned may lose his entire investment.


	 


	(m)           

	Investment
	Commitment

	.  The undersigned's overall commitment to investments which are not readily marketable is not disproportionate
	to the undersigned's net worth, and an investment in the Shares will not cause such overall commitment to become excessive.


	 


	(n)           

	Receipt
	of Information

	.  The undersigned has received all documents, records, books and other information pertaining to the
	undersigned’s investment in the Company that has been requested by the undersigned.


	 


	(o)           

	Investor
	Questionnaire

	.  The undersigned represents and warrants to the Company that all information that the undersigned
	has provided to the Company, including, without limitation, the information in the Investor Questionnaire attached hereto or previously
	provided to the Company (the “Investor Questionnaire”), is correct and complete as of the date hereof.


	 




	-

	5

	-









	(p)           

	No
	Reliance

	.  Other than as set forth herein, the undersigned is not relying upon any other information, representation
	or warranty by the Company or any officer, director, stockholder, agent or representative of the Company in determining to invest
	in the Shares.  The undersigned has consulted, to the extent deemed appropriate by the undersigned, with the undersigned’s
	own advisers as to the financial, tax, legal and related matters concerning an investment in the Shares and on that basis believes
	that his or its investment in the Shares is suitable and appropriate for the undersigned.


	 


	(q)           

	No
	Governmental Review

	.  The undersigned is aware that no federal or state agency has (i) made any finding or determination
	as to the fairness of this investment, (ii) made any recommendation or endorsement of the Shares or the Company, or (iii) guaranteed
	or insured any investment in the Shares or any investment made by the Company.


	 


	(r)           

	Price
	of Shares

	.  The undersigned understands that the price of the Shares offered hereby bear no relation to the assets,
	book value or net worth of the Company and were determined arbitrarily by the Company.  The undersigned further understands
	that there is a substantial risk of further dilution on his or its investment in the Company.

	Exemption
	from Registration; Valid Issuances

	be duly and validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable. Neither the sales of the Shares pursuant to, nor the Company's performance
	of its obligations under, this Agreement shall (a) result in the creation or imposition of any liens, charges, claims or other
	encumbrances upon the Shares or any of the assets of the Company, or (b) entitle the other holders of the Common Stock of the Company
	to preemptive or other rights to subscribe to or acquire the Common Stock or other securities of the Company. The Shares shall
	not subject the undersigned to personal liability by reason of the ownership thereof.


	 



	SECTION 5.

	Indemnity

	.  The
	undersigned agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers and directors, employees and its affiliates and their

	damage and expense whatsoever (including, but not limited to, any and all expenses whatsoever reasonably incurred in investigating,
	preparing or defending against any litigation commenced or threatened or any claim whatsoever) arising out of or based upon any
	false representation or warranty or breach or failure by the undersigned to comply with any covenant or agreement made by the undersigned
