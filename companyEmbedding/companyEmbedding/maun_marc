“It’s amazing! Literally, from the basement of my original Marc Anthony Salon came a line of professional hair products so renowned that they can now be found internationally. Marc Anthony products began because we wanted to ensure that all of our clients kept their salon-fresh look wherever they went. Our products are ultimately tailored to our clients’ needs. From curly hair products to create curly hair styles and frizz control, to hair thickening products to create high volume and hold, we have the right product for Your Hair, Your Way.”
“For a cut to sit well, hair has to be in great shape. Hair needs to move, be manageable and have shine to look amazing. That’s why Marc Anthony products have the highest caliber ingredients.”


“On top of working with some of the topmost chemists, our largest point of difference is how we test the products. Our salons are where each product passes or fails. Our International Team of celebrity hair stylists put each product through its paces. We stand behind our brands because we use them in our salons each and every day. That’s the Marc Anthony True Professional difference.”

- Marc Anthony

Whether you pushed the "snooze" button one too many times on your alarm and slept in or are hurrying to save time in the locker room or before a night out, dry shampoo is your solution!  Often times, when beating the clock, shampooing hair in the traditional method is just not an option.  A dry shampoo and the ease of use is a great suitable alternative solution.  Modern, busy women swear by dry shampoos!  When your hair appears greasy, it’s usually just the roots (close to the scalp) that need to be refreshed.  Dry shampoos work wonders at reviving your day-old style, soaking up oil, masking odours and amping up volume—no water required.  If you’re strapped for time and don’t have time to wash your hair and you need to freshen up your locks dry shampoo serves as a fantastic solution.
