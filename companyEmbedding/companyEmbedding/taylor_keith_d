Interests








Computer Programming
I thoroughly enjoy the creative process of thinking of an idea for a computer program and then turning it into reality. I started coding in high school and then during college when I designed computer educational games for children to help pay my tuition. Ever since, I’ve used coding to automate repetitive tasks and to solve mathematical problems, and to just have fun. 









History
I am constantly reading and now listening to (thanks to Audible) history books. I used to be a big science fiction fan. But, actual history is more amazing then anything we can make up. Some of my recent favorites, that I highly recommend: Freedom’s Forge How American Business Produced Victory in WW II by Arthur Herman, The Republic of Pirates by Colin Woodard, Disinformation by Prof Ronald J Rychlak, The Notorious Benedict Arnold by Steve Sheinkin. 









Travel
Life is an adventure, and nothing is more fun than exploring new places, meeting new people and seeing the beauty of nature and the history of human civilization. I especially love exploring large cities, with Tokyo and Moscow being my favorites.

Senior Counsel

Executive Profile

	Awards, Professional and Community Involvement	

	News, Media, and Speaking Engagements	




Keith D. Taylor focuses on the identification and control of risks. Mr. Taylor is a member of the American Board of Trial Advocates (ABOTA), the premier national advocacy group dedicated to the preservation of the right to trial by jury. Mr. Taylor’s trial experience includes general liability, products liability, premises liability, public entity liability, transportation liability (from bicycle to commercial motor vehicle), and catastrophic construction loss. Some of the catastrophic construction loss cases include the Academy of Motion Pictures Academy Awards scaffold collapse and the San Ysidro border crossing scaffold collapse.
Mr. Taylor’s practice also includes hospitality risk identification and
control of such risk. Mr. Taylor’s experience in this regard is assessing and solving his clients general liability claims associated with the restaurant and hotel industry from slip and fall matters to food borne illness and security. In particular, Cardona v. Pic N Save was a case venued in the Los Angeles Superior Court where the plaintiff’s misstep immediately outside at a local restaurant establishment resulted in full amputation of the entire leg along with a $7 million dollar demand. At trial, Mr. Taylor motioned the court for an order to allow the transport of the entire jury to the location of the plaintiff’s fall. That motion was granted and the jury was taken to view the area of the plaintiff’s fall. The jury determined that the area was “open and obvious” and the plaintiff received zero.
Mr. Taylor was also responsible for a summary judgment in a traumatic brain injury case versus a formidable plaintiff’s bar attorney. This case was covered by national and local media, which involved counsel’s settlement prior to the reading of the jury’s quick verdict and plaintiff counsel’s subsequent retraction of the settlement after learning that the jury intended to award $9.4 million to his client, who had jumped from an ambulance at freeway speeds. He has frequently been called upon in cases of catastrophic loss as a member of major case unit panel.
Mr. Taylor has more than thirty years of experience in the defense of cases in both State and Federal courts throughout California.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.
