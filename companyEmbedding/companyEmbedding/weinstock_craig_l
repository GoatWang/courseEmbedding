							James Hackett


					
							Mr. James T. “Jim” Hackett is Independent Director of the Company. Mr. Hackett is a Partner at Riverstone Holdings, LLC, an energy focused private investment firm, based in New York. In connection with his work at Riverstone, Mr. Hackett is currently serving as the Chief Executive Officer and a director of Silver Run Acquisition Corporation II (“Silver Run II”), a special purpose acquisition corporation (or SPAC), that is sponsored by Riverstone, went public in March 2017 and is currently targeting opportunities in the energy industry. Silver Run II raised approximately $1 billion in its IPO and at least 90% of the offering proceeds are held in a trust account and invested in short-term U.S. government treasury bills pending completion of Silver Run II’s acquisition of a target business. If Silver Run II is unable to complete such an acquisition by March 2019, the offering proceeds will be returned to its stockholders. Currently, Silver Run II has no operations and no full-time employees. If Silver Run II does complete an acquisition, depending on the nature of the management team in place at the target business, Mr. Hackett may only serve as Silver Run II’s chairman going forward. Certain institutional investors and proxy advisory firms may vote against, or recommend a vote against, a chief executive officer who is serving as a director at his public company and as a director at more than two other public companies (and in some cases, more than just one other public company). Because of the unique circumstances applicable to a SPAC such as Silver Run II, which is relatively new and has not yet acquired any operating business, we believe that the traditional concerns regarding “overboarding” are not applicable to Mr. Hackett and, regardless, would be outweighed by Mr. Hackett’s contribution to our Board in light of his extraordinary qualifications.
