Impact Analytics specializes in communications channel architecture, getting the right message to the right person at the right time.  We’ll design the flow of your marketing content and map out the conversation and interaction that must happen with each destination, avoiding common pitfalls.

Product Strategies - Timing, sales trends, coordination with offline marketing, complementing publisher content, we can help you position your products so your audience is most likely to buy.
Channel Strategies - Communications channels are complex, some you control, others are free wheeling, each has a rhythm, each has expections from its user base.  The right strategy will amplify your message and perhaps even push it viral.  the wrong strategy will provide a money pit for your marketing dollars.   In fact, if you time your branding and retails messages badly, your competition will swoop in to take advantage of the awareness you've created. (And with good intel, you can do the same to them!!).
Sponsor Strategies - Sharing a demographic with your sponsor is important, but developing a compatible message can improve results dramatically.

Impulse Marketing



"Impulse Marketing" is simply finding and formatting an issue sufficiently compelling that one is motivated to take the desired action, e.g. leave their email address.  Political issues are often like this.  Crimes, people being treated unfairly, and other issues that have "legs" in the media can be effective (I saw over 300,000 emails acquired from a landing page discussing the firing of Don Imus). 
One key to impulse marketing is simply mechanical, the path from initial influence (display ad or other medium)  issue to result (thank you very much for signing up) must be as easy and short as possible, ideally all on a single page, with as few boxes to fill in as possible.  It's not as easy as it looks!

Revenue Generation for Publishers and Content Owners



if you are producing content  several times a week, whether original or as an aggregation of other people's work, that content is valuable to your readers.  But the value from the advertisers perspective is not in your content, but rather in the communications channels you provide and the number of people you ulimately reach.
Impact Analytics can substantially improve your profitability by increasing the inventory of ad space in media that is in demand.  We have built email lists in the millions and have worked with top web sites in increasing display advertising and optimizing profits.  And through our partnerships we can find markets for your inventory with the best sponsors on an ongoing basis.   Our email acquisition programs are innovative, powerful and effective taking advantage of the strength of the content and providing a one-to-one communications channel between you and your readers.
We can develop a complete online marketing and growth strategy, providing a channel strategy using enhanced marketing reach to drive social and mobile media (if that makes sense for you!).
One of our specialties during this election year is conservative media, appealing to conservative sponsors (including finance and health).  We have the immediate ability to create partnerships between fundraisers and publishers to the benefit of both.  Fundraisers can take advantage of an intimated the audience and the brand of the large scale publisher to get fresh fundraising leads, solicit volunteers, and build an audience base for the fundraisers message. 










 
Email Acquisition and Lead Generation



Impact Analytics has deep experience in acquiring email addresses using "impulse response" techniques.   Once the message is decided the method is entirely data driven.   We've collected millions of addresses on behalf of publishers, our methods have been white listed by Return Path and all major ISPs. 














We have the immediate ability to create partnerships between fundraisers and publishers, to the great benefit of both.  Fundraisers can take advantage of the brand of the large scale publisher and an intimate relationship with the publisher's audience and  to get fresh fundraising leads, solicit volunteers, and build an audience base for the fundraiser's message.
We can target a large audience of conservative web users (5 million) and email addresses (several million), then amplify your message and audience through social networks (Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter and more).
 We have proprietary techniques to identify contributors, enthusiasts and potential activists in any geographic region on a large scale and we can provide strategy to get the greatest impact. 










 
Email List Management



Our team has helped client deliver more than 4 Billion emails and manage over 18,000 email campaigns.  Yet even with some of the most aggressive marketing techniques in the industry, our delivery has averaged over 98% and we have maintained good standing with Return Path and the major ISPs.
We believe the purpose of an email is to reach customers and ultimately make you money.  Whether it's a customer loyalty program of high rollers to be treated with kid gloves or a high turnover lead list to generate short term revenue, we can structure your program to maximize effectiveness.
By the way, we also can provide product strategies based on our experience in bundling, incentivizing and timing to channel efficiency.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
