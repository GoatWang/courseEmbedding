History[edit]
The company was established in 1945 by Marvin Sands in the Finger Lakes region of New York as Canandaigua Industries, selling bulk wine to bottlers in the eastern United States[6]. In its first year, the company sold approximately 200,000 gallons of wine and had gross sales of $150,000.[7]
The company was incorporated as Canandaigua Wine Company, Inc. in 1972 and went public in 1973.[8] Marvin's son Richard Sands became president in 1993 and CEO in 1996.[6] In 1999, company founder Marvin Sands passed away following a brief illness.[6]
In 2000, the company changed its name to Constellation Brands, Inc. to reflect the scope of the company and its range of brands.[7] In 2007, Rob Sands was named president and CEO.[9]
In 2013, Constellation acquired Grupo Modelo's U.S. beer business from Anheuser-Busch InBev. The transaction included full ownership of Crown Imports LLC which provided Constellation with complete, independent control of all aspects of the U.S. commercial business; a brewery in Nava, Mexico; exclusive perpetual brand license in the U.S. to import, market and sell Corona and the Modelo brands and the freedom to develop brand extensions and innovations for the U.S. market.[9]
In 2014, Constellation finalized a joint venture with Owens-Illinois and completed the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch InBev's glass production plant, located adjacent to the company's brewery in Nava, Mexico.[10]
Wine fraud[edit]
In 2010, a French court in Carcassonne, France, convicted 12 wine traders and producers for selling fake Pinot noir wine to buyers in the US, amongst them Constellation, in a scheme that lasted from January 2006 to March 2008. Constellation later faced and settled a class action lawsuit because it "should have known" that the wine was fake.[11]
Acquisitions[edit]




Constellation Brands moved its headquarters to a 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2) building on 11 acres (4.5 ha) in Victor, New York in 2009


Constellation Brands has expanded by acquiring other drinks companies.
In 1987, the company purchased the Manischewitz winery in Canandaigua, New York, and continues to license the Manischewitz name from R.A.B. Foods.[12]
In 1998 it acquired Matthew Clark plc in the United Kingdom, and after selling off its cider business, the Gaymer Cider Company, sold half of the business to Punch Taverns. Acquisitions include BRL Hardy (Australia)[13] and Nobilo (New Zealand) in 2003; Robert Mondavi Corp. for $1 billion in 2004;[14] Vincor International, Canada's largest wine company, for $1.44 billion in 2006;[15] Spirits Marque One (owner of Svedka Vodka) in 2007;[16] and Beam Wines Estates, the wine operations of Fortune Brands (which included several major brands such as Clos du Bois) for $885 million in 2008.[17] The company later moved to a more premium wine portfolio, divesting Almaden Vineyards, Inglenook Winery, and the Paul Masson winery in Madera, California, in 2008,[18] and its value spirits portfolio to the Sazerac Company in 2009.[19]
In June 2013 the company, which formerly imported Corona and other Modelo brands to the United States, acquired the US rights to those brands as a part of an anti-trust settlement permitting Modelo's acquisition by Anheuser-Busch InBev, along with a brewery in Piedras Negras, Mexico. It now produces its own versions of those products for the US, with Modelo serving all other countries.
In December 2015, Constellation announced the $1 billion acquisition of Ballast Point Brewing of San Diego.

History[edit]
The company was established in 1945 by Marvin Sands in the Finger Lakes region of New York as Canandaigua Industries, selling bulk wine to bottlers in the eastern United States[6]. In its first year, the company sold approximately 200,000 gallons of wine and had gross sales of $150,000.[7]
The company was incorporated as Canandaigua Wine Company, Inc. in 1972 and went public in 1973.[8] Marvin's son Richard Sands became president in 1993 and CEO in 1996.[6] In 1999, company founder Marvin Sands passed away following a brief illness.[6]
In 2000, the company changed its name to Constellation Brands, Inc. to reflect the scope of the company and its range of brands.[7] In 2007, Rob Sands was named president and CEO.[9]
In 2013, Constellation acquired Grupo Modelo's U.S. beer business from Anheuser-Busch InBev. The transaction included full ownership of Crown Imports LLC which provided Constellation with complete, independent control of all aspects of the U.S. commercial business; a brewery in Nava, Mexico; exclusive perpetual brand license in the U.S. to import, market and sell Corona and the Modelo brands and the freedom to develop brand extensions and innovations for the U.S. market.[9]
In 2014, Constellation finalized a joint venture with Owens-Illinois and completed the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch InBev's glass production plant, located adjacent to the company's brewery in Nava, Mexico.[10]
Wine fraud[edit]
In 2010, a French court in Carcassonne, France, convicted 12 wine traders and producers for selling fake Pinot noir wine to buyers in the US, amongst them Constellation, in a scheme that lasted from January 2006 to March 2008. Constellation later faced and settled a class action lawsuit because it "should have known" that the wine was fake.[11]
Acquisitions[edit]




Constellation Brands moved its headquarters to a 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2) building on 11 acres (4.5 ha) in Victor, New York in 2009


Constellation Brands has expanded by acquiring other drinks companies.
In 1987, the company purchased the Manischewitz winery in Canandaigua, New York, and continues to license the Manischewitz name from R.A.B. Foods.[12]
In 1998 it acquired Matthew Clark plc in the United Kingdom, and after selling off its cider business, the Gaymer Cider Company, sold half of the business to Punch Taverns. Acquisitions include BRL Hardy (Australia)[13] and Nobilo (New Zealand) in 2003; Robert Mondavi Corp. for $1 billion in 2004;[14] Vincor International, Canada's largest wine company, for $1.44 billion in 2006;[15] Spirits Marque One (owner of Svedka Vodka) in 2007;[16] and Beam Wines Estates, the wine operations of Fortune Brands (which included several major brands such as Clos du Bois) for $885 million in 2008.[17] The company later moved to a more premium wine portfolio, divesting Almaden Vineyards, Inglenook Winery, and the Paul Masson winery in Madera, California, in 2008,[18] and its value spirits portfolio to the Sazerac Company in 2009.[19]
In June 2013 the company, which formerly imported Corona and other Modelo brands to the United States, acquired the US rights to those brands as a part of an anti-trust settlement permitting Modelo's acquisition by Anheuser-Busch InBev, along with a brewery in Piedras Negras, Mexico. It now produces its own versions of those products for the US, with Modelo serving all other countries.
In December 2015, Constellation announced the $1 billion acquisition of Ballast Point Brewing of San Diego.

Get To Know Robert Sands, President of Constellation Brands



				by Rachael Doob


				Published on: 2/22/2015			



















Robert Sands is president and CEO of Constellation Brands, a company founded by his father, the late Marvin Sands. Constellation Brands is based in Victor, New York and is a publicly traded beverage company with brands in wine, beer, and spirits. The company is one of the largest wine producers in the world and in 2008 reached close to $4 billion in sales. It operates about 40 production facilities, employs over 4,300 people, and markets its products in 125 countries. Constellation Brands moves an enormous amount of wine including Clos du Bois, Robert Mondavi, Franciscan Estate, Blackstone, Kim Crawford, and Ravenswood. They are the biggest seller by volume of premium-category wines priced under $15 and they launched 20 new labels in 2012. 
BACKSTORY
Mr. Sands is a 1981 graduate of Skidmore College and earned a Law degree and a Juris Doctorate from Pace University School of Law in 1984. After graduating, Sands began his career working as an associate with the Rochester law firm of Harter, Secrest, & Emery. In June of 1986 he joined his father’s company, Constellation Brands, as general counsel overseeing legal affairs. In 1993 he was appointed to the position of executive vice president and general counsel and then in 1998 he was given the role of chief executive officer of Constellation International. Several years later Sands was appointed to the roles of president and COO and was put in charge of the company’s two divisions, Constellation Wines and Constellation Beers and Spirits. In 2007 he was named president and CEO of the company. 
OF NOTE
Rob Sands has been awarded several honors for his various achievements. He received the 2011 Beverage Forum’s Lifetime Achievement Award, which is given to individuals who, through their lifetime efforts, have materially changed the beverage landscape. He was also given the 2010 Dr. Louis Berger Memorial Award, presented by the American Cancer Society to a wine and spirits industry leader who exemplifies philanthropic work and is dedicated to the fight against cancer. In addition he received the 2009 Wine Enthusiast Man of the Year Award, given for outstanding achievement in the wine world.
DRAMA
In 2010, a French court is Carcassonne, France convicted twelve wine traders and producers for selling fake Pinot Noir to Constellation Brands in a fraud that lasted from January 2006 until March 2008. Constellation later faced a class action lawsuit as a result of this scheme. According to the Wall Street Journal, Constellation confirmed “that it purchased Pinot Noir from a French supplier involved in a massive scheme to sell a phony version of the wine variety, but the company said it believes the product it bought was genuine.”  
PERSONAL
Sands is chairman of the board of the New York Wine and Culinary Center and a member of the board of trustees of the Rochester General Health System. He is also on the board and executive committee of the Rochester Business Alliance and is a member of the board of trustees of Thompson Health. In 2008, Rob Sands was named an inaugural member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Upstate New York Regional Advisory Board. 
NO JOKE
In 2013, Constellation acquired the remaining portion of the Crown Imports beer joint venture along with a state-of-the-art brewery in Mexico and perpetual rights to produce the Grupo Modelo brands in the U.S. With the completion of this acquisition Constellation’s gross sales reached close to $6 billion.

Pace University’s 48th Annual Leaders in Management Awards Dinner Honors:

Robert S. Sands, President and CEO, Constellation Brands
F. Daniel Gabel, Chairman and CEO, Hagedorn & Company 

Master of Ceremonies: Ken Rudin, NPR’s Political Editor
Presenter: Brent Blackwelder, Environmental Advocate
Jazz & Cabaret Artist: Ann Hampton Callaway, Cole Porter’s Only Collaborator
Silent Auction: Fine Luxury Wines from Constellation Brands’ Private Collection
NEW YORK, April 4, 2011 – At its 48th Annual Leaders in Management Awards Dinner this spring, Pace University will recognize Robert S. Sands, Esq., Law ’84, an important philanthropist and business entrepreneur in upstate New York who is President and Chief Executive Officer, Constellation Brands, Inc., the world’s largest premium wine company; and F. Daniel Gabel, a significant early supporter of environmental organizations who is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hagedorn & Company, a major insurance brokerage firm. The event will be held at Cipriani Wall Street on Thursday, April 7, 2011. The reception starts at 6:00 pm.
The master of ceremonies at the black-tie affair will be NPR’s Political Editor‪‪ Ken Rudin, who received a BA in Political Science from his alma mater Pace and who has analyzed and predicted every congressional race in the nation with an extremely high accuracy rate since 1984. The “Political Junkie” columnist and “ScuttleButton” creator has a campaign button collection that surpasses 70,000 items.
President Emeritus of Friends of the Earth, Brent Blackwelder, an environmental activist for over 40 years, will introduce honoree Dan Gabel. A leader in the effort to save our nation’s rivers, Blackwelder helped expand the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System from eight rivers in 1973 to over 250 today.
For the first time, the gala this year will feature a silent auction of luxury wines donated generously by Constellation Brands. The brands up for auction include some of the the most sought after and highly rated wines in the industry: 2005 Château Mouton Rothschild, 2007 Opus One and the 2006 Robert Mondavi Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon. 
Entertainment will be provided by Tony Award–nominated, multi–platinum songwriter and jazz vocalist Ann Hampton Callaway, along with Pace’s own musical theater students: Ally Bonino ’11, Julia Franklin ’13, Lyle Colby Mackston ’12, Michael Ryan ’13, Brandon Saenz ’11 and Emily Thomas ’12.
Proceeds from the silent wine auction as well as the event will support Pace’s Student Scholarship Program and special projects selected by the President.  Student Speaker will be Diana Cavallo, a junior at Pace’s Pforzheimer Honors College studying English/Communications.
Scions of Family Dynasties in Wine & Spirits and Insurance Brokerage Industries Share “Pace Passion”  
Gabel: Five Generations of Innovative Insurance
Dan Gabel, Chairman and CEO of Hagedorn & Company, has been a leader in the insurance brokerage field since he took over as President of the company in 1979.  He is the fifth generation of his family to lead Hagedorn, which was founded in 1869, just four years after the end of the Civil War, by Banker Henry Bohlen Hagedorn and former sea captain John Miles Gillespie.
Gabel joined Hagedorn in 1964 after several years as an accountant with Price Waterhouse.  Under his leadership, Hagedorn continues to be a pioneer in insurance coverage.
A graduate of Duke University, Gabel is a member of the board of Duke’s School of Environment.  He also serves on the boards of Friends of the Earth, the Waterkeeper Alliance, Cary Institute, the Insurance Industry Charitable Foundation, as well as several corporations.  His early and steady commitment to helping organizations that work to improve the environment has been the hallmark of his public service.  In 2009, Gabel and his wife, Bunny, established The Gabel Internship Award Fund at Pace University, which awards stipends to three students who undertake summer internships at nonprofit organizations that promote environmental activism.
A trustee of his prep school, Cheshire Academy, he also serves on the board of The Hundred Year Association, which honors the achievements of organizations that have been in existence for more than a century, while also recognizing outstanding acts of public service that enhance the present and future prestige of New York City.
Gabel says Hagedorn’s basic mission remains the same today as it was more than a century ago: “to provide insurance and financial counseling to all our clients, regardless of size, so that they profit from our knowledge, service and integrity.”
Sands: “Elevating Life with Every Glass Raised'”
Robert S. Sands, Esq. Law ’84, President and CEO of Constellation Brands, is a glass-half-full kind of guy.
The first Sands winery was in North Carolina and founded in 1935 by his grandfather Mack Sands, a few years after the end of prohibition.  Ten years later, Marvin Sands, Rob’s dad, purchased a sauerkraut factory-turned-winery located in Canandaigua, New York (in the Finger Lakes region), and established Canandaigua Industries as a vendor of kosher wines made from concord grapes.
Fast forward 66 years and Canandaigua Industries is now Constellation Brands, the world’s largest premium wine company with a portfolio of more than 100 consumer brands and sales of approximately  $3.6 billion in about 125 countries and operations at approximately 30 facilities. Constellation’s brands include Robert Mondavi, Clos du Bois, Blackstone, Arbor Mist, Estancia, Ravenswood, Jackson Triggs, Kim Crawford, Corona Extra, Black Velvet Canadian Whisky and SVEDKA Vodka.
Sands studied philosophy at Skidmore College and then went on to attend Pace University’s School of Law in White Plains, New York. He earned his juris doctorate in 1984 and began his career  as a full-time associate at Harter Secrest & Emery LLP in Rochester, where he worked part time during his law-school years.
Sands joined Constellation Brands, Inc. in June 1986 as general counsel. In 1993, he was named executive vice president and general counsel.  In 1998, he was appointed CEO of Constellation International. From early 2000 through most of 2002, he served as group president with responsibility for Canandaigua Wine Company and the U.K. Division. In December 2002, Sands became president and chief operating officer and in July 2007, he was named President and CEO of the company. He is also a member of Constellation’s board of directors.
Sands is chairman of the board of the New York Wine and Culinary Center, and on the boards of the Rochester General Health System, the Rochester Business Alliance, and Thompson Health. In 2008, he was named an inaugural member of the Federal Reserve Bank (FED) of New York’s Upstate Regional Advisory Board.  A long-time supporter of arts and culture, Sands was instrumental in bringing the regionally acclaimed Rochester City Ballet to Pace’s Schimmel Theater as part of the Downtown NYC River to River Festival-Summer Stars 2010.
“We have focused on building sustainable growth by staying true to the core values and business philosophies that are the cornerstone of our inspiring heritage and foundation,” said Sands. “We believe that industry leadership involves a commitment to our brands, to the trade, to the land, to investors and to people around the world who turn to our products when celebrating big moments or enjoying quiet ones. We express this commitment through our vision: to elevate life with every glass raised.”
Leaders in Management Award
Past recipients of Pace’s Leaders In Management Award, an annual tradition since 1962, include Magazine Publishing Magnate David J. Pecker, Online Advertising Innovator Gurbaksh Chahal, Thomas J. Quinlan III, President and Chief Executive Officer of RR Donnelley; James Lipton, Dean Emeritus of the Actors Studio Drama School at Pace University; Michael O’Reilly, retired Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of The Chubb Corporation; Herbert Henkel, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Ingersoll-Rand Company; Ivan G. Seidenberg, Chairman and CEO of Verizon Communications; Barry M. Gosin, Chief Executive Officer of Newmark Knight Frank; David Rockefeller, retired chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank; Edward D. Miller, then President and Chief Executive Officer of AXA Financial Inc; Thomas C. Hays, chairman and CEO of Fortune Brands, Inc; and Eugene R. McGrath, former Chairman of the Board of Consolidated Edison, Inc.
