Company Profile


RCI Hospitality Holdings – Leader in gentlemen's clubs and  sports bars/restaurants

Founded in 1983, we pioneered elegant gentlemen's clubs based on powerful brands, quality environments, beautiful entertainers, and excellent restaurants.
Since our IPO in 1995, we have used our expertise to transform RCI into a leading hospitality company.
Today, subsidiaries own and operate more than 40 nightclubs and sports bars/restaurants.
Larger units are in major cities, such as New York, Miami, Philadelphia, Dallas/Ft. Worth, and Minneapolis, with smaller ones spread through the South and Southwest.
RCI also owns ED Publications, Inc., the leading media company serving the multi-billion dollar adult club business with industry-related websites, magazines and trade shows.
Investors are attracted by RCI's strong cash flow, operating margins and local laws that create high barriers to entry in the gentlemen's club business.

Key Strategies

Innovation: RCI has extensive experience in nightclub development, marketing, management, IT, and security. We know how to grow revenues and profits.
Club Roll Up: There is a universe of 3,500 clubs of which RCI would consider acquiring on a selected basis. Many owners plan to retire in the years ahead. With increasing access to financing, RCI can consolidate the industry, creating greater scale.
Bombshells: RCI has begun leveraging its expertise, developing the rapidly-growing Bombshells chain of military themed sports bar/restaurants.
Cash Flow: RCI is focused on growing its considerable free cash flow. We calculate free cash flow as net cash flows from from operating activities minus maintenance capital expenditures.
Capital Allocation Strategy: Our capital allocation strategy provides us with disciplined guidelines on how we should use our free cash flow to repurchase shares, acquire or open new clubs and restaurants, or accelerate payments on our debt; provided, however, that we may deviate from this strategy if the opportunities warrant.

Major Brands

Rick's Cabaret: Elegant clubs with restaurants
Scarlett’s Cabaret: High-end, high-energy “party” style club
Vivid Cabaret: High-end, high-energy “party” style club
Tootsie's Cabaret: Nation's mega club with 74,000 square feet
Club Onyx: High-end clubs for African-American professionals
Jaguars Club: Lively BYOB clubs for blue collar patrons and the college crowd
XTC Cabaret: Lively BYOB clubs for blue collar patrons and the college crowd
Bombshells: Military themed, sports bars/restaurants for a great time and great food

History of Innovation

        Robert Watters founded the company in 1983 in Houston with the innovative Rick's Cabaret gentlemen's club concept. In 1998, the company merged with the 
        XTC Cabaret chain, which was controlled by Eric Langan, who eventually became the company's president and CEO.
    

        The early days as a publicly traded company (originally named Rick's Cabaret International, Inc.) were challenging. During the first 10 years, the stock 
        fell more than half. Since then, shares have grown more than three fold.
    

        Focusing on innovation, RCI has created a truly upscale, friendly chain of clubs for both customers and entertainers, and built a substantial 
        company through acquisition and internal growth.
    

        "We brought our club concept to Manhattan in 2005 with Rick's Cabaret New York," said Mr. Langan. "Critics said it would never work. It did, 
        and we did it again in 2014 with Vivid Cabaret New York aimed at younger professionals. Today, Rick's is considered the No. 1 club in the city and Vivid 
        the hottest new club.
    

        "Another example is the success of Club Onyx, the first upscale clubs to cater to the African-American professional. It has attracted 
        an enthusiastic clientele of professional athletes, musicians, businessmen, and community leaders.
    

        "Now we are taking this spirit of innovation to closely related businesses. We have created the Bombshells sports bar/restaurant chain, which is attracting 
        interest from restaurant franchisors around the country."
    
Eric Langan, President & CEO

With more than two decades in the nightclub industry, Eric Langan joined RCI in 1998 and has led the company since 1999.
He acquired his first club in Texas at age 21 with $40,000 from the sale of his baseball card collection. Later, he acquired a controlling interest in RCI and became CEO, following its merger with his own publicly traded Taurus, Inc., which owned the XTC Cabaret chain.
Under Mr. Langan’s direction, RCI has grown inside and outside of Texas, becoming the leading consolidator in the nightclub industry, as well as expanding the company into related businesses, such as sports bars/restaurants.
Mr. Langan is a member of the Board of Directors of Adult Club Executives (ACE), the major trade organization for the gentlemen's club industry, and is considered an expert in the business.
He grew up in Peoria, IL, where his father was a police officer. Later, the family moved to the Dallas area, where Eric began his entrepreneurial career. By age 16, he had developed his own advertising media company, distributing promotional flyers for local businesses.
Mr. Langan believes the future of RCI lies in continued innovation in the hospitality industry, with an emphasis on employing self-motivated, entrepreneurial managers; adhering to strict cost controls; focusing on increasing cash flow; and creating shareholder value.

        "Now we are taking this spirit of innovation to closely related businesses. We have created the Bombshells sports bar/restaurant chain, which is attracting 
        interest from restaurant franchisors around the country."
    
Eric Langan, President & CEO

With more than two decades in the nightclub industry, Eric Langan joined RCI in 1998 and has led the company since 1999.
He acquired his first club in Texas at age 21 with $40,000 from the sale of his baseball card collection. Later, he acquired a controlling interest in RCI and became CEO, following its merger with his own publicly traded Taurus, Inc., which owned the XTC Cabaret chain.
Under Mr. Langan’s direction, RCI has grown inside and outside of Texas, becoming the leading consolidator in the nightclub industry, as well as expanding the company into related businesses, such as sports bars/restaurants.
Mr. Langan is a member of the Board of Directors of Adult Club Executives (ACE), the major trade organization for the gentlemen's club industry, and is considered an expert in the business.
He grew up in Peoria, IL, where his father was a police officer. Later, the family moved to the Dallas area, where Eric began his entrepreneurial career. By age 16, he had developed his own advertising media company, distributing promotional flyers for local businesses.
Mr. Langan believes the future of RCI lies in continued innovation in the hospitality industry, with an emphasis on employing self-motivated, entrepreneurial managers; adhering to strict cost controls; focusing on increasing cash flow; and creating shareholder value.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

  How Will SSNO Be Provided? (check one) Help






						
						Shareholder is NOT a U.S. citizen - no SSNO required.
					





						I'll phone it in asap.  I know registration can't start without it.




						I want GiveAshare to include a SSNO Request Card with 1st Part so recipient can 
						 provide it later.










 Shareholder Email Address (optional)
