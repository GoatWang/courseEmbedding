About Betrayal
“Simply put, the leftist labor unions have the Democrats in their pockets. And we’re all paying the price.”Linda Chavez, President George W. Bush’s original choice for Secretary of Labor and a former union official, is one of the foremost authorities on America’s labor unions. Now, in the explosive new book Betrayal, she and fellow union expert Daniel Gray expose the corrupt bargain between the labor movement and the Democratic Party.Committed to a far-left political agenda—and to enhancing their own power—union bosses funnel at least half a billion dollars into Democratic coffers every year. And they do it, illegally, by using dues money that workers are forced to pay as a condition of their employment—dues money that each year brings the unions $17 billion, all of it tax-free. What do labor bosses get in return? The power to call the shots in Democratic campaigns and on party policy, extraordinary influence at all levels of government, billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded federal grants, and special legal privileges that leave them free to act as they please, no matter the consequences for the American people. The cycle of corruption is seemingly endless.Chavez and Gray name names, exposing the many politicians who are in Big Labor’s pocket—including the leading lights of the Democratic Party. Betrayal also reveals: • Big Labor’s all-out efforts in the 2004 election, including how just one local union has launched a $35-million campaign to unseat President Bush• How corrupt union officials use members’ hard-earned money to fund lavish lifestyles—and how their Democratic supporters let them get away with it • How unions flout the law by failing to report any of their political spending to the IRS• How a government report uncovered the Democrats’ sellout to Big Labor—but how the unions and the Democrats sued to keep the report from going public • How the U.S. government lets unions practice legalized terrorism against American citizens• How public-employee unions extort concessions from the government and put Americans at risk by refusing to provide vital services like policing and firefighting• How Americans now live under a system of legal apartheid—one set of rules for labor bosses, another for the rest of usAll of us foot the bill for this corrupt system. Now it’s up to us to do something about it.From the Hardcover edition.

Praise

    “Exposes how Democratic politicians have sold out to Big Labor. . . A must-read for anyone concerned about higher taxes, bigger government, and a far-left social agenda.” —Sean Hannity“There probably isn’t a better book available on how unions corrupt politics.” —John J. Miller, National Review“Meticulously documents how the NEA and many other labor unions . . . have constructed political organizations tied directly to the Democratic Party. . . . Proponents of campaign finance reform like to claim that the recent McCain-Feingold law got the ‘big money’ out of politics. Well, some of the big money never left, as Ms. Chavez and Mr. Gray show so vividly.” —Wall Street JournalFrom the Trade Paperback edition.

Linda Chávez 
Among the most outspoken voices in American politics and society, Linda Chávez is the product 
of a working-class family who made their living painting houses or working in department stores 
or restaurants. Exposure to working-class values during her early years influenced Chávez's 
conservative attitudes toward privilege and labor in her adult years. She was born on July 7, 
1947, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, but by her tenth birthday her family moved to Denver, 
Colorado. There Chávez received much of her education. In 1970 she earned a baccalaureate 
degree from the University of Colorado. During the next two years Chávez completed graduate 
coursework in English literature at the University of California at Los Angeles. This background 
helped prepare Chávez for numerous positions she would hold in later years. 
Although Chávez writes a nationally syndicated political column that appears in numerous 
papers throughout the country, she is best known for her book

Cibolero

View larger

Hispanic New Mexican hunters and plainsmen,
or ciboleros (from the New Mexican
Spanish cíbolo), learned to hunt bison from
Native American neighbors in order to provide
winter meat for their home villages. Like
the Pueblos and Plains Indians, New Mexican
Hispanos depended on bison during the late
Spanish colonial, Mexican, and territorial
eras. The volume and extent of the ciboleros'
hunts peaked in the first half of the nineteenth
century and declined thereafter as the bison
were taken to the brink of extinction.
Ciboleros traditionally hunted bison twice
a year. The large-scale autumn hunt took
place after crops were harvested. Expeditions
from settlements in north-central New Mexico
and southern Colorado usually took six
weeks to reach the Southern Great Plains, encounter
herds, barter with Comanches or
Kiowas, hunt, secure and preserve meat, and
return before heavy snowfalls. During these
autumn hunts, bison were taken for their
thick robes as well as for their meat.
The summer hunt took place in June, after
spring planting, by which time meat supplies
procured the previous autumn were exhausted.
Bison meat was of utmost importance
for the common people, allowing them to save
goat herds for milk and roast kid for special
occasions. Only the wealthier classes regularly
partook of domestically raised meats.
Each village had an individual hunter who
specialized in running bison on horseback.
Specially trained horses were ridden only by
the ciboleros and used for only that purpose.
The lance and bow and arrow were the main
weapons of the hunt; firearms were few and
far between in New Mexico until the late nineteenth
century. It was a skill and profession
that was handed down from father to son, and
certain New Mexican families were specialists.
Hunters from various villages prepared supplies
for the journey and for barter and furnished
skinners and camp helpers. The hunters
gathered at a predesignated place and
chose a mayordomo, or foreman, and the expedition
proceeded in caravans of oxcarts.
Often Hispanos and Pueblos traveled together
for mutual safety and cooperation.
The Southern Plains was dominated by the
Comanches and Kiowas, who maintained
generally good relations with the Pueblos and
Hispanos after 1785, when New Mexico governor
Juan Bautista de Anza decisively defeated
the Comanches, led by Cuerno Verde, and established
peace. Barter of New Mexican agricultural
products with the Native Americans
created goodwill and allowed the ciboleros to
enter their traditional hunting lands.
After the bison herds were encountered, each
cibolero tied a long rope around his waist in
order to remount if thrown during the chase.
Commending their souls to God and Santiago
(Saint James), they rode into the herds. Selecting
choice animals, they lanced the bison or
shot arrows, bringing down only as many as
their villages needed. This was a dangerous
undertaking, and some ciboleros died from
being trampled, while others were killed by
Indians, especially the Cheyennes, who by 1850
were competing for the diminishing herds.
The late Cleofes Vigil of San Cristóbal, New
Mexico–poet-troubadour, historian, rancher,
and retired railroad worker–often performed
ballads about such fatal accidents.
After enough bison were brought down,
agregadores (helpers) and hunters pitched in,
skinning, slicing, and salting meat. After drying,
meat was packed in oxcarts for the return.
All the bison parts were used. Aside from the
meat, hides were tanned for robes or leather,
smoked tongues were traded in Mexico, horns
and bones were made into utensils, and the
wool was spun into rough cloth or stuffed in
mattresses.
The late Cipriano Solano (1870–1967) of
Springer, New Mexico, a retired rancher, recalled
that near the end of the nineteenth century
there were remnant bison herds near
Loma Parda, New Mexico, and he described
how he had taken a burro to haul the meat
back after hunting, and how one cibolero
would provide meat for several families for a
year. Ciboleros are still remembered in New
Mexican folk songs, cultural events, and family
oral traditions.
