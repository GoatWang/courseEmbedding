Strategy & Benefits

Principal Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund includes:

A quantitative, strategic index-based approach to commodity investing
Exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be long or flat (if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash)
The ability to make position changes intra-month based on trends
Monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels
A “smart” contract roll approach1

1 Smart Contract Roll Approach – A futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract.
Why Invest in the Fund?

The long/flat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends
Seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable long-only commodity indices
Has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intra-month
Risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high
Low- or non-correlation to stocks and bonds
Disciplined, quantitative, rules-based approach to commodity investing




Why Commodities?

Not just commodities – Long/Flat commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
The Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund seeks to match the performance of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index (ABCERI), which provides exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends.
This long/flat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise, and mitigate risk by going flat (to cash) when prices fall.
Why consider long/flat commodities?
Most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise. However, these long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.

Target Index

The Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index aims to capture upward trends in the commodity markets while minimizing risk during downward trends. The index uses a quantitative methodology to track either long or flat positions in a diversified portfolio of 12 commodity futures covering energy, metals, and agriculture. The index incorporates dynamic risk management and contract rolling methods.

Source: Bloomberg. Data from 10/1/2010 – 6/30/2017. October 1, 2010 is the inception of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index. Index returns and correlations are historical and are not representative of any fund performance. Total returns of the index include reinvested dividends. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  One cannot invest directly in an index. The indexes are composite indexes of commodity sector returns representing unmanaged, unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that are broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities. 

S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (S&P GSCI), a composite index of commodity sector returns representing an unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that is broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities;
Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index (BCOM TR), a broadly diversified index that allows investors to track 19 commodity futures through a single, simple measure
Deutsche Banc Liquid Commodity Optimum Yield Index (DBC CI), an index composed of futures contracts on 14 of the most heavily-traded and important physical commodities in the world.

Standard Deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean.
Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.
Maximum Drawdown is the greatest percent decline from a previous high.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 1.26% for DXCTX, 2.01% for DXSCX, and 1.01% for DXCIX.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with each Fund. Under this Operating Service Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of each Fund through September 1, 2018 other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1distribution and/or service fees, any front-end or contingent deferred sales loads, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other expenses outside the typical day-to-day operations of the Fund. If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

COMMODITY ADVISORS FUND L.P. - 10-K - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.Overview
The current objective of the Partnership is to achieve capital appreciation through speculative trading, directly and indirectly, in
U.S.
and international markets for currencies, interest rates, stock indices, agricultural and energy products and precious and base metals. The Partnership may employ futures, options on futures and forward contracts in those markets. The Partnership may also engage in spot, swap and other derivative transactions with the approval of the General Partner.
The General Partner manages all business of the Partnership and the Funds. The General Partner has delegated its responsibility for the investment of the Partnership's assets to the Advisors and may allocate the Partnership's assets to additional advisors. The Partnership has invested these assets in the Funds. The General Partner engages a team of approximately 30 professionals whose primary emphasis is on attempting to maintain quality control among the advisors to the funds operated or managed by the General Partner. A full-time staff of due diligence professionals use proprietary technology and on-site evaluations to monitor new and existing futures money managers. The accounting and operations staff provides processing of subscriptions and redemptions and reporting to limited partners and regulatory authorities. The General Partner also includes staff involved in marketing and sales support. In selecting the "established" advisors for the Partnership, the General Partner considered, among other things, the Advisors' past performance, trading style, volatility of markets traded and fee requirements. In selecting "emerging" advisors for the Partnership the General Partner conducts proprietary research and considers the background of the advisors' principals, as well as the advisors' trading styles, strategies and markets traded, expected volatility, trading results (to the extent available) and fee requirements. The General Partner may consider other factors in its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, (i) the quality of the advisor's risk control techniques, (ii) the quality of the advisor's research techniques and (iii) the advisor's company infrastructure and plan for development. Such information may be limited due to their "emerging" nature. The General Partner may modify or terminate the allocation of assets to an Advisor at any time and may allocate assets to additional advisors at any time.




                                       17


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responsibilities of the General Partner include:



  •   due diligence examinations of the Advisors;




  •   selection, appointment and termination of the Advisors;




  •   negotiation of the Management Agreements; and




  •   monitoring the activity of the Advisors.


In addition, the General Partner will prepare, or will assist the Administrator in preparing the books and records and will provide or will assist the Administrator in providing, the administrative and compliance services that are required by law or regulation, from time to time, in connection with the operation of the Partnership/Funds.
While the Partnership and the Funds have the right to seek lower commission rates from other commodity brokers at any time, the General Partner believes that the customer agreements and other arrangements with the commodity broker are fair, reasonable, and competitive.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, the programs traded by the major commodity trading advisors on behalf of the Partnership were: Aventis - Aventis Diversified Commodity Strategy and JE Moody - JEM Commodity Relative Value Program. The General Partner may modify or terminate the allocation of assets to an Advisor at any time and may allocate assets to additional advisors at any time. As of December 31, 2015, and as of September 30, 2015, the Partnership's assets were allocated among the Advisors in the following approximate percentages:



               Advisor       December 31, 2015           September 30, 2015
               Aventis         7,602,612       64 %         9,245,966       64 %
               JE Moody        4,323,517       36 %         5,168,768       36 %


Aventis Asset Management, LLC


Aventis will trade the Partnership's assets in accordance with its Aventis Diversified Commodity Strategy (formerly known as the Barbarian Program, and before that, the Misfit Barbarian Program), a proprietary and discretionary trading program developed and refined by Aventis, which is the synthesis of disparate fundamental views and technical indicators overlaid with strict risk management policies on a position, sector and portfolio basis. Aventis has traded its Aventis Diversified Commodity Strategy for client accounts since September 2006.
The Aventis Diversified Commodity Strategy has the following characteristics:



     •   Ensemble of Three Sub-Programs: The Aventis Diversified Commodity Strategy
         is based on an ensemble of three discretionary sub-programs: spreads,
         directional, and short-term trading. This type of trading is based
         primarily on the fundamentals of the market (i.e., changes in supply or
         demand of a commodity). It will also include supply and demand of the pit
         (i.e., discovery of over bought and over sold conditions).




     •   Spread Trading: Approximately 60% of trading activity will be based on
         calendar, intra-market and intermarket spreads. Intra-market spreads are
         where one is simultaneously long and short different delivery months of
         the same contract (i.e., long April Live Cattle versus short June Live
         Cattle). Intermarket spreads are where one is long one contract and
         simultaneously short a completely different contract (i.e., long December
         Natural Gas and short December Crude Oil).




     •   Directional Trading: Approximately 35% of the strategy is directional in
         nature utilizing outright and spread positions.




     •   Short-Term Trading: Approximately 5% of the strategy is involved in
         short-term trading.




     •   Markets Followed: The Aventis Diversified Commodity Strategy trades on
         behalf of the Partnership in the following markets, among others: grains,
         currencies, energies, softs, livestock and metals.




     •   Risk Management: Effective risk management is also a crucial aspect of the
         program. Account size, expectation, volatility of markets traded and the
         nature of other positions taken are all factors in deciding whether to
         take a position and determining the amount of equity committed to that
         position.




                                       18

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please note that the percentage of assets allocated to the three discretionary sub-programs (spreads, directional and short-term trading) will be made pursuant to Aventis's sole discretion and not in order to maintain any constant percentage allocation among the different sub-programs. As a result, the amount of assets allocated to each sub-program - both on a dollar amount and percentage basis - will vary greatly over the life of the Partnership. Trading decisions may require the exercise of judgment by Aventis. Therefore, successful trading may depend on Aventis' trading ability, knowledge and judgment. Aventis will exercise its judgment and discretion in interpreting the data generated by the Aventis Diversified Commodity Strategy, including selecting the markets which will be followed and actively traded. In addition, Aventis will determine the method by which orders are placed, the types of orders that are to be placed, the overall leverage for the portfolio, and, when applicable, the time at which orders are placed with, and executed by, a broker.
The trading program to be followed by Aventis does not assure successful trading. Investment decisions made in accordance with the Aventis Diversified Commodity Strategy will be based on an assessment of available market information. However, because of the large quantity of information at hand, the number of available facts that may be overlooked and the variables that may shift, any investment decision must, in the final analysis, be based on the judgment of Aventis.
The decision by Aventis not to trade certain markets or not to make certain trades may result at times in missing price moves and hence profits of great magnitude, which other trading advisors who are willing to trade these markets may be able to capture. Aventis's approach is dependent in part on the existence of certain technical or fundamental indicators. There have been periods in the past when there were no such market indicators, and those periods may recur. Aventis believes that the development of a trading strategy is a continual process. As a result of further analysis and research, changes have been made from time to time in the specific manner in which the Aventis Diversified Commodity Strategy evaluates price movements in various markets, and it is likely that similar revisions will be made in the future. As a result of such modifications, the program that may be used by Aventis in the future will differ from that used by Aventis in the past and might differ from that presently being used.
The Aventis Diversified Commodity Strategy is a proprietary and confidential program, and the foregoing description is, of necessity, general and is not intended to be exhaustive. Consequently, an investor will not be able to determine the full details of the program or whether the program is being followed. There can be no assurance that any trading strategy of Aventis will produce profitable results or will not result in losses.
J E Moody & Company LLC
The JEM Commodity Relative Value Program is a systematic program that uses quantitative models to detect and exploit price shifts and mispricings between related instruments in the energy, metal and agricultural markets, while employing hedging methods to maintain approximate market or sector neutrality. The strategies do not make un-hedged directional bets. Most trades are implemented using offsetting long and short positions in futures and futures options, thus reducing exposure to sudden changes in market direction. As examples, such offsetting positions may be in different delivery months of the same commodity market (e.g., calendar or butterfly spreads), in different but related markets (e.g., crude oil and unleaded gasoline) or between contracts traded on different exchanges (e.g.,
New York
and
London
copper).
Market coverage for the JEM Commodity Relative Value Program portfolio includes crude oil and petroleum distillates, natural gas, industrial metals, precious metals, grains, livestock, foodstuffs, fibers and potentially other commodities. JE Moody utilizes primarily exchange-traded futures and futures options to implement its relative value trades, although trades may also be made using other instruments, such as commodity swaps or OTC derivatives contracts.
The trading opportunities captured by the JEM Commodity Relative Value Program models are believed to arise due to various factors, including: changes in relative supply and demand of different commodity contracts, the idiosyncratic actions of market participants, external events that may disrupt production (e.g., droughts, hurricanes, labor unrest or geopolitics), and risk premia associated with general uncertainties in future supply or demand. By virtue of their relative value nature, JEM Commodity Relative Value Program trades may be interpreted as providing market liquidity to directional traders who need it, and earning a risk premium by doing so.
Relative value strategies are frequently employed by hedge funds in the equity, fixed income, convertible bond and option markets, but are relatively uncommon in the commodity or managed futures arenas. Over extended time periods, relative value strategies have been observed to produce more consistent returns and higher Sharpe ratios than un-hedged, directional trading strategies. With the high leverage often used, however, some relative value managers have experienced significant losses, particularly when extreme market events have occurred.




                                       19


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JE Moody attempts to manage the risk of large losses by limiting the overall portfolio leverage and the degree of exposure to any single commodity market or sector. The JEM Commodity Relative Value Program portfolio typically includes about 15 to 25 active relative value trades, with the number of open positions depending on the arbitrage opportunities available. The JEM Commodity Relative Value Program trades have low mutual correlation, cover multiple markets and sectors and thus enable meaningful diversification within the JEM Commodity Relative Value Program portfolio.
When few favorable relative value trading opportunities arise in the commodity markets, or as JE Moody may determine, JE Moody may choose to make relative value trades in the financial futures, options, swap or derivatives markets. At times when many or few trading opportunities are available, JE Moody may increase or reduce the overall JEM Commodity Relative Value Program portfolio exposure.
To hedge offsetting long and short positions, JE Moody may use techniques such as static hedging, dynamic hedging and option overlays. Moreover, hedging may seek to achieve market or sector neutrality via various benchmarks, such as by being "contract neutral," "dollar neutral" or "delta neutral." No hedging strategy is perfect, but each has its costs, risks, advantages and limitations. Even with well-hedged positions, there is usually some residual exposure to directional market movements. JE Moody seeks to balance the advantages of the hedging strategy used in a particular relative value trade versus the costs and risks of implementing the trade. The General Partner and JE Moody have agreed that JE Moody will trade the Partnership's assets allocated to JE Moody at a level that is up to three times the amount of assets allocated.
No assurance can be given that the Advisors' strategies will be successful or that they will generate profits for the Partnership. Specific Fund level performance information is included in Note 6 to the Partnership's financial statements included in "Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
For the period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the average allocation by commodity market sector for each of the Funds was as follows:

                              MB Master Fund L.P.



                               Energy        34.7 %
                               Grains        33.6 %
                               Livestock      4.3 %
                               Metals        15.8 %
                               Softs         11.6 %


                              JEM Master Fund L.P.



                               Energy        63.2 %
                               Grains         7.9 %
                               Livestock     22.9 %
                               Metals         1.7 %
                               Softs          4.3 %


(a) Liquidity.

The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services. Its only assets are its investment in the Funds and cash. The Funds' assets consist only of (a) expense reimbursement (MB Master only) and (b) equity in trading account, consisting of cash and cash margin, net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts, net unrealized appreciation on forward contracts,
U.S.
Treasury bills and options purchased, if applicable. Because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity futures trading, relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the Partnership. While substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity, no such illiquidity occurred during the year ended December 31, 2015.




                                       20


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To minimize the risk relating to low margin deposits, the Funds follow certain trading policies, including:



    (i) The Funds invest their assets only in commodity interests that the
        respective Advisor believes are traded in sufficient volume to permit ease
        of taking and liquidating positions. Sufficient volume, in this context,
        refers to a level of liquidity that the respective Advisor believes will
        permit it to enter and exit trades without noticeably moving the market.




    (ii) An Advisor will not initiate additional positions in any commodity
         interest if these positions would result in aggregate positions requiring
         a margin of more than 66 2/3% of the Funds' net assets allocated to that
         Advisor.




    (iii) The Funds may occasionally accept delivery of a commodity. Unless such
          delivery is disposed of promptly by retendering the warehouse receipt
          representing the delivery to the appropriate clearinghouse, the physical
          commodity position is fully hedged.




    (iv) The Funds do not employ the trading technique commonly known as
         "pyramiding," in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing
         positions as margin for the purchases or sale of additional positions in
         the same or related commodities.




    (v) The Funds do not utilize borrowings other than short-term borrowings if
        the Funds take delivery of any cash commodities.




    (vi) The Advisors may, from time to time, employ trading strategies such as
         spreads or straddles on behalf of the Funds. The terms "spread" and
         "straddle" describe commodity futures trading strategies involving the
         simultaneous buying and selling of futures contracts on the same
         commodity but involving different delivery dates or markets.




    (vii) The Funds will not permit the churning of their commodity trading
          accounts. The term "churning" refers to the practice of entering and
          exiting trades with a frequency unwarranted by legitimate efforts to
          profit from the trades, driven by the desire to generate commission
          income.


From January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the Partnership's average margin to equity ratio (i.e., the percentage of assets on deposit required for margin) was approximately 7.2%. The foregoing margin to equity ratio takes into account cash held in the Partnership's name, as well as the allocable value of the positions and cash held on behalf of the Partnership in the name of the Funds.
In the normal course of business, the Partnership, indirectly through its investments in the Funds, is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments. These financial instruments may include futures, forwards,
U.S.
Treasury bills, swaps and options, whose values are based upon an underlying asset, index, or reference rate, and generally represent future commitments to exchange currencies or cash balances, or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specific terms at specified future dates, or, in the case of derivative commodity instruments, to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash, through physical delivery or with another financial instrument. These instruments may be traded on an exchange, a swap execution facility or OTC. Exchange-traded instruments include futures and certain standardized forward, option and swap contracts. Certain swap contracts may also be traded on a swap execution facility or OTC. OTC contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and also include certain forward and option contracts. Specific market movements of commodities or futures contracts underlying an option cannot accurately be predicted. The purchaser of an option may lose the entire premium paid for the option. The writer or seller of an option has unlimited risk. Each of these instruments is subject to various risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments including market and credit risk. In general, the risks associated with OTC contracts are greater than those associated with exchange-traded instruments because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an OTC contract. Since May 1, 2011, none of the Funds' contracts have traded OTC, although contracts may be traded OTC in the future.
The risk to the Limited Partners that have purchased Redeemable Units is limited to the amount of their share of the Partnership's net assets and undistributed profits. This limited liability is a result of the organization of the Partnership as a limited partnership under
Delaware
law.




                                       21


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the Funds due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded. The Funds are exposed to a market risk equal to the value of futures and forward contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.
Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. The Partnership's/Funds' risk of loss in the event of counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial Condition and is not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments. The Partnership's/Funds' risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the Partnership/Funds to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events.
The Partnership/Funds had credit risk and concentration risk during the reporting period and prior periods included in this report, as MS&Co. and/or CGM or their affiliates were the sole counterparties or brokers with respect to the Partnership's/Funds' assets. Credit risk with respect to exchange-traded instruments is reduced to the extent that, through MS&Co. and/or CGM, the counterparty was an exchange or clearing organization. The Partnership/Funds continue to be subject to such risks with respect to MS&Co.
The General Partner monitors and attempts to control the risk exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and risk management monitoring systems and, accordingly, believes that it has effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the Partnership/Funds may be subject. These monitoring systems generally allow the General Partner to statistically analyze actual trading results with risk-adjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics. In addition, online monitoring systems provide account analysis of futures, forward and option contracts by sector, margin requirements, gain and loss transactions and collateral positions. (See also "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." for further information on financial instrument risk included in the notes to the financial statements.)
The majority of these financial instruments mature within one year of the inception date. However, due to the nature of the business, these instruments may not be held to maturity.
The Partnership's/Funds' risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the Partnership/Funds to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events.
Other than the risks inherent in
U.S.
Treasury bills, money market mutual fund securities, commodity futures and other derivatives, the Partnership knows of no trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties which will result in, or which are reasonably likely to result in, the Partnership's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.
(b) Capital Resources.
(i) The Partnership has made no material commitments for capital expenditures.
(ii) The Partnership's capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners as increased or decreased by gains or losses on trading and by expenses, interest income, subscriptions and redemptions of Redeemable Units and distributions of profits, if any. Gains or losses on trading cannot be predicted. Market movements in commodities are dependent upon fundamental and technical factors which the Advisors may or may not be able to identify, such as changing supply and demand relationships, weather, government agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies, national and international political and economic events and changes in interest rates. Partnership expenses consist of, among other things, ongoing selling agent fees, management fees and General Partner fees. The level of these expenses is dependent upon trading performance and the ability of the Advisors to identify and take advantage of price movements in the commodity markets, in addition to the level of net assets maintained. In addition, the amount of interest income payable by the Partnership's commodity broker is dependent upon interest rates over which neither the Partnership nor the commodity broker has control.




                                       22


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No forecast can be made as to the level of redemptions in any given period. A limited partner may require the Partnership to redeem some or all of their Redeemable Units at the net asset value per Redeemable Unit as of the end of any month on three business days' notice to the General Partner. There is no fee charged to limited partners in connection with redemptions. Redemptions are generally funded out of the Partnership's cash holdings and/or redemptions from the Funds. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 4,295.8170 Class A Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $5,416,401, 25.3060 Class Z Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $24,024 and 48.9960 Class Z General Partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $44,768. For the year ended December 31, 2014, 8,458.6440 Class A Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $11,253,309, 71.4170 Class Z Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $63,569 and 112.2640 Class Z General Partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $99,977. For the year ended December 31, 2013, 7,400.1910 Class A Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $10,500,783 and 1,718.0000 Class Z General Partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $1,600,861.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, there were additional subscriptions of 426.8410 Class A Redeemable Units totaling $565,997. For the year ended December 31, 2014, there were additional subscriptions of 2,791.0570 Class A Redeemable Units totaling $3,723,628. For the year ended December 31, 2013, there were additional subscriptions of 3,932.0890 Class A Redeemable Units totaling $5,592,487.
(c) Results of Operations.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class A decreased 7.7% from $1,304.97 to $1,204.03. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class Z decreased 5.9% from $889.87 to $837.69. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class A decreased 7.5% from $1,411.10 to $1,304.97. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class Z decreased 5.6% from $943.14 to $889.87. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class A decreased 2.9% from $1,452.61 to $1,411.10. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class Z decreased 0.9% from $951.57 to $943.14.
The Partnership, through its investment in the Funds, experienced a net trading loss before fees and expenses of $211,675 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Losses were primarily attributable to the Funds' trading of grains, livestock, metals and softs, and were partially offset by gains in energy. The net trading gain (or loss) from the Partnership's investment in the Funds is disclosed on page 39 under "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
The most significant losses were incurred in the metals markets during June, August, and September from long positions in nickel futures as prices moved lower on reports of high global inventories and weakening industrial demand in
China
. Within the livestock sector, losses were recorded during March from short positions in live cattle futures as prices moved higher after industry reports indicated
U.S.
cattle herds shrank during the first quarter. Additional losses were experienced from short positions in lean hog futures during April and long live cattle futures positions during September. Within the grains sector, losses were incurred during April from long positions in soybean and wheat futures as prices moved lower after the Department of Agriculture released a report which indicated
U.S.
grain stockpiles were at their highest levels in 28 years. During October, losses were experienced from long positions in soybean and corn futures as prices weakened following the release of
U.S.
government forecasts which predicted that global grain inventories will reach record levels in 2016. Additional losses in this sector were experienced during September from choppy price action in soybean futures. The Partnership's trading losses during the year were offset by gains achieved within the energy markets during February from long positions in crude oil and its related products as prices rallied as cold weather blanketed much of the
U.S.
and OPEC released a bullish monthly oil-market report. Additional gains during February were recorded from long positions in heating oil futures as prices spiked as severe cold weather in the
U.S.
boosted demand from homes and businesses. During July, gains within the energies were experienced from short positions in crude oil and its related products as prices dropped as investors weighed the prospect of easing restrictions on Iranian oil exports adding supply to an oversaturated world market. Within the soft commodity markets, gains were recorded during September from long positions in sugar futures as prices advanced after adverse weather disrupted the harvest in
Brazil
. Gains in this sector were also experienced during October from long positions in cocoa futures as extreme dry weather in
West Africa
threatened the region's cocoa crops and pushed prices higher.
The Partnership, through its investment in the Funds, experienced a net trading loss before fees and expenses of $682,546 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Losses were primarily attributable to the Funds' trading of energy and softs, and were partially offset by gains in grains, livestock and metals.
The most significant losses were incurred within the energy markets during February from short positions in crude oil futures as prices rose after Energy Information Administration data indicated crude stockpiles declined during the month. Losses in the energy sector were also incurred during June from short positions in Brent crude oil futures as prices rallied on speculation that an escalation of internal fighting in
Iraq
would disrupt oil exports from the
Middle East
. Additional losses were experienced during March from long positions in crude oil and its related products as prices dropped after reports indicated
U.S.
crude oil supplies exceeded previous




                                       23


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
forecasts. Within the soft commodity markets, losses were recorded during September from long positions in cotton futures as prices declined after reports showed cotton inventories in the
U.S.
advanced to 30-year highs. Additional losses during September were experienced from long positions in sugar futures as prices moved lower after bumper crops in
Thailand
and
India
expanded the global supply glut. During October, losses within the soft commodity markets were recorded from long positions in coffee futures as prices retreated as rains brought relief to drought-stricken areas in
Brazil
. The Partnership's losses for the year were partially offset by gains achieved within the grains markets from short positions in soybean futures during June, July, August, and September as favorable weather in the Midwest increased speculation that
U.S.
crop totals would reach near record levels in 2014. Within the livestock markets, gains were achieved during June from long positions in lean hog futures as prices increased on speculation
U.S.
hog herds would remain low. Gains were also recorded during April from long positions in live cattle futures as prices advanced in the second half of the month after government reports indicated
U.S.
cattle herds shrank to their lowest levels in decades. During October, further gains were experienced from short positions in lean hog futures as prices moved lower as
U.S.
pig farms continued to recover from a virus that decimated hog herds earlier in the year. Within the metals complex, gains were recorded during March from short positions in copper futures as prices declined amid concern weak manufacturing data in
China
would limit demand for the industrial metal. Additional gains in the metals sector were achieved during February from long positions in gold futures as increased geo-political turmoil boosted demand and prices.
The Partnership is paid interest on 100% of the average daily equity maintained in cash in the Partnership's (or the Partnership's allocable portion of a Fund's) brokerage account at the monthly average of the 4-week
U.S.
Treasury bill discount rate. Any interest earned on the Partnership's account in excess of the amounts described above, if any, will be retained by MS&Co. and shared with the General Partner. All interest earned on
U.S.
Treasury bills and money market mutual fund securities will be retained by the Funds. Interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2015 increased by $394, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The increase in interest income was due to higher
U.S.
Treasury bill rates during the three months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014. Interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $2,270, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The decrease in interest income was due to lower average daily equity during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014. Interest earned by the Partnership will increase the net asset value of the Partnership. The amount of interest income earned by the Partnership depends on the average daily equity in the Partnership's and the Funds' accounts and upon interest rates over which neither the Partnership/Funds nor MS&Co. have control.
Ongoing selling agent fees are calculated as a percentage of the net asset value of each Class of Redeemable Units as of the end of each month and, therefore, are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be compared in relation to the fluctuations in monthly net asset values. Ongoing selling agent fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $24,419 and $98,627, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2014. The decrease in ongoing selling agent fees is due to lower average net assets per Class during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2014.
Management fees are calculated as a percentage of the net asset value of each Class of Redeemable Units allocated to the respective Advisor at the end of the month and, therefore, are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be compared in relation to the fluctuations in monthly net asset values. Management fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $23,008 and $96,615, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2014. The decrease in management fees is due to lower average net assets per Class during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2014.
General Partner fees are paid to the General Partner for administering the business and affairs of the Partnership. These fees are calculated as a percentage of the net asset value for each Class of Redeemable Units as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. General Partner fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $12,513 and $51,133, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2014. The decrease in General Partner fees is due to lower average net assets per Class during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2014.
Incentive fees are based on the new trading profits generated by each Advisor as defined in each Advisor's respective Management Agreement. There were no incentive fees earned for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Partnership pays professional fees and other expenses, which generally include legal and accounting expenses related to the offering, filing, reporting and data processing fees. Professional fees for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $247,739 and $279,762, respectively.
In the General Partner's opinion, the Advisors continue to employ trading methods and produce results consistent with their expected performance given market conditions and the objectives of the Partnership. The General Partner continues to monitor the Advisors' performance on a daily, weekly, monthly and annual basis to ensure that these objectives are met.
Commodity markets are highly volatile. Broad price fluctuations and rapid inflation increase the risks involved in commodity trading, but also increases the possibility of profit. The profitability of the Partnership depends on the existence of major price trends and the ability of the Advisors to correctly identify those price trends. Price trends are influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand relationships, weather, governmental, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies, national and international political and economic events and changes in interest rates. To the extent that market trends exist and the Advisors are able to identify them, the Partnership expects to increase capital through operations.
In selecting the "established" advisors for the Partnership, the General Partner considered, among other things, the Advisors' past performance, trading style, volatility of markets traded and fee requirements. In selecting "emerging" advisors for the Partnership, the General Partner conducts proprietary research and considers the background of the advisors' principals, as well as the advisors' trading styles, strategies and markets traded, expected volatility, trading results (to the extent available) and fee requirements. The General Partner may consider other factors in its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, (i) the quality of the advisor's risk control techniques, (ii) the quality of the advisor's research techniques and (iii) the advisor's company infrastructure and plan for development. Such information may be limited due to their "emerging" nature. The General Partner may modify or terminate the allocation of assets to an Advisor at any time and may allocate assets to additional advisors at any time.
(d) Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. None.
(e) Contractual Obligations. None.
(f) Operational Risk.
The Partnership, through its investment in the Funds, is directly exposed to market risk and credit risk, which arise in the normal course of its business activities. Slightly less direct, but of critical importance, are risks pertaining to operational and back office support. This is particularly the case in a rapidly changing and increasingly global environment with increasing transaction volumes and an expansion in the number and complexity of products in the marketplace.
Such risks include:
Operational/Settlement Risk - the risk of financial and opportunity loss and legal liability attributable to operational problems, such as inaccurate pricing of transactions, untimely trade execution, clearance and/or settlement, or the inability to process large volumes of transactions. The Partnership/Funds are subject to increased risks with respect to their trading activities in emerging market instruments, where clearance, settlement and custodial risks are often greater than in more established markets.
Technological Risk - the risk of loss attributable to technological limitations or hardware failure that constrain the Partnership's/Funds' ability to gather, process, and communicate information efficiently and securely, without interruption, to customers, and in the markets where the Partnership/Funds participates. Additionally, the General Partner's computer systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, mishandling or misuse, computer viruses or malware, cyber attacks and other events that could have a security impact on such systems. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize a limited partner's personal, confidential, proprietary or other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, the General Partner's computer systems, and adversely affect the Partnership's/Funds' business, financial condition or results of operations.
Legal/Documentation Risk - the risk of loss attributable to deficiencies in the documentation of transactions (such as trade confirmations) and customer relationships (such as master netting agreements) or errors that result in noncompliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Financial Control Risk - the risk of loss attributable to limitations in financial systems and controls. Strong financial systems and controls ensure that assets are safeguarded, that transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization, and that financial information utilized by the General Partner and communicated to external parties, including the Partnership's Redeemable Unit holders, creditors, and regulators, is free of material errors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(g) Critical Accounting Policies.
Partnership's Investments: The Partnership's investments in the Funds are stated at fair value, which are based on (1) the Partnership's net contribution to each Fund and (2) its allocated share of the undistributed profits and losses, including realized gains/losses and the change in net unrealized gains/losses, of each Fund. Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820, "Fair Value Measurement," as amended, permits, as a practical expedient, the Partnership to measure the fair value of its investments in the Funds on the basis of the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) if the net asset value per share of such investments is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of ASC Topic 946 "Financial Services- Investment Companies" as of the Partnership's reporting date.
Funds' Investments. All commodity interests of the Funds, including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments, held by the Funds are held for trading purposes. The commodity interests are recorded on trade date and open contracts are recorded at fair value at the measurement date. Investments in commodity interests denominated in foreign currencies are translated into
U.S.
dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the measurement date. Gains or losses are realized when contracts are liquidated and are determined using the first-in, firstout method. Unrealized gains or losses on open contracts are included as a component of equity in trading account in the Funds' Statements of Financial Condition. Net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized gains or losses are reported in the Funds' Statements of Income and Expenses.
Funds' Fair Value Measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to fair values derived from unobservable inputs (Level 3). The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The fair value of exchange-traded futures, option and forward contracts is determined by the various exchanges, and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of business on the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period from various exchanges. The fair value of non-exchange-traded foreign currency option contracts is calculated by applying an industry standard model application for options valuation of foreign currency options, using as input the spot prices, interest rates and option implied volatilities quoted as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period.
U.S.
Treasury bills are valued at the last available bid price received from independent pricing services as of the close of the last business day of the reporting period.
The Funds consider prices for exchange-traded commodity futures, forward, swap and option contracts to be based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1). The values of
U.S.
Treasury bills, non-exchange-traded forward, swap and certain option contracts for which market quotations are not readily available are priced by broker quotes or pricing services that derive fair values for those assets and liabilities from observable inputs (Level 2). As of and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Funds did not hold any derivative instruments that were priced at fair value using unobservable inputs through the application of the General Partner's assumptions and internal valuation pricing models (Level 3).
Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2.
Futures Contracts. The Funds trade futures contracts. A futures contract is a firm commitment to buy or sell a specified quantity of investments, currency or a standardized amount of a deliverable grade commodity, at a specified price on a specified future date, unless the contract is closed before the delivery date or if the delivery quantity is something where physical delivery cannot occur (such as the S&P 500 Index), whereby such contract is settled in cash. Payments ("variation margin") may be made or received by the Funds each business day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying contracts, and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the Funds. When the contract is closed, the Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed. Transactions in futures contracts require participants to make both initial margin deposits of cash or other assets and variation margin deposits, through the futures broker, directly with the exchange on which the contracts are traded. Net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on futures contracts are included in the Funds' Statements of Income and Expenses.
London Metals Exchange Forward Contracts. Metal contracts traded on the London Metals Exchange ("LME") represent a firm commitment to buy or sell a specified quantity of aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin or zinc. LME contracts traded by the Funds are cash settled based on prompt dates published by the LME. Payments ("variation margin") may be made or received by the Funds each business day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying contracts, and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the Funds. A contract is considered offset when all long positions have been matched with a like number of short positions settling on the same prompt date. When the contract is closed at the prompt date, the Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed. Transactions in LME contracts require participants to make both initial margin deposits of cash or other assets and variation margin deposits, through the broker, directly with the LME. Net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on metal contracts are included in the Funds' Statements of Income and Expenses.
Options. The Funds may purchase and write (sell) both exchange-listed and OTC options on commodities or financial instruments. An option is a contract allowing, but not requiring, its holder to buy (call) or sell (put) a specific or standard commodity or financial instrument at a specified price during a specified time period. The option premium is the total price paid or received for the option contract. When the Funds write an option, the premium received is recorded as a liability in the Funds' Statements of Financial Condition and marked-to market daily. When the Funds purchase an option, the premium paid is recorded as an asset in the Funds' Statements of Financial Condition and marked-to-market daily. Net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on option contracts are included in the Funds' Statements of Income and Expenses. The Funds do not isolate the portion of the results of operations arising from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from fluctuations due to changes in market prices of investments held. Such fluctuations are included in total trading results in the Funds' Statements of Income and Expenses.
As both a buyer and seller of options, the Funds pay or receive a premium at the outset and then bear the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option. Written options expose the Funds to potentially unlimited liability; for purchased options, the risk of loss is limited to the premiums paid. Certain written put options permit cash settlement and do not require the option holder to own the reference asset. The Funds do not consider these contracts to be guarantees.

Commodity Advisors Fund L.P. 
Notes to Financial Statements  June 30, 2013  (Unaudited) 
1.����General: 
Commodity Advisors Fund L.P. (formerly known as �Energy Advisors Portfolio L.P.�) (the
�Partnership�) is a limited partnership which was organized on January 30, 2006, under the limited partnership laws of the State of Delaware. The Partnership commenced trading on October 1, 2006. Between October 1, 2006 and May 1, 2011,
the Partnership was operated pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(4). Prior to May 1, 2011, the Partnership�s investment objective was to achieve capital appreciation through speculative trading, directly and indirectly, primarily in energy related
investments, including, without limitation, energy futures, energy forwards, options, swaps and other over-the-counter (�OTC�) instruments and securities of energy related companies. Also, prior to May 1, 2011, the Partnership pursued its
objective by allocating its capital among various energy focused portfolio managers, each of which had an individual trading strategy, primarily through investments in collective investment vehicles, including those operated by the General Partner
and, occasionally, through individually managed accounts.  The current objective of the Partnership is to achieve capital
appreciation through speculative trading, directly and indirectly, in U.S. and international markets for currencies, interest rates, stock indices, agricultural and energy products and precious and base metals. The Partnership may employ futures,
options on futures and forward contracts in those markets. The Partnership may also engage in spot, swap and other derivative transactions with the approval of the General Partner. The commodity interests that are traded by the Partnership, through
its investment in the Funds (as defined in note 5 �Investment in Funds�), are volatile and involve a high degree of market risk.  Between June 23, 2006 (commencement of the initial offering period) and October 1, 2006, 9,475 redeemable units of limited partnership interest (�Redeemable Units�) were sold at $1,000 per
Redeemable Unit. The Partnership commenced its operations on October�1, 2006. The Partnership privately and continuously offers Redeemable Units to qualified investors. There is no maximum number of Redeemable Units that may be sold by the
Partnership.  Ceres Managed Futures LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, acts as the general partner (the �General
Partner�) and commodity pool operator of the Partnership. The General Partner is wholly owned by Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Holdings LLC (�MSSB Holdings�). MSSB Holdings is ultimately owned by Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley is a
publicly held company whose shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Morgan Stanley is engaged in various financial services and other businesses. Prior to June 28, 2013, Morgan Stanley indirectly owned a majority equity interest in MSSB
Holdings and Citigroup Inc. indirectly owned a minority equity interest in MSSB Holdings. Prior to July�31, 2009, the date as of which MSSB Holdings became its owner, the General Partner was wholly owned by Citigroup Financial Products Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc., the sole owner of which is Citigroup Inc.  From inception
until May 1, 2011, the Partnership offered two classes of redeemable units of partnership interest: �Class A� Redeemable Units and �Class B� Redeemable Units. As of June 30, 2011, the Partnership no longer offered Class B
Redeemable Units. Beginning May 1, 2011, the Partnership began to offer two additional classes of Redeemable Units in addition to Class A Redeemable Units: �Class D� Redeemable and �Class Z� Redeemable Units. 
Class Z Redeemable Units were first issued on October�1, 2011. As of June 30, 2013, there were no Redeemable Units outstanding in
Class D. Class�A Redeemable Units, Class D Redeemable Units and Class Z Redeemable Units will each be referred to as a �Class� and collectively referred to as the �Classes.� The class of Redeemable Units that a limited
partner receives upon a subscription will generally depend upon the amount invested in the Partnership or the status of the limited partner, although the General Partner may determine to offer any class of Redeemable Units to investors at its
discretion. Class Z Redeemable Units are offered to certain employees of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and its affiliates (and their family members).  ��������As of June 30, 2013, all trading decisions were made for the Partnership by its four trading advisors (each an �Advisor�, and collectively the
�Advisors�).�JE Moody & Company LLC (�JE Moody�), Krom River Investment Management (Cayman) Limited (�Krom River Management�) and Krom River Trading A.G. (�Krom River Trading� and together with Krom
River Management, �Krom River�) and Aventis Asset Management, LLC (formerly known as Misfit Financial Group, LLC) (�Aventis�) have been selected by the General Partner as the major commodity trading advisors to the Partnership.
In addition, the General Partner has allocated the Partnership�s assets to additional non-major trading advisors�(i.e. commodity trading advisors allocated less than 10% of the Partnership�s assets). Information about advisors that
are allocated less than 10% of the Partnership�s assets may not be disclosed. The General Partner may allocate less than 10% of the Partnership�s assets to a new trading advisor or another trading program of a current Advisor at any
time.�The Advisors are not affiliated with one another, are not affiliated with the General Partner or CGM and are not responsible for the organization or operation of the Partnership. The General Partner will generally allocate the assets of
the Partnership to �established� trading advisors (i.e., advisors with established trading strategies), but may also allocate assets to �emerging� trading advisors (i.e. trading advisors in the process of developing and refining
their trading strategies). The General Partner has selected and will select commodity trading advisors for the Partnership that it believes possess the potential to be successful traders. The Advisors have various levels of experience in
speculatively trading commodity interests and have various levels of experience in managing client funds.  Each Advisor is
allocated a portion of the Partnership�s assets to manage. The Partnership invests the portion of its assets allocated to each of the Advisors indirectly through investment in the Funds. 
The General Partner and each limited partner share in the profits and losses of the Partnership in proportion to the amount of
Partnership interest owned by each, except that no limited partner shall be liable for obligations of the Partnership in excess of its capital contribution and profits, if any, net of distributions and losses, if any. 
��������The accompanying financial statements and accompanying notes are unaudited but, in the opinion of
management, include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the Partnership�s financial condition at June 30, 2013 and December�31, 2012, the results of its operations for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and changes in partners� capital for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012. These financial statements present the results of interim periods and do not include all disclosures normally
provided in annual financial statements. You should read these financial statements together with the financial statements and notes included in the Partnership�s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
�SEC�) for the year ended December 31, 2012 and Amendment No. 2 to the Partnership�s Registration Statement on Form 10-12G/A filed with the SEC on April 26, 2013. 
The preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (�GAAP�) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. As a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.  Due to the nature of
commodity trading, the results of operations for the interim periods presented should not be considered indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.

Due to rounding.  The above capital ratios may
vary for individual investors based on the timing of capital transactions during the period. Additionally, these ratios are calculated for the limited partner class using the limited partners� share of income, expenses and average net assets.

3.����Trading Activities: 
The Partnership was formed for the purpose of trading contracts in a variety of commodity interests, including
derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments. However, the Partnership�s investments are in other funds. The results of the Partnership�s trading activities from its investments in the Funds are shown in the
Statements of Income and Expenses.  Subsequent to June 30, 2013, CMF Cirrus Master Fund L.P., MB Master Fund L.P., KR Master
Fund L.P. and JEM Master Fund L.P. entered into brokerage account agreements with Morgan Stanley�& Co. LLC (�MS&Co�) and expect to commence trading during the third quarter of 2013. The Partnership, through its investment in
the Funds, will pay MS&Co. a service fee equal to $0.70 per round-turn for futures transactions, an equivalent amount for swaps, excluding forward foreign currency transactions, and $0.35 per side for option transactions, excluding foreign
exchange.   The customer agreements between the
Partnership/Funds and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (�CGM�)/MS&Co, as applicable gives the Partnership and the Funds the legal right to net unrealized gains and losses on open futures and open forward contracts. The Partnership and the
Funds net, for financial reporting purposes, the unrealized gains and losses on open futures and open forward contracts on the Statements of Financial Condition as the criteria under Accounting Standards Codification (�ASC�) 210-20, �Balance Sheet,� have been met.  Ongoing selling agent fees are calculated
as a percentage of the Partnership�s adjusted net asset value on the last day of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions.  On January 1, 2013, the Partnership adopted Accounting Standards Update (�ASU�) 2011-11, �Disclosure about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities� and ASU 2013-01, �Clarifying the
Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities�. ASU 2011-11 created a new disclosure requirement about the nature of an entity�s rights to setoff and the related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and
derivative instruments, while ASU 2013-01 clarified the types of instruments and transactions that are subject to the offsetting disclosure requirements established by ASU 2011-11. Entities are required to disclose both gross information and net
information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. The objective of these disclosures is to
facilitate comparison between those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of U.S. GAAP and those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of International Financial Reporting Standards. The new guidance
did not have a significant impact on the Partnership�s financial statements.

4.����Fair Value Measurements: 
Partnership�s and the Funds� Investments. All commodity interests held by the Partnership (including
derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments), through its investment in the Funds, are held for trading purposes. The commodity interests are recorded on trade date and open contracts are recorded at fair value (as
described below) at the measurement date. Investments in commodity interests denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the measurement date. Gains or losses are realized when contracts are
liquidated. Unrealized gains or losses on open contracts are included as a component of equity in trading account on the Funds� Statements of Financial Condition. Net realized gains or losses and any change in net unrealized gains or losses
from the preceding period are reported in the Funds� Statements of Income and Expenses.  Partnership�s and the
Funds� Fair Value Measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market
conditions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to fair values derived from unobservable inputs (Level 3). The level
in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Management has concluded that based on
available information in the marketplace, the Funds� Level 1 assets and liabilities are actively traded.  GAAP also
requires the use of judgment in determining if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when the market has become inactive. Management has concluded that based on available information in the marketplace, there
has not been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity in the Partnership�s and the Funds� Level 2 assets and liabilities.  The Partnership and the Funds will separately present purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in their reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements (i.e., to present such items on a gross basis
rather than on a net basis), and make disclosures regarding the level of disaggregation and the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for measurements that fall within either Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as
required under GAAP.  On October 1, 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the �FASB�) issued ASU 2012-04
�Technical Corrections and Improvements,� which makes minor technical corrections and clarifications to Accounting Standards Codification (�ASC�) 820, �Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.� When the FASB issued
Statement 157 (codified in ASC 820), it conformed the use of the term �fair value� in certain pre-Codification standards but not others. ASU 2012-04 conforms the term�s use throughout the ASC �to fully reflect the fair value
measurement and disclosure requirements� of ASC 820. ASU 2012-04 also amends the requirements that must be met for an investment company to qualify for the exemption from presenting a statement of cash flows. Specifically, it eliminates the
requirements that substantially all of an entity�s investments be carried at �market value� and that the investments be highly liquid. Instead, it requires substantially all of the entity�s investments to be carried at �fair
value� and classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements under ASC 820. The amendments are effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Partnership�s
financial statements.  The Partnership and the Funds consider prices for exchange-traded commodity futures, forwards and
options contracts to be based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1). The values of non-exchange-traded forwards, swaps and certain options contracts for which market
quotations are not readily available are priced by broker-dealers who derive fair values for those assets and liabilities from observable inputs (Level 2). Investments in funds (other commodity pools) with no rights or obligations inherent within
the ownership interest held by the Partnership are priced based on the end of the day net asset value (Level�2). The value of the Partnership�s investments in funds reflects its proportional interest in the funds. As of and for the periods
ended June�30, 2013 and December�31, 2012, the Partnership and the Funds did not hold any derivative instruments that were priced at fair value using unobservable inputs through the application of management�s assumptions and internal
valuation pricing models (Level�3). There were no transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 during the six months ended June 30, 2013 and for the year ended December 31, 2012.

during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2013.  Cirrus Master�s, MB Master�s, KR Master�s and JEM
Master�s, (collectively, the �Funds�) trading of futures, forwards, swaps and options contracts, if applicable, on commodities is done primarily on U.S. and foreign commodity exchanges. The Funds engage in such trading through
commodity brokerage accounts maintained with CGM and/or MS&Co, as applicable.  A limited partner of the Funds may withdraw
all or part of its capital contribution and undistributed profits, if any, from the Funds as of the end of any day the �Redemption Day� after a request for redemption has been made to the General Partner at least three days in advance of
the Redemption Date. Such withdrawals are classified as a liability when the limited partner elects to redeem and informs the Funds.  Ongoing selling agent, management, administrative and incentive fees are charged at the Partnership level. All exchange, clearing, service, user, give-up, floor
brokerage and National Futures Association fees (collectively, the �clearing fees�) are borne by the Funds. All other fees and commissions are charged at the Partnership level. 
At June 30, 2013, the Partnership owned approximately 12.8%, 3.3%, 7.5% and 28.4% of Cirrus Master, MB Master, KR Master and JEM Master,
respectively. At December 31, 2012, the Partnership owned approximately 16.4%, 21.0%, 9.4% and 28.8% of Cirrus Master, MB Master, KR Master and JEM Master, respectively. It is the intention of the Partnership to continue to invest in the Funds. The
performance of the Partnership is directly affected by the performance of the Funds. Expenses to investors as a result of the investment in the Funds are approximately the same and redemption rights are not affected. 
Summarized information reflecting the total assets, liabilities and capital for the Funds is shown in the following tables.

In the normal course of business, the Partnership, through its investments in the Funds, is a party to financial
instruments with off-balance sheet risk, including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments. These financial instruments may include forwards, futures, swaps and options, whose
values are based upon an underlying asset, index, or reference rate, and generally represent future commitments to exchange currencies or cash balances, or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specific terms at specified future dates,
or, in the case of derivative commodity instruments, or to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash, through physical delivery or with another financial instrument. These instruments may be traded on an exchange or OTC. Exchange-traded
instruments are standardized and include futures and certain forward and option contracts. OTC contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and include certain swaps, forwards and option contacts. Specific market movements of commodities or
futures contracts underlying an option cannot accurately be predicted. The purchaser of an option may lose the entire premium paid for the option. The writer or seller of an option has unlimited risk. Each of these instruments is subject to various
risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments including market and credit risk. In general, the risks associated with OTC contracts are greater than those associated with exchange-traded instruments because of the greater
risk of default by the counterparty to an OTC contract. Since May 1, 2011, none of the Partnership�s/Funds� contracts have traded OTC, although contracts may be traded OTC in the future. 
The risk to the limited partners that have purchased Redeemable Units is limited to the amount of their share of the Partnership�s
assets and undistributed profits. This limited liability is a result of the organization of the Partnership as a limited partnership under Delaware law.  Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the Funds due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in
commodity or security prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded. The Funds are exposed to a market risk equal to the value of futures and forward
contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.  Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may
occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. The Partnership�s/Funds� risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the Statements of
Financial Condition and is not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments. The Partnership�s/Funds� risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that
permit the Partnership/Funds to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events. The Partnership/Funds have credit risk and concentration risk as CGM and/or
MS&Co. or their affiliates are the counterparties or brokers with respect to the Funds� assets. Credit risk with respect to exchange-traded instruments is reduced to the extent that, through CGM and/or MS&Co, the
Partnership�s/Funds� counterparty is an exchange or clearing organization.  As both a buyer and seller of options,
the Funds pay or receive a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option. Written options expose the Funds to potentially unlimited liability; for purchased options, the risk
of loss is limited to the premiums paid. Certain written put options permit cash settlement and do not require the option holder to own the reference asset. The Funds do not consider these contracts to be guarantees. 
The General Partner monitors and attempts to control the Fund�s risk exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and risk
management monitoring systems, and accordingly, believes that it has effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the Partnership/Funds may be subject. These monitoring systems generally allow the General
Partner to statistically analyze actual trading results with risk adjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics. In addition, online monitoring systems provide account analysis of futures, forwards and options positions by sector,
margin requirements, gain and loss transactions and collateral positions.  The majority of these financial instruments mature
within one year of the inception date. However, due to the nature of the Funds� businesses, these instruments may not be held to maturity.

Commodity Advisors Fund L.P. 
Notes to Financial Statements  June 30, 2013  (Unaudited) 
�
7.����Critical Accounting Policies: 
Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. As a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. 
Partnership�s and the Funds� Investments. All
commodity interests held by the Partnership (including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments), through its investment in the Funds, are held for trading purposes. The commodity interests are recorded on the trade date
and open contracts are recorded at fair value (as described below) at the measurement date. Investments in commodity interests denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the measurement
date. Gains or losses are realized when contracts are liquidated. Unrealized gains or losses on open contracts are included as a component of equity in trading account on the Funds� Statements of Financial Condition. Net realized gains or
losses and any change in net unrealized gains or losses from the preceding period are reported in the Statements of Income and Expenses. 
Partnership�s and the Funds� Fair Value Measurements. Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value hierarchy gives the
highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to fair values derived from unobservable inputs (Level 3). The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the
fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Management has concluded that based on available information in the marketplace, the
Funds� Level 1 assets and liabilities are actively traded.  GAAP also requires the use of judgment in determining if a
formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when the market has become inactive. Management has concluded that based on available information in the marketplace, there has not been a significant decrease in the volume
and level of activity in the Partnership�s and the Funds� Level 2 assets and liabilities.  The Partnership and the
Funds will separately present purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in their reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements (i.e., to present such items on a gross basis rather than on a net basis), and make disclosures regarding the level
of disaggregation and the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for measurements that fall within either Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as required under GAAP. 
The Funds consider prices for exchange-traded commodity futures, forwards and options contracts to be based on unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets (Level 1). The values of non-exchange-traded forwards, swaps and certain options contracts for which market quotations are not readily available were priced by
broker-dealers who derive fair values for those assets and liabilities from observable inputs (Level 2). Investments in funds (other commodity pools) with no rights or obligations inherent within the ownership interest held by the Partnership are
priced based on the end of the day net asset value (Level 2). The value of the Partnership�s investments in the Funds reflects its proportional interest in the Funds. As of and for the periods ended June 30, 2013 and December�31, 2012, the
Partnership and the Funds did not hold any derivative instruments that were priced at fair value using unobservable inputs through the application of management�s assumptions and internal valuation pricing models (Level 3).
 There were no transfers of assets and liabilities between Level�1 and Level�2 during the six months ended June 30, 2013 and for the year ended December 31, 2012. 
Futures Contracts. The Funds trade futures contracts. A futures contract is a firm
commitment to buy or sell a specified quantity of investments, currency or a standardized amount of a deliverable grade commodity, at a specified price on a specified future date, unless the contract is closed before the delivery date or if the
delivery quantity is something where physical delivery cannot occur (such as the S&P 500 Index), whereby such contract is settled in cash. Payments (�variation margin�) may be made or received by the Funds each business day, depending
on the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying contracts, and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the Funds. When the contract is closed, the Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed. Transactions in futures contracts require participants to make both initial margin deposits of cash or other assets and variation margin deposits, through the futures
broker, directly with the exchange on which the contracts are traded. Net realized gains (losses) and changes in net unrealized gains (losses) on futures contracts are included in the Funds� Statements of Income and Expenses and Changes in
Partners� Capital. 

Forward Foreign Currency Contracts. Forward foreign currency
contracts are those contracts where the Funds agree to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of foreign currency for an agreed-upon price on an agreed future date. Forward foreign currency contracts are valued daily, and the Funds� net equity
therein, representing unrealized gain or loss on the contracts as measured by the difference between the forward foreign exchange rates at the dates of entry into the contracts and the forward rates at the reporting date, is included in the
Funds� Statements of Financial Condition. Net realized gains (losses) and changes in net unrealized gains (losses) on forward foreign currency contracts are recognized in the period in which the contract is closed or the changes occur,
respectively, and are included in the Funds� Statements of Income and Expenses and Changes in Partners� Capital. 
The Funds do not isolate the portion of the results of operations arising from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on
investments from fluctuations due to changes in market prices of investments held. Such fluctuations are included in net gain (loss) on investments in the Funds� Statements of Income and Expenses and Changes in Partners� Capital.

London Metals Exchange Forward Contracts. Metal contracts traded on the London
Metals Exchange (�LME�) represent a firm commitment to buy or sell a specified quantity of aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin or zinc. LME contracts traded by the Funds are cash settled based on prompt dates published by the LME. Payments
(�variation margin�) may be made or received by the Funds each business day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying contracts, and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the Funds. A contract is
considered offset when all long positions have been matched with a like number of short positions settling on the same prompt date. When the contract is closed at the prompt date, the Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference
between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed. Transactions in LME contracts require participants to make both initial margin deposits of cash or other assets and variation margin deposits,
through the broker, directly with the LME. Net realized gains (losses) and changes in net unrealized gains (losses) on metal contracts are included in the Funds� Statements of Income and Expenses and Changes in Partners� Capital.

Commodity Advisors Fund L.P. 
Notes to Financial Statements  June 30, 2013  (Unaudited) 
�
Options. The Funds may purchase and write (sell) both exchange�listed and OTC options on
commodities or financial instruments. An option is a contract allowing, but not requiring, its holder to buy (call) or sell (put) a specific or standard commodity or financial instrument at a specified price during a specified time period. The
option premium is the total price paid or received for the option contract. When the Funds write an option, the premium received is recorded as a liability in the Statements of Financial Condition and marked to market daily. When the Funds purchase
an option, the premium paid is recorded as an asset in the Statements of Financial Condition and marked to market daily. Net realized gains (losses) and changes in net unrealized gains (losses) on options contracts are included in the Statements of
Income and Expenses and Changes in Partners� Capital. 
Income Taxes. Income taxes have not been provided as each partner is individually liable
for the taxes, if any, on its share of the Partnership�s income and expenses.  GAAP provides guidance for how uncertain
tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements and requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Partnership�s financial statements to
determine whether the tax positions are �more-likely-than-not� to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions with respect to tax at the Partnership level not deemed to meet the
more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. The General Partner concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the Partnership�s financial
statements.  The Partnership files U.S. federal and various state and local tax returns. No income tax returns are currently
under examination. The 2009 through 2012 tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and most state tax authorities. The General Partner does not believe that there are any uncertain tax positions that require recognition of a tax
liability. 
Subsequent Events. The General Partner of the Partnership evaluates events
that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. The General Partner has assessed the subsequent events through the date of issuance and determined that, other than that described in Note 3 to the financial
statements, there were no subsequent events requiring adjustment of or disclosure in the financial statements. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In June 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-08, �Financial Services �
Investments Companies (Topic 946): Amendments to the Scope, Measurement and Disclosure Requirements�. ASU 2013-08 changes the approach to the investment company assessment, requires non-controlling ownership interests in other investment
companies to be measured at fair value, and requires additional disclosures about the investment company�s status as an investment company. The amendments are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013.
The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact this pronouncement would have on the financial statements. 
Net Income (Loss) per unit. Net income (loss) per unit is calculated in
accordance with investment company guidance. See Note 2, �Financial Highlights.�

Item�2.
Management�s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services. Its only assets are its investments in the Funds, interest receivable and cash. The Funds� only assets are their equity in trading
accounts, consisting of cash and cash margin, net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts, net unrealized appreciation on forward contracts and commodity options purchased, if applicable, and interest receivable. Because of the low margin
deposits normally required in commodity futures trading, relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the Partnership/Funds. While substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity, no such illiquidity
occurred in the second quarter of 2013.  The Partnership�s capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners
as increased or decreased by gains or losses on trading and by expenses, interest income, redemptions of Redeemable Units and distributions of profits, if any.  For the six months ended June 30, 2013, Partnership Capital decreased 13.1% from $35,141,447 to $30,543,297. This decrease was attributable to redemptions of 3,635.1130 Class A Redeemable Units totaling
$5,184,124 and 1,718.000 General Partner unit equivalents of Class Z Redeemable Units totaling $1,600,861, coupled with a net loss of $1,158,738. This was partially offset with subscriptions for 2,339.4960 Class A Redeemable Units totaling
$3,345,573. Future redemptions can impact the amount of funds available for investment in commodity contract positions in subsequent months. 
Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the financial statements are
reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Partnership�s significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 7 of the Financial Statements. 
The Partnership and the Funds record all investments at fair value in their financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as
a component of net realized gains (losses) and change in net unrealized trading gains (losses) in the Statements of Income and Expenses. 
Results of Operations 
During the second quarter of 2013, the Partnership�s net asset value per Class A Redeemable Unit decreased 1.1% from $1,417.66 to
$1,402.70 as compared to an decrease of 2.8% in the second quarter of 2012. During the second quarter of 2013, the Partnership�s net asset value per Class Z Redeemable Unit decreased 0.6% from $933.33 to $928.15 as compared to a decrease of
2.3% in the second quarter of 2012. The Partnership experienced a net trading gain through its investment in the Funds before clearing and related fees in the second quarter of 2013 of $165,304. Gains were primarily attributable to the Funds�
trading of commodity futures in energy, livestock, metals and softs and were partially offset by losses in grains. The Partnership experienced a net trading loss through its investment in the Funds before brokerage fees and related fees in the
second quarter of 2012 of $668,743. Losses were primarily attributable to the Funds trading in energy, livestock, metals and softs and were partially offset by gains in grains. 
The most significant losses were incurred in the grains during May from short futures positions in soybeans as prices advanced on strong
global export demand which drove U.S. supplies to a nine-year low. Further losses were incurred in grains trading during May from short futures positions in corn as prices climbed higher following a government report that indicated wet weather would
slow crop planting throughout the U.S. Midwest. The Partnership�s losses were offset by trading gains in the energy markets from short positions in crude oil futures as prices declined during May on contracting Chinese manufacturing and
speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve would cut its bond purchasing program. During May, additional gains were recorded in soft commodities from short futures positions in cotton as prices declined on speculation slowing growth in China would curb
demand. Trading in livestock was also profitable for the quarter as long futures positions in live cattle recorded gains during May on signs of increased demand for U.S. beef. Long positions in lean hog futures also posted gains. In metals, gains
were recorded primarily from short positions in gold futures during April as prices declined sharply on speculation Cyprus would be required to sell its gold reserves to accommodate a bail-out plan. 
During the Partnership�s six months ended June 30, 2013, the Partnership�s net asset value per Class A Redeemable Unit
decreased 3.4% from $1,452.61 to $1,402.70 as compared to a decrease of 4.0% in the six months ended June 30, 2012. During the Partnership�s six months ended June 30, 2013, the Partnership�s net asset value per Class Z Redeemable Unit
decreased 2.5% from $951.57 to $928.15 as compared to a decrease of 3.0% in the six months ended June 30, 2012. The Partnership experienced a net trading gain through its investment in the Funds before brokerage fees and related fees in the six
months ended June 30, 2013 of $79,269. Gains were primarily attributable to the Fund�s trading of commodity futures in livestock and metals and were partially offset by losses in energy, grains and softs. The Partnership experienced a net
trading loss through its investment in the Funds before brokerage fees and related fees in the six months ended June 30, 2012 of $562,114. Losses were primarily attributable to the Funds trading in livestock, metals and softs and were partially
offset by gains in energy and grains.  The most significant losses were incurred in the grain markets during May from short
futures positions in soybeans and corn as prices advanced on reports of increased global demand for U.S. crops and poor weather conditions throughout much of the Midwest. Further losses were incurred in this sector from short futures positions in
corn during January as prices advanced on concern drier weather would deplete soil moisture in South America and increase stress on crops. In energy trading, losses were incurred during March from long futures positions in Brent crude oil as prices
continued to decline during the month due to a slowing economy and weakening global demand. Further losses were incurred in energy trading during February from long futures positions in RBOB gasoline as prices declined on the back of declining oil
prices amid weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data. In soft commodities trading, losses were incurred during February from long sugar futures positions as sugar prices declined to a 30-month low on signs cane crops were getting enough moisture to
boost harvests in Brazil. A portion of the Partnership�s losses for the first six months of 2013 was offset by gains from trading livestock and metal futures. The most significant trading gains were recorded within the livestock sector during
February from short futures positions in lean hogs as prices declined on weaker domestic demand for pork. Further gains were recorded by the Partnership from long positions in live cattle futures during May as prices rose on signs of increasing
demand for U.S. beef. In the metals complex, profits were recorded during January primarily from long futures positions in platinum as prices increased on reports of supply disruptions in South Africa, the world�s largest platinum producer.
Further gains in metals resulted from short futures positions in gold as prices declined sharply during April as Cyprus planned to sell gold to raise money, while minutes from a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting spurred speculation that U.S. stimulus
will be curbed.  Commodity futures markets are highly volatile. Broad and rapid price fluctuations increase the risks involved
in commodity trading, but also increase the possibility for profit or loss. The profitability of the Funds depends on the existence of major price trends and the ability of the Advisors to identify those price trends correctly. Price trends are
influenced by, among other things, changing supply and demand relationships, weather, governmental, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies, national and international political and economic events and changes in interest rates. To
the extent that market trends exist and the Advisors are able to identify them, the Funds expect to increase capital through operations.  Interest income on 100% of the average daily equity maintained in cash in the Partnership�s (or the Partnership�s allocable portion of Funds�) brokerage accounts was earned at a 30-day U.S.
Treasury bill rate determined weekly by CGM based on the average non-competitive yield on 90 day U.S. Treasury bills maturing in 30 days. Interest income from investment in Funds for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 decreased $3,984 and
$3,405, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2012. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to lower U.S. Treasury bill rates and lower average daily equity during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, as
compared to the corresponding periods in 2012. Interest earned by the Partnership will increase the net asset value of the Partnership. The amount of interest income earned by the Partnership depends on the average daily equity in the
Partnership�s and the Funds� accounts and upon interest rates over which neither the Partnership/Funds nor CGM has control.  The Partnership pays (or reimburses CGM if previously paid) for all actual transaction fees, including any clearing fees, applicable to the Partnership�s trading. Clearing fees for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2013, decreased by $32,546 and 23,577, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2012. The decrease in clearing fees is primarily due to a decrease in the number of trades during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2013, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2012.  Ongoing selling agent fees are calculated as a percentage of
the Partnership�s adjusted net asset value for each Class of Redeemable Units as of the end of each month and, therefore, are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the
fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. Ongoing selling agent fees for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 decreased by $8,817 and $10,240, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2012. The decrease in ongoing
selling agent fees is due to lower adjusted net assets per Class during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2012.  Management fees are calculated as a percentage of the net asset value of each Class of Redeemable Units allocated to the respective Advisor at the end of the month and, therefore, is affected by trading
performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. Management fees for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 decreased by $47,890 and $100,364,
respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2012. The decrease in management fees is due to lower adjusted net assets per Class during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2012.
 Administrative fees are paid to the General Partner for administering the business and affairs of the Partnership. These fees
are calculated as a percentage of the net asset value for each Class of Redeemable Units as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the
fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. Administrative fees for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 decreased by $27,547 and $57,242, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2012. The decrease in administrative fees
is due to lower adjusted net assets per Class during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2012.  ��������Incentive fees are based on the new trading profits generated by each Advisor as defined in the respective management agreement among the Partnership, the
General Partner and each Advisor and are payable quarterly. Trading performance for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 resulted in incentive fees of $52,192 and $86,061, respectively. Trading performance for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2012 resulted in incentive fees of $15,588 and $40,460, respectively. To the extent an Advisor incurs a loss for the Partnership, the Advisor will not be paid an incentive fee until such Advisor receives any net loss incurred by the Advisor
and earns additional new trading profits for the Partnership.

Item�3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  All of the Partnership�s assets are subject to the risk of trading loss through its investments in the Funds. The Funds are speculative commodity pools. The market sensitive instruments held by them
are acquired for speculative trading purposes, and all or substantially all of the Funds� assets are subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the
Funds� main line of business.  The limited partners will not be liable for losses exceeding the current net asset value
of their investment.  Market movements result in frequent changes in the fair value of the Funds� open positions and,
consequently, in their earnings and cash balances. The Funds� market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial
instruments and contracts, the diversification effects of the Funds� open contracts and the liquidity of the markets in which they trade.  The Funds rapidly acquire and liquidate both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets. Consequently, it is not possible to predict how a particular future market scenario will affect
performance, and the Funds� past performance is not necessarily indicative of their future results.  �Value at
Risk� is a measure of the maximum amount which the Funds could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market sector. However, the inherent uncertainty of the Funds� speculative trading and the recurrence in the markets traded by the
Funds of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated Value at Risk or the Funds� experience to date (i.e., �risk of
ruin�). In light of the foregoing as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the inclusion of the quantification in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the
Funds� losses in any market sector will be limited to Value at Risk or by the Funds� attempts to manage its market risk.  Exchange maintenance margin requirements have been used by the Funds as the measure of their Value at Risk. Maintenance margin requirements are set by exchanges to equal or exceed the maximum losses
reasonably expected to be incurred in the fair value of any given contract in 95%-99% of any one-day interval. The margin levels are established by dealers and exchanges
using historical price studies as well as an assessment of current market volatility, (including the implied volatility of the options on a given futures contract) and economic fundamentals to provide a probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected
near-term one-day price fluctuation. Maintenance margin has been used rather than the more generally available initial margin, because initial margin includes a credit risk component, which is not relevant to Value at Risk. 
Value at Risk tables represent a probabilistic assessment of the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments. The Advisors
currently trade the Partnership�s assets indirectly in master fund managed accounts established in the name of the Funds, over which they have been granted limited authority to make trading decisions. The first two trading Value at Risk tables
reflect the market sensitive instruments held by the Partnership indirectly, through its investments in the Funds. The remaining trading Value at Risk tables reflect the market sensitive instruments, held indirectly by each Fund, separately. There
have been no material changes in the trading Value at Risk information previously disclosed in the Partnership�s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Item�4.
Controls and Procedures 
The Partnership�s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Partnership on the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the �Exchange Act�), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods expected in the SEC�s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports it files is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and
Chief Financial Officer (�CFO�) of the General Partner, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure and appropriate SEC filings.  The General Partner is responsible for ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for establishing, maintaining and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures for the Partnership�s
external disclosures.  The General Partner�s President and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of the Partnership�s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2013 and, based on that evaluation, the General
Partner�s President and CFO have concluded that at that date, the Partnership�s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  The Partnership�s internal control over financial reporting is a process under the supervision of the General Partner�s President and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These controls include policies and procedures that:  �


�
�
 pertain to the maintenance of records, that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Partnership;  �


�
�
 provide reasonable assurance that (i)�transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP, and (ii)�the Partnership�s receipts are handled and expenditures are made only pursuant to authorizations of the General Partner; and  �


�
�
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection and correction of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Partnership�s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  There were no
changes in the Partnership�s internal control over financial reporting process during the fiscal quarter ended June�30, 2013 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership�s internal control
over financial reporting.

Item�1.
Legal Proceedings.  There are no
material legal proceedings pending against the Partnership nor the General Partner.  The following information supplements and amends the
discussion set forth under Part I, Item�3 �Legal Proceedings� in the Partnership�s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December�31, 2012, as updated by the Partnership�s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended March�31, 2013.  Citigroup Global Markets Inc. 
Subprime Mortgage�Related Litigation and Other Matters  Securities Actions:   On May�31, 2013, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York entered an order dismissing with prejudice the consolidated action INTERNATIONAL FUND MANAGEMENT S.A., ET AL. v. CITIGROUP INC., ET AL. and the individual action SWISSCANTO ASSET MANAGEMENT AG, ET
AL. v. CITIGROUP INC., ET AL. pursuant to settlement agreements reached by the parties.  RMBS Litigation and Other Matters 
Beginning in July 2010, Citigroup and Related Parties have been named as defendants in complaints filed by purchasers of mortgage-backed
securities (�MBS�) and collateralized debt obligations (�CDOs�) sold or underwritten by Citigroup and certain of its subsidiaries. The MBS-related complaints generally assert that the defendants made material misrepresentations
and omissions about the credit quality of the mortgage loans underlying the securities, such as the underwriting standards to which the loans conformed, the loan-to-value ratio of the loans, and the extent to which the mortgaged properties were
owner-occupied, and typically assert claims under Section�11 of the Securities Act of 1933, state blue sky laws, and/or common-law misrepresentation-based causes of action. The CDO-related complaints further allege that the defendants adversely
selected or permitted the adverse selection of CDO collateral without full disclosure to investors. The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek rescission of their investments, recovery of their investment losses, or other damages. Other
purchasers of MBS and CDOs sold or underwritten by Citigroup have threatened to file additional suits, for some of which Citigroup has agreed to toll (extend) the statute of limitations. 
� 24 


Table of Contents
The filed actions generally are in the early stages of proceedings, and certain of the
actions or threatened actions have been resolved through settlement or otherwise. The aggregate original purchase amount of the purchases at issue in the pending RMBS and CDO investor suits, including claims that have been dismissed but are still
subject to appeal or otherwise not fully resolved, is approximately $8 billion, and the aggregate original purchase amount of the purchases covered by tolling agreements with RMBS and CDO investors threatening litigation is approximately $6 billion.
 On May�29, 2013, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York so-ordered the parties�
stipulation of voluntary dismissal with prejudice in FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY v. CITIGROUP INC., ET AL. On June�24, 2013, the court entered orders of voluntary dismissal with prejudice and bar orders in FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY v.
JPMORGAN CHASE�& CO., ET AL. and FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY v. ALLY FINANCIAL INC., ET AL., dismissing with prejudice all claims against Citigroup in those actions. 
On April�30, 2013, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued an order reinstating certain RMBS
claims on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of mortgage-backed securities issued by Residential Accredit Loans, Inc. in NEW JERSEY CARPENTERS HEALTH FUND v. RESIDENTIAL CAPITAL LLC, ET AL. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is named as an
underwriter defendant, along with several other underwriter defendants, in plaintiffs� consolidated third amended complaint, served on May�10, 2013.  Terra Firma Litigation  On September�15, 2010, the district court
issued an order granting in part and denying in part Citigroup�s motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs� claims for negligent misrepresentation and tortious interference were dismissed. On October�18, 2010, a jury trial commenced on
Plaintiffs� remaining claims for fraudulent misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment. The court dismissed the fraudulent concealment claim before sending the case to the jury. On November�4, 2010, the jury returned a verdict on the
fraudulent misrepresentation claim in favor of Citi. Judgment dismissing the complaint was entered on December�9, 2010. Plaintiffs have appealed the judgment as to the negligent misrepresentation claim, the fraudulent concealment claim and the
fraudulent misrepresentation claim to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Argument was held on October�4, 2012. On May�31, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the November 2010
jury verdict in favor of Citigroup and ordered that the case be retried. The action was remanded to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and retrial is scheduled to begin on October�7, 2013. 
Other Matters  On
May�6, 2013, Citibank, N.A. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Barclays Bank, PLC, seeking payment under a contractual indemnity for losses suffered as a result of foreign
exchange trading by Lehman Brothers Inc. in September 2008.

Credit Default Swaps Information Market Matters 
In April 2011, the European Commission (DG Competition) (the �EC�) opened an investigation (Case No COMP/39.745) concerning the
market for pricing information concerning credit default swaps (�CDS�). On July�2, 2013, the EC served on Citigroup and Related Parties, as well as a dozen other CDS dealers, a Statement of Objections alleging that Citigroup and the
other dealers colluded to prevent exchanges from entering the credit derivatives business. The Statement of Objections sets forth the EC case team�s preliminary conclusions prior to hearing the dealers� defenses. 
In July 2009 and September 2011, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice served Civil Investigative Demands
(�CIDs�) on Citigroup concerning its role in Markit, a financial information services firm that collects and disseminates valuation and other data relating to credit default swaps. Citigroup has responded to the CIDs and is cooperating
with the investigation.  Interbank Offered Rates-Related litigation and Other Matters 
On June�14, 2013, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (�MAS�) announced the results of its review of the submissions
processes from 2007 to 2011 of twenty banks, including Citibank, N.A. Singapore Branch, for benchmarks set in Singapore, including the Singapore Interbank Offered Rates (�SIBOR�), Swap Offered Rates, and foreign exchange benchmarks used to
settle non-deliverable forward FX contracts. All of the banks, including Citibank, N.A. Singapore Branch, were found to have deficiencies in governance, risk management, internal controls, and surveillance systems relating to benchmark submissions,
and all were required, among other things, to adopt certain corrective measures, to make quarterly reports to the MAS, and (with one exception) to deposit additional statutory reserves with the MAS for a period of one year. 
On June�11, 2013, the plaintiff in 7 W. 57TH ST. REALTY V. CITIGROUP, INC., ET AL., filed a First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff
alleges that defendants, including Citigroup and Citibank, N.A., manipulated USD LIBOR in violation of federal and state antitrust law and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and seeks compensatory damages and, where authorized
by statute, treble damages.  On May�20, 2013, an individual action was brought against Citigroup and Citibank, N.A., as
well as other USD LIBOR panel banks on behalf of certain hedge funds that were parties to interest rate swap transactions. Based on allegations that the panel bank defendants manipulated USD LIBOR, plaintiffs assert claims for breach of contract,
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, tortious interference with contract, civil conspiracy, and unjust enrichment, and seek compensatory damages. 
On June�25 and 28, 2013, three additional individual actions were brought against Citigroup and Citibank, N.A., as well as other USD
LIBOR panel banks by various California counties and related public entities. Plaintiffs in each of these actions allege that the panel bank defendants manipulated USD LIBOR in violation of federal and state antitrust law. Plaintiffs

Morgan Stanley�& Co. LLC  On June�1, 2011, Morgan Stanley�& Co. Incorporated converted from a Delaware corporation to a Delaware limited liability company. As a result of that conversion, Morgan Stanley�&
Co. Incorporated is now named Morgan Stanley�& Co. LLC (�MS&Co.� or the �Company�).  MS&Co. is a
wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of Morgan Stanley (�MS�), a Delaware holding company. MS files periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which include current
descriptions of material litigation and material proceedings and investigations, if any, by governmental and/or regulatory agencies or self-regulatory organizations concerning MS and its subsidiaries, including MS&Co. As a consolidated
subsidiary of MS, MS&Co. does not file its own periodic reports with the SEC that contain descriptions of material litigation, proceedings and investigations. As a result, we refer you to the �Legal Proceedings� section of MS�s
SEC 10-K filings for 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, and 2008.  In addition to the matters described in those filings, in the normal course of
business, each of MS and MS&Co. has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial
services institution. Certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Each of MS and MS&Co. is also involved, from time to time, in investigations
and proceedings by governmental and/or regulatory agencies or self-regulatory organizations, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, fines or penalties. The number of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with
regard to many financial services institutions, including MS and MS&Co.  MS&Co. is a Delaware limited liability company with its main
business office located at 1585 Broadway, New York, New York 10036. Among other registrations and memberships, MS&Co. is registered as a futures commission merchant and is a member of the National Futures Association. 
During the preceding five years, the following administrative, civil, or criminal actions pending, on appeal or concluded against MS&Co. or any of
its principals are material within the meaning of CFTC Rule 4.24(l)(2) or 4.34(k)(2):  On June�2, 2009, MS executed a final settlement
with the Office of the New York State Attorney General (�NYAG�) in connection with its investigation relating to the sale of auction-rate securities (�ARS�). MS agreed, among other things to: (1)�repurchase at par illiquid
ARS that were purchased by certain retail clients prior to February�13, 2008; (2)�pay certain retail clients that sold ARS below par the difference between par and the price at which the clients sold the securities; (3)�arbitrate,
under special procedures, claims for consequential damages by certain retail clients; (4)�refund refinancing fees to certain municipal issuers of ARS; and (5)�pay a total penalty of $35 million. On August�13, 2008, MS reached an
agreement in principle on substantially the same terms with the Office of the Illinois Secretary of State, Securities Department (on behalf of a task force of other states under the auspices of the North American Securities Administrators
Association) that would settle their investigations into the same matters.

On June�5, 2012, the Company consented to and became the subject of an Order Instituting Proceedings
Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions by The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (�CFTC�) to resolve allegations related to the failure of a
salesperson to comply with exchange rules that prohibit off-exchange futures transactions unless there is an Exchange for Related Position (�EFRP�). Specifically, the CFTC found that from April 2008 through October 2009, the Company
violated Section�4c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act and Commission Regulation 1.38 by executing, processing and reporting numerous off-exchange futures trades to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (�CME�) and Chicago Board of Trade
(�CBOT�) as EFRPs in violation of CME and CBOT rules because those trades lacked the corresponding and related cash, OTC swap, OTC option, or other OTC derivative position. In addition, the CFTC found that the Company violated CFTC
Regulation 166.3 by failing to supervise the handling of the trades at issue and failing to have adequate policies and procedures designed to detect and deter the violations of the Act and Regulations. Without admitting or denying the underlying
allegations and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, the Company accepted and consented to entry of findings and the imposition of a cease and desist order, a fine of $5,000,000, and undertakings related to public statements,
cooperation and payment of the fine. The Company entered into corresponding and related settlements with the CME and CBOT in which the CME found that the Company violated CME Rules 432.Q and 538 and fined the Company $750,000 and CBOT found that the
Company violated CBOT Rules 432.Q and 538 and fined the Company $1,000,000.  On March�15, 2010, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San
Francisco filed two complaints against the Company and other defendants in the Superior Court of the State of California. These actions are styled Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco v. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, et al., and
Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco v. Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. et al., respectively. Amended complaints filed on June�10, 2010 allege that defendants made untrue statements and material omissions in connection with the sale to
plaintiff of a number of mortgage pass-through certificates backed by securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans. The amount of certificates allegedly sold to plaintiff by the Company in these cases was approximately $704 million
and $276 million, respectively. The complaints raise claims under both the federal securities laws and California law and seek, among other things, to rescind the plaintiff�s purchase of such certificates. On July�29, 2011 and
September�8, 2011, the court presiding over both actions sustained defendants� demurrers with respect to claims brought under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and overruled defendants� demurrers with respect to all other
claims. At June�25, 2013, the current unpaid balance of the mortgage pass-through certificates at issue in these cases was approximately $345 million, and the certificates had incurred actual losses of approximately $2.8 million. Based on
currently available information, the Company believes it could incur a loss for this action up to the difference between the $345 million unpaid balance of these certificates (plus any losses incurred) and their fair market value at the time of a
judgment against the Company, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs. The Company may be entitled to be indemnified for some of these losses and to an offset for interest received by the plaintiff prior to a judgment.

STACK 2006-1 CDO. The complaint asserts claims for common law fraud, fraudulent inducement and fraudulent concealment and alleges that the Company misrepresented the risks of the STACK 2006-1 CDO to CDIB, and that the Company knew that the assets
backing the CDO were of poor quality when it entered into the credit default swap with CDIB. The complaint seeks compensatory damages related to the approximately $228 million that CDIB alleges it has already lost under the credit default swap,
rescission of CDIB�s obligation to pay an additional $12 million, punitive damages, equitable relief, fees and costs.�On February�28, 2011, the court presiding over this action denied the Company�s motion to dismiss the complaint
and on March�21, 2011, the Company appealed that order.�On July�7, 2011, the appellate court affirmed the lower court�s decision denying the motion to dismiss. Based on currently available information, the Company believes it
could incur a loss of up to approximately $240 million plus pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs.  On October�15, 2010, the

against the Company, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs. The Company may be entitled to be indemnified for some of these losses and to an offset for interest received by the plaintiff prior to a judgment.

 Red Oak | CTA Performance



























































Home|
Glossary







Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) provide advice and services related to trading and investment strategies utilizing futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a wide variety of physical goods such as agricultural products, forest products, metals, and energy, plus derivative contracts on financial instruments such as indices, bonds, and currencies. Each CTA is characterized by its respective trading strategy and the markets it trades. CTAs are regulated by the United States federal government through registration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and membership in the National Futures Association (NFA)†.
The CTA information presented on www.ctaperformance.com was compiled by Equinox Fund Management, LLC, based upon information provided by each respective manager of commodity futures and foreign currency trading programs tracked by Equinox Fund Management and its affiliates. The CTA performance information does not contain opinion or analysis of Equinox Fund Management or any of its affiliates, and the completeness and accuracy of performance information reported to Equinox Fund Management cannot in all cases be independently verified. Please note that the CTA performance may not be reflective of actual fund performance. For the most recent performance figures, please refer to each respective commodity trading advisors website or marketing literature.
Performance information illustrated on this site is "net" of all fees and charges, and includes interest income applicable to the accounts comprising each composite performance summary. Performance results of individual accounts may vary as a result of differing fees, account size, the timing of entry of orders, and other factors. The performance results are not indicative of the results that may be achieved in the future.

Company background
Red Oak is a Delaware corporation established in 1989 and was registered as a CTA effective July 12, 1991. Red Oak is jointly owned by its two principals, Gary A. Gerstein and Phyllis Weaver.
Investment Goal
Red Oak seeks to achieve high absolute rates of return and low correlations with Altegris 40 and S&P 500 indices, and to do so through rigorous fundamental analysis and disciplined risk control.
Markets traded
Equity indices, interest rates, FX, agriculturals, energies, metals
Strategy
Red Oak’s trading strategy is driven by fundamentals.  Therefore, unlike many trading strategies now being employed by managed futures professionals, Red Oak’s approach is neither technically-based nor trend-following. Fundamental analysis, in general, is based on a study of factors external to the markets in predicting future prices. Such factors might include, among other things, supply and demand factors for a particular commodity, the economy of a particular country, government policies, domestic and foreign political and economic events and changing trade prospects. Fundamental analysis is premised on the concept that market prices frequently may not reflect (on a real time basis) the actual value of a commodity, although such value will eventually determine price levels.
Red Oak’s fundamental research disciplines attempt to step beyond the near term “noise” of leveraged volatile markets. The firm’s research focus is on significant and somewhat longer-term market forces. Red Oak believes that the fundamental forces driving major price changes can be isolated and anticipated. The firm trades principally financial, currency, and physical commodity futures on commodity exchanges inside and outside the United States. Financial futures may include equity index futures and interest rate futures based both inside and outside the US. Physical futures include agricultural commodities, energies and metals. It may also trade forward contracts through banks. With regard to financial futures, the firm’s research focuses on the macroeconomic trends that affect financial markets, valuation levels, the level and rate of change in “real” interest rates, central bank policy, funding needs, the level and rate of change of profitability, overall financial leverage in the monetary system, and numerous other factors that affect the price level and volatility of equity and fixed income financial instruments. In the currency markets Red Oak concentrates its fundamental research on such factors as trade and budget levels and trends, political considerations, interest rate differentials and changes in interest rates, changes in marginal rates of return on capital in various countries, central bank policy, and many other factors that affect relative currency values and directional changes. Research regarding physical commodities focuses on macro-and micro-economic trends, supply and demand balances, substitution effects caused by relative price changes, political considerations, and changes in technology, weather, and numerous other factors that affect commodities prices.
The firms employs risk control procedures in an effort to preserve capital and protect against material forecasting errors. To control risk, a predetermined dollar level of acceptable loss per position is calculated based on volatility and risk-reward dynamics. If this predetermined acceptable loss is exceeded, the position is closed. 
Key personnel
Gary A. Gerstein, Founder — Mr. Gerstein is the Chief Investment Officer, Managing Director, President, and Secretary of Red Oak and is responsible for all investment aspects of the firm. Mr. Gerstein developed the firm’s fundamental investment approach and methodology and is responsible for the implementation of this strategy. Mr. Gerstein became both a principal and an associated person of Red Oak effective August 27, 1991. Red Oak was registered as a CTA on July 12, 1991. Red Oak (in its predecessor form) was registered as a CTA on March 7, 1990 and was merged with Red Oak Advisors, Inc., an affiliate which conducted a securities investment advisory business. During the period from incorporation on December 4, 1989 to March 1990, Red Oak (in its predecessor form) was conducting activities in order to prepare for its anticipated launch as a CTA, such as creating its infrastructure and related necessities. The combined company took the name Red Oak Commodity Advisors, Inc. Red Oak no longer provides such securities investment advisory services. Mr. Gerstein received his MA in Economics from Rutgers University and his BS in Economics from New York University. He also has obtained the Chartered Financial Analyst designation. 
Phyllis Weaver, Founder — From August 1991 through July 2011, Ms. Weaver was the Director of Marketing and Client Services, Managing Director, and Treasurer of Red Oak and executed all administrative aspects of the firm. At present, Ms. Weaver is less active in the daily operations of the firm. Her role now is principally as an advisor to Gary Gerstein in marketing and client services and overseer of the firm’s financial accounting, compliance and administration. She became both a principal and an associated person of Red Oak on August 27, 1991 and member of the NFA since September 4, 1991.  Ms. Weaver attended the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. Ms. Weaver was on the faculty of Harvard University, Graduate School of Education, first as an Assistant Professor and finally as an Associate Professor.  Ms. Weaver received an MBA from Stanford University; a PhD in Language Communications and an MEd in Higher Education, both from the University of Pittsburgh; she was granted a BS in Education from Ohio State University.

There are substantial risks and potential conflicts of interest associated with managed futures programs. The success of an investment in such a program is dependent upon the ability of a commodity trading advisor (“CTA”) to identify profitable investment opportunities and successfully trade. The identification of attractive trading opportunities is difficult, requires skill, and involves a significant degree of uncertainty. The high degree of leverage often obtainable in futures trading can work against you as well as for you, and can lead to large losses. Returns generated from a CTA’s trading, if any, may not adequately compensate you for the business and financial risks you assume. You can lose all or a substantial amount of your investment. Managed futures accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees. It may be necessary for accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits in order to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets. CTAs may trade highly illiquid markets, or on foreign markets, and may not be able to close or offset positions immediately upon request. You may have market exposure even after the CTA has a request for closure or liquidation.
PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. THERE IS RISK OF LOSS. YOU CAN LOSE MONEY IN A MANAGED FUTURES PROGRAM.

Strategy & Benefits

Principal Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund includes:

A quantitative, strategic index-based approach to commodity investing
Exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be long or flat (if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash)
The ability to make position changes intra-month based on trends
Monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels
A “smart” contract roll approach1

1 Smart Contract Roll Approach – A futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract.
Why Invest in the Fund?

The long/flat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends
Seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable long-only commodity indices
Has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intra-month
Risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high
Low- or non-correlation to stocks and bonds
Disciplined, quantitative, rules-based approach to commodity investing




Why Commodities?

Not just commodities – Long/Flat commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
The Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund seeks to match the performance of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index (ABCERI), which provides exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends.
This long/flat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise, and mitigate risk by going flat (to cash) when prices fall.
Why consider long/flat commodities?
Most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise. However, these long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.

Target Index

The Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index aims to capture upward trends in the commodity markets while minimizing risk during downward trends. The index uses a quantitative methodology to track either long or flat positions in a diversified portfolio of 12 commodity futures covering energy, metals, and agriculture. The index incorporates dynamic risk management and contract rolling methods.

Source: Bloomberg. Data from 10/1/2010 – 6/30/2017. October 1, 2010 is the inception of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index. Index returns and correlations are historical and are not representative of any fund performance. Total returns of the index include reinvested dividends. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  One cannot invest directly in an index. The indexes are composite indexes of commodity sector returns representing unmanaged, unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that are broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities. 

S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (S&P GSCI), a composite index of commodity sector returns representing an unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that is broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities;
Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index (BCOM TR), a broadly diversified index that allows investors to track 19 commodity futures through a single, simple measure
Deutsche Banc Liquid Commodity Optimum Yield Index (DBC CI), an index composed of futures contracts on 14 of the most heavily-traded and important physical commodities in the world.

Standard Deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean.
Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.
Maximum Drawdown is the greatest percent decline from a previous high.

If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
