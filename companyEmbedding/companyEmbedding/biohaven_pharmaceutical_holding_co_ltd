Intellectual Property 






























 




Biohaven Pharma| biopharmaceutical company | trigriluzoleIntellectual Property
Rimegepant and BHV-3500
The intellectual property rights related to rimegepant and BHV-3500 are in-licensed from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) and are covered by five families of U.S. and certain selected foreign patents.
Rimegepant was selected as the lead CGRP receptor antagonist compound for its potential best-in-class chemical profile after 10 years of internal research at BMS on this drug target. Rimegepant has been dosed in 687 subjects and studied in six clinical trials in healthy volunteers and patients with migraine that inform pharmacokinetic, metabolic interactions, safety, tolerability and efficacy of rimegepant. In a Phase 2b trial, rimegepant has demonstrated comprehensive and durable treatment effects in acute migraine.
Trigriluzole
We own several families of patent applications containing claims directed to trigriluzole and prodrugs of riluzole. These patent applications include several U.S. applications and corresponding PCT applications.
BHV-0223
BHV-0223, a sublingual ODT form of riluzole, is licensed from Catalent and its use for treating various forms of pain, ALS and depression are currently covered in the United States by several pending U.S. patent applications, with corresponding PCT applications which we intend to nationalize in selected jurisdictions before the applicable deadlines. In addition to the patent applications we own, we have also licensed one issued patent and several pending patent applications from Yale University which provide protection for the use of riluzole in treating generalized anxiety disorder and other neurological uses, respectively. Further, we have licensed several patents from Rutgers University covering the use of riluzole for treating various forms of cancer.
BHV-5000 and lanicemine
The intellectual property rights related to BHV-5000 and lanicemine are in-licensed from AstraZeneca (AZ). We have in-licensed one patent family related to certain uses of lanicemine and a patent application family containing claims directed to BHV-5000.
BHV-5000 and lanicemine represent advances on the limitations of ketamine. While these agents are potent NMDA antagonists, their unique low-trapping pharmacology (i.e., ability to uncouple from NMDA receptor) is thought to confer limited liability for dissociative effects traditionally associated with ketamine. Additionally, BHV-5000 is orally available and, as such, is more suitable for chronic use in neuropsychiatric disorders.
The license agreement between Biohaven and AZ  brings together scientific leaders in clinical glutamate research at Biohaven with AZ pharmaceutical expertise in developing a novel NMDA antagonist. Kumar Srinivasan, VP Scientific Partnering and Alliances, IMED Biotech Unit commented, “At AstraZeneca we operate in an open research environment where we collaborate with the best external partners to develop ground-breaking medicines. Biohaven has assembled a team of highly experienced scientists, and we are confident that together we will develop new treatments that can benefit patients suffering from debilitating neuropsychiatric disorders.”
Additional Licensed Patent Applications
We have also licensed a family of patent applications related to the treatment of depression with a combination of ketamine and scopolamine from Massachusetts General Hospital.

Therapeutic Focus 






























 




Biohaven Pharma| biopharmaceutical company | trigriluzoleTherapeutic Focus
Glutamatergic Agents Across a Broad Range of Applications
Yale researchers were among the first to identify ketamine – a drug best known for its use by club goers for its hallucinogenic effects—as a promising therapy for patients with treatment-resistant depression and anxiety. The finding was a major discovery that revealed a new pathway for treating these neuropsychiatric disorders. Rather than acting on the brain’s levels of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine as other mood and anxiety drugs do, ketamine worked on regulating levels of a neurotransmitter called glutamate. “It’s a completely different approach,” says Gerard Sanacora M.D., professor of psychiatry and director of the Yale Depression Research Program. “It’s an all-purpose approach that’s physiologically-based across diagnostic categories.” The Yale group’s seminal work on ketamine was first published in Berman et al. 2000 and has led to numerous lines of research  exploring glutamatergic mechanisms in neuropsychiatric disorders.
Having witnessed successful results using ketamine on depressed patients, the Yale researchers began focusing on other  ways to modulate brain glutamate without the dissociative effects of ketamine. John Krystal M.D., Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Yale and Chief of Psychiatry at Yale-New Haven Hospital, mentored a next generation of Yale researchers to further expand the exploration of other glutamate modulating agents in neuropsychiatric disorders. Vlad Coric M.D., Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Yale, was the first to demonstrate anxiolytic properties of the glutamate modulating agent Riluzole in patients with treatment-resistant OCD. With colleagues Drs. Christopher Pittenger and Michael Bloch at the Yale OCD Research Clinic, the group expanded their work to explore the therapeutic potential of other glutamate modulating agents. 
Drs. Krystal, Sanacora and Coric turned to the Yale Office of Cooperative Research (OCR) to file the necessary patents and begin the process of translating their research into new therapies. What ultimately emerged from the co-inventors research was the startup Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company, Ltd, a company dedicated to developing a new generation of drugs for treating targeted diseases by regulating glutamate. Integral to the company’s formation was contributions by seasoned drug developer Declan Doogan, M.D., former Senior VP Head of World Drug Development at Pfizer, and Robert Berman, M.D.    who lead Bristol-Myers Squib;s ABILIFY program in attaining a first-cycle FDA approval for adjunctive use in major depressive disorder.

NEW HAVEN, Conn., July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (NYSE: BHVN) announced today that it has commenced enrollment in the first of its two registrational Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of orally-dosed rimegepant (BHV-3000) for the acute treatment of migraine. Biohaven expects to begin enrollment in the second Phase 3 clinical trial this summer and report topline results for both studies in the first half of 2018.
"Large numbers of migraine patients, including those with cardiovascular disease or hypertension for whom existing treatment options such as triptans are contraindicated, may benefit from a safe and effective oral CGRP receptor antagonist medication that provides rapid and sustained relief from pain," said Vlad Coric, M.D., Chief Executive Officer at Biohaven.  "Based on the results of its Phase 2b clinical trial, we believe rimegepant has the potential to be a best-in-class treatment option, combining early, comprehensive, and durable efficacy with convenient oral dosing, so that patients are spared the need for any intravenous or subcutaneous administration."
Biohaven plans to conduct two double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 75 mg of rimegepant, Biohaven's innovative, orally-dosed small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist, for the acute treatment of migraine. The co-primary endpoints of the studies are freedom from pain at two hours post-dosing and a demonstrated effect on the patient's most bothersome symptom (nausea, photophobia or phonophobia) at two hours post-dosing. Patients in the Phase 3 clinical trials will be eligible to participate in a long-term safety study.
In a previously completed Phase 2b clinical trial, the 75 mg dose of rimegepant was observed to have achieved statistically significant improvement compared to placebo at two hours post-dosing on all four key migraine symptoms: pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia. To the company's knowledge, rimegepant is the only oral, small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist currently in development that has achieved statistically significant improvement on all four of these key migraine symptoms within a single study. Rimegepant treated patients also experienced durable efficacy, achieving statistically higher rates of pain freedom at 24 and 48 hours post-dosing compared to placebo.
Rimegepant is the most advanced candidate in Biohaven's CGRP receptor antagonist platform. Biohaven is also pursuing the development of BHV-3500 for the treatment of patients with chronic and episodic migraine. Biohaven's CGRP platform is focused on delivering oral or intranasal therapies for migraine that are easy to use for patients when and where a debilitating migraine attack hits.
"We are very pleased to begin the Phase 3 development of this important product candidate for migraine sufferers. We also plan to demonstrate, through our long-term safety study, a low risk of cardiovascular side effects and favorable safety profile in addition to comprehensive and durable treatment effects observed in the acute studies," said Elyse Stock, M.D., Chief of Portfolio Development and Strategy at Biohaven.
About Migraine  Migraine is both widespread and disabling neurological disorder. The Migraine Research Foundation ranks migraine as the world's third most prevalent illness, affecting approximately 36 million people in the United States. Current treatment approaches, such as triptans, can be limited by headache recurrence within 24 hours after taking migraine medication, as well as cardiovascular contraindications and warnings.

Biohaven has combined internal development and research with intellectual property licensed from companies and institutions including Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, AstraZeneca AB, Yale University, Catalent, Rutgers, ALS Biopharma LLC and Massachusetts General Hospital. Currently, Biohaven's lead development programs include multiple compounds across its CGRP receptor antagonist and glutamate modulation platforms. The company's common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and traded under the ticker symbol BHVN. More information about Biohaven is available at www.biohavenpharma.com.

Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. Key Developments

Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. Enrolls First Patient in Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Oral Rimegepant for the Acute Treatment of Migraine
Jul 24 17
Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. announced that it has commenced enrollment in the first of its two registrational Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of orally-dosed rimegepant (BHV-3000) for the acute treatment of migraine. Biohaven expects to begin enrollment in the second Phase 3 clinical trial this summer and report results for both studies in the first half of 2018. Biohaven plans to conduct two double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 75 mg of rimegepant, Biohaven's innovative, orally-dosed small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist, for the acute treatment of migraine. The co-primary endpoints of the studies are freedom from pain at two hours post-dosing and a demonstrated effect on the patient's most bothersome symptom (nausea, photophobia or phonophobia) at two hours post-dosing. Patients in the Phase 3 clinical trials will be eligible to participate in a long-term safety study. In a previously completed Phase 2b clinical trial, the 75 mg dose of rimegepant was observed to have achieved statistically significant improvement compared to placebo at two hours post-dosing on all four key migraine symptoms: pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia. To the company's knowledge, rimegepant is the only oral, small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist currently in development that has achieved statistically significant improvement on all four of these key migraine symptoms within a single study. Rimegepant treated patients also experienced durable efficacy, achieving statistically higher rates of pain freedom at 24 and 48 hours post-dosing compared to placebo. Rimegepant is the most advanced candidate in Biohaven's CGRP receptor antagonist platform. Biohaven is also pursuing the development of BHV-3500 for the treatment of patients with chronic and episodic migraine. Biohaven's CGRP platform is focused on delivering oral or intranasal therapies for migraine that are easy to use for patients when and where a debilitating migraine attack hits.


Biohaven's BHV-5000 Receives Orphan Drug Designation From The FDA In Rett Syndrome
Jul 6 17
Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. announced that BHV-5000, an investigational compound in the company's glutamate modulation platform, has been granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment for patients with Rett syndrome. This is the company's fourth product candidate to receive orphan drug designation from the FDA. Rett syndrome is a rare and severe genetic neurodevelopmental disorder affecting females almost exclusively. Symptoms emerge from six to 18 months of age after apparently normal post-natal development. Patients with Rett syndrome develop global deceleration of psychomotor function, loss of acquired cognitive skills (such as language and purposeful hand movement) as well as brain-mediated episodes of transient respiratory suppression. Patients may survive into adulthood, yet they are severely physically and cognitively impaired. Rett syndrome affects approximately 15,000 individuals in the United States. No approved drug therapies for Rett syndrome are currently available and care is supportive. Biohaven expects to initiate a Phase 1 trial of BHV-5000 in healthy volunteers with a commercially-ready formulation in 2017, and then proceed to a study in patients with Rett syndrome in 2018.

If the underwriters price the IPO at the midpoint of the price range, BHVN will have a market capitalization of $508.7 million. We previewed this deal on our IPO Insights platform. BHVN filed for the IPO on April 7, 2017. Lead Underwriters: Barclays Capital, Morgan Stanley, and Piper Jaffray. Underwriters: Needham & Co., and William Blair & Co. Business Summary: Clinical-Stage Biopharmaceutical Developing Treatments For Neurological Disorders 

 (Source: Company Website) Biohaven Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that is developing product candidates for the treatment of neurological disorders (including rare disorders). Its product candidates include rimegapant, which Biohaven expects to have in two Phase III trials for treating migraines, and trigriluzole, which is currently in Phase II/III trials for treating ataxias, with a focus on spinocerebellar ataxia. Biohaven is also developing BHV-5000 for treating symptoms of Rett syndrome, BHV-0223 for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and BHV-3500 for the prevention of chronic and episodic migraines.
 The company believes that many of its product candidates have the potential to be best-in-class or first-in-class treatments. In addition, based upon outcomes from the Phase IIb clinical trial for rimegepant, the company believes it will be a best-in-class option that significantly improves the symptoms of migraines, such as pain, nausea, photophobia, and phonophopia. Financial Overview Currently, Biohaven has no products approved for sale, nor has the company generated any revenue from product sales. Biohaven has funded its operations primarily through the sale of preferred shares, common shares, and bank loans. Since its inception, Biohaven has incurred net losses each fiscal year, and its accumulated deficit was $75.5 million as of December 31, 2016. The company intends to use the net proceeds of this IPO to fund further clinical trials, repay $5.6 million in debt to Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and finalize an obligation to purchase Kleo Pharmaceutical stock. Competition: Allergan, CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, And Eli Lilly Biohaven faces competition from a variety of pharmaceutical companies including Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), CoLucid Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:CLCD), Allergan (NYSE:AGN), Alder Biopharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALDR), Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Shinogi, Shire Ltd. (NASDAQ:SHPG), Erydel, and Mitsubishi Tanabe. An anticipated market cap of $508M would place BHVN in the smaller end of this group. Many of these competitors are significantly larger and more established. Executive Management Highlights CEO and Director Vladimir Coric, M.D. has served in his position since October 2015. He previously served at Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), Yale Clinical Neuroscience Research Unit, and Yale Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Research Clinic. Dr. Coric received his M.D. from Wake Forest University School of Medicine. He completed his internship at Yale-New Haven Hospital and residency training at the Yale Psychiatry Residency Training Program. Chief Medical Officer Robert Berman, M.D. has served in his position since November 2015. His previous experience includes positions at Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), and Biohaven Medical Services. Dr. Berman received his B.A. in molecular biophysics and biochemistry from Yale University and his M.D. from Mount Sinai School of Medicine of New York University.
 Conclusion: Consider Buying In We are encouraged that BHVN's products are so far along in clinical trials, as well as by license agreements with BMS and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN). We suggest investors consider buying in. Risk factors of any early stage biopharma do include a lack of revenues, significant losses, and significant obligations relating to licensing agreements.

(Biohaven), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of innovative, late-stage product candidates targeting neurological disorders, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, and provided a review of recent accomplishments and anticipated upcoming milestones.Biohaven Pharmaceuticals LogoMore"The successful execution of our initial public offering has substantially enhanced our resources and will enable us to drive the development of our wide portfolio of product candidates across both common and rare neurological disorders," said Vlad Coric, M.D., CEO of Biohaven.  "Our goal is to innovate best-in-class and first-in-class therapies for patients who are suffering from debilitating and sometimes deadly neurological conditions without effective treatment options."   Recent Business Highlights:Completed Initial Public Offering In May, Biohaven announced that it had closed its initial public offering (IPO) of 9,900,000 common shares at a price to the public of $17.00 per share and that the underwriters for the offering exercised in full their option to purchase an additional 1,485,000 common shares. Aggregate gross proceeds from the offering were $193.5 million, before underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses payable by the company.    Completed Enrollment in Trigriluzole Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial and Received Fast Track DesignationAlso in May, the company announced that: - It completed enrollment in its Phase 2/3 clinical trial of trigriluzole (BHV-4157), a novel pro-drug, in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track Designation to trigriluzole for the potential treatment of SCA; trigriluzole had previously received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of SCA.   Continued Progress of Programs In-licensed from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) and AstraZeneca (AZ) - CGRP Receptor Antagonist Platform:  Intellectual property (IP) rights related to rimegepant and BHV-3500, product candidates in the company's novel CGRP receptor antagonist platform, are in-licensed from BMS and are covered by five families of U.S. patents and certain selected foreign patents. Rimegepant was selected as the lead CGRP receptor antagonist compound for its potential best-in-class chemical profile after 10 years of internal research at BMS on this drug target. During the first quarter of 2017, Biohaven continued its clinical operations activities to prepare for its two planned Phase 3 clinical trials of rimegepant. - Glutamate Modulation Platform:  BHV-5000 and lanicemine, product candidates in the company's glutamate modulation platform, are in-licensed from AZ. IP rights related to BHV-5000 and lanicemine represent advances on the limitations of ketamine. During the first quarter of 2017, Biohaven continued its clinical operations and regulatory activities necessary to support advancement of BHV-5000 into clinical trials.Upcoming Milestones:Biohaven is progressing its drug candidates through clinical programs in a number of common and rare neurological disorders. The company expects to reach significant pipeline milestones with its CGRP receptor antagonists and glutamate modulators in the coming quarters.In its CGRP receptor antagonist platform, the company expects to: - Commence two Phase 3 clinical trials of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine in the second half of 2017, with top-line results expected in the first quarter of 2018. - Submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the FDA for BHV-3500 for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine in the second half of 2017.   In its glutamate modulation platform, the company expects to: - Commence a bioequivalence study of BHV-0223 in the second half of 2017. - Commence a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic trial with BHV-5000 in the second half of 2017. First Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsCash Position: Cash as of March 31, 2017 was $52.3 million, compared to $23.6 million as of December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the receipt of gross proceeds of $40.0 million upon the second closing of the company's Series A preferred share financing in February, partially offset by operating costs and offering costs of the Series A preferred share financing during the quarter.  In May, the company raised $193.5 million in gross proceeds from its initial public offering and received net proceeds of $176.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses payable by the company.R&D Expenses: Research and development (R&D) expenses were $10.7 million in Q1 2017, compared to $2.4 million in Q1 2016. This increase was primarily driven by advances in the company's rimegepant and trigriluzole programs, and expenses related to hiring additional R&D personnel, including share- based compensation.G&A Expenses:  General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $3.8 million in Q1 2017, compared to $0.6 million in Q1 2016. The increase was primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs, including share-based compensation, due to the hiring of additional personnel in the company's general and administrative functions and increases in professional fees related to the preparation, audit and review of the company's financial statements.Net Loss:  The company reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of ($22.8) million, or ($1.74) per share, in Q1 2017, compared to ($3.0) million, or ($0.25) per share, in Q1 2016.  The increased loss reflects Biohaven's expanded investments in its R&D and business operations, and costs associated with its recent public offering.Read MoreAbout BiohavenBiohaven is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of innovative, late-stage product candidates targeting neurological diseases, including rare disorders.

About Biohaven 






























 




Biohaven Pharma| biopharmaceutical company | trigriluzoleAbout Biohaven
Biohaven is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of innovative, late-stage product candidates targeting neurological diseases, including rare disorders. Our product candidates are small molecules based on two distinct mechanistic platforms—calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP, receptor antagonists and glutamate modulators—which we believe have the potential to significantly alter existing treatment approaches across a diverse set of neurological indications with high unmet need in both large markets and orphan indications.
 
The most advanced product candidate from our CGRP receptor antagonist platform is rimegepant, which we are developing for the acute treatment of migraine and for which we intend to initiate two Phase 3 clinical trials in the second half of 2017. The most advanced product candidate from our glutamate modulation platform is trigriluzole, which we are developing for the treatment of ataxias with an initial focus on spinocerebellar ataxia, or SCA. We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for trigriluzole in SCA, and we began a Phase 2/3 clinical trial in SCA in December 2016 and expect to report topline results in early 2018. Our second most advanced product candidate from our glutamate modulation platform is BHV-0223, which we are developing for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for BHV-0223 in ALS.

	First Quarter 2017



	Financial Results




	 





	Cash Position:


	Cash as of March 31, 2017 was $52.3 million, compared to $23.6 million as of December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the receipt of gross proceeds of $40.0 million upon the second closing of the companys Series A preferred share financing in February, partially offset by operating costs and offering costs of the Series A preferred share financing during the quarter.  In May, the company raised $193.5 million in gross proceeds from its initial public offering and received net proceeds of $176.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses payable by the company.



	 





	R&D Expenses:


	Research and development (R&D) expenses were $10.7 million in Q1 2017, compared to $2.4 million in Q1 2016. This increase was primarily driven by advances in the companys rimegepant and trigriluzole programs, and expenses related to hiring additional R&D personnel, including share- based compensation.



	 





	G&A Expenses: 


	General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $3.8 million in Q1 2017, compared to $0.6 million in Q1 2016. The increase was primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs, including share-based compensation, due to the hiring of additional personnel in the companys general and administrative functions and increases in professional fees related to the preparation, audit and review of the companys financial statements.



	 












	 





	Net Loss: 


	The company reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of ($22.8) million, or ($1.74) per share, in Q1 2017, compared to ($3.0) million, or ($0.25) per share, in Q1 2016.  The increased loss reflects Biohavens expanded investments in its R&D and business operations, and costs associated with its recent public offering.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
