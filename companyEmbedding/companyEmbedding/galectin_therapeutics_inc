About Us

Home »  Who We Are » About Us

Galectin Therapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on discovery and development. We apply our leadership in galectin science and drug development to create new therapies to improve the lives of patients with chronic liver and skin diseases and cancer. Drug candidates based on our unique carbohydrate technology target galectin proteins, which are key mediators of biologic and pathologic function.
Galectin Therapeutics is pursuing therapies for indications in which galectins have a demonstrated role in the pathogenesis of directly involved in multiple inflammatory, fibrotic, and malignant diseases. We focus on diseases with serious, life-threatening consequences to patients, and those where current treatment options are limited. Our strategy is to establish clinical development approaches that add value to the Company in the shortest time possible, and to seek partners as the program advances and requires much greater resources.
Galectin Therapeutics leverages extensive scientific and development expertise as well as established relationships with outside sources to achieve cost effective and efficient development. The lead development program is in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with cirrhosis, the most advanced form of NASH related fibrosis. This is the most common liver disease and one of the largest drug development opportunities available today. Additional development programs are in treatment of severe atopic dermatitis, moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, and in combination immunotherapy for advanced melanoma and other malignancies.
