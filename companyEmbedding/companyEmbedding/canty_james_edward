Ro, there are no words that I can give to ease the loss of such a wonderful man. James was an awesome Father, Husband, Family Man and a True Friend to those he knew. I will never forget the day he announced your pregnancies and never forget when the children were born, James was such a Proud Papa. I will miss my shrimp quesadilla lunches and talks of foreign ports, and of course all the talks of the children and their antics. Do not forget that you have a family with The Home Depot and we are all thinking of you and your family.I miss James and always will.Your friend, Sherry

James Canty was one of the most jovial and giving people I knew. It was lovely to see him with his family- Rolanda, Lil Jay and Briauna. He had the deepest laugh and loved to talk and share stories. He will be sorely missed by all. My deepest condolences to Rolanda and all of the family and friends who had an opportunity to know such a wonderful spirit.


Lisa Wooten of Richmond, Va

Rolanda, May the Lord be with you and your children; and with yours and James' family during this difficult time.Lisa Wooten
