Selling Shareholder Ordinary Shares
 

This is the initial offering of ordinary shares
of XTRIBE P.L.C. and no public market currently exists for the securities being offered. We are offering for sale a total of up
to 1,000,000 Ordinary Shares at a fixed price of $6.00 per share. In addition, selling shareholders are offering an additional
up to 1,500,000 Ordinary Shares. There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by the Company for the offering
to proceed, and we will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the shares offered by the Company. The offering
of shares by the Company is being conducted on a self-underwritten, best efforts basis, which means the Company will attempt to
sell the shares. This Prospectus will permit the Company to sell the shares directly to the public, with no commission or other
remuneration payable to it for any shares it may sell. In offering the securities on our behalf, he will rely on the safe
harbor from broker-dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The shares will
be offered at a fixed price of $6.00 per share for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days from the effective date of this
prospectus. The offering shall terminate on the earlier of (i) when the offering period ends (180 days from the effective date
of this prospectus), (ii) the date when the sale of all 1,000,000 shares is completed, (iii) when the Board of Directors decides
that it is in the best interest of the Company to terminate the offering prior the completion of the sale of all 1,000,000 shares
offered by the Company registered under the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is part.
 

There
has been no market for our securities and a public market may never develop, or, if any market does develop, it may not be sustained.
Our Ordinary Shares are not traded on any exchange or market. This offering is not contingent upon having a market maker file
an application with FINRA or NASDAQ for approval of an initial listing. 

 
 We are not a blank check company as
defined in Rule 419 of Regulation C under the Securities Act and have no plans or intentions to engage in a business combination
after the offering.
 
XTRIBE
Ltd. (the predecessor to the registrant) commenced operations on May 12, 2014. To date we have been primarily been engaged in
organizational and business development’s activities. We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”).
 
THE
PURCHASE OF THE SECURITIES OFFERED THROUGH THIS PROSPECTUS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ AND CONSIDER
THE SECTION OF THIS PROSPECTUS ENTITLED “RISK FACTORS” ON PAGES 7 THROUGH 12 BEFORE BUYING ANY ORDINARY SHARES OF
XTRIBE P.L.C.
 
NEITHER
THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THESE SECURITIES
OR PASSED UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.
 
The
information contained in this prospectus is not complete and may be changed. This prospectus is included in a registration statement
that was filed by XTRIBE P.L.C. with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This prospectus is not an offer to sell these
securities and it is not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any state where the offer or sale is not permitted.

SUMMARY
 
The
following summary highlights selected information contained in this prospectus. This summary does not contain all the information
you should consider before investing in the securities. Before making an investment decision, you should read the entire prospectus
carefully, including the “Risk Factors” section, the financial statements, and the notes to the financial statements.
 
For
purposes of this prospectus, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references herein to “XTRIBE”
“we,” “us,” the “Company” and “our,” refer to XTRIBE P.L.C., a Company registered
in England and Wales.
 
Following
this offering, we will additionally incur public company reporting costs of approximately $100,000 per year or $25,000 per quarter.
To fund the Company’s operating growth following December, 2016, the Company will clearly require additional funding for
ongoing operations and to finance additional growth. There is no guarantee that we will be able to raise any additional capital
and have no current arrangements for any such financing.
 
Our
near term financing requirement (less than 6 months), is anticipated to be approximately $330,000, which includes a monthly overhead
burn rate of $55,000, public reporting costs and the remainder allocated to the Company’s general working capital. On December
7, 2016, the Company raised an additional $522,000 to satisfy its near term requirement.
 

Beyond
our near term financing requirement (more than 6 months), we will need an additional approximately $6,000,000 to implement the
Company’s plan of operations, the majority of which will be needed in 2017.
 
The
foregoing represents the Company’s best estimates as of the date of this Prospectus and may materially vary based upon actual
experience.
 
The
inability to obtain this funding either in the near term and/or longer term will materially affect the ability of the Company
to implement its business plan of operations and jeopardize the viability of the Company. In that case, the Company may need to
suspend its operations and reevaluate and revise its plan of operations
 
THE
COMPANY
 
Business
Overview
 
The
Company was originally registered as a private limited company in the United Kingdom as MEC FOOD (UK) LTD on December 12, 2011.
On May 12, 2014, the Company changed its name to XTRIBE Limited. On April 30, 2016, the Company was registered as a public limited
company and changed its name to XTRIBE P.L.C. The Company has developed a free smartphone application which allows the user to
sell, buy, swap and rent objects and services utilizing an active geolocation tool which locates all potential customers within
any specified geographic target. Transactions can be completed without any intermediary, directly between party and counter-party,
without any commissions or third-party payments. Users have the option of customizing the app to best promote commerce. The Company
derives revenues by its B2B division, XTRIBE Store. The XTRIBE application is available for Apple and Android devices and can
be easily downloaded for free to a user’s mobile device. Once installed, the user establishes a free account and can immediately
transact and communicate with other users.
 
The
Company’s principal office is located in London, England.
 
The
Company’s application has several elements:
 


 
●
The
    user can create ads for any product or service which is then accessed by other users on a geolocalized basis. When a user
    accesses the application, the user sees a map of the user’s local area and the location of other users in that area
    who are selling goods or services. In this manner, the application is ideal for both sellers and purchasers.

 
 
 

 
●
Using
    the application, a user can connect with other users in a social networking context in order to facilitate communications
    and personal interactions related to commerce transacted using the application.

 
 
 

 
●
Transactions
    are completed in a direct and simplified manner, without the necessary of going through any middlemen. The entire transaction
    can be completed utilizing a smartphone. Purchasers can make offers to and /or barter with the seller and facilitate payment.

 
 
 

 
●
Sellers
    can customize their offerings to use identity programs to market goods and services.

 
 
 

 
●
The
    application is available in multiple languages.

 

 4 
 

 

 
The
Company intends to advertise through social media and other internet-related channels. The Company’s website is www.xtribeapp.com.
In this manner, the Company believes that it will be able to achieve significant market penetration for its application to a vast
number of users in a relatively short timeframe.
 
The
Company’s initial application is fully developed and operational and it has approximately 200,000 registered users.
 

Xtribe
B2B: Revenue Model
 
The
Xtribe revenue model is based on the provision of subscribed access for professional users as well as on the placement of credit
packages for the purchase of additional services focused on professional users and others. There are two models within the Xtribe
platform: the first is based on the Free and Store profile types (and their upgrades), and the second is based on a system
of credits which are purchased in packages and which give access to additional functions and higher visibility.
 
Xtribe
Free:
 
This
is a profile dedicated to persons and entities who wish to sell their property or services freely and in the simplest way possible.
 
Features:
allows up to 3 products and 3 services at the same time. These slots are permanently available for free. For example, if a
user has three items for sale at the same time and one of them is purchased, that slot automatically becomes available for the
seller to offer another item.
 
Xtribe
Store:
 
Xtribe
developed the Store profile to meet the needs of storekeepers and professionals, and all those who require a higher volume
of ads and engage in several transactions simultaneously. The monthly base cost of this profile is €19.90.
 


 5 
 

  
Features:
with the same ease of use and degree of interaction as the basic application, the Store profile provides accounts with customized
features for businesses and wider activities:
 

●No
                                         limit to the number of ads which can be published.

●Ability
                                         to sell to multiple users from the same ad.

●Detailed

Agency
Agreement
 
On
June 30, 2016, the Company entered into an agency agreement for Italy whereby the agent would receive five percent of all sales
that the agent introduced to the Company. In addition, the agent would reimburse the Company 55 percent of the software development
costs that the Company had expended, which were $638,720 as of June 30, 2016.
 
Consulting
Agreement
 
The
Company has a consulting arrangement for application development with a company in which the Chief Executive Officer has a material
interest. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, this company was owed $0 and $8,169. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and
2014, the Company paid $108,756 and $87,289 to this company. There is no written agreement between the parties.
 
Initial
Capital Formation
 


In
2013, the Company issued an aggregate of 10,000 Ordinary Shares to its founders for an aggregate consideration of $14,882. On
April 30, 2016, the Company effectuated a recapitalization (forward split) of 21.1 to 1 which resulted in the 10,000 Ordinary
Shares being reclassified as 211,000 Ordinary Shares. In 2015, the Company issued an additional 29,624 Ordinary Shares (on a post-reclassification
basis) for a total consideration of $361,036. In the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company issued another 337,522 Ordinary
Shares for a total consideration of $602,246. At December 31, 2016, following a recapitalization completed in November 2016, the
Company had 9,000,000 Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding. The Registrant sold these Company Ordinary Shares under an exemption
from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and, to offshore holders, under an exemption from registration
provided by Regulation S.
 

Without
taking into account this offering, we will run out of funds approximately October 31, 2017. Following this offering, we will additionally
incur public company reporting costs of approximately $100,000 per year or $25,000 per quarter. To fund the Company’s operating
expenses following October 31, 2017, the Company will require additional funding for ongoing operations and to expand to new markets.
There is no guarantee that we will be able to raise any additional capital and have no current arrangements for any such financing.

Emerging
Growth Company Status Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (“JOBS”) Act
 
Because
we generated less than $1 billion in total annual gross revenues during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as
an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (“JOBS”) Act.
 
We
will lose our emerging growth company status on the earliest occurrence of any of the following events:
 
1.
On the last day of any fiscal year in which we earn at least $1 billion in total annual gross revenues, which amount is adjusted
for inflation every five years;
 
2.
On the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity
securities pursuant to an effective registration statement;
 
3.
On the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or
 
4.
On the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer”, as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title
17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto. A “large accelerated filer” is an issuer that, at the end
of its fiscal year, meets the following conditions:
 
a.
It has an aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by its non-affiliates of $700 million
or more as of the last business day of the issuer’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter;
 
b.
It has been subject to the requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act for a period of at least twelve calendar months;
and
 
c.
It has filed at least one annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act.
 
As
an emerging growth company, exemptions from the following provisions are available to us:
 
1.
Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires auditor attestation of internal controls;
 
2.
Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive
compensation and golden parachute compensation;
 

 8 
 

 
3.
Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires companies to disclose the relationship
between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the company;
 
4.
Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires companies to disclose the ratio between
the annual total compensation of the CEO and the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the companies; and
 
5.
The requirement to provide certain other executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K. Instead, an emerging
growth company must only comply with the more limited provisions of Item 402 applicable to smaller reporting companies, regardless
of the issuer’s size.
 
Pursuant
to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company may choose to forgo such exemption and instead comply with the requirements
that apply to an issuer that is not an emerging growth company. We have elected to maintain our status as an emerging growth company
and take advantage of the JOBS Act provisions.
 

Company
Officers and Directors are Non-Residents of the United States
 
The
officers and directors of the Company are all resident outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible
(a) to effect service of process within the United States on the Company’s officers and directors; (b) to enforce judgments
obtained in U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against the officers and directors;
(c) to enforce judgments of U.S. courts based on civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws in foreign courts
against the Ciompany’s officers and directors and (d) to bring an original action in foreign courts to enforce liabilities
based on the U.S. federal securities laws against the Company’s officers and directors

RISK
FACTORS
 
Before
you invest in our securities, you should be aware that there are various risks. You should consider carefully these risk factors,
together with all of the other information included in this annual report before you decide to purchase our securities. If any
of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations
could be materially adversely affected.
 
Our
independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability
to continue as a going concern and our ability to obtain future financing.
 
In
their report dated March 20, 2017 our independent auditors stated that our financial statements for the period ended December
31, 2016 were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern and they expressed substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. This doubt is based entirely upon the Company’s current lack of resources to execute its
business plan. In our early stages of development and operation, we expect to experience net losses. Our ability to continue as
a going concern is subject to our ability to generate a profit and/or obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including
obtaining additional funding from the sale of our securities, increasing sales or obtaining loans and grants from various financial
institutions where possible. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, you may lose your entire investment.
 

Without
taking into account the offering, we will run out of funds approximately October 31, 2017. Following this offering, we will additionally
incur public company reporting costs of approximately $100,000 per year or $25,000 per quarter. To fund the Company’s operating
expenses following October 31, 2017, the Company will clearly require additional funding for ongoing operations and to finance
such additional business it may identify. There is no guarantee that we will be able to raise any additional capital and have
no current arrangements for any such financing.
 
Our
near term financing requirement less than 12 months, is anticipated to be approximately $2,500,000, which includes a monthly overhead
burn rate of $55,000, public reporting costs and the remainder allocated to general working capital. Beyond our near term financing
requirement (more than 12 months), we will need an additional approximately $7,250,000 to fully implement the Company’s
plan of operations.
 
The
foregoing represents the Company’s best estimates as of the date of this Prospectus and may materially vary based upon actual
experience.
 
The
inability to obtain this funding either in the near term and/or longer term will materially affect the ability of the Company
to implement its business plan of operations and jeopardize the viability of the Company. In that case, the Company may need to
suspend its operations and reevaluate and revise its plan of operations
 
We
commenced initial operations in May 2014 and have a limited operating history and, accordingly, you will not have any basis on
which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objectives.
 
We
are an early stage emerging growth company with no sales to date. Since we do not have an established operating history or regular
sales yet, you will have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objectives.
 
The
absence of any significant operating history for us makes forecasting our revenue and expenses difficult, and we may be unable
to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for unexpected revenue shortfalls or unexpected expenses.
 
As
a result of the absence of any operating history for us, it is difficult to accurately forecast our future revenue. In addition,
we have limited meaningful historical financial data upon which to base planned operating expenses. Current and future expense
levels are based on our operating plans and estimates of future revenue. Revenue and operating results are difficult to forecast
because they generally depend on our ability to promote and sell our services. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending
in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall, which would result in further substantial losses. We may
also be unable to expand our operations in a timely manner to adequately meet demand to the extent it exceeds expectations.
 


 11 
 

 
Our
limited operating history does not afford investors a sufficient history on which to base an investment decision.
 
We
are currently in the early stages of developing our business. There can be no assurance that at this time that we will operate
profitably or that we will have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due.
 
Investors
must consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies, particularly in rapidly evolving markets.
Such risks include the following:
 


 
●
Competition

 
 
 

 
●
ability
    to anticipate and adapt to a competitive market;

 
 
 

 
●
ability
    to effectively manage expanding operations; amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion
    of our business, operations, and infrastructure; and

 
 
 

 
●
dependence
    upon key personnel to market and sell our services and the loss of one of our key managers may adversely affect the marketing
    of our services.

 
We
cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful or that we will successfully address these risks. In the event
that we do not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations could
be materially and adversely affected and we may not have the resources to continue or expand our business operations.
 

 12 
 

 
We
have no profitable operating history and May Never Achieve Profitability
 
From
inception, XTRIBE P.L.C. (the “Company”) was organized to develop free smartphone applications which allow the user
to sell, buy, swap and rent objects and services utilizing an active geolocation tool which locates all potential customers within
any specified geographic target. The Company will derive revenues by through its B2B division, XTRIBE Store. In this regard, the
Company seeks to reshape smartphone e-commerce by delivering a new, easy-to-use application providing added value to the user.
As of the date of this prospectus, the Company has yet to engage in any meaningful business activities. Through December 31, 2016,
the Company has not generated any revenues and the Company has operated with minimal overhead. We are faced with all of the risks
associated with a company in the early stages of development. Our business is subject to numerous risks associated with a relatively
new, low-capitalized company engaged in our business sector. Such risks include, but are not limited to, competition from well-established
and well-capitalized companies, and unanticipated difficulties regarding the marketing and sale of our applications. There can
be no assurance that we will ever generate significant revenues or achieve profitability. Should this be the case, our Ordinary
Shares could become worthless and investors in our Ordinary Shares or other securities could lose their entire investment.
 
The
inability to obtain this funding either in the near term and/or longer term will materially affect the ability of the Company
to implement its business plan of operations and jeopardize the viability of the Company. In that case, the Company may need to
suspend its operations and reevaluate and revise its plan of operations
 

The
Company may be unable to complete its expansion plans if it does not raise sufficient funds in the Offering.
 

Taking into account financial resources on
hand (which will permit the Company to operate through October 2017), the Company needs to raise at least $1,500,000 in
its Offering in order to complete the roll-out of its products in Italy. The Company will need to raise at least $2,250,000
or more in its Offering in order to expand to other markets, including the United States. See Use of Proceeds.
If the Company is not able to raise sufficient funding, it may need to scale back operations and/or defer entry into more lucrative
markets. This inability may significantly hamper the growth prospects of the Company and impair shareholder value.
 
Dependence
on our Management, without whose services Company business operations could cease.
 
At
this time, our management is wholly responsible for the development and execution of our business plan. Our management is under
no contractual obligation to remain employed by us, although they have no present intent to leave. If our management should choose
to leave us for any reason before we have hired additional personnel our operations may fail. Even if we are able to find additional
personnel, it is uncertain whether we could find qualified management who could develop our business along the lines described
herein or would be willing to work for compensation the Company could afford. Without such management, the Company could be forced
to cease operations and investors in our Ordinary Shares or other securities could lose their entire investment.
 
Our
officers and directors devote limited time to the Company’s business and are engaged in other business activities
 
At
this time, only our Chief Executive Officer devotes full time to the business and the Chairman and Chief Financial Officer devote
approximately one-half of their time to the business. Without full-time devoted management, the Company could be forced to cease
operations and investors in our Ordinary Shares or other securities could lose their entire investment.
 

Our
officers and directors may not be subject to service of process or the subject to the bringing of or enforcement of actions against
them due to their residency outside the United States.
 
The
officers and directors of the Company are all resident outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible
(a) to effect service of process within the United States on the Company’s officers and directors; (b) to enforce judgments
obtained in U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against the officers and directors;
(c) to enforce judgments of U.S. courts based on civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws in foreign courts
against the Company’s officers and directors and (d) to bring an original action in foreign courts to enforce liabilities
based on the U.S. federal securities laws against the Company’s officers and directors. As a result, Company shareholders
and investors may find themselves without effective recourse against any of the Company’s officers and directors.
 
Concentrated
control risks; shareholders could be unable to control or influence key corporate actions or effect changes in the Company’s
board of directors or management.
 
Our
current officers and directors currently own approximately 3,193,100 Ordinary Shares (including shares held by entities of which
they are a beneficial owner), representing approximately 35.5% of the voting control of the Company. Our current officers and
directors therefore have the power to make all major decisions regarding our affairs, including decisions regarding whether or
not to issue stock and for what consideration, whether or not to sell all or substantially all of our assets and for what consideration
and whether or not to authorize more stock for issuance or otherwise amend our charter or bylaws.
 


 13 
 

 
Lack
of additional working capital may cause curtailment of any expansion plans while raising of capital through sale of equity securities
would dilute existing shareholders’ percentage of ownership
 
Without
taking into account the offering, we will run out of funds approximately October 31, 2017. Following this offering, we will additionally
incur public company reporting costs of approximately $100,000 per year or $25,000 per quarter. To fund the Company’s operating
expenses following October 31, 2017, the Company will clearly require additional funding for ongoing operations and to finance
additional applications and services it may identify. There is no guarantee that we will be able to raise any additional capital
and have no current arrangements for any such financing. A shortage of capital would affect our ability to fund our working capital
requirements. If we require additional capital, funds may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, if we
raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities could dilute
existing shareholders. If funds are not available, we could be placed in the position of having to cease all operations.
 
We
do not presently have a traditional credit facility with a financial institution. This absence may adversely affect our operations
 


We
are authorized to issue unlimited Ordinary Shares, of which, as of December 31, 2016, 9,000,000 were issued and outstanding. No
Preference Shares are issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2016. Additional shares may be issued by our board of directors
without further shareholder approval. The issuance of large numbers of shares, possibly at below market prices, is likely to result
in substantial dilution to the interests of other shareholders. In addition, issuances of large numbers of shares may adversely
affect the market price of our Ordinary Shares.
 
Our
inability to successfully achieve a critical mass of revenues could adversely affect our financial condition
 
No
assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully achieve a critical mass of revenue in order to cover our operating
expenses and achieve sustainable profitability. Without such critical mass of revenues, the Company could be forced to cease operations.
 
Our
success is substantially dependent on general economic conditions and business trends, a downturn of which could adversely affect
our operations
 
The
success of our operations depends to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to consumer spending. These factors
include economic conditions, activity in the financial markets, general business conditions, personnel cost, inflation, interest
rates and taxation. Our business is affected by the general condition and economic stability of our consumers and their continued
willingness to accept our products and services. An overall decline in the economy could cause a reduction in our sales and the
Company could face a situation where it never achieves a critical mass of revenues and thereby be forced to cease operations.
 

 14 
 

 

The
Company’s business is subject to the risk of foreign currency exchange losses due to fluctuations in various currencies
in the markets where it operates.
 
The
Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales
and operating expenses worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar
value of the Company’s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. On the other hand, strengthening of foreign currencies
may also increase the Company’s cost of products and services denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting
gross margins. The Company has not yet adopted a strategy to deal with these issues, which could have a material impact on
the Company’s operating results
 
Changes
in generally accepted accounting principles could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, cash flows, revenue
and results of operations
 
We
are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters that govern the measurement of our performance.
Based on our reading and interpretations of relevant guidance, principles or concepts issued by, among other authorities, the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission, our management believes that our current contract terms and business arrangements have been properly
reported. However, there continue to be issued interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range
of contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the industries in which we operate. Future interpretations or
changes by the regulators of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes
in our revenue recognition and/or other accounting policies and practices that could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, cash flows, revenue and results of operations.
 
We
will need to increase the size of our organization, and may experience difficulties in managing growth.
 
We
are a small company with no current full-time employees. We expect to experience a period of significant expansion in headcount,
facilities, infrastructure and overhead and anticipate that further expansion will be required to address potential growth and
market opportunities. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need
to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate managers. Our future financial performance and its ability to compete effectively
will depend, in part, on its ability to manage any future growth effectively.
 
We
are subject to compliance with securities law, which exposes us to potential liabilities, including potential rescission rights.
 
We
have offered and sold our Ordinary Shares to investors pursuant to certain exemptions from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as well as those of various state securities laws. The basis for relying on such exemptions is factual;
that is, the applicability of such exemptions depends upon our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors
and making the offering. We have not received a legal opinion to the effect that any of our prior offerings were exempt from registration
under any federal or state law. Instead, we have relied upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemptions, including information
provided by investors themselves.
 
If
any prior offering did not qualify for such exemption, an investor would have the right to rescind its purchase of the securities
if it so desired. It is possible that if an investor should seek rescission, such investor would succeed. A similar situation
prevails under state law in those states where the securities may be offered without registration in reliance on the partial preemption
from the registration or qualification provisions of such state statutes under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act
of 1996. If investors were successful in seeking rescission, we would face severe financial demands that could adversely affect
our business and operations. Additionally, if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which it has relied, we may become
subject to significant fines and penalties imposed by the SEC and state securities agencies.

Company made the decision to become an SEC “reporting company” in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
We incur certain costs of compliance with applicable SEC reporting rules and regulations including, but not limited to attorneys
fees, accounting and auditing fees, other professional fees, financial printing costs and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs in an
amount estimated at approximately $100,000 per year. On balance, the Company determined that the incurrence of such costs and
expenses was preferable to the Company being in a position where it had very limited access to additional capital funding.
 
The
availability of a large number of authorized but unissued shares of Ordinary Stock may, upon their issuance, lead to dilution
of existing shareholders.
 
We
are authorized to issue unlimited Ordinary Shares, of which, as of December 22, 2016, 9,000,000 were issued and outstanding. No
Preference Shares are issued and outstanding as of October 26, 2016. Additional shares may be issued by our board of directors
without further shareholder approval. The issuance of large numbers of shares, possibly at below market prices, is likely to result
in substantial dilution to the interests of other shareholders. In addition, issuances of large numbers of shares may adversely
affect the market price of our Ordinary Shares.
 
Our
need for additional capital that could dilute the ownership interest of investors.
 
We
require substantial working capital to fund our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related
or convertible debt securities, these securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of holders
of our Ordinary Shares and they may experience additional dilution. We cannot predict whether additional financing will be available
to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. Since our inception, we have experienced negative cash flow from operations
and expect to experience significant negative cash flow from operations in the future. The issuance of additional Ordinary Shares
or Preference Shares by the Company may have the effect of further diluting the proportionate equity interest and voting power
of holders of our Ordinary Shares.
 
We
may not have adequate internal accounting controls. While we have certain internal procedures in our budgeting, forecasting and
in the management and allocation of funds, our internal controls may not be adequate.
 
We
are constantly striving to improve our internal accounting controls. Our board of directors has not designated an Audit Committee
and we do not have any outside directors. We do not have a dedicated full time Chief Financial Officer. We hope to develop an
adequate internal accounting control to budget, forecast, manage and allocate our funds and account for them. There is no guarantee
that such improvements will be adequate or successful or that such improvements will be carried out on a timely basis. If we do
not have adequate internal accounting controls, we may not be able to appropriately budget, forecast and manage our funds, we
may also be unable to prepare accurate accounts on a timely basis to meet our continuing financial reporting obligations and we
may not be able to satisfy our obligations under US securities laws.
 

 16 
 

 
We
may not have adequate insurance coverage
 
We
currently have only general liability insurance and we cannot assure you that we would not face liability upon the occurrence
of any uninsured event which could result in any loss or damages being assessed against the Company.
 
We
are subject to numerous laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.
 
Our
operations are subject to extensive national, state and local laws and regulations relating to the financial markets. Future laws
or regulations, any adverse change in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with existing
legal requirements may result in substantial penalties and harm to our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with governmental regulations. Our operations
could be significantly delayed or curtailed and our cost of operations could significantly increase as a result of regulatory
requirements or restrictions. We are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect
on our operations.
 
We
do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future
 
We
currently intend to retain all future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. We do not intend to pay
any cash dividends in the foreseeable future but will review this policy as circumstances dictate.
 
There
is currently no market for our securities and there can be no assurance that any market will ever develop or that our Ordinary
Shares will be listed for trading.
 
There
has not been any established trading market for our Ordinary Shares and there is currently no market for our securities. Even
if we are ultimately approved for trading on the NYSE MKT or other market(s), there can be no assurance as the prices at which
our Ordinary Shares will trade if a trading market develops, of which there can be no assurance. Until our Ordinary Shares are
fully distributed and an orderly market develops, (if ever) in our Ordinary Shares, the price at which it trades is likely to
fluctuate significantly.
 
Prices
for our Ordinary Shares will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors, including the depth and liquidity
of the market for the Ordinary Shares, developments affecting our business, including the impact of the factors referred to elsewhere
in these Risk Factors, investor perception of us and general economic and market conditions. No assurances can be given that an
orderly or liquid market will ever develop for our Ordinary Shares. Due to the anticipated low price of the securities, many brokerage
firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities.
 
Our
Ordinary Shares are subject to the Penny Stock Regulations
 
Our
Ordinary Shares will likely be subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules to the extent that the price remains
less than $5.00. Those rules, which require delivery of a schedule explaining the penny stock market and the associated risks
before any sale, may further limit your ability to sell your shares.
 
The
SEC has adopted regulations which generally define “penny stock” to be an equity security that has a market price
of less than $5.00 per share. Our Ordinary Shares, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition of penny
stock and subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons
other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000, or annual incomes
exceeding $200,000 or $300,000, together with their spouse).
 
For
transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such
securities and have received the purchaser’s prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction,
other than exempt transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure
document mandated by the Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is
the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer’s presumed control over the market.
Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information
on the limited market in penny stocks. Consequently, the `penny stock` rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell
our Ordinary Shares and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Ordinary Shares in the secondary market.
 


 17 
 

 
Our
Ordinary Shares are illiquid and subject to price volatility unrelated to our operations
 
The
market price of our Ordinary Shares could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of
our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of other companies in the same industry, trading volume
in our Ordinary Shares, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting
our competitors or us. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has
had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance
and could have the same effect on our Ordinary Shares. Sales of substantial amounts of Ordinary Shares, or the perception that
such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Ordinary Shares and could impair our ability to raise capital
through the sale of our equity securities.
 
Management
will have broad discretion as to the use of the proceeds from this offering, and we may not use the proceeds effectively.
 
Our
management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from this offering and could spend the proceeds in
ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our shares. Our failure to apply these funds effectively
could have a material adverse effect on our business, stunt the growth of our business domestically and in foreign markets, and
cause the price of our Ordinary Shares to decline.
 

 18 
 

 
You
will experience immediate and substantial dilution in the net tangible book value per share of the Ordinary Shares you purchase.
 

Since
the price per Ordinary Share being offered is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per Ordinary Share, you will
suffer substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of the Ordinary Shares you purchase in this offering. Based on the
public offering price of $6.00 per share, if you purchase Ordinary Shares in this offering, you will suffer immediate and substantial
dilution of $5.45 per share in the net tangible book value of the Ordinary Shares assuming 100% of the shares offered are sold;
$5.56 per share if 80% of the shares offered are sold; $5.71 if 50% of the shares offered are sold and $5.87 per share is 25%
of the shares offered are sold. See the section entitled “Dilution” below for a more detailed discussion of the dilution
you will incur if you purchase Ordinary Shares in this offering.
 
You
may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings and other issuances of our Ordinary Shares or other securities.
In addition, this offering and future equity offerings and other issuances of our Ordinary Shares or other securities may adversely
affect our Ordinary Share price.
 
In
order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our Ordinary Shares or other securities convertible
into or exchangeable for our Ordinary Shares, including but not limited to Preference Shares and convertible debt. We cannot assure
you that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater
than the price per share paid by investors in this offering, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future
could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional Ordinary Shares or securities
convertible into Ordinary Shares in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share in this offering. In addition,
the sale of shares in this offering and any future sales of a substantial number of Ordinary Shares in the public market, or the
perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the price of our Ordinary Shares. We cannot predict the effect, if
any, that market sales of those shares of Ordinary Shares or the availability of those Ordinary Shares for sale will have on the
market price of our Ordinary Shares.
 
We
have not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures, in the absence of which, shareholders may have more limited
protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters.
 
Recent
Federal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures
designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted
in response to legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities
exchanges, such as the NYSE or the Nasdaq Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures
that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address board of directors’ independence,
audit committee oversight, and the adoption of a code of ethics. We have not yet adopted any of these corporate governance measures
and, since our securities are not yet listed on a national securities exchange, we are not required to do so. It is possible that
if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, shareholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances
that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define
responsible conduct. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating
their investment decisions.
 
We
may be deemed to be a “shell company”
 
Rule
405 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 defines a “shell company” as a registrant…that has no or nominal
operations; and either (a) no or nominal assets; (b) assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or (c) assets consisting
of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets. While the Company does not believe that it is a “shell
company”, designation as a “shell company” could result in the application of Rule 144(i), which would limit
the availability of the exemption from registration provided in Rule 144 for certain shares of Company Ordinary Shares and could
result in certain persons affiliated with the Company being deemed “statutory underwriters under Rule 145(c).

For
as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including
those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.
 
In
April 2012, President Obama signed into law the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act contains
provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for “emerging growth companies,” including
certain requirements relating to accounting standards and compensation disclosure. We are classified as an emerging growth company.
For as long as we are an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, we
will not be required to, among other things, (1) provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment
of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes
Oxley Act of 2002, (2) comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the
PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required
to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer, (3) comply with any new audit
rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012 unless the SEC determines otherwise, (4) provide certain disclosure regarding
executive compensation required of larger public companies or (5) hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation.
 
Further,
our independent registered public accounting firm is not yet required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal
controls over financial reporting, and will not be required to do so for as long as we are an “emerging growth company”
pursuant to the provisions of the JOBS Act.
 
Under
the JOBS Act we have elected to use an extended period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
 
We
have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1),
which allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private
until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable
to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry
 
If
the market does not accept or embrace our applications and services, our business may fail.
 
The
applications and services we are offering have not been tested in the market on a large-scale basis. As a result, we can only
speculate as to the market acceptance of these products and services. No assurance can be given that the market will accept our
products and services, or any of them. If the public fails to accept our products and services to a satisfactory degree, our business
may fail.
 
Our
market is highly competitive.
 
The
market for smartphone applications is highly competitive and most competitive companies and products will be far better financed
and capitalized and have substantially greater resources than ours. While we believe that our applications and services are competitive
with applications and services provided by other companies, there is no guarantee that we will be able to effectively compete
against them, and if we do not effectively compete, our business may fail.
 
If
we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights adequately, our business could be adversely affected.
 
We
seek to protect our intellectual property through trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality, non-compete and nondisclosure agreements,
trademarks, domain names and other measures, some of which afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our
proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property or to obtain and use property
that we regard as proprietary. We cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate. In addition,
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States.
Intellectual property protections may also be unavailable, limited or difficult to enforce in some countries, which could make
it easier for competitors to steal our intellectual property. Our failure to protect adequately our intellectual property and
proprietary rights could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
An
assertion by a third party that we are infringing its intellectual property could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation
or expensive licenses and our business might be harmed.
 
We
might not prevail in any intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties
in such litigation. Defending such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time-consuming and distracting to management, result
in costly litigation or settlement, cause development delays, or require us to enter into licensing agreements.

SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
This
prospectus contains forward-looking statements. This prospectus includes statements regarding our plans, goals, strategies,
intent, beliefs or current expectations. These statements are expressed in good faith and based upon a reasonable basis when made,
but there can be no assurance that these expectations will be achieved or accomplished. These forward looking statements can be
identified by the use of terms and phrases such as “believe,” “plan,” “intend,” “anticipate,”
“target,” “estimate,” “expect,” and the like, and/or future-tense or conditional constructions
“may,” “could,” “should,” etc. Items contemplating or making assumptions about, actual or
potential future sales, market size, collaborations, and business opportunities also constitute such forward-looking statements.
 
Although
forward-looking statements in this report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, forward-looking statements are inherently
subject to known and unknown risks, business, economic and other risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially
different from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in
order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this report, other than as may be required by applicable
law or regulation. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in our reports filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission which attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect
our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize,
or if the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those expected or projected.

for the Selling Shareholders.

DETERMINATION
OF OFFERING PRICE
 
Since
our shares are not listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system, the offering price of the shares was arbitrarily determined.
 
The
offering price of the Company’s shares has been determined arbitrarily by us and does not necessarily bear any relationship
to our book value, assets, past operating results, financial condition or any other established criteria of value. The facts considered
in determining the offering price were our financial condition and prospects, our limited operating history and the general condition
of the securities market. Although our Ordinary Shares is not listed on a public exchange, we intend to apply for listing on the
NYSE MKT or other market(s) prior to completion of the Offering. In order to be quoted on the NYSE MKT or other trading market(s),
a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our Ordinary Shares. There can be no assurance
that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, nor can there be any assurance that such an application
for quotation will be approved.
 
In
addition, there is no assurance that our Ordinary Shares will trade at market prices in excess of the initial public offering
price as prices for the Ordinary Shares in any public market which may develop will be determined in the marketplace and may be
influenced by many factors, including the depth and liquidity.
 
The
Selling Shareholders may sell their shares in the over-the-counter market or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time
of sale, at prices related to the prevailing market price, or at negotiated prices. We will not receive any proceeds from the
sale of Ordinary Shares by the Selling Shareholders.
 
DILUTION
 

Our
historical net tangible book value as of December 31, 2016 was approximately ($190,183), or approximately ($0.021) per share of
Ordinary Stock (after adjusting for all forward stock splits). Our historical net tangible book value is the amount of our total
tangible assets less our liabilities. Historical net tangible book value per common share is our historical net tangible book
value divided by the number of shares of Ordinary Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2016.
 
After
giving effect to the sale of 1,000,000 shares of our Ordinary Stock in this offering at the public offering price of $6.00 per
share of Ordinary Shares and after deducting the estimated offering expenses payable by us, our as-adjusted net tangible book
value as of December 31, 2016 would have been approximately $5,723,079, or $0.572 per share of Ordinary Stock (after adjusting
for all forward stock splits). This represents an immediate increase in pro forma net tangible book value of approximately $0.593 per
share to our existing Ordinary stockholders, and an immediate dilution of approximately $5.43 per Ordinary Share to new investors
purchasing securities in this offering at the assumed public offering price.
   
The
following table illustrates this dilution on a per share basis:

MARKET
FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS
 
Holders
 

As
of December 31, 2016, there were approximately 25 record holders of our Ordinary Shares. As of December 31, 2016, there were 9,000,000
Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding. No public market currently exists for our Ordinary Shares or Preference Shares. We intend
to apply to have our shares initially listed for quotation on the NYSE MKT and/or other trading market(s).
 
The
Securities Enforcement and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990
 
The
Securities and Exchange Commission has also adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions
in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered
on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq system, provided that current price and volume information with
respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system).
 
A
purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to sell the stock. The shares offered by this prospectus constitute
penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act. The shares will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future. The classification
of penny stock makes it more difficult for a broker-dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which makes it more difficult
for a purchaser to liquidate his/her investment. Any broker-dealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or
her shares in us will be subject to Rules 15g-1 through 15g-10 of the Securities and Exchange Act. Rather than creating a need
to comply with those rules, some broker-dealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny stock.
 
The
penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver
a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission, which:
 


 
●
contains
    a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading;

 
 
 

 
●
contains
    a description of the broker’s or dealer’s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the
    customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended;

 
 
 

 
●
contains
    a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including “bid” and “ask” prices for penny
    stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price;

 
 
 

 
●
contains
    a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions;

 
 
 

 
●
defines
    significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks; and

 
 
 

 
●
contains
    such other information and is in such form (including language, type, size and format) as the Securities and Exchange Commission
    shall require by rule or regulation;

 


 24 
 

 
The
broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, to the customer:
 


 
●
the
    bid and offer quotations for the penny stock;

 
 
 

 
●
the
    compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction;

 
 
 

 
●
the
    number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity
    of the market for such stock; and

 
 
 

 
●
monthly
    account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account.

 
In
addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the
broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive
the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions
involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements will have
the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock
rules. Therefore, shareholders may have difficulty selling their securities.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 

Overview
 
The
Company was originally registered as a private limited company in the United Kingdom as MEC FOOD (UK) LTD on December 12, 2011.
On May 12, 2014, the Company changed its name to XTRIBE Limited. On April 30, 2016, the Company was registered as a public limited
company and changed its name to XTRIBE P.L.C. The Company has developed a free smartphone application which allows the user to
sell, buy, swap and rent objects and services utilizing an active geolocation tool which locates all potential customers within
any specified geographic target. Transactions can be completed without any intermediary, directly between party and counter-party,
without any commissions or third-party payments. Users have the option of customizing the app to best promote commerce. The Company
derives revenues by its B2B division, XTRIBE Store. The XTRIBE application is available for Apple and Android devices and can
be easily downloaded for free to a user’s mobile device. Once installed, the user establishes a free account and can immediately
transact and communicate with other users.
 
To
date we have not generated material revenues.  Commencing in 2017, we expect to generate revenue streams through the
use of our fully developed and operational application by its registered users. The Company is currently only operating in Italy,
but plans to expand its operations to the United States and other selected markets in the next 12-24 months.
 

As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $427,777
cash on hand which management believes is sufficient to fund expenses of operation through October 2017. Management further believes
that it needs to raise a minimum of an additional approximately $1,500,000 in the Offering to complete its product roll-out
and marketing and support in Italy. Additional proceeds will enable the Company to expand to the United States and other international
markets.
 
Xtribe
B2B: Revenue Model
 
The
Xtribe revenue model is based on the provision of subscribed access for professional users as well as on the placement of credit
packages for the purchase of additional services focused on professional users and others. There are two models within the Xtribe
platform: the first is based on the Free and Store profile types (and their upgrades), and the second is based
on a system of credits which are purchased in packages and which give access to additional functions and higher
visibility.
 
Xtribe
Free:
 
This
is a profile dedicated to persons and entities who wish to sell their property or services freely and in the simplest way possible.
 
Features: allows
up to 3 products and 3 services at the same time. These slots are permanently available for free. For example, if a user has three
items for sale at the same time and one of them is purchased, that slot automatically becomes available for the seller to offer
another item.

Agency
Agreement
 
On
June 30, 2016, the Company entered into an agency agreement for Italy whereby the agent would receive five percent of all sales
that the agent introduced to the Company. In addition, the agent would reimburse the Company 55 percent of the software development
costs that the Company had expended, which were $638,720 as of June 30, 2016.
 
Consulting
Agreement
 
The
Company has a consulting arrangement for application development with a company in which the Chief Executive Officer has a material
interest. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, this company was owed $18,964 and $0. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and
2015, the Company paid $101,511 and $108,756 to this company. There is no written agreement between the parties.
 
Strategic
Outlook
 
We
believe that the connectivity between by buyers and sellers, the geolocation attributes, and the multilingual capabilities of
our application will provide the source for our success in a currently underutilized market.
 
As
our registered user base grows, we intend to hire additional information technology staff to maintain our product offerings and
develop new products to increase our market share.
 
We
believe that our near-term success will depend particularly on our ability to develop customer awareness and confidence in our
application.  Since we have limited capital resources, we will need to closely manage our expenses and conserve our
cash by continually monitoring any increase in expenses and reducing or eliminating unnecessary expenditures. Our prospects must
be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development, particularly
given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets, that we have limited financial resources, and face an uncertain economic
environment. We may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties.
 
Results
of Operations
 
Comparison
of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015
 
The
following discussion analyzes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The following information
should be considered together with our condensed financial statements for such period and the accompanying notes thereto.
 
Net
Revenue/Net Loss
 
We
have not generated significant revenue since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have not generated
any sales. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had a net loss of $554,328 and $380,720.
 
General
and Administrative Expenses
General
and administrative expenses increased by $329,834 to $379,068 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $49,234 for the year ended
December 31, 2015. The increase resulted primarily from increases in consulting costs of $198,604 and management fees of
$125,507.
 
Sales
and Marketing
 
Sales
and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 were $83,437 as compared to $58,860 for the year ended December 31,
2015, an increase of $24,577. This is a result of its continuing marketing campaign during the year ended December 31, 2016
to increase market awareness. 
 


 29 
 

 

Research
and Development
 
Research
and development expenses were $298,531 and $272,626 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, an increase of $25,905. The
increase is related to enhancements and updates to the application software.
 
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
 
As
of March 30, 2017, the Company has a cash position of approximately $183,687. Based upon the current cash position and the Company’s
planned expense run rate, management believes the Company has funds currently to finance its operations through October 2017.
 
Net
cash used in operating activities increased by $347,878 to $729,315 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $381,437
for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase resulted primarily from other receivables related to the reimbursement of software
development costs and the net loss described above.
 
Net
cash provided by financing activities increased by $470,787 to $987,614 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $516,827 for
the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016, consisted of
issuances of ordinary shares of approximately $615,000 compared to $361,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015, additional
loans payable – shareholders of approximately $429,000 compared to $156,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 and
the repayment of loans payable shareholders of approximately $56,000 compared to $0 during the year ended December 31, 2015.

 

 30 
 

 

As
we have not realized any revenues since our inception, we have financed our operations through private offerings of debt and equity
securities. We do not currently maintain a line of credit or term loan with any commercial bank or other financial institution.
 
Since
our inception, we have focused on developing and implementing our business plan. We believe that our existing cash resources will
not be sufficient to sustain our operations during the next twelve months. We currently need to generate sufficient revenues to
support our cost structure to enable us to pay ongoing costs and expenses as they are incurred, finance the development
of our platform, and execute the business plan. If we cannot generate sufficient revenue to fund our business plan, we
intend to seek to raise such financing through the sale of debt and/or equity securities. The issuance of additional equity would
result in dilution to existing shareholders. If we are unable to obtain additional funds when they are needed or if such
funds cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to us, we will be unable to execute upon the business plan or pay costs and
expenses as they are incurred, which would have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
 
Even
if we are successful in generating sufficient revenue or in raising sufficient capital in order to complete the platform,
our ability to continue in business as a viable going concern can only be achieved when our revenues reach a level that sustains
our business operations. There can be no assurance that we will raise sufficient proceeds, or any proceeds, for us to implement
fully our proposed business plan. Moreover there can be no assurance we will generate revenues sufficient to fund our operations.
In either such situation, we may not be able to continue our operations and our business might fail.
 
 Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements
 
As
of December 31, 2016, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
 
Critical
Accounting Policies
 
Our
financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during
their preparation. A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements included elsewhere
herein.

PROPERTIES
 
Offices
 

The
Company does not currently transact any business at its office in London and it merely provides the Company with a presence in
the United Kingdom. There is no formal arrangement in place for these offices and the Company does not incur any cost or expense
with respect thereto. Similarly, at this time, the Company does not incur any expense with respect to any other facilities it
may utilize. In this regard, the Company does not have any operating offices or facilities at this time. Most of the work required
for the Company t this time is performed by consultants and managers who work from their residences or personal offices. The Company
operates in this manner to minimize its operating overhead until it is profitable. The Company does intend to lease offices to
support its operations when funding and/or revenues support that expense.

Dividend
Policy
 
We
have never paid cash dividends on our Ordinary Shares. Under applicable law, we may declare and pay dividends on our Ordinary
Shares either out of our surplus, as defined in applicable law, or if there is no such surplus, out of our net profits for the
fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. If, however, the capital of our company, computed
in accordance with applicable law, has been diminished by depreciation in the value of our property, or by losses, or otherwise,
to an amount less than the aggregate amount of the capital represented by the issued and outstanding shares of all classes having
a preference upon the distribution of assets, we are prohibited from declaring and paying out of such net profits any dividends
upon any of our shares until the deficiency in the amount of capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes
having a preference upon the distribution of assets shall have been repaired.

Selling
Shareholders
 
The
Selling Shareholders shall have the sole and absolute discretion not to accept any purchase offer or make any sale of shares if
it deems the purchase price to be unsatisfactory at any particular time.
 
The
Selling Shareholders may also sell the shares directly to market makers acting as principals and/or broker-dealers acting as agents
for themselves or their customers. Such broker-dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions
from the Selling Shareholders and/or the purchasers of shares for whom such broker-dealers may act as agents or to whom they sell
as principal or both, which compensation as to a particular broker-dealer might be in excess of customary commissions. Market
makers and block purchasers purchasing the shares will do so for their own account and at their own risk. It is possible that
the Selling Shareholders will attempt to sell shares of Ordinary Shares in block transactions to market makers or other purchasers
at a price per share which may be below the then existing market price. We cannot assure that all or any of the shares offered
in this Prospectus will be issued to, or sold by, the Selling Shareholders. The Selling Shareholders and any broker-dealers or
agents, upon completing the sale of any of the shares offered in this Prospectus, may be deemed to be “underwriters”
as that term is defined under the Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of such acts. In such event, any commissions
received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting
commissions or discounts under the Act.
 
The
Selling Shareholders, alternatively, may sell all or any part of the shares offered in this Prospectus through an underwriter.
The Selling Shareholders have not entered into any agreement with a prospective underwriter and there is no assurance that any
such agreement will be entered into.
 
We
know of no existing arrangements between the Selling Shareholders and any other stockholder, broker, dealer or agent relating
to the sale or distribution of the shares. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of the Selling Shareholders
pursuant to this Prospectus. We have agreed to bear the expenses of the registration of the shares, including legal and accounting
fees, and such expenses are estimated to be approximately $30,000.
 
A
Selling Shareholder may pledge his/her/its shares to their respective brokers under the margin provisions of customer agreements.
If a Selling Shareholder defaults on a margin loan, the broker may, from time to time, offer and sell the pledged shares of Ordinary
Shares. The Selling Shareholders and any other persons participating in the sale or distribution of the shares will be subject
to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations under such act, including, without limitation, Regulation
M. These provisions may restrict certain activities of, and limit the timing of purchases and sales of any of the shares by, the
Selling Shareholders or any other such person. The Selling Shareholders is not permitted to engage in short sales of Ordinary
Shares. Furthermore, under Regulation M, persons engaged in a distribution of securities are prohibited from simultaneously engaging
in market making and certain other activities with respect to such securities for a specified period of time prior to the commencement
of such distributions, subject to specified exceptions or exemptions. All of these limitations may affect the marketability of
the shares.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 
To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
XTRIBE
P.L.C.
 
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of XTRIBE P.L.C. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and
the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the years
then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such an opinion. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company’s losses from development activities raise substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty.

NOTE
1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Nature
of the Business
 
The
Company was originally registered as a private limited company in the United Kingdom as MEC FOOD (UK) LTD on December 12, 2011.
On May 12, 2014, the Company changed its name to XTRIBE Limited. On April 30, 2016, the Company was registered as a public limited
company and changed its name to XTRIBE P.L.C. The Company has developed a free smartphone application which allows the user to
sell, buy, swap and rent objects and services utilizing an active geolocation tool which locates all potential customers within
any specified geographic target. Transactions can be completed without any intermediary, directly between the party and counter-party,
without any commissions or third-party payments. Users have the option of customizing the app to best promote commerce. The Company
derives revenues by its B2B division, XTRIBE Store. The XTRIBE application is available for Apple and Android devices and can
be easily downloaded for free to a user’s mobile device. Once installed, the user establishes a free account and can immediately
transact and communicate with other users.
 
The
Company’s principal office is located in London, England.
 
Basis
of Presentation
 
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“US GAAP”).
 
Recapitalization
 
On
April 30, 2016, the Board of Directors approved and adopted a 21.1:1 recapitalization. The accompanying financial statements and
notes to the financial statements give retroactive effect to the recapitalization for all periods presented unless otherwise specified.
 
On
November 3, 2016, the Board of Directors approved and adopted a 36:1 recapitalization and a reduction in the par value of the
ordinary shares from $1.00 to $0.034. The accompanying financial statements and notes to the financial statements give retroactive
effect to the recapitalization for all periods presented unless otherwise specified.
 
Use
of Estimates
 
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.
 
Concentration
of Credit Risk
 
The
Company is exposed to credit risk in the normal course of business, primarily related to accounts receivable and cash and cash
equivalents. Substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are maintained with a financial institution in
England, namely, HSBC, which are not insured or otherwise protected. The Company maintained balances of $427,777 and $201,603
with this institution as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts
in England.
 

 F-7 
 

 
Comprehensive
Income
 
The
Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“FASB ASC”) 220, “Comprehensive
Income,” in reporting comprehensive income. Comprehensive income is a more inclusive financial reporting methodology that
includes disclosure of certain financial information that historically has not been recognized in the calculation of net income.
The Company has one item of other comprehensive income, consisting of a foreign translation adjustment.
 
Foreign
Currency Transactions and Translation
 
The
functional currency of the operations of the Company is the Euro. The capitalization of the Company is provided in British pounds
(“GBP”), while the Company transacts a majority of its other transactions including loans from shareholders in Euros,
which makes the Euro the functional currency. Gains and losses resulting from transactions in currencies other than the functional
currency of the Company are recorded in the statement of operations for the reporting periods as part of general and administrative
expense. Included in general and administrative expense were foreign currency transaction losses of $8,705 and $17,081 for the
years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 
The
reporting currency of the Company is the United States (U.S.) dollar. The financial statements in functional currency are translated
to U.S. dollars using the closing rate of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rate of exchange for the statement of
operations. The capital accounts are translated at historical rate. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income as a component of shareholders’ equity.
 
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
 
The
Company’s financial instruments consist of accounts payable and accrued expenses and loans payable. The carrying value of
accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of their short maturities. The Company believes the
carrying amount of its loans payable approximate fair value based on rates and other terms currently available to the Company
for similar debt instruments.
 
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
 
For
purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all cash accounts, which are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or
penalties, and certificates of deposit and commercial paper with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash or cash equivalents.
 
Software
 
Software
is stated at cost. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, principally
five years. Maintenance and upgrades to the software are charged to operations. Upon retirement, sale, or other disposition of
software, the costs and accumulated amortization are eliminated from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is included
in operations.
 
Long-Lived
Assets
 
The
Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets in accordance with FASB ASC 360 “Property, Plant, and Equipment.”
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets are measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of
an asset to future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, undiscounted and without interest or independent appraisals.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.
 

 F-8 
 

 
Revenue
Recognition
 
In
accordance with FASB ASC 605, “Revenue Recognition,” the Company recognizes revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of
a customer or distributor arrangement exists, (ii) a retailer, distributor or wholesaler receives the goods and acceptance occurs,
(iii) the price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured. Subject to these criteria,
the Company recognizes revenue from product sales, upon the application initialization on the XTRIBE Store by the customer.
 
 
Income
Taxes
 
The
Company follows FASB ASC 740 when accounting for income taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting
and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for temporary differences between
the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future
based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income
tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets
and liabilities. Tax years from 2013 through 2016 remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.
 
Advertising
Costs
 
Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were $83,277 and $19,869 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and
are included in sales and marketing expenses.
 
Research
and Development Costs
 
In
accordance with FASB ASC 730, research and development costs are expensed when incurred. Research and development costs for the
years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $298,531 and $272,626.
 
On
June 30, 2016, the Company entered into an agency agreement whereby the agent would receive five percent of all sales that the
agent introduced to the Company. In addition, the agent would reimburse the Company 55 percent of the software development costs
that the Company had expended, which were $638,720 as of June 30, 2016. Therefore, the amount of $351,296 was billed to the agent
in British pounds (£262,288) and was to be paid by December 31, 2016 and has been recorded as other receivable. As a result
of fluctuations in the exchange rates the other receivable was $322,581, as of December 31, 2016. The Company has extended the
payment terms of the receivable, as the amounts due are from a vendor. In 2017, the Company began offsetting amounts owed to the
vendor against payments due on the receivable. As of the date of this report, the amounts offset totaled $63,594.
 
Software
development costs that were incurred during six months ended June 30, 2016, amounting to $163,500 have been completely offset
by the agent’s reimbursement, with the remaining reimbursement balance of $206,694 reflected as other income for the year
ended December 31, 2016.
 
Software
development costs that were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016, have been expensed as incurred and recorded in research
and development costs in the statement of operations.
 
Basic
and Diluted Net Income per Share of Ordinary Shares
 
The
Company follows FASB ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share,” when reporting Earnings Per Share resulting in the presentation
of basic and diluted earnings per share. Because the Company reported a net loss for each of the years presented and because the
Company has no ordinary share equivalents, the amounts reported for basic and diluted loss per share were the same.
 
Recently
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
 
In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure
of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The amendments in this Update provide guidance
about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that
raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the
financial statements are issued and to provide related footnote disclosures. Substantial doubt about an entity’s ability
to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable
that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements
are issued. The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods
and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The amendments were adopted as of December 31, 2016, see Note
2 for management’s evaluation and disclosure.
 

 F-9 
 

 
Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
 
In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The core principle of the
guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
 
In
August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017. The Company anticipates that the impact of this guidance on the financial statements will not be material.
 
In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.
The amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement
of financial position. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is
permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company does not anticipate the adoption
of this standard to have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The amendments in this Update specify the accounting
for leases. The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases.
For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. The company anticipates that the impact of this guidance on the financial
statements will not be material.
 
In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions,
including: (1) income tax consequences; (2) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and (3) classification on
the statement of cash flows. For public companies, the amendments in the ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company currently does not have employee share-based payments
and therefore the adoption of this guidance will have no effect on the financial statements.
 
NOTE
2 – MANAGEMENT PLANS
 
The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has
incurred significant losses and experienced negative cash flow from operations since inception. These conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
Since
inception, the Company has focused on developing and implementing its business plan. The Company believes that its existing cash
resources will not be sufficient to sustain operations during the next twelve months. The Company currently needs to generate
revenue in order to sustain its operations. In the event that the Company cannot generate sufficient revenue to sustain its operations,
the Company will need to reduce expenses or obtain financing through the sale of debt and/or equity securities. The issuance of
additional equity would result in dilution to existing shareholders. If the Company is unable to obtain additional funds when
they are needed or if such funds cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to the Company, the Company would likely be unable to
execute upon the business plan or pay costs and expenses as they are incurred, which would have a material, adverse effect on
the business, financial condition and results of operations.
 

 F-10 
 

 
Based
upon the current cash position and the Company’s planned expense run rate, management believes the Company has funds currently
to finance its operations through October 2017.
 
NOTE
3 – LOANS PAYABLE – SHAREHOLDERS
 
During
the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company received loans in the amount of $149,127 from two shareholders, in which one of
them is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (See Note 7).
 
During
the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company received loans in the amount of $449,173 from four shareholders, of which one of
them was the same as in the December 31, 2015 loan transactions.
 
During
the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company repaid $56,506 of the loan payable – shareholders to its Chief Executive Officer.
 
The
loans are interest-free and unsecured with no formal repayment terms.
 
NOTE
4 – INCOME TAXES
 
The
Company follows FASB ASC 740-10-10 whereby an entity recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences
or events that have been previously recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of
deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax law. The effects of future changes in tax laws or rates
are not anticipated.
 
At
December 31, 2016, the Company has trading losses in the United Kingdom, which is similar to net operating losses in the United
States, of approximately $362,000. These losses can be carried forward to offset future taxable income indefinitely. Deferred
tax assets would arise from the recognition of anticipated utilization of these net operating losses to offset future taxable
income.

Management
determined that realization of the deferred tax assets is not assured and recorded a valuation allowance for the amount of such

As
of January 1, 2015, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits, and accordingly, the Company did not recognize interest or penalties
during 2016 and 2015 related to unrecognized tax benefits. There has been no change in unrecognized tax benefits during the years
ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and there was no accrual for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Tax years
from 2013 through 2016 remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.
 
NOTE
5 – SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
 
During
the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company sold 1,066,748 shares of the Company’s ordinary shares and raised $361,036.
 
During
the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company sold 337,522 shares of the Company’s ordinary shares and raised $602,246.
 
NOTE
6 – OPERATING LEASES
 
As
of December 31, 2016, the Company was not obligated under any non-cancelable operating lease arrangements.
 
NOTE
7 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
The
Company has a consulting arrangement with a company in which the Chief Executive Officer has a material interest. As of December
31, 2016 and 2015, this company was owed $18,964 and $0. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company paid $101,511

ITEM
9A.	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
 
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
The
Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedure include, without
limitations, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its
principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
 

In
accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was completed by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this Prospectus. Based on that evaluation, as of December 31, 2016 the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed
or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the
Commission’s rules and forms.
 
Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and
effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:
 


●
Pertain
    to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
    the assets of the company;

 
 

●
Provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

 
 

●
Provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s
    assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems,
no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control
over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore,
it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
 

 44 
 
 
As
of December 31, 2016, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria
for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments.
Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures
were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies
that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal
controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.
 
The
matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight
in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent
with control objectives; and (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned
material weaknesses were identified by our management in connection with the review of our financial statements for the period
ended December 31, 2016.
 
Management
believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However,
management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board
of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures,
which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.
 
Management’s
Remediation Initiatives
 

Given
the financial resources available to the Company, the Company is not in a position to institute any realistic remediation of the
identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls.A s such time as the Company commences
operations and has the financial resources to address and eliminate the identified weaknesses, we intend to take action to do
so. Unfortunately, until the Company has such financial resources, the identified weaknesses will continue to exist.
 
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During the period from inception (December 12, 2011) through December
31, 2016, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by
this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting.
 
Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company
have been detected.

Item
10. Indemnification of Directors and Officers
 
Pursuant
to our Company Registration and other corporate documents, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any
proceeding, including a lawsuit, because of his position, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to
be in our best interest. In certain cases, we may advance expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding. To the extent that
the officer or director is successful on the merits in any such proceeding as to which such person is to be indemnified, we must
indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorney’s fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may
be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged
liable, only by a court order. The prior discussion of indemnification in this paragraph is intended to be to the fullest extent
permitted by the laws of England and Wales.
 
Indemnification
for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be permitted to directors or officers pursuant to the
foregoing provisions. However, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Commission, such indemnification is against public
policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
 
Item
11. Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution
 
Although
we will receive no proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to this prospectus, we have agreed to bear the costs and expenses
of the registration of the shares. Our expenses in connection with the issuance and distribution of the securities being registered
are estimated as follows:

will pay any other expenses incurred in selling their Ordinary Shares, including any brokerage commissions or costs of sale.
 
Item
12. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities
 

Since
inception, the Company has sold 9,000,000 shares of Ordinary Stock which were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933.
All of said shares were sold outside of the United States pursuant to an exemption from registration in Regulation S promulgated
under the Securities Act of 1933.

Item
13. Undertakings
 
The
undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:
 
(1)            
To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:
 
i.                To
include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;
 
ii.               
To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent
post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set
forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if
the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high
end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule
424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering
price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement.
 
iii.                To
include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement
or any material change to such information in the registration statement;
 
(2)
That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall
be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at
that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
 
(3)
To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold
at the termination of the offering.
 
(4)
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and
controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that
in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act
and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment
by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful
defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the
securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy
as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
 
(5)
Each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration
statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included
in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in
a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed
incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to
a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration
statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date
of first use.
 
(6)
That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial
distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned
registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser,
if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant
will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:
 

 48 
 
 
i.
                Any preliminary prospectus or
prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;
 
ii.               
Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred
to by the undersigned registrant;
 
iii.               
The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned
registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and
 
iv.
               Any other communication that is an offer
in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.
