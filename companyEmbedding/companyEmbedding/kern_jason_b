JLL Income Property Trust | JLLIPT





























































































































            Back to Heritage
          






              Jason B. Kern
            

              Director
            







Jason B. Kern has served as the Chief Executive Officer of LaSalle’s Private Equity business in the Americas since July 2013. Mr. Kern also serves on LaSalle’s Global Management Committee, North American Investment Committee and North American Private Equity Allocation Committee. Prior to joining LaSalle, from November 2009 to July 2013, Mr. Kern worked at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), where he founded and was the head of HSBC’s Asia-Pacific Real Estate & Lodging Advisory Group. In this role, Mr. Kern worked with many of Asia’s leading REITs, developers and investors and advised on initial public offerings, equity and bond issues, private equity raises and asset acquisitions and sales in the Asian property sector, with total transaction volume exceeding $50 billion.
Prior to joining HSBC, Mr. Kern spent 17 years at J.P. Morgan, principally in senior roles within the real estate investment banking team advising REITs and other real estate companies, and was based in J.P. Morgan’s offices in the United States, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Hong Kong. Mr. Kern is on the Boards of both the National Association of Real Estate Investment Managers (NAREIM) and the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate (AFIRE). Mr. Kern serves as a director of various private REITs sponsored by our advisor. Mr. Kern holds an M.B.A. in Finance and Accounting from New York University’s Stern School of Business and a B.A. in Economics and English Literature from Colgate University.


















Summary of Risk Factors
You should read the prospectus carefully for a description of the risks associated with an investment in JLL Income Property Trust. Some of these risks include but are not limited to the following:

Since there is no public trading market for shares of our common stock, repurchases of shares by us after a one-year minimum holding period will likely be the only way to dispose of your shares.
After a required one-year holding period, we limit the amount of shares that may be repurchased under our repurchase plan to approximately 5% of our net asset value (NAV) per quarter and 20% of our NAV per annum. Because our assets will consist primarily of properties that generally cannot be readily liquidated, we may not have sufficient liquid resources to satisfy repurchase requests. Further, our Board of Directors may modify or suspend our repurchase plan if it deems such action to be in the best interest of our stockholders. As a result, our shares have limited liquidity and at times may be illiquid.
The purchase and redemption price for shares of our common stock will be based on the NAV of each class of common stock and will not be based on any public trading market. Because valuation of properties is inherently subjective, our NAV may not accurately reflect the actual price at which our assets could be liquidated on any given day.
We are dependent on our advisor to conduct our operations. We will pay substantial fees to our advisor, which increases your risk of loss.
We have a history of operating losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability.
Our advisor will face conflicts of interest as a result of, among other things, time constraints, allocation of investment opportunities, and the fact that the fees it will receive for services rendered to us will be based on our NAV, which it is responsible for calculating.
The amount of distributions we make is uncertain and there is no assurance that future distributions will be made. We may pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, including, without limitation, the sale of assets, borrowings, or offering proceeds.
Our use of leverage increases the risk of your investment.
If we fail to maintain our status as a REIT, and no relief provisions apply, we would be subject to serious adverse tax consequences that would cause a significant reduction in our cash available for distribution to our stockholders and potentially have a negative impact on our NAV.

These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” and other similar terms, including references to assumptions and forecasts of future results.

Although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that any deviation will not be material.
