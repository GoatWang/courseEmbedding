About us

































About us

We serve a broad and diverse range of consumer and industrial end markets, including: transportation, home life, construction, energy and fuels, and clothing and footwear. We develop products that address customers’ needs and help provide solutions to some of the world’s greatest challenges. Through our five divisions, we operate in more than 30 countries around the world, employing over 15,000 associates. 
Message from the Founder and Chairman
More than four decades ago, in 1970, we founded Huntsman Container Corporation.  We had no idea then that our fledgling packaging business would evolve into what has become one of the world's largest chemical companies.  Through a series of strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and carefully planned internal expansions, our operating companies today produce 33 billion pounds of products for a variety of global businesses, including chemicals, plastics, automotive, aviation, footwear, paints and coatings, construction, technology, agriculture, health care, textiles, detergent, personal care, furniture, appliances and packaging.  
Our success is due, in large measure, to the thousands of associates who work in our facilities around the world to manufacture the chemical industry's highest quality products.
We have been most fortunate to build a company of this magnitude, and it is our duty and privilege to give back to society.  Through our humanitarian initiatives, we have helped to provide food and housing to the hungry and homeless around the world; we have funded education for those who otherwise would not have been able to attend school.  
Most importantly, our dream of establishing a world class cancer research and treatment center has been realized.   The Huntsman Cancer Institute and Hospitals represents our purpose in life, and our ultimate goal will have been achieved when the most challenging forms of cancer have been eradicated.  Our family will continue to serve as the principal benefactors and fundraisers for the Huntsman Cancer Institute in the quest to prevent, diagnose, treat and cure cancer.   
Jon M. Huntsman

History[edit]
The Huntsman Corporation was initially founded as the Huntsman Container Corporation in 1970 by Jon Huntsman, Sr. It went public as the Huntsman Corporation on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE: HUN in February 2005. Huntsman has grown through a series of acquisitions (with some divestitures) and today is a manufacturer and marketer of differentiated chemical products.
In April 1994, Huntsman acquired the Texaco Chemical company for $1.06 billion.[3] Texaco Inc. agreed to sell its last remaining petrochemicals plant to Huntsman in 1999 for about $600 million.[4]
The Huntsman Corporation became the then third-largest petrochemical business in the United States when in 1999, it acquired Imperial Chemical Industries' polyurethanes, titanium dioxide, aromatics and petrochemical global businesses for $2.8 billion.[5]
Huntsman also acquired the Performance Additives and Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) businesses of Rockwood Holdings, Inc. on October 1, 2014, to become the second-largest global producer of titanium dioxide and inorganic color pigments for uses like paints and industrial coatings.[6] Huntsman paid approximately $1 billion in cash and assumed certain unfunded European pension liabilities.[7]
Terminated takeover by Access Industries[edit]
In June 2007, it was announced that Huntsman had agreed to be acquired by Access Industries, owned by the billionaire Len Blavatnik, for $5.88 billion in cash. Huntsman shareholders would receive $25.25 a share from Access Industries' chemical unit, Basell Holdings, based in Hoofddorp, Netherlands. Access would assume $3.7 billion of Huntsman debt.
However, on July 12, 2007, the agreement was terminated as Huntsman agreed to be bought by Apollo Management for $6.51 billion or $28 a share.[8] Huntsman filed a suit against Apollo Management and its two partners in Texas after the group backed out of the deal to purchase the chemical company. The suit alleged fraud against Apollo Management as Huntsman believed that the group never intended to allow its Hexion Specialty Chemicals unit to buy Huntsman Corp. for $6.5 billion. Huntsman also claimed Apollo put forth a higher bid to prevent the Basell AF buyout as it would have threatened Hexion's market share. Hexion stated Huntsman's declining financial position as the reason the deal was terminated.[9] Upon termination of the Hexion merger agreement, the Huntsman stock value dropped by almost 50%.
In December 2008, Apollo and Hexion agreed to pay Huntsman $1 billion in return for Huntsman dropping all charges against them. A suit against the funding banks was settled in 2009 for $632 million in cash and $1.1 billion in loans to the Huntsman Corporation.[10]
Merger of equals: HuntsmanClariant[edit]
In May 2017, Huntsman and Clariant announced that they would merge, as equals, forming HuntsmanClariant which would be the global leader in speciality chemical production - with the deal valued at $20 billion.[11][12] Clariant shareholders will own 52% of the new entity, with Huntsman shareholders owning the remaining 48% of shares.[13][14]
Business segments[edit]
Advanced Materials is a supplier of synthetic and formulated polymer systems. Huntsman’s epoxy, acrylic and polyurethane-based polymer products are used to replace traditional materials in aircraft, automobiles and electrical power transmission.
Polyurethanes manufactures MDI-based polyurethane solutions used in an extensive range of applications and market sectors. Polyurethanes provide key benefits of energy efficiency, comfort, and well-being. Insulation products conserve energy in housing and commercial properties and play a critical role in the food supply chain – keeping products at the right temperature in refrigerated vehicles, chiller cabinets, and refrigerators. Polyurethanes also provide comfort and well-being in automotive seating, furniture, bedding, and footwear. Adhesive products, coatings, and elastomers are used extensively throughout consumer and industrial applications.
Performance Products manufactures products primarily based on amines, carbonates, surfactants and maleic anhydride. End uses include agrochemicals, oil and gas and alternative energy solutions, home detergents and personal care products, adhesives and coatings, mining, and polyurethane/epoxy curing agents.
Pigments and Additives is a manufacturer of titanium dioxide pigments and additives used to add performance and color to items such as paints, inks, plastics and concrete to cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food.
Textile Effects manufactures and markets textile dyes and chemicals that enhance color and improve performance such as fade resistance, UV-blocking and the ability to repel water and stains in apparel, home, and technical textiles.

History[edit]
The Huntsman Corporation was initially founded as the Huntsman Container Corporation in 1970 by Jon Huntsman, Sr. It went public as the Huntsman Corporation on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE: HUN in February 2005. Huntsman has grown through a series of acquisitions (with some divestitures) and today is a manufacturer and marketer of differentiated chemical products.
In April 1994, Huntsman acquired the Texaco Chemical company for $1.06 billion.[3] Texaco Inc. agreed to sell its last remaining petrochemicals plant to Huntsman in 1999 for about $600 million.[4]
The Huntsman Corporation became the then third-largest petrochemical business in the United States when in 1999, it acquired Imperial Chemical Industries' polyurethanes, titanium dioxide, aromatics and petrochemical global businesses for $2.8 billion.[5]
Huntsman also acquired the Performance Additives and Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) businesses of Rockwood Holdings, Inc. on October 1, 2014, to become the second-largest global producer of titanium dioxide and inorganic color pigments for uses like paints and industrial coatings.[6] Huntsman paid approximately $1 billion in cash and assumed certain unfunded European pension liabilities.[7]
Terminated takeover by Access Industries[edit]
In June 2007, it was announced that Huntsman had agreed to be acquired by Access Industries, owned by the billionaire Len Blavatnik, for $5.88 billion in cash. Huntsman shareholders would receive $25.25 a share from Access Industries' chemical unit, Basell Holdings, based in Hoofddorp, Netherlands. Access would assume $3.7 billion of Huntsman debt.
However, on July 12, 2007, the agreement was terminated as Huntsman agreed to be bought by Apollo Management for $6.51 billion or $28 a share.[8] Huntsman filed a suit against Apollo Management and its two partners in Texas after the group backed out of the deal to purchase the chemical company. The suit alleged fraud against Apollo Management as Huntsman believed that the group never intended to allow its Hexion Specialty Chemicals unit to buy Huntsman Corp. for $6.5 billion. Huntsman also claimed Apollo put forth a higher bid to prevent the Basell AF buyout as it would have threatened Hexion's market share. Hexion stated Huntsman's declining financial position as the reason the deal was terminated.[9] Upon termination of the Hexion merger agreement, the Huntsman stock value dropped by almost 50%.
In December 2008, Apollo and Hexion agreed to pay Huntsman $1 billion in return for Huntsman dropping all charges against them. A suit against the funding banks was settled in 2009 for $632 million in cash and $1.1 billion in loans to the Huntsman Corporation.[10]
Merger of equals: HuntsmanClariant[edit]
In May 2017, Huntsman and Clariant announced that they would merge, as equals, forming HuntsmanClariant which would be the global leader in speciality chemical production - with the deal valued at $20 billion.[11][12] Clariant shareholders will own 52% of the new entity, with Huntsman shareholders owning the remaining 48% of shares.[13][14]
Business segments[edit]
Advanced Materials is a supplier of synthetic and formulated polymer systems. Huntsman’s epoxy, acrylic and polyurethane-based polymer products are used to replace traditional materials in aircraft, automobiles and electrical power transmission.
Polyurethanes manufactures MDI-based polyurethane solutions used in an extensive range of applications and market sectors. Polyurethanes provide key benefits of energy efficiency, comfort, and well-being. Insulation products conserve energy in housing and commercial properties and play a critical role in the food supply chain – keeping products at the right temperature in refrigerated vehicles, chiller cabinets, and refrigerators. Polyurethanes also provide comfort and well-being in automotive seating, furniture, bedding, and footwear. Adhesive products, coatings, and elastomers are used extensively throughout consumer and industrial applications.
Performance Products manufactures products primarily based on amines, carbonates, surfactants and maleic anhydride. End uses include agrochemicals, oil and gas and alternative energy solutions, home detergents and personal care products, adhesives and coatings, mining, and polyurethane/epoxy curing agents.
Pigments and Additives is a manufacturer of titanium dioxide pigments and additives used to add performance and color to items such as paints, inks, plastics and concrete to cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food.
Textile Effects manufactures and markets textile dyes and chemicals that enhance color and improve performance such as fade resistance, UV-blocking and the ability to repel water and stains in apparel, home, and technical textiles.

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
