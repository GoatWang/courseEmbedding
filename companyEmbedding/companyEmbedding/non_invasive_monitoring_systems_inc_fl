Outsmart Burglars  the Moment You Plug It In





“I built SimpliSafe to make home security simpler and smarter. It uses advanced wireless technology, there’s no annual contracts, and it saves you hundreds. I’m proud of that.”
Chad Laurans, CEO & Chief Engineer

After his friends were robbed, Chad Laurans discovered a serious problem in the home security industry. You want your home to be safe, but alarm companies charge huge fees of $45 a month and lock you in long-term contracts. The demands are just too high.
So Chad Built Something New.
Relying on his electrical engineering degree from Yale and an MBA from Harvard, he designed an advanced home security system. He called it SimpliSafe.
Now it’s the fastest growing home security company in the nation. SimpliSafe won’t lock you in a long-term contract and 24/7 professional monitoring is only $14.99 a month.
Protect your home—the smart way. 










Award-Winning Home Security
Winner of CNET Editor’s Choice Award, Angie’s List Super Service Award, and A+ Rated by the Better Business Bureau.








Dave Ramsey, Personal Finance Expert:
“Protecting your family is important, but don’t ever sign a long-term contract. Do it the right way with SimpliSafe. These are the good guys!”





Joe Balog, Police Chief:
"My force used SimpliSafe to stop a serial burglary ring. It still helps us catch other criminals in the act today."





Unlike SimpliSafe, most burglar alarms are far too expensive, here’s why...



With so many people making a profit, they need to use sneaky tactics to extract money from you

They bait you with a “$99” offer though there’s typically $1,500 of hidden fees beneath the hood.
They lock you into 2-3 year contracts that contain fine print such as auto-renewal clauses. (Click to find out why the Government is considering making them illegal).
Their alarms use old wired technology and they’re hard to use (so you need to pay a service engineer for even the most straightforward task).




At SimpliSafe, There Are No Middlemen.
SimpliSafe has sliced out shady annual contracts, intrusive installations, and costly middlemen. We designed our system from scratch to give you everything you need in a security system plus some exciting bells and whistles. We sell direct to you, online. Our system is easy to self-install, and we pass the savings onto you with excellent equipment pricing and monthly monitoring for just $14.99/month.

 describes SimpliSafe alarms as

Many alarm companies have absolutely huge sneaky hidden fees. They advertise their alarms as being “from $99”, then they get you to sign a contract for over $1,000—and you can’t leave them for at least 3 years. But SimpliSafe alarms have no hidden charges.
We’re so confident you’ll love your SimpliSafe alarm that we’ll let you try it RISK-FREE with an incredible no-risk 60-day money back guarantee. SimpliSafe alarms are reliable, easy to use, have no annual contracts and
                no hidden costs.

9 Things to Avoid When Choosing A Traditional Alarm Company
We listened to all the things you dislike about traditional burglar alarm companies... then fixed them.




Traditional Alarm Company
SimpliSafe: a Better Way






                        Old wired technology. Traditional alarm companies 
                        want to put wires in your walls, because they know 
                        that ripping their wires out is hard and expensive.
                        



                        State-of-the-art 100% wireless technology. We 
                        took micro-chip technology and 
                        developed smarter software to offer you a robust 
                        and reliable security system. With wireless, there 
                        are no holes in your walls.
                        






                        Monitoring is $42.99 a month.
                        



                        Ours is just $14.99 a month. SimpliSafe protects your home 
                        with COPS Monitoring - named BEST MONITORING in the 
                        Industry by the Central Station Alarm Association.
                        





                        The moment you let them put a system into your home, you’re 
                        typically locked into a $1,547 contract with no way out.
                        



                        No annual contracts! Our customers stay with us because of 
                        our excellent product quality and helpful customer support.
                        





                        Auto-renewal clauses grab another $1,547 from you if you don’t 
                        cancel them within 90 days of the end of your three-year term. 
                        Forget to cancel? You’re legally trapped—there’s no way out.
                        




                        No hidden charges, no 
                        commitments, no sneaky tricks.
                        





                        Many frustrated customers (just google “alarm system 
                        complaints” or “alarm contract complaints” and see 
                        for yourself).
                    



                        Growing by word of mouth. See our Facebook fan page.
                        





                        Uses a phone line to connect to the monitoring center. 
                        Burglars sometimes cut phone lines.
                        



                        Uses its built-in and independent cellular connection, which is 
                        5-10 seconds faster, and is uncuttable. No phone line required.
                        





                        Prices are kept high because there are so many 
                        middlemen and salespeople involved.
                        



                        We don’t have expensive salespeople or middlemen. That’s 
                        how we can afford to keep our prices so low.
                        





                        Installation typically costs between $99 and $500. You’ll 
                        need to take a day off of work, while the installer drills 
                        holes in your walls.
                        



                        Set-up is easier than you could ever imagine. No tools 
                        needed, just adhesive pads. The unit actually talks to you 
                        while you’re setting it up. One of our customers purchased a 
                        second system for his daughter’s home and was “looking 
                        forward to the joy of installing it for her.” Watch our

                        easy installation video to see what he means.
                        

                        Does easy set-up mean the system is flimsy or less secure?  
                        No! Quite the opposite. No wires means there’s nothing for 
                        burglars to cut.
                        




                        As soon as you sign up, there’s no going back: 
                        you cannot cancel even if you try.

Nearly One Million Americans TrustSimpliSafe to Protect Them. Here’s Why:



Dennis R.
Amarillo, TX



This morning at 6:45 AM, my phone rang. It was the SimpliSafe operator, telling me that my alarm was going off. I had them call the police and they were there within minutes. The glass in the back door had been broken but the system worked perfectly and the intruders ran away. We only had to replace a small pane of glass.







Greg W.
Clarksville, TN



Our home was burglarized two weeks ago. I purchased a system that night and installed it within the week. Today, the thieves returned and the alarm scared them off. The officers were at my home within minutes. Nothing was taken.  SimpliSafe works.







Lauren B.
Tacoma, WA



We installed our system and within one week, the water sensor placed at our water heater set off the alarm. Sure enough, the T/P valve had opened on our water heater. The monitoring service alerted us in under 60 seconds. No water damage whatsoever! Way to go Simplisafe! Our system paid for itself that day.







Stephanie T.
Toledo, OH



I love my system. It saved us from thousands of dollars in damage when the power went out in our house in Northern Ohio on the coldest day in February (-17°!). The monitoring center alerted us in Florida that the power was out and the temperature in the house was dropping fast. We were able to contact an electrician to repair the problem. Without the system we never would have known and would have had major freeze damage.






SimpliSafe is recommended by ABC, Fox News, NBC & more!





















“No installation, no annual contracts, very smart.”






“Everything is included, and it’s portable so if you change apartments, you can just bring it with you.”






“David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe vs ADT: 
                SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger 
                rivals by giving consumers what they really
                 want. Even without fancy marketing, word 
                 is spreading.”  see review








SimpliSafe is not for you if...


1
You have a HUGE home: If your home is larger than 20,000 
            square feet (about the size of a football field)—or if it has more 
            than 50 windows on the first floor—you would probably benefit 
            from a system that can handle a huge number of sensors. Our 
            advice would be to go to a traditional contract security company
            —and keep in mind the things we’ve warned you about.


2
You run a large commercial property such as a 
            shopping mall—you would probably benefit from a 
            system that has CCTV or security guards, in which 
            case you should probably go to one of the traditional 
            contract security companies—and keep in mind the 
            things we’ve warned you about.



However, if you’re one of the 95% of people who don’t run a large commercial property, then SimpliSafe is probably the best
            choice for you. If you’re in any doubt, contact one of our security consultants at 1-888-957-4675 for free friendly advice.

This Incredibly Easy DIY Set-Up Saves You Hundreds!



Most alarm companies make set-up complicated so they can force you to pay outrageous installation fees. With SimpliSafe there are NO expensive set-up fees, NO complicated wiring, and NO strangers drilling holes in your walls!



				Sleek wireless alarms are so easy to install, anyone can do it! And it will look so good that your neighbors will think you spent hundreds!
			

				All your sensors arrive pre-programmed, batteries installed & adhesive strips ready-mounted—so you can arm your home against intruders in under an hour.
			






Most Alarms Have Two Dangerous Defects—SimpliSafe Doesn’t
Learn the Two Powerful Secrets for Stopping Intruders In Their Tracks:
				Most wireless alarm systems have a dangerous defect—if an intruder smashes the Keypad quickly enough, the police don’t get alerted. SimpliSafe has solved this problem: we took the brains of your system out of your keypad, and hid them in your Base Station.

Its fortified by a nationwide network of fiber optic cables running along multiple signal carriers. You’re protected even during catastrophic natural disasters. That means it’s real security you can count on.



Maximum Safety—at a Miniature Price

This is the most affordable and comprehensive protection possible. 24/7 professional protection is just $14.99—with a free cellular connection built-in!
Most alarm companies charge you over $30, $40 or sometimes $50 every month…for the exact same level of monitoring.

You can cancel at any time

SimpliSafe is the ONLY alarm company that gives you the freedom to subscribe to our monitoring service for as long as you want and cancel at any time, without any termination fees or hassles. You pay $14.99 per month and that’s it.

SimpliSafe is There...Even When the Lights Go Out


Never fear a power outage or electricity failure again. SimpliSafe runs on powerful lithium batteries that last 5 years—so you stay secure when the electricity fails. Plus, the Base Station comes equipped with a built-in rechargeable backup battery, which can power your system for 24 hours and be recharged at any time.


Customer Review: Donald Meehan
“I have had my system for about 6 weeks now my wife and I love it. We just lost power for four days, I took the base to my in-laws and recharged it twice. It worked great during the power outage. I spoke to some neighbors who have also recently got alarms with other companies, they were very upset because their system died pretty quickly and were not able to recharge it.”









You’ll Save Up to 20% on Home Insurance With this Certificate


Home insurance companies know the value of professional alarm monitoring. That’s why you will save 5% to 20% on your insurance premiums when your protect your home with SimpliSafe monitoring!
With savings that great, your professional alarm monitoring might even pay for itself. Over 100,000 SimpliSafe customers are saving money on their insurance premiums! These are just a small sample of the insurance companies we work with:













Firefighters Straight to your Door


When a fire is burning in your home every second counts. SimpliSafe smoke detectors are built with photoelectric sensors for faster detection of a fire before it breaks into a flame, giving you and your family more time to get up and out of your home. Photoelectric sensors like ours are less likely to trigger annoying false alarms.
Never worry about sleeping through a fire alarm. This monitored detector will sound its own internal siren as well as trigger the full security system alarm.






Our competitor’s model sells for $79.99. Ours is $29.99. How do we sell the highest quality sensors at half the price? No middlemen.






Extreme Range—and Fully Customizable for Your Home





SimpliSafe sensors have a huge range of 400 ft., so our system is perfect for homes and businesses of any size (unless you live in the Superdome).
Some alarm companies make it almost impossible to personalize your alarm for your home. Every SimpliSafe alarm system is 100% customizable to meet your home’s unique needs. Our systems support up to 41 sensors—you can add more at any time via our online security shop or with a quick call to our friendly support team.





Smart Sensors Never Mistake Pets for Burglars


SimpliSafe uses more precise motion sensors to ensure your pets won’t trigger your alarms. Simply place your motion sensors where your pets can’t fiddle with them, and your cats or dogs can comfortably play at home without triggering an alarm.

It’s Easier Than Ever to Test Your Sensors

It’s easy to make sure your pets won’t set off your alarm with SimpliSafe’s unique Test Mode. And our security specialists are available for a consultation if you’re having trouble finding the right position!

Homeowners with big pets love this trick

Normally, the Motion Sensor looks straight out and down towards the ground. If your pet is triggering the sensor, just place it about 4-5 feet above ground level, and turn it upside down! This way, your pet can’t trigger it, but an intruder will!








Moving is Easier than Ever—Fully Portable Alarms





All SimpliSafe Equipment will fit a new home quickly and easily. Moving to a larger place? No problem. Order extra sensors anytime

Simple Re-Installation

We include extra 3M command strips in every box, making it easy for you to move sensors to a new home. These adhesive strips are super strong, but are also engineered to pull off cleanly without damaging your walls.





Total Security— Exceptional Savings



CNET calls SimpliSafe “better, smarter home security...you’ll have a hard time finding a better option at a better price.” Here’s why:
We protect your home 24 hours a day with a state-of-the-art security system, professional alarm monitoring, and instant police dispatch. Your security system is so effective that actual Wisconsin police uses it to catch criminals. We use COPS monitoring—winner of CSAA’s Best-in-Industry Monitoring.
...and it’s only 14.99/month Compare that to the $50/month most other companies charge. That adds up to savings of over $500 every year.

What is an “auto-renewal clause” anyway?
Most alarm companies have an automatic renewal clause in their monitoring and service contract (and use teeny tiny font). This means that your contract will be renewed for anywhere from 12 months to three years, unless you cancel by mail within 30 days before the end of your contract. Many of the nationwide and local alarm companies use this tactic. Cancelling early usually involves a penalty of 75% to 100% of the value of the contract. 

SimpliSafe offers monthly alarm monitoring. There are no contracts to sign, so there’s no fear of getting tricked by fine print and hidden fees. You can cancel your SimpliSafe alarm monitoring anytime by simply giving us a call.

"SimpliSafe security system is inexpensive, transportable..."








"All the bells and whistles for a lot less money"








SimpliSafe is our idea of not getting robbed.








"Some things can keep you tethered to landline service, such as your home's security system. Not so with SimpliSafe Inc."








SimpliSafe was featured in Elle Decor's top punchlist.








"This ingenious security system uses wireless technology..."








I really like the SimpliSafe security system for its easy setup, expandability, custom setup options and ability to move with you if you relocate. I think the price for the system is really affordable when you compare it to other security systems on the market. It gets a thumbs up from me.








SimpliSafe offers wireless, plug-and-play security for urban dwellers—increasingly being used in the era of disappearing land lines.








Wireless Wonders: SimpliSafe is an affordable, but full-featured, wireless security system similar to the expensive, professionally installed ones.








"David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe  vs ADT: SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger rivals by giving consumers what they really want. Even without fancy marketing, word is spreading."








Security Doesn't Get Any Easier. Setup took less than 15 minutes from start to finish and drastically improved my peace of mind.









Rating: Strong Recommend (the highest rating). "This is a system anyone could setup in under 30 minutes." See full review  
If you've got a car alarm, using the SimpliSafe home security system will come as naturally and easily. 
							All sensor units come prepared with removable adhesive backs (the 3M variety that adheres well, but removes easily).

Outsmart Burglars  the Moment You Plug It In





“I built SimpliSafe to make home security simpler and smarter. It uses advanced wireless technology, there’s no annual contracts, and it saves you hundreds. I’m proud of that.”
Chad Laurans, CEO & Chief Engineer

Get your free keychain remote!


After his friends were robbed, Chad Laurans discovered a serious problem in the home security industry. You want your home to be safe, but alarm companies charge huge fees of $45 a month and lock you in long-term contracts. The demands are just too high.
So Chad Built Something New.
Relying on his electrical engineering degree from Yale and an MBA from Harvard, he designed an advanced home security system. He called it SimpliSafe.
Now it’s the fastest growing home security company in the nation. SimpliSafe won’t lock you in a long-term contract and 24/7 professional monitoring is only $14.99 a month.
Protect your home—the smart way. 










Award-Winning Home Security
Winner of CNET Editor’s Choice Award, Angie’s List Super Service Award, and A+ Rated by the Better Business Bureau.








Dave Ramsey, Personal Finance Expert:
“Protecting your family is important, but don’t ever sign a long-term contract. Do it the right way with SimpliSafe. These are the good guys!”





Joe Balog, Police Chief:
"My force used SimpliSafe to stop a serial burglary ring. It still helps us catch other criminals in the act today."





Unlike SimpliSafe, most burglar alarms are far too expensive, here’s why...



With so many people making a profit, they need to use sneaky tactics to extract money from you

They bait you with a “$99” offer though there’s typically $1,500 of hidden fees beneath the hood.
They lock you into 2-3 year contracts that contain fine print such as auto-renewal clauses. (Click to find out why the Government is considering making them illegal).
Their alarms use old wired technology and they’re hard to use (so you need to pay a service engineer for even the most straightforward task).




At SimpliSafe, There Are No Middlemen.
SimpliSafe has sliced out shady annual contracts, intrusive installations, and costly middlemen. We designed our system from scratch to give you everything you need in a security system plus some exciting bells and whistles. We sell direct to you, online. Our system is easy to self-install, and we pass the savings onto you with excellent equipment pricing and monthly monitoring for just $14.99/month.

 describes SimpliSafe alarms as

Many alarm companies have absolutely huge sneaky hidden fees. They advertise their alarms as being “from $99”, then they get you to sign a contract for over $1,000—and you can’t leave them for at least 3 years. But SimpliSafe alarms have no hidden charges.
We’re so confident you’ll love your SimpliSafe alarm that we’ll let you try it RISK-FREE with an incredible no-risk 60-day money back guarantee. SimpliSafe alarms are reliable, easy to use, have no annual contracts and
                no hidden costs.

                        want to put wires in your walls, because they know 
                        that ripping their wires out is hard and expensive.
                        



                        State-of-the-art 100% wireless technology. We

                        and reliable security system. With wireless, there 
                        are no holes in your walls.

                        The moment you let them put a system into your home, you’re 
                        typically locked into a $1,547 contract with no way out.
                        



                        No annual contracts! Our customers stay with us because of 
                        our excellent product quality and helpful customer support.
                        





                        Auto-renewal clauses grab another $1,547 from you if you don’t 
                        cancel them within 90 days of the end of your three-year term. 
                        Forget to cancel? You’re legally trapped—there’s no way out.
                        




                        No hidden charges, no 
                        commitments, no sneaky tricks.
                        





                        Many frustrated customers (just google “alarm system 
                        complaints” or “alarm contract complaints” and see 
                        for yourself).
                    



                        Growing by word of mouth. See our Facebook fan page.
                        





                        Uses a phone line to connect to the monitoring center. 
                        Burglars sometimes cut phone lines.
                        



                        Uses its built-in and independent cellular connection, which is 
                        5-10 seconds faster, and is uncuttable. No phone line required.
                        





                        Prices are kept high because there are so many 
                        middlemen and salespeople involved.
                        



                        We don’t have expensive salespeople or middlemen. That’s 
                        how we can afford to keep our prices so low.
                        





                        Installation typically costs between $99 and $500. You’ll 
                        need to take a day off of work, while the installer drills 
                        holes in your walls.
                        



                        Set-up is easier than you could ever imagine. No tools 
                        needed, just adhesive pads. The unit actually talks to you 
                        while you’re setting it up. One of our customers purchased a 
                        second system for his daughter’s home and was “looking 
                        forward to the joy of installing it for her.” Watch our

                        easy installation video to see what he means.
                        

                        Does easy set-up mean the system is flimsy or less secure?  
                        No! Quite the opposite. No wires means there’s nothing for 
                        burglars to cut.
                        




                        As soon as you sign up, there’s no going back: 
                        you cannot cancel even if you try.

Nearly One Million Americans TrustSimpliSafe to Protect Them. Here’s Why:



Dennis R.
Amarillo, TX



This morning at 6:45 AM, my phone rang. It was the SimpliSafe operator, telling me that my alarm was going off. I had them call the police and they were there within minutes. The glass in the back door had been broken but the system worked perfectly and the intruders ran away. We only had to replace a small pane of glass.







Greg W.
Clarksville, TN



Our home was burglarized two weeks ago. I purchased a system that night and installed it within the week. Today, the thieves returned and the alarm scared them off. The officers were at my home within minutes. Nothing was taken.  SimpliSafe works.







Lauren B.
Tacoma, WA



We installed our system and within one week, the water sensor placed at our water heater set off the alarm. Sure enough, the T/P valve had opened on our water heater. The monitoring service alerted us in under 60 seconds. No water damage whatsoever! Way to go Simplisafe! Our system paid for itself that day.







Stephanie T.
Toledo, OH



I love my system. It saved us from thousands of dollars in damage when the power went out in our house in Northern Ohio on the coldest day in February (-17°!). The monitoring center alerted us in Florida that the power was out and the temperature in the house was dropping fast. We were able to contact an electrician to repair the problem. Without the system we never would have known and would have had major freeze damage.






SimpliSafe is recommended by ABC, Fox News, NBC & more!





















“No installation, no annual contracts, very smart.”






“Everything is included, and it’s portable so if you change apartments, you can just bring it with you.”






“David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe vs ADT: 
                SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger 
                rivals by giving consumers what they really
                 want. Even without fancy marketing, word 
                 is spreading.”  see review








SimpliSafe is not for you if...


1
You have a HUGE home: If your home is larger than 20,000 
            square feet (about the size of a football field)—or if it has more 
            than 50 windows on the first floor—you would probably benefit 
            from a system that can handle a huge number of sensors. Our 
            advice would be to go to a traditional contract security company
            —and keep in mind the things we’ve warned you about.


2
You run a large commercial property such as a 
            shopping mall—you would probably benefit from a 
            system that has CCTV or security guards, in which 
            case you should probably go to one of the traditional 
            contract security companies—and keep in mind the 
            things we’ve warned you about.



However, if you’re one of the 95% of people who don’t run a large commercial property, then SimpliSafe is probably the best
            choice for you. If you’re in any doubt, contact one of our security consultants at 1-888-957-4675 for free friendly advice.

SimpliSafe protects your properties with COPS Monitoring. It was recently named Best Monitoring in the Industry according to the independent Central Station Alarm Association.
Real safety is reinforced. COPS central stations are U.L.-Listed, F.M.-Approved, and Five Diamond Certified—the highest caliber protection available. Its fortified by a nationwide network of fiber optic cables running along multiple signal carriers. You’re protected even during catastrophic natural disasters. That means it’s real security you can count on.



Maximum Safety—at a Miniature Price

This is the most affordable and comprehensive protection possible. 24/7 professional protection is just $14.99—with a free cellular connection built-in!
Most alarm companies charge you over $30, $40 or sometimes $50 every month…for the exact same level of monitoring.

100% Satisfaction Guaranteed

We at Simplisafe are committed to providing you with 
		   only the best products and services. Our goal is to 
			make your life safer and easier. If you are in any way 
			unsatisfied with your SimpliSafe product or service, 
			please contact us and we’ll do our best to make it right.








3 Year Product Warranty

Even after 60 days has passed, you still benefit from our 
		   three-year product warranty. If anything goes wrong with

		   whatever it takes to sort things out usually, we’ll just send you  
		   a replacement part, completely free of charge. We can afford 
		   to offer this because our components are so reliable.







What is an “auto-renewal clause” anyway?
Most alarm companies have an automatic renewal clause in their monitoring and service contract (and use teeny tiny font). This means that your contract will be renewed for anywhere from 12 months to three years, unless you cancel by mail within 30 days before the end of your contract. Many of the nationwide and local alarm companies use this tactic. Cancelling early usually involves a penalty of 75% to 100% of the value of the contract. 

SimpliSafe offers monthly alarm monitoring. There are no contracts to sign, so there’s no fear of getting tricked by fine print and hidden fees. You can cancel your SimpliSafe alarm monitoring anytime by simply giving us a call.

"No installation, no contracts, very smart."








We have thousands of Facebook Fans. Click here to see how they're raving about us.








"SimpliSafe security system is inexpensive, transportable..."








"All the bells and whistles for a lot less money"








SimpliSafe is our idea of not getting robbed.








"Some things can keep you tethered to landline service, such as your home's security system. Not so with SimpliSafe Inc."








SimpliSafe was featured in Elle Decor's top punchlist.








"This ingenious security system uses wireless technology..."








I really like the SimpliSafe security system for its easy setup, expandability, custom setup options and ability to move with you if you relocate. I think the price for the system is really affordable when you compare it to other security systems on the market. It gets a thumbs up from me.








SimpliSafe offers wireless, plug-and-play security for urban dwellers—increasingly being used in the era of disappearing land lines.








Wireless Wonders: SimpliSafe is an affordable, but full-featured, wireless security system similar to the expensive, professionally installed ones.








"David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe  vs ADT: SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger rivals by giving consumers what they really want. Even without fancy marketing, word is spreading."








Security Doesn't Get Any Easier. Setup took less than 15 minutes from start to finish and drastically improved my peace of mind.









Rating: Strong Recommend (the highest rating). "This is a system anyone could setup in under 30 minutes." See full review  
If you've got a car alarm, using the SimpliSafe home security system will come as naturally and easily. 
							All sensor units come prepared with removable adhesive backs (the 3M variety that adheres well, but removes easily).

Small changes can make a difference
There’s more to life with diabetes than most people think, and making small changes to your daily routine can help make managing it a little easier.
It's easy to talk yourself out of exercising, eating healthy food, or testing as much as you should. But every positive step you take, no matter how small, is a step forward.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
