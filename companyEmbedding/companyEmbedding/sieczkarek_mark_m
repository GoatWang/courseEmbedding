About NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Going Beyond Antibiotics®
NovaBay Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing the unmet therapeutic needs of the global, topical anti-infective market with its Aganocide compounds, led by auriclosene. Auriclosene is a new chemical entity invented by NovaBay that has a broad spectrum of activity against bacteria, viruses and fungi. Aganocide compounds are based on the human body’s natural immune system and the molecules involved in combating infections. Bacterial resistance to Aganocides is highly unlikely, as demonstrated in published studies. Once pathogens penetrate the body’s primary defense, the next line of defense is provided by the white blood cells. NovaBay has focused on understanding these molecules generated by the white blood cells and finding ways, by chemical modification, to allow them to be developed as therapeutic products with the potential to treat a wide range of local, non-systemic infections. NovaBay believes that Aganocides will help reduce the rise of antibiotic resistance as they begin to supplant the usage of classic topical antibiotics.
Forward-looking Statements
This release contains forward-looking statements and opinions, which are based upon management’s current expectations, assumptions, estimates, projections and beliefs. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding building shareholder value and the effect that Aganocides may have. The words “look forward,” “unlikely,” “believe” and “will” are intended to identify these forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or achievements to be materially different and adverse from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to difficulties or delays in development, clinical trial, regulatory approval, production and marketing of the company’s product candidates, unexpected adverse side effects or inadequate therapeutic efficacy of the product candidates, the uncertainty of patent protection for the company’s intellectual property or trade secrets, the company’s ability to obtain additional financing as necessary and unanticipated research and development and other costs. Other risks relating to NovaBay and Aganocide compounds, including risks that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements in this press release, are detailed in NovaBay’s latest Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, especially under the heading “Risk Factors.” The forward-looking statements in this release speak only as of this date, and NovaBay disclaims any intent or obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statement except as required by law.

NovaBay® Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE MKT: NBY), a biopharmaceutical company commercializing and developing topical non-antibiotic antimicrobial products for the global eye care market, announces the appointment of Mark M. Sieczkarek as Chairman of the Board, effective April 10, 2015.  NovaBay founder Dr. Ron Najafi remains on the Board and continues to serve as NovaBay’s President and Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Sieczkarek has served as a director of NovaBay since January 2014.
“With an impressive background in ophthalmology and product launches, Mark Sieczkarek is ideally qualified to serve as our Board Chairman,” said Dr. Najafi.  “Since joining our Board earlier this year, Mark has played an instrumental role in developing a well-conceived commercial strategy for Avenova™, our proprietary prescription product for the management of eye lid conditions.  We are delighted by the market’s early acceptance of Avenova and will be looking for Mark’s continued guidance in supporting the success of NovaBay.”
“I’m extremely pleased to be named NovaBay’s Chairman at this exciting time as the Company transitions to a commercially focused eye-care entity,” said Mr. Sieczkarek.  “I’m very impressed with the benefit Avenova brings patients who have suffered for years with blepharitis and dry eye.  I look forward to contributing to this product’s success and advancing NovaBay’s overall business strategy.”
Mr. Sieczkarek was elected Chairman of Solta Medical, Inc. in June 2013, and in August 2013 was named interim President and Chief Executive Officer.  He served in these positions until Solta Medical was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in January 2014.  Prior to Solta Medical, Mr. Sieczkarek was President and Chief Executive Officer of Conceptus, Inc., where he oversaw the successful commercial launch of the Essure® permanent birth control device.  He previously was Senior Vice President and President of The Americas and Europe for the leading ophthalmic company Bausch & Lomb, Inc., with responsibility for commercial operation in the United States, Canada Latin America, Europe and Africa.
Additionally, NovaBay announces the appointment of Mr. LI Xinzhou (Paul Li) to the Board of Directors, also effective April 10, 2015.  Mr. Li is Chairman, Executive Director of China Pioneer Pharma Holdings Limited, the exclusive distributor of NovaBay’s NeutroPhase® Skin and Wound Cleanser in China and Southeast Asia.  Mr. Li has not been appointed to any committees and will not receive compensation for his Board membership.  He will stand for re-election to the Board at NovaBay’s 2015 annual meeting of stockholders, which will be held June 12, 2015.  Mr. Li’s appointment increases the size of the NovaBay Board to nine directors.
“I am delighted that Paul Li of China Pioneer Pharma, NovaBay’s largest shareholder, is joining the Board,” added Dr. Najafi.  “Paul and his company have been tremendous supporters of NovaBay both as a distributor and as an investor.  Paul has been our Board’s Asia-Pacific advisor for more than two years, providing his vision and strategic thinking for introducing NovaBay products into the China and Southeast Asia markets, as well as facilitating the collaboration between our companies.”
Mr. Li founded China Pioneer Pharma in July 1996, and is responsible for managing the operations and planning, and for formulating the company’s strategies.  He has more than 18 years of experience in the pharmaceutical services industry and has more than 20 years of experience in international trading and management.  Prior to China Pioneer Pharma, Mr. Li worked at the Hainan branch of Sumitomo Corporation.  Mr. Li graduated from Jianghan Petroleum Normal School with a diploma in English and studied at the China Europe International Business School.
NovaBay also announces that current directors Charles J. Cashion and Tony Wicks have informed the Company’s Board that they will not stand for re-election at the 2015 annual meeting.  Following their departures, the Audit Committee will be chaired by Gail Maderis and the Compensation Committee will be chaired by Mr. Sieczkarek.  In addition to Mr. Li, Dr. Alex McPherson will stand for re-election to the Board at the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders.
