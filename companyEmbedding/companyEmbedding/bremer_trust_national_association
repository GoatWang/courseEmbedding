Online Banking Help
Answers to some of your questions about Online Banking



Getting started



    What information do I need to enroll in Online Banking?




You will be asked for personal and account information. We suggest having your last statement balance or account-opening balance on hand. Additional detailed information about the enrollment process is found in our Online Banking Help. 




    How do I find the Login from Bremer.com?




Desktop: If you are on a desktop PC or Mac from the home page of Bremer.com, you should see a toolbar on the right-hand side of the window. Simply use the drop-downs to choose your account type (Personal Banking) and online system (Online Banking), then select Sign In.

Don't see a toolbar? Depending on your window size or resolution settings, you  may instead see a set of small icons. Select or click any of these icons to expand the toolbar, then follow the steps listed above. 

Tablet: Select any of the blue icons on the right-hand side of the page to expand the toolbar. Then use the drop-downs to choose your account type (Personal Banking) and online system (Online Banking), then select Sign In.
Smartphone or Other Mobile Device: Select the blue padlock icon to access the secure login area. Then use the drop-downs to choose your account type (Personal) and online system (Online Banking), then select Sign In. For the best user experience with a smartphone, we recommend using Mobile Banking via bremer.com/mobile or by downloading our free Bremer Bank Mobile app from Google Play or the App Store.




    Why do I need a one-time security code?




To protect your account, you may be prompted for an extra level of security. Our online system takes into account multiple factors that may prompt an additional level of security. For instance, if your system does not allow cookies or if this is the first time logging in from this device, you will be prompted for the security code.




    What if I don't recognize, or am not available at, the phone number for the security code?




If you are being prompted to use a one-time security code, but the online banking system does not recognize or provide your phone number, select the link for Answer verification questions instead. 
To avoid this issue in the future, you will need to update your phone number(s) on record with us. After you have logged in, go to the Customer Service menu then Manage contact information.




    Why is nothing happening after I select the Login button?




Look in the lower-left or upper-right corner of your browser to see if a pop-up blocker has activated. Change your browser settings or options to always allow pop-ups from this website. Some newer browsers may need to have compatibility mode enabled. Look for your browser’s Tools or Options menu and select Compatibility View.




    Why does it say my password is invalid?




This error message indicates that the password entered does not match the associated User ID. Try logging in again, or use the Reset it yourself link located just below the Password field.




    What steps should I follow the first time I log in?




To get the most out of Online Banking, we suggest following these three steps after your first login: 
1. Sign up for Online Statements. Go to the Customer Service menu and select Change document delivery method.
2. Enroll in Bill Pay. Go to the Pay and transfer menu to get started. Then simply enter and save your commonly-paid bills for future access, and paying bills will be easier than ever.
3. Add Mobile Banking. Download our free mobile app from the App Store or Google Play, then follow the steps to activate mobile access. You’ll be able to check balances, pay bills to saved payees and more, all from your smartphone.





Using the system



    What steps should I follow the first time I log in?




To get the most out of Online Banking, we suggest following these three steps after your first login: 
1. Sign up for Online Statements. Go to the Customer Service menu and select Change document delivery method.
2. Enroll in Bill Pay. Go to the Pay and transfer menu to get started. Then simply enter and save your commonly-paid bills for future access, and paying bills will be easier than ever.
3. Add Mobile Banking. Download our free mobile app from the App Store or Google Play, then follow the steps to activate mobile access. You’ll be able to check balances, pay bills to saved payees and more, all from your smartphone.




    Where do I add a bill or payee?




Make it easier to pay any bill, any time. Store your payee information by using the Pay and transfer menu. If you wish to pay bills from our mobile app on your smartphone, you will need to set up the payee from a traditional desktop online banking session first.




    How do I sign up for alerts?




Go to Customer Service > Manage alerts to choose from available account and security alerts.




    Where do I find my online statements?




First, sign up for online statements by going to Customer Service > Change document delivery method. You will receive an email when your regular account statement is ready to view. It can be found by going to Accounts > Statements.




    How do I make an external transfer?




Log in to Online Banking and go to the Pay and transfer menu. Then select Get started with External Transfers. Follow the on-screen prompts to establish your external account(s) for transfers. You will need to validate that external account before transfers can be made.




    Who can make external transfers?




Only account owners can make external transfers. To make an external transfer through Online Banking, the external account must be established first.




    Where can I find additional help?




Additional how-to instructions and frequently asked questions are available in the Help feature within Online Banking.





Troubleshooting



    Why does it say an invalid ID or password was entered?




As the error message states, either an incorrect User ID or password was entered. (In most cases, we find this message is the result of entering an incorrect User ID.) Go to Bremer.com again – do not use your Back key, but instead re-type Bremer.com into the address bar of the browser – to begin the login process again. If you continue to get this error message, call Bremer Phone Bank at 800-908-BANK (2265) to confirm your Online Banking User ID.




    Why does it say my password is invalid?




This error message indicates that the password entered does not match the associated User ID. Try logging in again, or use the Reset it yourself link located just below the Password field.




    What if I don't recognize, or am not available at, the phone number for the security code?




If you are being prompted to use a one-time security code, but the online banking system does not recognize or provide your phone number, select the link for Answer verification questions instead. 
To avoid this issue in the future, you will need to update your phone number(s) on record with us. After you have logged in, go to the Customer Service menu then Manage contact information.




    Why is nothing happening after I select the Login button?




Look in the lower-left or upper-right corner of your browser to see if a pop-up blocker has activated. Change your browser settings or options to always allow pop-ups from this website. Some newer browsers may need to have compatibility mode enabled. Look for your browser’s Tools or Options menu and select Compatibility View.




    Why is my personal account not showing in Online Banking?




In order to view an account in online banking, you must be an account owner.

If you are an authorized signer or Power of Attorney on the account: The account will not display in online banking. Instead, you may access the account in branches, through ATM or debit card transactions, and by contacting Bremer Phone Bank at 800-908-BANK (2265). 


If you are a Trustee, Guardian, Personal Rep, Rep Payee, VA Fiduciary, Custodian or Conservator on the account: Please talk with a personal banker at the Bremer Bank near you to validate the account’s signature card. The personal banker can also help process a request to add online banking access to the account(s) in question. Until this is complete, you may continue to access the account in branches, through ATM or debit card transactions, and by contacting Bremer Phone Bank at 800-908-BANK (2265). 


If you are an account owner, but still cannot view the account, please contact a personal banker or call Bremer Phone Bank at 800-908-BANK (2265) to research the issue.





    Why is my business account not showing in Online Banking?




Our personal Online Banking solution is not designed to support business accounts.
If you wish to access both your personal and business accounts through one online banking session, we encourage you to enroll in our Business Online Banking solution.




    Why am I seeing pop-up ads in Online Banking?




Bremer Bank occasionally advertises our own products and services just after login. If you see third-party ads during your session, you may wish to install a pop-up blocker and refer to your security software. If the issue persists, you may wish to consult a computer expert for assistance.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.

                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
