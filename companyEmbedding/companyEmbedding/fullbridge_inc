Corporate
Learning Labs & Working Labs powered by Lyra™ Technology









Fullbridge helps corporations increase daily innovation and problem solving to drive everything from product development to sales. People today have more access to information and knowledge than ever before yet they often lack the capacity to find and focus on the right ideas.
Fullbridge learning experiences help corporations:

Generate a learning culture
Work more effectively in teams
Engage in solving the problems that matter

Did you know? Support for innovation (e.g., being open to change, valuing new ideas), vision, task orientation, and external communication displayed the strongest relationships with creativity and innovation in teams (Hulsheger et al., 2009).










    Get Your Team Started
  












      I have noticed that when we have open positions, managers will call and say, ‘who went through the Fullbridge Program? I want to think about them first.’ We’ve had two or three people who’ve moved into new positions since the program ended.

        The Biggest Challenges Today
      






Constant Change
While it took 50 years for the telephone to reach approximately 75 million American homes, and 38 years for the radio to reach 38 million listeners, it took only 5 years for Facebook to reach 600 million people.



Employee Engagement
21% of millennials say they’ve changed jobs within the past year, which is more than three times the number of non-millennials who report the same. What does this turnover cost us? About $30.5 billion annually.




Inconsistent Teamwork
A pattern of oscillating between exploration and engagement accounts for more than half of the difference in creative output for research groups. In one lab it distinguished high performing teams with almost 90% accuracy.

              Stay Ahead of Change
            


            To compete today, organizations must tear down the notion of traditional learning and instead promote agility, idea flow and innovation. At Fullbridge, we believe smart learning is iterative and the influence of teams and social networks is very real. That’s why we built Lyra.

        What people are saying
      








           Our Fullbridge hire made an impact immediately. A lot of recent grads come out ingrained in school life, focused on working individually to get good grades. A mind-shift needs to occur to be successful in the workforce. His mindset was better prepared and had that shift coming in. He had self-awareness, awareness of others, and great teamwork.
         
—Manager, Strategy & Analysis, Digitas LBi








           Fullbridge has become an essential part of our culture…Our success as a firm depends on how well we prepare our young attorneys for the challenges they will face in the real-world practice of law. Our clients expect us to bring more than legal skills to the table, and Fullbridge helps us achieve that.
         
—Bob Jewell, Managing Partner of Andrews Kurth Kenyon Law Firm








           The Fullbridge program was a dynamic way to immerse ourselves in an office setting while being able to step back and analyze mistakes for improvement.
         
—Participant at College of the Holy Cross
