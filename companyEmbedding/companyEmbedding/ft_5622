                    My favorite places to take family and friends, and I encourage my clients also is to take in, the Alamo, walk around it, read about it, and then go across the street, down some steps to the San Antonio River.   I love this area, good food, good music, some pretty good jazz,  good shopping and lots of flavor of San Antonio.  If you want to take a day trip around the historical missions,  rent a bike and take a ride.   So much history of this area surrounds these missions and they are fun to visit and a great day trip on the bike, or an afternoon in a car. Of course the Majestic Theater and the new Tobin Center of Performing Arts should be at the top of your list to visit.

                    Buying the right home can be very challenging these days.  How's it working for you?  In my past experience, what I've found is that most agents just don't have a plan to help their buyers.  
My technique may be a little different, but my buyers ALWAYS find exactly what they've been dreaming about.  How?  I take the time and sit down with you and your family and really get to know you during a consultation.  I will only show you properties that matches what you want.  I will negotiate aggressively on your behalf.  I will help make the process as stress free as possible.  Hire me and you'll recognize that I do so much more than the average agent!

                    San Antonio is a great town with a diverse population. There is something here for everyone. If you are a foodie, you should check out the hot new restaurants in Southtown. Love craft beer and live music, check out the Alamo Beer Company. Love local fare, you have to head out to the Pearl Market at the Pearl Brewery. Want to immerse yourself in the culture, set your sights on Market Square. Lastly, San Antonio has the River Walk once described as the American Venice! On the River Walk one can take a river boat tour, grab a margarita at one of the many restaurants that line the river, ghost hunt at the historic Menger, visit the Alamo where Davy Crockett and the Texian Army took their last stand against Santa Anna and so much more. Once you get here you'll never want to leave, trust me, I'm a transplant!

In: Brown Treesnake Technical Working Group Meeting: Agenda & Abstracts - 16, 17 & 18 April 2008. Kingsville, TX: North American Brown Tree Snake Control Team. p. 15. The brown treesnake is known to employ both visual and olfactory cues when searching for prey. At present, these cues emanate only from the trap proper, a small source. We hypothesized that trap success could be enhanced by providing substrate-born olfactory cues leading to the trap...

    FeaturesMultiple configurations available to satisfy a broad range of installations: Single- and dual-circuit models Fixed temp and combination fixed- temp/rate-of-rise 135ºF or 194ºF ratings. Plain housing available for residential installations (model 5601P)  Easy to use terminal screws that provide a more positive wiring connection A broader range of back box mounting options: Single gang 3.5" and 4" Octagonal 4 square with square to round plaster ringReversible mounting bracket for flush and surface mount installationsDescriptionSystem Sensors 5600 series mechanical heat detectors offer a low-cost means for property protection against fire, and for non-life-safety installations where smoke detectors are inappropriate.  Multiple configurations. The 5600 series offers a full-line of configurations to accommodate a broad range of applications. Both single- and dual-circuit models are offered, each available for low- and high-temperature ratings with either fixed temperature or combination fixed temperature/rate-of-rise (ROR) activation. The ROR element of the fixed/ROR models is restorable, to accommodate field-testing the unit.  Installation flexibility. To satisfy a variety of installations, the 5600 series easily mounts to single-gang and octagonal back boxes. These models also accommodate four-square back boxes, when used with a square to round plaster ring. The mounting bracket is reversible to allow for flush- and surface-mount back box installations.  Visual identification. The 5600 series provides clear markings on the exterior of the unit to ensure that the proper detector is being used. Alphanumeric characters identify the activation method, as well as the temperature rating, in degrees Fahrenheit and Celsius. Fixed temperature models are identified FX, while combination fixed/rate-of-rise units are marked FX/ROR. The 5600 series also provides a post-activation indicator in the form of a collector. Once the detector has been activated, the collector drops from the unit, to easily identify the specific unit in alarm.
