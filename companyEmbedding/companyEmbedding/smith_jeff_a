Shoe - Ok, so this is the second or third shoe I have drawn.  So, if you work on shoes, please add some constructive points.I want the shoe to have an extended point on the front.  Also, expose the insert color in front of the toes when on the user's foot.

30' Cat in Sketchbook Pro - Concept sketch I did on my trip to Germany.  Did the linework on the flight to ATL and colored/shaded on the flight to MUC.A cat with a traditional nose, plus it is a walk around with a slight raise on the bow-deck.  This would give a little extra room in the small cabin.

22 Cat/Jet Drive - OK, this is an attempt to merge a center console cat with a jet drive set up.  Each hull at the stern has a 1,200cc jet drive unit in it.  This ='s very low draft and adds a sun-pad over the motors.  At the same time, keeps an open deck for those of us who do not like bow riders (copyboy excluded as he is all about the bow rider).

                                            Right on Terence!  I just stepped up to a Companion as well!  It is great, and almost as good for a left hander as a right hander.  Almost....but it is still terrific.

                                            Marcus,
I started out with an Acer Tablet PC,  Many early images were completed on that.  Then I moved to a Gateway Tablet PC.  Now I am using a Wacom 12" Cintiq.  It is super thin and about as close to paper as I have found.  The larger Cintiqs are great...but man, this one is ipad thickness.

                                            Dennis, this was just the pencil tool.  I do not use that many custom brushes in SBPro.

                                            I'm still learning the best way to use SketchBook. Which tool do you use for outlines? Or is it all pencil? Thanks and great work.

                                            Don't worry about the nib, I used the stock one.  Worry more about setting up the screen for you (proper hand setting) and setting up the pencil setting.

                                            What nib do you use on your tablet?  I just got one and I am finding it hard to get the pencil look and stroke right.

                                            I am on a tablet PC.  I travel a fair amount for work.  Not having to scan and print was my initial motivation (when at a factory in Taiwan or China).  Now I use it a fair amount.

                                            Hi Jeff,
I'm a tablet guy - Wacom Intuos3 and have been since 2004.
I've given it a thought to step over to Cintiq, but I'm just so used to this way of working ...funnily enough, when I tried a Cintiq I felt my hand was in the way, hehe! How strange is that :)
You tablet or screen?
Season greetings!

                                            Thanks Ingi!  Interesting you are using SBpro for your sketching.  Are you using a tablet or a tablet PC?

                                            Great to see all your Sketchbook images.
I use this program all the time, but only for 'sketches' and then move on to Painter or Photoshop - I really admire your use of colour - 'cause I've never had the patience to give it a go in Sketchbook :)
Great work, by-the-way!

                                            its every curves are so beautiful ~~ smoothness in your works is so impressive~ 
think that is your identity of design ?
anyway, good luck 2 u ~

                                            Thanks Jonathan, I should start by finding some time to build them in SW.  That would be an easy first step.

I think you should think of hooking up with a yacht design firm for a project. you would get awesome results.

                                            I like the design. MY grandfather owned a boat like this, not as cool obviously. It was named after me, and my father located the same boat in Cprus two years back.. Brings back nostalgic memories. good conceptual work Jeff.

                                            Jeff,
I too like the lines on this sketch. Seems like a super fun 40' cat, has the feel of a 20' ski boat.

                                            Thanks Gary.  I am enjoy the design of WWII aircraft.  There is a such an interesting blend of function, form and "get the design finished because we have to manufacture it ASAP!"

                                            Glenn, this image is 100% Sketchbook Pro.  All of the work on my coroflot portfolio marked as Sketchbook Pro is 100% done on the tablet PC.  No paper involved.  That is not to say that I do not do sketch on paper.  There is a ton of that in my portfolio as well.  The coroflot portfolio has motivated me to work on native SBpro....

Go for it, Sketchbook pro is great.  It is only digital paper.  I would say wacom or tablet PC is a must.

Don,
Thanks, it has an old school tip blended with the new.

                                            nice.. i like your drawings... i like the massing of the individual components. humanistic. say, i've been interested in using SB for a while now, i've been using Painter and PS lately and i can't seem to find something that would closely resemble actual pencil strokes. I think the strokes in your renderings look more natural, what would you suggest?

                                            Don, thanks.  I am an "old school" PWC guy.  I ride a 1994 Yamaha Waveblaster and a 1996 Yamaha SuperJet.  So, why not sketch on the stand up?  The current one was designed in 1996.....so at least mine is still the "current" design.

No, this is 100% digital.  All lines, shading and color work were completed in Sketchbook Pro on a tablet PC.  This design has never been on paper.

                                            is this added to a scanned pen sketch - it sure looks like it?

                                            David,  Sketchbook pro is "digital paper".  There are not selection areas.  It is raw, but lots of fun.

                                            Absolutely glorious work!
The design and concept is superbly resolved and the colour flip between burnt orange and gold is sublime.

Really no inspiration.  Had an idea in my head for the bow.  Did the sketch to think out the rest of the concept on paper (screen).

Looks heavy duty and would also make an interesting vehicle (dump truck). Nice clean styling.

I'm seeing hints of Geiger's Alien, but even more of the big insecty thing from "This Island Earth" that scared the crap out of me as a kid.
Great sketching Jeff!

Have not seen the movie yet.  Do not have faith in Mr Abrams.  Alias and Lost were both great the first season.....

                                            I really like how dynamic this one is... it does look a bit precarious though. Adds tension. Also the nose is very sci-fi-esque. Funny how we've come to identify certain design forms as more futuristic than others.

                                            Rajat, it is just a concept for jet like plane or ship.  Nothing more or less.

I feel the true fishing guys would not get a good "fighting area" out of this deck.  Divers would like it!  I put some storage in the sides...

                                            Jeff-  I think the walk thru transom area is an interesting idea.  As for the not liking of the space consumption, if you could incorporate, say, live wells or storage compartments just ahead of the motor areas it would be a more acceptable design.  The only reason I would see why consumers would not go for this style is the rough seas and water in the boat possibilities.  Looks great though< I like the lines, its more of an elegant Bay boat, or near shore boat...

Thanks again.  I have not posted any of my "job" ID work on Coroflot yet.  These images are all concepts to practice quick design communication.

                                            Thanks Gary.  Most people that fish will not like the curve in.  It takes up too much deck space.

                                            As ever - great rear aspect visual Jeff.
I agree that the walk thru deck looks great, this could maybe work as a jet-ski dock on a bigger Hull.

Wish I had the motivation to build something in SW for myself....just do not have the drive.

The line art ones are coloring images for my son.  Nice little treat for him to get an email every day with a fresh truck.  I have drawn truck after truck for him....I guess it is good practice.  You should see the chalk drawings we do at the park on the cement!

Sketchbook pro is simple digital paper with layers.  All the tools and no mess!  I think it is $200.  The computer or wacom is the expensive part.  Love my new gateway with the 14.1" wide-screen.

Window graphic is really fresh on this design, just about all other designs feature a variant on the 'teardrop'.

I've got to get hold of one of these digital sketchbooks-the results are cool.

Thanks for the compliment.  I have found that rapid concepts like this is what I need to be doing.  To me, the key point of that sketch is that is was done on a plane!  Extra challenge!

I spend too much time on planes.  It passes the time, and in the end does act as an ice breaker.  As soon as I start drawing, the person next to me asks what I am doing and so does the next flight attendant.  Then I get to explain what ID is.  

This one I sketched on the plane, added color on the next stop at ATL.

                                            Thanks Mike.  Sketchbook Pro is digital paper with Layers.  You have to look at it with that mindset.  There is no select and fill.  No gradient tool.  I think that is what gives it more of a natural look.   It is around $200 US retail.  All you need is a tablet PC.

I love the softness of colour and linework you're able to generate with this software - maybe I need to get my hands on a copy.

Your sketchwork is absolutely fantastic.

Thanks for the compliment.  I have found that rapid concepts like this is what I need to be doing.  To me, the key point of that sketch is that is was done on a plane!  Extra challenge!

Window graphic is really fresh on this design, just about all other designs feature a variant on the 'teardrop'.

I've got to get hold of one of these digital sketchbooks-the results are cool.

Sketchbook pro is simple digital paper with layers.  All the tools and no mess!  I think it is $200.  The computer or wacom is the expensive part.  Love my new gateway with the 14.1" wide-screen.

The line art ones are coloring images for my son.  Nice little treat for him to get an email every day with a fresh truck.  I have drawn truck after truck for him....I guess it is good practice.  You should see the chalk drawings we do at the park on the cement!

Wish I had the motivation to build something in SW for myself....just do not have the drive.

                                            As ever - great rear aspect visual Jeff.
I agree that the walk thru deck looks great, this could maybe work as a jet-ski dock on a bigger Hull.

                                            Thanks Gary.  Most people that fish will not like the curve in.  It takes up too much deck space.

Thanks again.  I have not posted any of my "job" ID work on Coroflot yet.  These images are all concepts to practice quick design communication.

                                            Jeff-  I think the walk thru transom area is an interesting idea.  As for the not liking of the space consumption, if you could incorporate, say, live wells or storage compartments just ahead of the motor areas it would be a more acceptable design.  The only reason I would see why consumers would not go for this style is the rough seas and water in the boat possibilities.  Looks great though< I like the lines, its more of an elegant Bay boat, or near shore boat...

I feel the true fishing guys would not get a good "fighting area" out of this deck.  Divers would like it!  I put some storage in the sides...

I honestly feel that I can now spot your trademark touches after looking at the myriad of stunning work you've posted - kind of "techno-organic".

                                            I really like how dynamic this one is... it does look a bit precarious though. Adds tension. Also the nose is very sci-fi-esque. Funny how we've come to identify certain design forms as more futuristic than others.

                                            My goodness. We both added monsters today:  http://www.coroflot.com/public/individual_file.asp?sort_by=1&portfolio_id=908699&individual_id=98798

Strange. Did you see Cloverfield? Pretty unusual creature they have in it.

                                            Just felt like this sketch last night.  Might do some more on the way to Germany tomorrow night.

Have not seen the movie yet.  Do not have faith in Mr Abrams.  Alias and Lost were both great the first season.....

                                            Blimey!
I'm seeing hints of Geiger's Alien, but even more of the big insecty thing from "This Island Earth" that scared the crap out of me as a kid.
Great sketching Jeff!

Looks heavy duty and would also make an interesting vehicle (dump truck). Nice clean styling.

Very aerodynamic, yet has great flowing lines. What was your inspiration?

                                            Don,
Really no inspiration.  Had an idea in my head for the bow.  Did the sketch to think out the rest of the concept on paper (screen).

                                            Thanks Don.  I really like how my son pushes me to draw different subjects.  Sidewalk chalk trucks drawings are also fun.

                                            Absolutely glorious work!
The design and concept is superbly resolved and the colour flip between burnt orange and gold is sublime.

                                            David,  Sketchbook pro is "digital paper".  There are not selection areas.  It is raw, but lots of fun.

No, this is 100% digital.  All lines, shading and color work were completed in Sketchbook Pro on a tablet PC.  This design has never been on paper.

I really like the way that the overall form reflects a wave - nice detailing too.

The current one was designed in 1996.....so at least mine is still the "current" design.

                                            nice.. i like your drawings... i like the massing of the individual components. humanistic. say, i've been interested in using SB for a while now, i've been using Painter and PS lately and i can't seem to find something that would closely resemble actual pencil strokes. I think the strokes in your renderings look more natural, what would you suggest?

                                            Arturo,
Go for it, Sketchbook pro is great.  It is only digital paper.  I would say wacom or tablet PC is a must.

Don,
Thanks, it has an old school tip blended with the new.

                                            Jeff - i use Paint Shop Pro on top of hand started pencil sketches - do you do 'everything' on the tablet - v. curious - you have it down that's for sure..

                                            Glenn, this image is 100% Sketchbook Pro.  All of the work on my coroflot portfolio marked as Sketchbook Pro is 100% done on the tablet PC.  No paper involved.  That is not to say that I do not do sketch on paper.  There is a ton of that in my portfolio as well.  The coroflot portfolio has motivated me to work on native SBpro....

This reminds me of those fantastic old Warbirds that look so fantastic tear-arsing around Reno, just on the verge of exploding - ace work my friend!

                                            Thanks Gary.  I am enjoy the design of WWII aircraft.  There is a such an interesting blend of function, form and "get the design finished because we have to manufacture it ASAP!"

This is 100% digital.  Drawn by hand in Sketchbook Pro on a tablet PC.  Then colored in Sketchbook Pro.

Thanks!

                                            This has a nice metropolis quality to it.  Very fresh and bold.

                                            Jeff,
I too like the lines on this sketch. Seems like a super fun 40' cat, has the feel of a 20' ski boat.

                                            I like the design. MY grandfather owned a boat like this, not as cool obviously. It was named after me, and my father located the same boat in Cprus two years back.. Brings back nostalgic memories. good conceptual work Jeff.

                                            Jeff I would love to see some of your power boats transform into real boats. they are sure worth a try. I think you should think of hooking up with a yacht design firm for a project. you would get awesome results.

                                            Thanks Jonathan, I should start by finding some time to build them in SW.  That would be an easy first step.

Nice that you noticed the lower hull...I guess it is from being on the water looking at boats!

                                            Great to see all your Sketchbook images.
I use this program all the time, but only for 'sketches' and then move on to Painter or Photoshop - I really admire your use of colour - 'cause I've never had the patience to give it a go in Sketchbook :)
Great work, by-the-way!

                                            Thanks Ingi!  Interesting you are using SBpro for your sketching.  Are you using a tablet or a tablet PC?

                                            Hi Jeff,
I'm a tablet guy - Wacom Intuos3 and have been since 2004.
I've given it a thought to step over to Cintiq, but I'm just so used to this way of working ...funnily enough, when I tried a Cintiq I felt my hand was in the way, hehe! How strange is that :)
You tablet or screen?
Season greetings!

                                            I am on a tablet PC.  I travel a fair amount for work.  Not having to scan and print was my initial motivation (when at a factory in Taiwan or China).  Now I use it a fair amount.

                                            What nib do you use on your tablet?  I just got one and I am finding it hard to get the pencil look and stroke right.

                                            Don't worry about the nib, I used the stock one.  Worry more about setting up the screen for you (proper hand setting) and setting up the pencil setting.

                                            I'm still learning the best way to use SketchBook. Which tool do you use for outlines? Or is it all pencil? Thanks and great work.

                                            Dennis, this was just the pencil tool.  I do not use that many custom brushes in SBPro.

                                            Marcus,
I started out with an Acer Tablet PC,  Many early images were completed on that.  Then I moved to a Gateway Tablet PC.  Now I am using a Wacom 12" Cintiq.  It is super thin and about as close to paper as I have found.  The larger Cintiqs are great...but man, this one is ipad thickness.

                                            Great stuff as always Jeff! We just spoke to a Wacom rep and will be using the Companions in a few weeks here at Igloo.

                                            Right on Terence!  I just stepped up to a Companion as well!  It is great, and almost as good for a left hander as a right hander.  Almost....but it is still terrific.
