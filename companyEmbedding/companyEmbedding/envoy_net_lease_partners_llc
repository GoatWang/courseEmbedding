   NNN PROPERTIES
Tenant Credit Ratings



What are NNN Properties?
NNN Properties are typically free standing buildings that are leased to tenants for a 10 to 25 year term.  NNN Properties offer the benefit of little or no management responsibilities as the tenant pays for all, if not most of the expenses. The investor receives their rent with little to no other involvement.
Tenants in NNN Properties are divided by both quality and type of businesses they are in.  Qualitatively NNN Properties have either credit or non credit tenants.  The most desirable (least risk) NNN Properties have investment grade (rated BBB- and better) credit tenants.

Non credit tenant NNN Properties have tenants that are not credit rated.  These tenants frequently are regional or local businesses or companies that are unrated.  Some tenants are considered credit worthy yet are unrated because they carry no debt on their books.  Click Tenant Ratings for list of tenants for NNN Properties.
Who Buys NNN Properties?
NNN Properties are appealing to those who wish to have outright ownership of their commercial real estate investments and have little to no management responsibility.  The alternative ways of owning non management commercial real estate would be to own a security in the form of a mutual fund or REIT or invest in fractional ownership Tenant in Common properties.

A major advantage of 100% direct ownership is control and the ability to defer future capital gains by doing a 1031 exchange when the property is sold.  For many investors the lack of immediate liquidity inherent in NNN Properties is offset by the lack of volatility NNN Properties offer when compared to a securitized investment.   Investors should carefully consider their need for liquidity when considering investing in NNN Properties.
How are NNN Properties Valued?
NNN Properties typically are valued using their Capitalization Rate also referred to as Cap Rate. NNN Properties cap rates reflects the value of a stream of economic benefits discounted for time and risk. Generally this is computed as a pretax cap rate using the Net Operating Income (NOI) for NNN Properties.

NOI is income less all expenses before debt service. The Cap Rate is the NOI divided by the purchase price for NNN Properties. Conversely the NOI divided by the Cap Rate will equal the purchase or selling price.
Example of Cap Rates for NNN Properties:
NOI = $100,000/10%=$1,000,000 Purchase or Selling Price
NOI = $100,000/$1,000,000=10% Cap Rate
How are Cap Rates Determined for NNN Properties?
Some of the major considerations when calculating Cap Rates for NNN Properties are:

 The credit worthiness of the tenant.
 The length of the lease, typically 10 to 25 years.
 The type of lease, triple net (NNN) or double net (NN). See below for definition.
 Type and frequency of bumps or increases if any in rent.
 Cost of financing
 Strength of the demographics of the property location
 Nature of the improvements. Are the improvements easily converted for another tenant or are they special purpose that would require significant expense and time to convert before re tenanting?
 Age and condition of the improvements
The more positive the above factors for NNN Properties, the lower the Cap Rate or the higher the value of the property related to its income stream. Conversely if the above factors for NNN Properties are weak the Cap Rate will be higher and the resulting value will be lower reflecting the greater risk of the investment.

It is important to remember that markets are not perfect and low Cap Rate NNN Properties are  not necessary a lower risk investment, they could simply be a bad investment that is over priced.  Astute investors seek NNN Properties that are mispriced in their favor, namely a higher Cap Rate for a property that has lower risk factors.
What is Build-to-Suit?
In a build-to-suit the landlord builds the improvements for the tenant and the tenant leases them back typically on a Net Lease.  The Net Lease rent payable by the tenant is a function of the construction and financing costs of the project.  This arrangement allows the tenant to move in and occupy the property with zero initial cost.

The Net Lease rent is fully deductible over the lease term, making the tenant's after-tax cost less than with alternative forms of asset-based financing.
What is a Ground Lease?
A ground lease is a method for separating ownership of the improvements (building) from the ownership of the underlying fee (ground). Typically ground leases are long term Net Leases where the tenant pays all expenses except debt service.
  Any financing for the improvements are paid for by the tenant.  In some cases the ground lease is subordinated to the debt on the improvements.

On unsubordinated ground lease, no lien is placed against the fee simple title to the land. Instead, the leasehold estate is the primary security for any debt on the improvements.  There is no depreciation with the ownership of a ground lease.
Many investors favor ground leases because they don't need to use their own funds to build the improvements yet end up owning the improvements on termination of the lease.  When the Net Lease ends the improvements revert to the owner of the ground lease the owner benefits from the full rent for both the land and the improvements.
Tenants like ground leases because they reduce the tenant's cost of development by eliminating land acquisition costs.  A long term Net Lease provides predictable rent payments that are deductible by the tenant for federal and state income tax purposes.
Typically ground leases are long term Net Leases and include set rent escalations, foreclosure rights and reversionary right (improvements revert to owner of ground lease at termination of the lease).
What is a Sale Leaseback?
A Real estate sale leaseback is when a business sells its commercial property for current market value and then leases it back typically using a Net Lease.  The seller retains the use of their real estate and frees up capital which can be used to invest back into the business.  
Real estate sale leasebacks are popular because they generate capital for immediate use within the business.

A long term Net Lease on a sale leaseback create a predictable rent that is deductible for federal and state income tax purposes Some businesses do sale and leaseback transactions for equipment as well.
Types Net Leases
NNN Properties are generally categorized as either true triple net (NNN) or double net (NN).  The distinction between NNN and NN leases is an important one as can be seen in the following definitions.
Absolute Triple Net (NNN)
The tenant pays operating expenses such as maintenance, repairs, taxes and replacement for the entire property, without limitation. The owners pay the mortgage only. This is the type of lease that most investors expect when purchasing NNN Properties.
Bond Lease (NNN)
A bond lease is a slight variation on the true triple NNN lease because the tenant is required to absolutely comply with their rent and operating expense obligations regardless of extenuating circumstances affecting the property (i.e. Even if the property is under eminent domain proceedings).  
Double Net Lease  (NN)
Similar to NNN leases but with additional owner responsibilities. The owner is generally liable for the structural components of the building such as the roof, foundation, load-bearing walls and parking.  Leases will vary so they should be carefully read.
Net Lease Alternative
For investors considering NNN Properties but who would like to invest less capital (cash) and still have little to no management responsibilities Fractional Ownership can be a good option to consider.
Advantages of Fractional Properties are the lower minimum investment (starting at $100,000), greater diversification, prepackaged financing (if any) and due diligence material.  Unlike a stock, or bond Fractional Ownership can qualify for 1031 and 1033 exchanges providing they follow IRS guidelines.

The ratings and property characteristics are then matched to each investor’s risk tolerance and objectives and needs.

~ Mike H, Investor, Scottsdale Arizona








Client Case Study



Recently I decided to it was time to sell three manufactured housing communities that I owned for a number of years. I was tired of dealing with tenants, the constant upkeep and repair and did not feel positive about the direction of the industry as a whole. In order to avoid paying over 3/4 of a million dollars in capital gains, my accountant advised me to do a 1031 exchange.
TM 1031 Exchange was recommended to me by my broker at Clear Point Financial. They located all three of the replacement properties (Verizon Wireless, Jiffy Lube, and a 14,000 sq. ft. medical office building.
I feel these properties are far superior investments than anything I could find on my own. The Property Vault was a tremendous help in sorting out and comparing properties and investment potential. TM 1031 negotiated the purchase with the sellers, arranged for the Facilitator, assisted with obtaining the needed loans and the due diligence. They were able to put me in touch with very competent legal counsel who were critical in closing the transactions in each geographic location where the properties are located.
Because I had to sell my properties and close properties in three different states while staying in compliance with the strict IRS regulations and timelines in regards to exchanges, this was not a simple transaction. TM 1031 made the whole process as smooth as possible and I would highly recommend them to other investors.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

CHICAGO, Feb. 2, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Envoy Net Lease Partners, LLC, a finance company that provides up to 100 percent equity financing for net lease properties, launched today to bring much-needed development capital to independent real estate developers of to-be-built and redeveloped properties in diversified markets across the U.S.
Envoy plans to invest $20 million in net lease transactions over the next 18 months.
The company fills a void in the market by meeting the needs of developers with projects in the $500,000 to $10 million range, which are often too small to interest institutional investors.
"Envoy is seeking multi-year, multi-project relationships with proven developers," says Ralph N. Cram, the company's chief operating officer. "By providing the equity developers need, we can free them up from this burdensome and time-consuming task and allow them to focus on what they do best: developing real estate and accelerating the growth of their business."  
Mr. Cram has more than 25 years of experience working in real estate finance and acquisitions with a specialty in the net lease industry.  In addition, Envoy's management team will be counseled by an advisory board comprised of several net lease industry veterans.  Among them are: James Purinton, former president of ORIX Real Estate Properties; Ronald Max, chief operating officer at Novascent Partners LLC; and Allan Yusim, former partner in the Real Estate and Finance Practice groups at Patzik, Frank & Samotny.
"Independent developers often face the prospect of having to pull together equity capital from a variety of different sources — for each and every deal," Cram continued, "so Envoy represents a solution to a persistent problem of chasing after equity to get their deals done.  For those developers, Envoy can be the only equity source they'll ever need." 
Envoy Net Lease Partners
Based in greater Chicago and focused solely on providing equity capital for smaller net lease (re)development projects, Envoy Net Lease Partners, LLC, is backed by a $1 billion-plus New York money management firm and a family office with more than 50 years of retail industry experience.  Envoy seeks projects anywhere in the U.S. spanning the retail, restaurant, medical, industrial and office realms.  For more information, please visit www.envoynnn.com.
