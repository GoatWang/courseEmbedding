History[edit]
Investec was founded as a small leasing and financing company in 1974 in Johannesburg by Larry Nestadt, Errol Grolman and Ian Kantor. It has expanded through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions.[7] It secured a banking licence in 1980[8][9] and was first listed on the JSE Securities Exchange in South Africa in 1986, after merging with Metboard, a trust company. In 1988, Investec Bank Limited was restructured into Investec Group Limited ("IGL"), giving Investec Management and staff control of the company.[8]
In 1990, Investec acquired property management company I. Kuper & Company (Pty) Limited, Corporate Merchant Bank Limited (formerly Hill Samuel Merchant Bank Limited) and trade finance company Reichmans Limited.[8] Investec entered the UK market in 1992, by acquiring London-based Allied Trust Bank Limited ('ATB'), this was the first international acquisition by the Group.[8] In 1998, Investec acquired Guinness Mahon, a leading London based merchant bank, and Henderson Crosthwaite, its stockbroking arm, for £95m.[10] It also bought Hambros plc, another London based merchant bank the same year.[11] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2002.[8] In 2003 in a Black Economic Empowerment transaction empowerment partners acquired a 21.5% stake in the South Africa-listed Investec.[8]




Investec Loyal about to win the 2011 Sydney to Hobart, taken from Sandy Bay, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia


In 2005, Investec sold its UK Private Client Stockbroking operation, Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite Limited to Rensburg plc. Investec retains a 47.7% interest in the combined entity, Rensburg Sheppards plc.[12] In 2007, Investec plc acquired Kensington Group plc[13] and Experien (Pty) Ltd.[14] Investec plc acquired the remaining shares in Rensburg Sheppards plc in 2010. This business has since been rebranded as Investec Wealth & Investments and incorporates other wealth activities previously operated through the Bank.[15] In June 2012, Investec plc completed the €32 million acquisition of Irish brokerage firm, NCB. As a result, Investec now employs more than 240 specialists in Ireland.[16]
Operations[edit]
Investec employs approximately 8,200 people worldwide and operates primarily in South Africa, the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland. It also has banking operations in Switzerland, Mauritius, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Jersey, Namibia, Botswana, Canada, Taiwan and the United States.[7]
Products and divisional structure[edit]
Investec is organised as a network comprising six business divisions: Asset Management, Wealth & Investment, Property, Private Banking, Investment Banking and Capital Markets.[7]
Legal structure[edit]




LTI TX4 "Silver" advertising for Investec


In July 2002, Investec became the first South African company to list on both the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges, by implementing a dual listed companies (DLC) structure.[17]
The main features of the DLC structure are:

Investec plc and Investec Limited are separate legal entities and listings, but are bound together by contractual agreements and mechanisms.[17]
Investec plc is the holding company for the majority of the group's non-Southern African operations and Investec Limited is the holding company for the majority of the group's Southern African operations.[17]
Investec operates as if it is a single unified economic enterprise.[17]
Shareholders have common economic and voting interests as if Investec plc and Investec Limited were a single company.[17]
Creditors, however, are ring-fenced to either Investec plc or Investec Limited as there are no cross guarantees between the companies.[17]

Empowerment in South Africa[edit]
Investec's approach to transformation within South Africa involves:

Fostering the creation of new black entrepreneurial platforms[18]
Serving as a source of empowerment financing[18]
Encouraging internal transformation by bringing about greater representivity in the workplace. Investec focuses on creating black entrepreneurs within its organisation[18]

Sponsorships[edit]
Cricket[edit]
Investec announced a ten-year title sponsorship of Investec Test Match cricket for the England and Wales Cricket Board on 24 November 2011 at Lord's Cricket Ground. This sponsorship, will run until 2021 and is the longest sponsorship agreement secured in ECB’s history.[19]
Rugby[edit]
Investec is involved in a number of rugby sponsorships around the world, as they feel that "rugby embodies Investec's beliefs in collaborative teamwork, innovative play and determination and it’s for these reasons that we support many rugby initiatives".[20]
Investec previously sponsored the Investec Internationals Series (formerly the Investec Challenge) played at Twickenham Stadium, England.[21]
Investec is in the third year as the sponsor of the Investec Super Rugby competition in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.[22][23]
Investec also supports the International Rugby Academy South Africa which aims to capitalise on an untapped demand for high performance in playing and coaching rugby in South Africa.[24][25]
In 2010 Investec announced that they are the official sponsors of the Tri Nations rugby competition in New Zealand for the second year running.[26][27]
Horse racing[edit]
Investec has become a long term sponsor of the Epsom Derby festival in the UK until 2013. The illustrious horse-racing event is now known as the Investec Derby.[28][29]
Investec also sponsors the Investec Cape Derby in South Africa.[30]
Football[edit]
Investec has become the official shirt sponsor for Tottenham Hotspur's domestic cup games and UEFA Champions League games for the 2010/2011 and UEFA Europa League games for the 2011/2012 seasons. This sponsorship marked the first promotion into the football world for Investec.[31][32][33] In 2014, Investec became the official shirt sponsor for Widnes F.C. in the North West Counties Football League Division One.[34]
ProMaths[edit]
Since 2005 Investec has been sponsoring a flagship project started by the Kutlwanong Centre for Math, Science and Technology. The project aims at improving the mathematics and science skills of students from historically disadvantaged regions across South Africa. The project has been a huge success year on year, with most of the students obtaining distinctions in mathematics and science, and their other subjects. In 2014 the project was awarded the Mail & Guardian Investing In The Future STEM award.[35]
Other[edit]
Other sponsorships include the Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute in London's Hyde Park[36] and Russian Tennis Player Elena Dementieva for the 2008 Wimbledon tournament as well as the Australian Open in January 2009.[37]

History[edit]
Investec was founded as a small leasing and financing company in 1974 in Johannesburg by Larry Nestadt, Errol Grolman and Ian Kantor. It has expanded through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions.[7] It secured a banking licence in 1980[8][9] and was first listed on the JSE Securities Exchange in South Africa in 1986, after merging with Metboard, a trust company. In 1988, Investec Bank Limited was restructured into Investec Group Limited ("IGL"), giving Investec Management and staff control of the company.[8]
In 1990, Investec acquired property management company I. Kuper & Company (Pty) Limited, Corporate Merchant Bank Limited (formerly Hill Samuel Merchant Bank Limited) and trade finance company Reichmans Limited.[8] Investec entered the UK market in 1992, by acquiring London-based Allied Trust Bank Limited ('ATB'), this was the first international acquisition by the Group.[8] In 1998, Investec acquired Guinness Mahon, a leading London based merchant bank, and Henderson Crosthwaite, its stockbroking arm, for £95m.[10] It also bought Hambros plc, another London based merchant bank the same year.[11] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2002.[8] In 2003 in a Black Economic Empowerment transaction empowerment partners acquired a 21.5% stake in the South Africa-listed Investec.[8]




Investec Loyal about to win the 2011 Sydney to Hobart, taken from Sandy Bay, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia


In 2005, Investec sold its UK Private Client Stockbroking operation, Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite Limited to Rensburg plc. Investec retains a 47.7% interest in the combined entity, Rensburg Sheppards plc.[12] In 2007, Investec plc acquired Kensington Group plc[13] and Experien (Pty) Ltd.[14] Investec plc acquired the remaining shares in Rensburg Sheppards plc in 2010. This business has since been rebranded as Investec Wealth & Investments and incorporates other wealth activities previously operated through the Bank.[15] In June 2012, Investec plc completed the €32 million acquisition of Irish brokerage firm, NCB. As a result, Investec now employs more than 240 specialists in Ireland.[16]
Operations[edit]
Investec employs approximately 8,200 people worldwide and operates primarily in South Africa, the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland. It also has banking operations in Switzerland, Mauritius, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Jersey, Namibia, Botswana, Canada, Taiwan and the United States.[7]

Legal structure[edit]




LTI TX4 "Silver" advertising for Investec


In July 2002, Investec became the first South African company to list on both the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges, by implementing a dual listed companies (DLC) structure.[17]
The main features of the DLC structure are:

Investec plc and Investec Limited are separate legal entities and listings, but are bound together by contractual agreements and mechanisms.[17]
Investec plc is the holding company for the majority of the group's non-Southern African operations and Investec Limited is the holding company for the majority of the group's Southern African operations.[17]
Investec operates as if it is a single unified economic enterprise.[17]
Shareholders have common economic and voting interests as if Investec plc and Investec Limited were a single company.[17]
Creditors, however, are ring-fenced to either Investec plc or Investec Limited as there are no cross guarantees between the companies.[17]

Empowerment in South Africa[edit]
Investec's approach to transformation within South Africa involves:

Fostering the creation of new black entrepreneurial platforms[18]
Serving as a source of empowerment financing[18]
Encouraging internal transformation by bringing about greater representivity in the workplace. Investec focuses on creating black entrepreneurs within its organisation[18]

Sponsorships[edit]
Cricket[edit]
Investec announced a ten-year title sponsorship of Investec Test Match cricket for the England and Wales Cricket Board on 24 November 2011 at Lord's Cricket Ground. This sponsorship, will run until 2021 and is the longest sponsorship agreement secured in ECB’s history.[19]
Rugby[edit]
Investec is involved in a number of rugby sponsorships around the world, as they feel that "rugby embodies Investec's beliefs in collaborative teamwork, innovative play and determination and it’s for these reasons that we support many rugby initiatives".[20]
Investec previously sponsored the Investec Internationals Series (formerly the Investec Challenge) played at Twickenham Stadium, England.[21]
Investec is in the third year as the sponsor of the Investec Super Rugby competition in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.[22][23]
Investec also supports the International Rugby Academy South Africa which aims to capitalise on an untapped demand for high performance in playing and coaching rugby in South Africa.[24][25]
In 2010 Investec announced that they are the official sponsors of the Tri Nations rugby competition in New Zealand for the second year running.[26][27]
Horse racing[edit]
Investec has become a long term sponsor of the Epsom Derby festival in the UK until 2013. The illustrious horse-racing event is now known as the Investec Derby.[28][29]
Investec also sponsors the Investec Cape Derby in South Africa.[30]
Football[edit]
Investec has become the official shirt sponsor for Tottenham Hotspur's domestic cup games and UEFA Champions League games for the 2010/2011 and UEFA Europa League games for the 2011/2012 seasons. This sponsorship marked the first promotion into the football world for Investec.[31][32][33] In 2014, Investec became the official shirt sponsor for Widnes F.C. in the North West Counties Football League Division One.[34]
ProMaths[edit]
Since 2005 Investec has been sponsoring a flagship project started by the Kutlwanong Centre for Math, Science and Technology. The project aims at improving the mathematics and science skills of students from historically disadvantaged regions across South Africa. The project has been a huge success year on year, with most of the students obtaining distinctions in mathematics and science, and their other subjects. In 2014 the project was awarded the Mail & Guardian Investing In The Future STEM award.[35]
Other[edit]
Other sponsorships include the Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute in London's Hyde Park[36] and Russian Tennis Player Elena Dementieva for the 2008 Wimbledon tournament as well as the Australian Open in January 2009.[37]

Rugby[edit]
Investec is involved in a number of rugby sponsorships around the world, as they feel that "rugby embodies Investec's beliefs in collaborative teamwork, innovative play and determination and it’s for these reasons that we support many rugby initiatives".[20]

Football[edit]
Investec has become the official shirt sponsor for Tottenham Hotspur's domestic cup games and UEFA Champions League games for the 2010/2011 and UEFA Europa League games for the 2011/2012 seasons.

Our story







                        History
                    
From start-up to global business



It all began in South Africa in 1991. We were a small start-up offering domestic strategies in an emerging market. Now we’re an international business managing approximately $124 billion* for clients based all over the world.
*As at 30.06.17













                        Perspective
                    
Unique journey: unique insight



We are on a truly unique journey. Launched in South Africa in 1991, we are one of the first asset management firms to build a global franchise from emerging market origins. This means we see the world differently, allowing our clients to benefit from our unique insight.













                        People
                    
More than a job



We are curious for our clients. We put our clients and our people at the centre of our business. This is after all their business. Our people enjoy working without constraints and they’re passionate about what they do. That’s why so many of our senior people have been with us for so long.

Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

History[edit]
Investec was founded as a small leasing and financing company in 1974 in Johannesburg by Larry Nestadt, Errol Grolman and Ian Kantor. It has expanded through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions.[7] It secured a banking licence in 1980[8][9] and was first listed on the JSE Securities Exchange in South Africa in 1986, after merging with Metboard, a trust company. In 1988, Investec Bank Limited was restructured into Investec Group Limited ("IGL"), giving Investec Management and staff control of the company.[8]
In 1990, Investec acquired property management company I. Kuper & Company (Pty) Limited, Corporate Merchant Bank Limited (formerly Hill Samuel Merchant Bank Limited) and trade finance company Reichmans Limited.[8] Investec entered the UK market in 1992, by acquiring London-based Allied Trust Bank Limited ('ATB'), this was the first international acquisition by the Group.[8] In 1998, Investec acquired Guinness Mahon, a leading London based merchant bank, and Henderson Crosthwaite, its stockbroking arm, for £95m.[10] It also bought Hambros plc, another London based merchant bank the same year.[11] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2002.[8] In 2003 in a Black Economic Empowerment transaction empowerment partners acquired a 21.5% stake in the South Africa-listed Investec.[8]




Investec Loyal about to win the 2011 Sydney to Hobart, taken from Sandy Bay, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia


In 2005, Investec sold its UK Private Client Stockbroking operation, Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite Limited to Rensburg plc. Investec retains a 47.7% interest in the combined entity, Rensburg Sheppards plc.[12] In 2007, Investec plc acquired Kensington Group plc[13] and Experien (Pty) Ltd.[14] Investec plc acquired the remaining shares in Rensburg Sheppards plc in 2010. This business has since been rebranded as Investec Wealth & Investments and incorporates other wealth activities previously operated through the Bank.[15] In June 2012, Investec plc completed the €32 million acquisition of Irish brokerage firm, NCB. As a result, Investec now employs more than 240 specialists in Ireland.[16]
Operations[edit]
Investec employs approximately 8,200 people worldwide and operates primarily in South Africa, the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland. It also has banking operations in Switzerland, Mauritius, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Jersey, Namibia, Botswana, Canada, Taiwan and the United States.[7]
Products and divisional structure[edit]
Investec is organised as a network comprising six business divisions: Asset Management, Wealth & Investment, Property, Private Banking, Investment Banking and Capital Markets.[7]
Legal structure[edit]




LTI TX4 "Silver" advertising for Investec


In July 2002, Investec became the first South African company to list on both the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges, by implementing a dual listed companies (DLC) structure.[17]
The main features of the DLC structure are:

Investec plc and Investec Limited are separate legal entities and listings, but are bound together by contractual agreements and mechanisms.[17]
Investec plc is the holding company for the majority of the group's non-Southern African operations and Investec Limited is the holding company for the majority of the group's Southern African operations.[17]
Investec operates as if it is a single unified economic enterprise.[17]
Shareholders have common economic and voting interests as if Investec plc and Investec Limited were a single company.[17]
Creditors, however, are ring-fenced to either Investec plc or Investec Limited as there are no cross guarantees between the companies.[17]

Empowerment in South Africa[edit]
Investec's approach to transformation within South Africa involves:

Fostering the creation of new black entrepreneurial platforms[18]
Serving as a source of empowerment financing[18]
Encouraging internal transformation by bringing about greater representivity in the workplace. Investec focuses on creating black entrepreneurs within its organisation[18]

Sponsorships[edit]
Cricket[edit]
Investec announced a ten-year title sponsorship of Investec Test Match cricket for the England and Wales Cricket Board on 24 November 2011 at Lord's Cricket Ground. This sponsorship, will run until 2021 and is the longest sponsorship agreement secured in ECB’s history.[19]
Rugby[edit]
Investec is involved in a number of rugby sponsorships around the world, as they feel that "rugby embodies Investec's beliefs in collaborative teamwork, innovative play and determination and it’s for these reasons that we support many rugby initiatives".[20]
Investec previously sponsored the Investec Internationals Series (formerly the Investec Challenge) played at Twickenham Stadium, England.[21]
Investec is in the third year as the sponsor of the Investec Super Rugby competition in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.[22][23]
Investec also supports the International Rugby Academy South Africa which aims to capitalise on an untapped demand for high performance in playing and coaching rugby in South Africa.[24][25]
In 2010 Investec announced that they are the official sponsors of the Tri Nations rugby competition in New Zealand for the second year running.[26][27]
Horse racing[edit]
Investec has become a long term sponsor of the Epsom Derby festival in the UK until 2013. The illustrious horse-racing event is now known as the Investec Derby.[28][29]
Investec also sponsors the Investec Cape Derby in South Africa.[30]
Football[edit]
Investec has become the official shirt sponsor for Tottenham Hotspur's domestic cup games and UEFA Champions League games for the 2010/2011 and UEFA Europa League games for the 2011/2012 seasons. This sponsorship marked the first promotion into the football world for Investec.[31][32][33] In 2014, Investec became the official shirt sponsor for Widnes F.C. in the North West Counties Football League Division One.[34]
ProMaths[edit]
Since 2005 Investec has been sponsoring a flagship project started by the Kutlwanong Centre for Math, Science and Technology. The project aims at improving the mathematics and science skills of students from historically disadvantaged regions across South Africa. The project has been a huge success year on year, with most of the students obtaining distinctions in mathematics and science, and their other subjects. In 2014 the project was awarded the Mail & Guardian Investing In The Future STEM award.[35]
Other[edit]
Other sponsorships include the Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute in London's Hyde Park[36] and Russian Tennis Player Elena Dementieva for the 2008 Wimbledon tournament as well as the Australian Open in January 2009.[37]
Awards[edit]
The company was awarded Most Trusted Asset Management Brand, South Africa in 2016 by Global Brands Magazine Award.[38]

History[edit]
Investec was founded as a small leasing and financing company in 1974 in Johannesburg by Larry Nestadt, Errol Grolman and Ian Kantor. It has expanded through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions.[7] It secured a banking licence in 1980[8][9] and was first listed on the JSE Securities Exchange in South Africa in 1986, after merging with Metboard, a trust company. In 1988, Investec Bank Limited was restructured into Investec Group Limited ("IGL"), giving Investec Management and staff control of the company.[8]
In 1990, Investec acquired property management company I. Kuper & Company (Pty) Limited, Corporate Merchant Bank Limited (formerly Hill Samuel Merchant Bank Limited) and trade finance company Reichmans Limited.[8] Investec entered the UK market in 1992, by acquiring London-based Allied Trust Bank Limited ('ATB'), this was the first international acquisition by the Group.[8] In 1998, Investec acquired Guinness Mahon, a leading London based merchant bank, and Henderson Crosthwaite, its stockbroking arm, for £95m.[10] It also bought Hambros plc, another London based merchant bank the same year.[11] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2002.[8] In 2003 in a Black Economic Empowerment transaction empowerment partners acquired a 21.5% stake in the South Africa-listed Investec.[8]




Investec Loyal about to win the 2011 Sydney to Hobart, taken from Sandy Bay, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia


In 2005, Investec sold its UK Private Client Stockbroking operation, Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite Limited to Rensburg plc. Investec retains a 47.7% interest in the combined entity, Rensburg Sheppards plc.[12] In 2007, Investec plc acquired Kensington Group plc[13] and Experien (Pty) Ltd.[14] Investec plc acquired the remaining shares in Rensburg Sheppards plc in 2010. This business has since been rebranded as Investec Wealth & Investments and incorporates other wealth activities previously operated through the Bank.[15] In June 2012, Investec plc completed the €32 million acquisition of Irish brokerage firm, NCB. As a result, Investec now employs more than 240 specialists in Ireland.[16]
Operations[edit]
Investec employs approximately 8,200 people worldwide and operates primarily in South Africa, the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland. It also has banking operations in Switzerland, Mauritius, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Jersey, Namibia, Botswana, Canada, Taiwan and the United States.[7]
Products and divisional structure[edit]
Investec is organised as a network comprising six business divisions: Asset Management, Wealth & Investment, Property, Private Banking, Investment Banking and Capital Markets.[7]
Legal structure[edit]




LTI TX4 "Silver" advertising for Investec


In July 2002, Investec became the first South African company to list on both the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges, by implementing a dual listed companies (DLC) structure.[17]
The main features of the DLC structure are:

Investec plc and Investec Limited are separate legal entities and listings, but are bound together by contractual agreements and mechanisms.[17]
Investec plc is the holding company for the majority of the group's non-Southern African operations and Investec Limited is the holding company for the majority of the group's Southern African operations.[17]
Investec operates as if it is a single unified economic enterprise.[17]
Shareholders have common economic and voting interests as if Investec plc and Investec Limited were a single company.[17]
Creditors, however, are ring-fenced to either Investec plc or Investec Limited as there are no cross guarantees between the companies.[17]

Empowerment in South Africa[edit]
Investec's approach to transformation within South Africa involves:

Fostering the creation of new black entrepreneurial platforms[18]
Serving as a source of empowerment financing[18]
Encouraging internal transformation by bringing about greater representivity in the workplace. Investec focuses on creating black entrepreneurs within its organisation[18]

Sponsorships[edit]
Cricket[edit]
Investec announced a ten-year title sponsorship of Investec Test Match cricket for the England and Wales Cricket Board on 24 November 2011 at Lord's Cricket Ground. This sponsorship, will run until 2021 and is the longest sponsorship agreement secured in ECB’s history.[19]
Rugby[edit]
Investec is involved in a number of rugby sponsorships around the world, as they feel that "rugby embodies Investec's beliefs in collaborative teamwork, innovative play and determination and it’s for these reasons that we support many rugby initiatives".[20]
Investec previously sponsored the Investec Internationals Series (formerly the Investec Challenge) played at Twickenham Stadium, England.[21]
Investec is in the third year as the sponsor of the Investec Super Rugby competition in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.[22][23]
Investec also supports the International Rugby Academy South Africa which aims to capitalise on an untapped demand for high performance in playing and coaching rugby in South Africa.[24][25]
In 2010 Investec announced that they are the official sponsors of the Tri Nations rugby competition in New Zealand for the second year running.[26][27]
Horse racing[edit]
Investec has become a long term sponsor of the Epsom Derby festival in the UK until 2013. The illustrious horse-racing event is now known as the Investec Derby.[28][29]
Investec also sponsors the Investec Cape Derby in South Africa.[30]
Football[edit]
Investec has become the official shirt sponsor for Tottenham Hotspur's domestic cup games and UEFA Champions League games for the 2010/2011 and UEFA Europa League games for the 2011/2012 seasons. This sponsorship marked the first promotion into the football world for Investec.[31][32][33] In 2014, Investec became the official shirt sponsor for Widnes F.C. in the North West Counties Football League Division One.[34]
ProMaths[edit]
Since 2005 Investec has been sponsoring a flagship project started by the Kutlwanong Centre for Math, Science and Technology. The project aims at improving the mathematics and science skills of students from historically disadvantaged regions across South Africa. The project has been a huge success year on year, with most of the students obtaining distinctions in mathematics and science, and their other subjects. In 2014 the project was awarded the Mail & Guardian Investing In The Future STEM award.[35]
Other[edit]
Other sponsorships include the Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute in London's Hyde Park[36] and Russian Tennis Player Elena Dementieva for the 2008 Wimbledon tournament as well as the Australian Open in January 2009.[37]
Awards[edit]
The company was awarded Most Trusted Asset Management Brand, South Africa in 2016 by Global Brands Magazine Award.[38]

History[edit]
Investec was founded as a small leasing and financing company in 1974 in Johannesburg by Larry Nestadt, Errol Grolman and Ian Kantor. It has expanded through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions.[7] It secured a banking licence in 1980[8][9] and was first listed on the JSE Securities Exchange in South Africa in 1986, after merging with Metboard, a trust company. In 1988, Investec Bank Limited was restructured into Investec Group Limited ("IGL"), giving Investec Management and staff control of the company.[8]
In 1990, Investec acquired property management company I. Kuper & Company (Pty) Limited, Corporate Merchant Bank Limited (formerly Hill Samuel Merchant Bank Limited) and trade finance company Reichmans Limited.[8] Investec entered the UK market in 1992, by acquiring London-based Allied Trust Bank Limited ('ATB'), this was the first international acquisition by the Group.[8] In 1998, Investec acquired Guinness Mahon, a leading London based merchant bank, and Henderson Crosthwaite, its stockbroking arm, for £95m.[10] It also bought Hambros plc, another London based merchant bank the same year.[11] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2002.[8] In 2003 in a Black Economic Empowerment transaction empowerment partners acquired a 21.5% stake in the South Africa-listed Investec.[8]




Investec Loyal about to win the 2011 Sydney to Hobart, taken from Sandy Bay, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia


In 2005, Investec sold its UK Private Client Stockbroking operation, Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite Limited to Rensburg plc. Investec retains a 47.7% interest in the combined entity, Rensburg Sheppards plc.[12] In 2007, Investec plc acquired Kensington Group plc[13] and Experien (Pty) Ltd.[14] Investec plc acquired the remaining shares in Rensburg Sheppards plc in 2010. This business has since been rebranded as Investec Wealth & Investments and incorporates other wealth activities previously operated through the Bank.[15] In June 2012, Investec plc completed the €32 million acquisition of Irish brokerage firm, NCB. As a result, Investec now employs more than 240 specialists in Ireland.[16]
Operations[edit]
Investec employs approximately 8,200 people worldwide and operates primarily in South Africa, the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland. It also has banking operations in Switzerland, Mauritius, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Jersey, Namibia, Botswana, Canada, Taiwan and the United States.[7]
Products and divisional structure[edit]
Investec is organised as a network comprising six business divisions: Asset Management, Wealth & Investment, Property, Private Banking, Investment Banking and Capital Markets.[7]
Legal structure[edit]




LTI TX4 "Silver" advertising for Investec


In July 2002, Investec became the first South African company to list on both the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges, by implementing a dual listed companies (DLC) structure.[17]
The main features of the DLC structure are:

Investec plc and Investec Limited are separate legal entities and listings, but are bound together by contractual agreements and mechanisms.[17]
Investec plc is the holding company for the majority of the group's non-Southern African operations and Investec Limited is the holding company for the majority of the group's Southern African operations.[17]
Investec operates as if it is a single unified economic enterprise.[17]
Shareholders have common economic and voting interests as if Investec plc and Investec Limited were a single company.[17]
Creditors, however, are ring-fenced to either Investec plc or Investec Limited as there are no cross guarantees between the companies.[17]

Empowerment in South Africa[edit]
Investec's approach to transformation within South Africa involves:

Fostering the creation of new black entrepreneurial platforms[18]
Serving as a source of empowerment financing[18]
Encouraging internal transformation by bringing about greater representivity in the workplace. Investec focuses on creating black entrepreneurs within its organisation[18]

Sponsorships[edit]
Cricket[edit]
Investec announced a ten-year title sponsorship of Investec Test Match cricket for the England and Wales Cricket Board on 24 November 2011 at Lord's Cricket Ground. This sponsorship, will run until 2021 and is the longest sponsorship agreement secured in ECB’s history.[19]
Rugby[edit]
Investec is involved in a number of rugby sponsorships around the world, as they feel that "rugby embodies Investec's beliefs in collaborative teamwork, innovative play and determination and it’s for these reasons that we support many rugby initiatives".[20]
Investec previously sponsored the Investec Internationals Series (formerly the Investec Challenge) played at Twickenham Stadium, England.[21]
Investec is in the third year as the sponsor of the Investec Super Rugby competition in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.[22][23]
Investec also supports the International Rugby Academy South Africa which aims to capitalise on an untapped demand for high performance in playing and coaching rugby in South Africa.[24][25]
In 2010 Investec announced that they are the official sponsors of the Tri Nations rugby competition in New Zealand for the second year running.[26][27]
Horse racing[edit]
Investec has become a long term sponsor of the Epsom Derby festival in the UK until 2013. The illustrious horse-racing event is now known as the Investec Derby.[28][29]
Investec also sponsors the Investec Cape Derby in South Africa.[30]
Football[edit]
Investec has become the official shirt sponsor for Tottenham Hotspur's domestic cup games and UEFA Champions League games for the 2010/2011 and UEFA Europa League games for the 2011/2012 seasons. This sponsorship marked the first promotion into the football world for Investec.[31][32][33] In 2014, Investec became the official shirt sponsor for Widnes F.C. in the North West Counties Football League Division One.[34]
ProMaths[edit]
Since 2005 Investec has been sponsoring a flagship project started by the Kutlwanong Centre for Math, Science and Technology. The project aims at improving the mathematics and science skills of students from historically disadvantaged regions across South Africa. The project has been a huge success year on year, with most of the students obtaining distinctions in mathematics and science, and their other subjects. In 2014 the project was awarded the Mail & Guardian Investing In The Future STEM award.[35]
Other[edit]
Other sponsorships include the Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute in London's Hyde Park[36] and Russian Tennis Player Elena Dementieva for the 2008 Wimbledon tournament as well as the Australian Open in January 2009.[37]

Stewardship







                        Our commitment
                    



Investec Asset Management embraces the concept of active stewardship. The aim of our work is to preserve and grow the real purchasing power of the assets entrusted to us by our clients over the long term. In fulfilling this purpose we will assume a stewardship role, including the effective exercising of our clients’ ownership rights. We will monitor, evaluate, and if necessary, actively engage or withdraw investments with the aim of preserving or adding value to our clients’ portfolios.     













                        Our objectives
                    



Our primary objective is to ensure that we allocate our clients capital as efficiently as possible; to preserve and grow their wealth over the long term. We therefore take an active and transparent approach to stewardship including engagement with the investments in our portfolios. We believe this benefits our clients and improve the broader environmental and social context in which we invest.













                        ESG integration
                    



We have a dedicated global ESG (environmental, social and governance) team, which is steered by a senior Investment Governance Committee. Together with all the investment teams, the ESG team focuses on integration strategies, ESG research and engagement efforts.

A view from the CEO
Investec Asset Management CEO, Hendrik du Toit, talks about the unique journey of the firm as well as the investment and industry trends that have shaped our business and approach to investing. He also looks ahead to the major long-term themes that will shape the next quarter century for our business in a more challenging investment landscape.






Tomorrow’s world
What investment trends have shown consistent, resilient performance and returns over the last 25 years? What will be those of the next 25 years? How will the rise of emerging markets shape the way we look at the world? How do we invest for a better tomorrow and why? Capability heads and leaders from across the business reflect on these questions and more.





For an explanation of any technical terms please refer to the glossary











Towards the future









The world has changed profoundly over the past quarter century. Although the fundamentals of investment remain essentially the same, the investment process has become a lot faster. The data revolution has not only speeded up analysis but also transformed the nature of the active manager’s challenge. Managers no longer simply need to find more data and create better intelligence than their competitors, they must see through a surfeit of data to find superior insight.
Our clients have also changed. Today, asset owners are much better informed and more knowledgeable about asset management processes. Their priorities are also changing with the ageing demographics of their stakeholders who are also demanding more attention to the environmental and social impact of how their savings are invested, and require greater oversight of their investments.
As the actors have changed so has the setting. Investment managers are facing several new challenges that will shape the way we allocate capital in the future.









Meeting new challenges









1. Global disruptions
The last 25 years have been characterised by disruption and crises”, says Russell Silberston, Head of Multi-Asset Absolute Return. “Sterling was ejected from the exchange-rate mechanism in 1992, there was the Asian financial crisis in 1997, the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2001. Then there was the ‘big one’ – the global financial crisis in 2008. It goes on! Markets are uncertain. We cannot quantify what they’re going to do.”
But while there have always been market disruptions it is also likely that their effects will be wider-reaching. Philip Saunders, Co-Head of Multi-Asset Growth explains that “globalisation has changed the way markets have behaved. Our clients are now international rather than domestic and allocate capital globally. This means that we have to understand how global dynamics materially impact markets and their investments.”
2. Changes in the markets
Navigating market crises, and helping our clients understand the short- and long-term consequences of these disruptions is an essential part of investment management. But we are now also facing profound changes to the way the markets work, as our Co-Chief Investment Officer and Co-Head of 4Factor™ Equity, James Hand, explains. “There’s been the growth of high-frequency traders; there’s been a big shift from active to passive managers, accelerated in the recent past by the growth of ETFs and smart beta”, he says. James believes these changes are working against each other in a way that will exacerbate disruption in the future: “markets should be becoming more efficient with increased speed, but they should also be becoming less efficient with the growth of passive investing”, he says. The resulting tension, he believes, “really highlights some key issues for investors to think about in the future.”
3. Sustainable development
To deal with these challenges we have to be more innovative. “The big challenge for the world today can be summarised in two words: sustainable development,” says Hendrik. “By the middle of this century, we’ll have 10 billion people on earth. We need to invest in a sustainable way, so there will be significant commercial opportunities in financing not only the infrastructure but also in the businesses and the assets which will cater for that kind of world.”









The way forward









1. Attention to environmental, social and governance issues
Investing in a sustainable future will be one of the major trends of the coming years. As a firm, we believe that playing a role in financing sustainable development is a central part of our mission of “doing the right thing.” The imperative to invest sustainably was also underlined on a global level in 2015. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, which were agreed to by the majority of the countries on the planet even (if they are not yet fully ratified), are clarion calls for the world to work together to take action.
This imperative is also driven by our clients. For example, pension funds are aligning their investment practices with the values of their members. As the demographics of retirement savers include larger proportions of individuals from Generation X, Generation Y and even now the Millennials, who care more deeply about social and environmental issues, the vehicles through which they save need to reflect their values. For many pension funds, taking account of sustainability issues is even shaping how they view their fiduciary duty to their members.
The immediate priority is, therefore, that integrating an analysis of environmental, social and governance (ESG) challenges and risks into the investment process. “We believe it adds more value for our clients if we treat material ESG issues as an integral part of the investment analysis and decision-making process, rather than as a separate consideration,” James Hand says. He is also seeing more clients who require these issues to be included in quarterly report-backs, and a larger number of clients requesting segregated mandates with exclusions and ESG-specific screens.
2. Active ownership
As we sharpen our focus on ESG and face greater scrutiny from our clients, we believe that when we invest in the equity of companies we should be active shareholders. The Quality team, for example, typically conducts several hundred meetings each year with management teams to ensure they are comfortable with their decision-making processes. Simon Brazier, Co-Head of Quality, explains that “it’s important for us to engage with companies because we’re long-term investors. These meetings not only give us valuable insight into company strategy, but also enable us to make sure that the objectives of the management team are aligned with our aims as a shareholder.”
Additionally, Simon says, meeting with management teams enables his team to make sure that they have the long-term health of their companies at heart. “More than half of what we’re looking for in companies is how they grow their profits and returns,” he says. “Management teams have a corporate responsibility to act in the long-term interest of their company, its shareholders and stakeholders. They shouldn’t focus on short-term pressures like returning cash to shareholders or increasing compensation.”
3. Dealing with low rates and disinflation
We believe that really knowing the intricacies of the securities you own is vital in this time of great change for the investment environment. “We are moving from a relatively inflationary regime to a disinflationary, and in some cases deflationary, regime and that has changed the rules of the game in terms of the behaviour of different asset classes”, says Philip Saunders.
Philip observes two principal causes for this shift. First, a long secular bond bull market has just ended. Until relatively recently bond yields have been healthy, particularly long-dated bonds, but there is a strong likelihood that developed-market bond returns will remain depressed for some time and the environment broadly disinflationary. “Declining inflation expectations have also acted as a strong tail wind for equity valuations resulting in a re-rating”, says Philip. “Conversely, it has been negative for assets that benefit from inflation, such as gold and other commodities, despite some strong counter-trend rallies”.
Second, the accumulation of debt through quantitative easing programmes from the US Federal Reserve (the Fed), the Bank of England and latterly the European Central Bank has risen to unprecedented levels. Such expansionary monetary policy has further depressed real interest rates and hampered economic growth. Russell Silberston believes that, “Negative rates are here to stay for the foreseeable future, so investors need to think about alternative approaches to their traditional defensive asset class.”
As a result, Philip believes that we “have got to search more broadly for opportunities and we have got to be prepared to be a bit more flexible from an asset allocation perspective.” One of Russell’s suggestions is that asset owners might want to rethink their use of market-capitalised government bond benchmarks and instead think of other strategies such as looking at bonds with shorter maturities. “They can also exploit new opportunities by widening the investment universe or boost returns by hedging currency exposure.”
4. Adapting to changes in emerging markets
“One of the big changes in financial markets has been the emergence of emerging markets into the mainstream”, says Hendrik du Toit. “That process will continue.” Peter Eerdmans agrees, pointing out that these countries change. “It’s almost the definition of emerging markets that they are going through a process of profound change”, he says. We must, therefore, be cognisant of the fact that the countries we think of as emerging today, may not be the emerging markets of tomorrow.
Emerging markets have become more interconnected over time. Simon Brazier notes that, “Emerging markets are becoming an increasingly important part of the investment landscape. I’m a UK equity fund manager, but nearly a third of the revenues of companies that I can invest in come from developing or emerging markets. They may be listed in London, but emerging markets are vital for their growth.” And this holds true for policy making as well as business. “With globalisation, the Fed is even looking at China to impact its monetary policy”, he says, “This is a profound change in the global policy landscape.”
This shift has material consequences for the investment strategies we employ. As countries develop and become higher quality, with stronger monetary and fiscal policies, they start trading more like developed markets. As a result, a static investment process that focuses purely on credit risks, for example, will struggle to outperform on the more developed side of emerging markets.









Being prepared









So what do these challenges tell us about how we should think about investing?What unique insight do we have?
Investec Asset Management is one of the first firms to have developed a global mainstream fund management business from emerging-market roots. We believe that our journey to this point has taught us that we must adapt to the environment as we find it, not how we would like it to be. “From time to time, the investment landscape gets disrupted. It’s a fact”, says Hendrik.
The disruptions of the last 25 years have taught us is that as global financial markets become more integrated more than ever we need to build diversified and resilient portfolios to preserve and grow our clients’ capital. But doing so doesn’t mean shying away from taking on appropriate risk. In a complex and uncertain investment environment we need to search more broadly for opportunities, adapt our strategies and processes where necessary. We need to keep evolving. This doesn’t mean throwing out all the old models, but working from a stable core of investment beliefs.
So what do the next 25 years hold? No one has a crystal ball, but we believe that whatever happens it is important that we focus on doing the right thing for our clients, by acting in a way that reflects their values and aspirations as well as our own. We need to make sure that we steward our clients’ money safely and that means adapting to market changes and disruptions. We also have a responsibility to think about the long term and leaving a better future for the savers of today. “Investing is all about tomorrow, not today”, says Hendrik. “So I would argue that investment should be about a better tomorrow and a better future.”
 

Past performance is not a guide to the future and investments carry a risk of capital loss. Emerging markets may have less developed legal, political, economic and/or other systems. These markets may therefore carry a higher risk of financial loss than those in countries generally regarded as being more developed. The views expressed are those of the contributors at the time of publication and are subject to change.

Fund overview

The Investec Value Fund aims to provide investors with capital growth over the long term.
This is an equity fund where the manager prefers to buy out-of-favour, undervalued stocks which may lag the rest of the market for long periods. This means the fund should be considered as a long-term investment to be held through an entire market cycle.
Takes concentrated positions in stocks which may lead to significant exposure to a particular sector or industry.
Relative to the ALSI, periods of outperformance from purist value portfolios tend to be short and sharp, while periods of underperformance can be long. The Fund’s long-term track record of meaningful outperformance must be viewed in this context, and it requires patient investment to reap the potential benefits.
Performance of the Fund will hence differ markedly, either positively and negatively, from that of the index and peers.

Important information
Collective investment schemes (CIS) are traded at ruling prices and can engage in borrowing, up to 10% of portfolio net asset value to bridge insufficient liquidity, and scrip lending. A schedule of charges, fees and advisor fees is available on request from the Manager, Investec Fund Managers SA (RF) (Pty) Ltd which is registered under the CIS Control Act. Additional advisor fees may be paid and if so, are subject to the relevant FAIS disclosure requirements. CISs are generally medium to long-term investments and the manager gives no guarantee with respect to the capital or the return of the Fund. Performance shown is that of the Fund and individual investor performance may differ as a result of initial fees, actual investment date, date of any subsequent reinvestment and any dividend withholding tax and past performance is not necessarily a guide to the future. Performance figures above are based on lump sum investments, using NAV to NAV figures net of fees with gross income reinvested, in South African Rands. Different classes of units apply to the Fund and the information presented is for the most expensive class. Fund valuations and transaction cut-off time are 16h00 SA time each business day. This portfolio may be closed in order to be managed in accordance with the mandate. Fluctuations or movements in exchange rates may cause the value of underlying international investments to go up or down. A higher Total Expense Ratio (TER) does not necessarily imply a poor return, nor does a low TER imply a good return. Where portfolios invest in the participatory interests of foreign collective investment schemes, these may levy additional charges which are included in the relevant TER. The ratio does not include transaction costs. The current TER cannot be regarded as an indication of the future TERs. Fund prices are published each business day in selected media.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page.

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
