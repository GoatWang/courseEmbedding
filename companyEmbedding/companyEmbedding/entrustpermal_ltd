		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal. In addition to the Fund's operating expenses, you will indirectly bear the operating expenses of the underlying funds, which can be substantially higher than fees associated with mutual funds. The Fund may invest in unregistered hedge funds which are highly speculative investments that employ aggressive investment strategies, and carry substantial risk. Investments in hedge funds are generally illiquid, difficult to value and may carry significant restrictions for transferring assets. Some of the underlying funds employ leverage, which increases the volatility of investment returns and subjects the Fund to magnified losses if an underlying fund's investments decline in value. The Fund and some of the underlying funds may use derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. Some of the underlying funds may employ short selling, a speculative strategy. Unlike the possible loss on a security that is purchased, there is no limit on the amount of loss on an appreciating security that is sold short. The Fund and each underlying fund may engage in active and frequent trading, resulting in higher portfolio turnover and transaction costs. There is no assurance that these and other strategies used by the Fund or underlying funds will be successful. Equity securities are subject to price fluctuation. International investments are subject to special risks including currency fluctuations, social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Small-and mid-cap stocks involve greater risks and volatility than large-cap stocks. Fixed income securities involve interest rate, credit, inflation, and reinvestment risks. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities fall. High-yield bonds possess greater price volatility, illiquidity, and possibility of default. Asset-backed, mortgage-backed or mortgage related securities are subject to additional risks such as prepayment and extension risks. 
 Please see the prospectus for a more complete discussion of the Fund's risks.

 Performance 






Performance




Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so shares, when redeemed, maybe worth more or less than the original cost. Fund performance figures reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which the performance would have been lower. For the period prior to the June 28, 2013, Fund’s inception, the performance shown is that of Permal Hedge Strategies Fund I Service Shares incepted on February 1, 2012.
The maximum sales charge is 3.00%. Fund performance figures are net of fees, including a 1.10% management fee, 0.80% distribution/servicing fee, acquired fund (underlying manager) fees, and other Fund expenses. Performance results for the Fund are short-term and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating performance potential over varying market conditions or market cycles. Total return figures are based on the NAV per share applied to shareholder subscriptions and redemptions, which may differ from the NAV per share disclosed in Fund shareholder reports.








Net Asset Value (NAV): An investment option’s net asset value (“NAV”) per unit or unit price is calculated by dividing the value of its net assets by the total number of units outstanding. 


































**Gross expenses are the Fund's total annual operating expenses for the share class(es) shown.  Net expenses for Class(es) Broker reflect contractual fee waivers and/or reimbursements, where these reductions reduce the Fund's gross expenses, which cannot be terminated prior to Dec 31, 2017 without Board consent. The Gross and Net Expenses listed include 4.21 of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses ("AFFE") that are required to be shown in the Fund's prospectus. AFFE reflects the Fund's pro rata share of fees and expenses relating to its investments in acquired funds; however, AFFE are not incurred directly by the Fund. Therefore, AFFE are not reflected in the Fund's audited financial statements or financial highlights.


Underlying manager fees: In addition to the Fund's operating expenses, Fund shareholders will indirectly bear the operating expenses of the underlying funds. Generally, underlying manager fees include 1% to 3% management fee and a 15% to 25% incentive fee.

 Characteristics 






characteristics












Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the average number of years for which each dollar of unpaid principal on a loan or mortgage remains outstanding. Once calculated, WAL tells how many years it will take to pay half of the outstanding principal. 


Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds with embedded options. Effective duration takes into account that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change. Duration measures the sensitivity of price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates. The higher the duration number, the more sensitive a fixed-income investment will be to interest rate changes.

 Holdings 






Holdings








IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

 Distributions 






Distributions









The per share distribution amounts presented above reflect the distribution rates that were paid to shareholders on the indicated payable dates. The character of distributions for certain funds may have been subsequently adjusted for tax purposes. Shareholders can determine which funds may have reclassified the tax character of distributions by visiting the Tax Center in Account Services. Information on reclassifications for distributions paid during the current calendar year will not be available until the first quarter of the following year.


An XBRL file is not a fund's complete prospectus. XBRL is an interactive data format and is provided in addition to a fund's prospectus and annual and semi-annual reports linked to this page. An XBRL file is not viewable without a viewer tool. A viewer tool is available on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. You can download an XBRL zip file and view it on the SEC website or use the data for analysis with any comparison tool.








IMPORTANT INFORMATION: An investment in the Fund is not suitable for all investors, is illiquid and should be considered speculative. An investment in the Fund entails unique risks because the Portfolio Funds in which the Fund will invest are private entities with limited regulatory oversight and disclosure obligations. Because the Fund invests in underlying Portfolio Funds, the managers may not be able to shift allocations in time to capture an immediate or sudden spike in the market. Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss.
The information shown above relates to Permal Hedge Strategies Portfolio, the registered investment company in which the Fund invests substantially all of its investable assets. The Fund utilizes a master/feeder structure by investing all of its assets in the Permal Hedge Strategies Portfolio. Assets are reported at the master portfolio level.
Tapering of the Federal Reserve Board's quantitative easing program and a general rise in interest rates may lead to increased portfolio volatility.

            document only. Shares in any EnTrustPermal fund may not be offered in any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is not authorized.
        

            EnTrustPermal and its subsidiaries do not provide investment advisory services to the public and nothing contained herein should be construed as an offer
            of EnTrustPermal’s services or products.

For Non-U.S. Persons and Their Advisors: 
            The information contained in this part of the Website is directed solely to Non-U.S. persons and their advisers. By entering this Website you are
            certifying that you are not a U.S. person (including a resident of the United States, a corporation, partnership or other entity organized under U.S. laws,
            any estate of which any executor or administrator is a U.S. person or any trust of which any trustee is a U.S. person), or acting on behalf of a U.S.
            person. If you are not sure whether you are considered a U.S. person, please consult your legal adviser.
        

            The information provided on the Website is not intended for distribution to, or use by, any person or entity in any jurisdiction where such distribution or
            use is prohibited, or that would subject EnTrustPermal to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction. In particular, this expanded part of the
            Website for non-U.S. qualifying investors is directed solely to non-U.S. persons and their advisors who are outside the U.S. and must not be acted upon by
            persons in the U.S.
        

For U.K. Investors: 
            To the extent that material on the Website is issued in the UK, it is approved for the purposes of S.21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 by
            EnTrustPermal Ltd. an entity which is authorized and regulated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), save where a particular part of the Website
            is directed at exempt recipients only.
        

            EnTrustPermal Ltd. does not exclude or restrict any duty or liability it may have in respect of the Website to its customers under the UK Financial
            Services and Markets Act 2000 or the regulatory system.
        

            EnTrustPermal Ltd. has approved the material in the Distributor Information only to the extent it is accessible in the U.K. by persons to whom
            EnTrustPermal Ltd. could itself have communicated such material.
        

            EnTrustPermal funds are unregulated collective investment schemes for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 of the U.K.
        

            Persons dealing with agents of the EnTrustPermal funds outside the U.K. or investing in the EnTrustPermal funds may not be covered by the rules and
            regulations made for the protection of investors in the U.K. This means that they will not have the benefit of rights designed to protect investors under
            the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and under the rules of the Financial Conduct Authority. In particular they may not benefit from the right to
            claim through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme for losses resulting from a default of obligations owed under relevant regulations.
        

UK Stewardship Code: 
            FCA Conduct of Business Rule 2.2.3R, requires the investment firms which it covers to disclose the nature of their commitment to the UK Financial Reporting
            Council's Stewardship Code (the "Code") or, where they do not comply with the Code, the reasons for not doing so. The Code is voluntary and sets out a
            number of principles relating to engagement by investors with U.K. equity issuers.
        

            EnTrustPermal Ltd. predominantly manages funds of hedge funds, and does not generally invest directly with U.K. companies. As such, the Code is not
            generally applicable to EnTrustPermal Ltd.’s investment management business. However, EnTrustPermal does support the broad aims and objectives of the Code.
            We continue to maintain policies and procedures designed to identify and manage conflicts of interest as they arise, as well as a code of ethics policy to
            which all employees are bound. Proxy voting in respect of the underlying hedge funds in which EnTrustPermal invests is conducted in accordance with our
            proxy voting policy, which is reviewed on an annual basis and updated as necessary.
        

For U.S. and Canadian Institutional Investors and Distributors to U.S. Institutions: 
            The information contained in this part of the Website is directed solely to qualified U.S. and Canadian institutions and distributors to qualified U.S.
            institutions.
        

            Although certain EnTrustPermal entities are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as investment advisers under the U.S. Investment
            Advisers Act of 1940, securities issued by certain of the EnTrustPermal Funds have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, and have not
            been registered with, or approved by, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities administrator or any other regulatory authority.
            The securities issued by such EnTrustPermal Funds therefore cannot be sold, transferred or pledged (although they may be redeemed as described in each
            fund's offering documents) in the absence of such registration or the availability of an exemption therefrom. There is no public or other market for these
            securities, and no such market is expected to develop. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor the securities regulatory authority or
            commission of any state of the United States has passed upon the value of the securities of the EnTrustPermal Funds, made any recommendations as to their
            purchase, approved or disapproved any offering made by EnTrustPermal Funds or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of any information contained on the
            Website or in the offering materials for the EnTrustPermal Funds. Any contrary representation is a criminal offense.
        

            Unless otherwise noted, EnTrustPermal Funds have not been and will not be registered as investment companies under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940.
        

            U.S. institutions entering this area of the Website will be required to represent to EnTrustPermal that they are "accredited investors" as such term is
            defined under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, and "qualified purchasers" as such term is defined under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940.
        

            Canadian institutions entering this area of the Website will be required to represent to EnTrustPermal that they are "accredited investors" as such term is
            defined under the Canadian National Instrument 45-106 – Prospectus and Registration Exemptions.

            To the extent that material on the Website is issued in France, such issuance is by EnTrustPermal SAS or EnTrustPermal Ltd. EnTrustPermal SAS is a French

            France and neither this information nor any offering material relating to the Shares may be distributed or made available in France. Persons who are

            or regulations.
        

Singapore investors: 
            EnTrustPermal Singapore is a division of Legg Mason Asset Management Singapore Pte. Limited (Registration Number (UEN): 200007942R). The offer or
            invitation of Shares, does not relate to a collective investment scheme which are authorized under Section 286 of the Securities and Futures Act, Chapter
            289 of Singapore (the "SFA") or recognized under Section 287 of the SFA. The EnTrustPermal funds are not authorized or recognized by the Monetary Authority

            Act 2001 in respect of the financial services provided to wholesale clients in Australia ("Exemption"). The Exemption was granted on condition that we
            alert you to this and to the fact that EnTrustPermal Ltd. is regulated by the FCA under applicable English laws which differ from Australian Laws and that
            any information contained on this Website in the course of providing financial services will be prepared in accordance with English regulatory requirements
            (and not Australian laws).

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is a newly organized, open-end investment company with a limited history of operations. In addition to the Fund's operating expenses, you will indirectly bear the operating expenses of the underlying funds. The Fund may invest in unregistered hedge funds which are highly speculative investments that employ aggressive investment strategies and carry substantial risk. Investments in hedge funds are generally illiquid, difficult to value and may carry significant restrictions for transferring assets. Some of the underlying funds employ leverage, which increases the volatility of investment returns and subjects the Fund to magnified losses if an underlying fund's investments decline in value. The Fund and some of the underlying funds may use derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. Some of the underlying funds may employ short selling, a speculative strategy. Unlike the possible loss on a security that is purchased, there is no limit on the amount of loss on an appreciating security that is sold short. The Fund and each underlying fund may engage in active and frequent trading, resulting in higher portfolio turnover and transaction costs. There is no assurance that these and other strategies used by the Fund or underlying funds will be successful. Equity securities are subject to price fluctuation. International investments are subject to special risks including currency fluctuations, social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Small-and mid-cap stocks involve greater risks and volatility than large-cap stocks. Fixed income securities involve interest rate, credit, inflation, and reinvestment risks. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities fall. High yield bonds possess greater price volatility, illiquidity, and possibility of default. Please see the prospectus for a more complete discussion of the Fund's risks.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. For performance data including the effects of sales charges, Class A and Class A2 shares reflect the deduction of a maximum front-end sales charge of 5.75%. One-, three- and five-year returns for Class B shares reflect a maximum contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) of up to 5.0%, 3.0% and 1.0% respectively. Class C1 shares have no initial or CDSC charge, but are subject to a 12b-1 fee. One-year returns for Class C shares reflect a CDSC of 1.0%. Total returns assume the reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all Fund expenses. Total return figures are based on the NAV per share applied to shareholder subscriptions and redemptions, which may differ from the NAV per share disclosed in Fund shareholder reports. Performance shown excluding sales charges would have been lower, if the applicable sales charge been reflected. Had fees not been waived in various periods performance would have been lower. All classes of shares may not be available to all investors or through all distribution channels.
Different minimums may apply to clients of certain service agents. See the Fund's prospectus for additional information.
An investor cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.


Net Asset Value (NAV): An investment option’s net asset value (“NAV”) per unit or unit price is calculated by dividing the value of its net assets by the total number of units outstanding. 
























Morningstar proprietary ratings are based on risk-adjusted returns and are subject to change every month. The Overall Morningstar Rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. A 4- or 5-star rating does not necessarily imply that a fund achieved positive results for the period. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Share classes have a common portfolio and different expense structures.














**Gross expenses are the Fund's total annual operating expenses for the share class(es) shown.  Net expenses for Class(es) A, C, FI, I & IS reflect contractual fee waivers and/or reimbursements, where these reductions reduce the Fund's gross expenses, which cannot be terminated prior to Dec 31, 2018 without Board consent.  Net expenses for Class(es) A, C, FI, I & IS reflect voluntary fee waivers and/or reimbursements, where these reductions reduce the Fund's gross expenses, which cannot be terminated prior to Dec 31, 2017 without Board consent.
