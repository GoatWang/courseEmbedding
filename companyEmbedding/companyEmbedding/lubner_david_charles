Nightstar Appoints David Lubner to its Board of Directors






July 13, 2017 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



BOSTON & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NightstaRx Limited (“Nightstar”), a clinical-stage gene therapy company 
      developing treatments for inherited retinal diseases, today announced 
      that the company has appointed industry finance veteran David Lubner to 
      its board of directors. Mr. Lubner will serve as chair of the company’s 
      audit committee.
    


      “We are very pleased to welcome David to our board of directors and look 
      forward to his contributions alongside the very strong team we have 
      already built at Nightstar,” said David Fellows, chief executive officer 
      of Nightstar. “David brings decades of experience leading the finance 
      function at both private and publicly-traded biotechnology companies, 
      which will be invaluable as Nightstar evolves as a company and we 
      continue to advance our pipeline of novel programs for the treatment of 
      patients with inherited retinal diseases.”
    

      Mr. Lubner currently serves as executive vice president and chief 
      financial officer of Ra Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: RARX). Prior to 
      joining Ra Pharma, he served as a member of the senior management team 
      of Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biotechnology company, from its 
      inception in 2006 through 2015, including roles as senior vice president 
      and chief financial officer. From 1999 to 2005, Mr. Lubner served as 
      chief financial officer of PharMetrics Inc., a pharmacy and medical 
      claims data informatics company acquired by IMS Health in 2005. Prior to 
      joining PharMetrics, he served as vice president and chief financial 
      officer of ProScript from 1996 to 1999. Mr. Lubner is a member of the 
      American Institute of CPAs and is a Certified Public Accountant in the 
      Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He received his B.S. in business 
      administration from Northeastern University and an M.S. in taxation from 
      Bentley University.
    

About Nightstar


      Nightstar is a leading clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on 
      developing and commercializing novel one-time treatments for patients 
      suffering from rare inherited retinal diseases that would otherwise 
      progress to blindness. Nightstar’s lead product candidate, NSR-REP1, is 
      being developed as a treatment for patients with choroideremia, a rare, 
      inherited cause of progressive blindness that affects approximately one 
      in every 50,000 people. Positive results from a Phase 1/2 trial of 
      NSR-REP1 were published in The 
      Lancet in 2014 and in The 
      New England Journal of Medicine in 2016. Nightstar plans to commence 
      a Phase 3 registrational clinical trial of NSR-REP1 for choroideremia at 
      sites in the United States, Europe and Canada. Nightstar’s second 
      product candidate, NSR-RPGR, is being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical 
      trial to treat patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.
    

      In addition to these two programs, Nightstar is evaluating several other 
      retinal gene therapy product candidates for potential advancement into 
      clinical trials. Nightstar was founded in 2014 by ophthalmology 
      researchers at the University of Oxford. For more information about 
      Nightstar or its clinical trials, please visit www.nightstarx.com.
