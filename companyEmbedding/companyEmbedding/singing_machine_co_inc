History[edit]
The Singing Machine Company (SMC) was originally incorporated in California in 1982 with a focus on professional and semi-professional karaoke equipment. In 1988 the Company began marketing karaoke equipment for home use. It is believed that SMD was the first company to introduce home karaoke products to the United States.[1] In 2001, SMC entered into a multi-year license agreement with MTV.[2] As a part of a shift in strategy, SMC approached the mass market through large retailers. In the following year, Business Week Magazine named The Singing Machine Company #1 on their list of Hot Growth Companies.[3]
Products[edit]
Karaoke Machines[edit]
The core of SMC's business is the distribution and sale of its karaoke machines to retailers and wholesalers such as Wal-Mart, Sam's Club, Best Buy, and Costco.[citation needed]
In the fall of 2015 The Singing Machine introduced its new digital line of products, no CD-G required allowing users to create playlists on the company's branded site and chose their favorite songs, download them to a USB, giving them the freedom of mixing and matching genres, singers, and enjoying the songs they want to sing.
Music[edit]
SMC has a music library thousands of recordings, which are licensed from their publishers for karaoke use. The library spans a variety of genres including: pop, rock, rap, country, Christian, Latin, motown, and oldies.
Bratz Licensed Products[edit]
In 2007 SMC signed a deal with MGA Entertainment to license the popular Bratz franchise. Such licensed products include karaoke products, digital drum sets, clock radios, TV/DVD combos, and portable DVD players.
Motown Licensed Products[edit]
Following a 2003 agreement between SMC and Universal Music Enterprises, the company released the "Motown Original Artist Karaoke" compilation series, which features karaoke tracks of Motown classic songs made from the original master recordings of the songs instead of cover versions, like most karaoke tracks. In addition, a Motown-themed karaoke machine has also been released.
Musical Instruments[edit]
SMC has a line of electronic drum sets under the brand name "SoundX".

Loud music booms down the hallway outside the Singing Machine Company’s Fort Lauderdale headquarters. Inside, the Company is testing out the latest Singing Machine “Carnaval” their latest product in a new line of Digital Download karaoke machines. It is quickly apparent that the new “Carnaval” is fully loaded to achieve maximum fun. It’s loaded with the latest tech and filled with all the features to make it a roadshow warrior -- big, loud speakers, a lithium-ion battery and travel wheels and trolley handle for portability. And to really emphasize fun, the company built in disco ball lights. Lots and lots of room-filling, dazzling lights that bathe any room in color. All of this is designed to emphasize the idea that this company and its products are all about fun.
The Singing Machine Company has been creating joy through music for over 32 years and has been publicly traded since 1994. The Company now trades on the OTCQB under the ticker “SMDM”.  Over the last four years, the Company has been on a growth tear, posting 5 consecutive years of profits and double-digit growth in sales. This year is no exception as the Company recently released its 2nd quarter ended September 30, 2015 results, boasting a 31% increase in sales compared to the prior year and quarterly net income of almost $2 million dollars, or $0.03 cents per share. The Company is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 6 for the second quarter ended earnings results.
Singing Machine sells their karaoke machines through all major big box retailers in North America like Wal-Mart, Target, Toys ‘R’ Us, Costco, and Sam’s Club and Amazon.com. The Company also sells internationally to countries like Australia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. The Company reports its products can be found in over 25,000 retail stores world-wide and last year announced it had sold over 1,000,000 karaoke machines in its 2015 fiscal year.
Gary Atkinson, Company CEO, laughs as one of his staffers belts out a poorly done out of tune version of Adele. “It doesn’t matter how well you sing as long as you can have fun with friends,” commented Gary Atkinson. Mr. Atkinson, a former licensed attorney and MBA graduate, who has shifted gears significantly to lead the Singing Machine’s transition over the last 7 years.
The Company’s North American strategy has been to push out competitors but occupying all of the retail shelf space allocated for karaoke products. The Company produces over 30 models of karaoke machines ranging in price points from $49 up to $299 and has the range of features and price points to lock up most of the big box retailers in North America. The strategy has worked as the Company has seen its sales surge over the last 5 years from approximately $19.0M to almost $40.0M in its most recent fiscal-year ended results. 
Now as the market share leader, the Company is setting its sights on transforming itself from a primarily hardware based Company to a hardware and music distribution company. This year Singing Machine released a new line of Digital Download karaoke products with the goal to enter into the karaoke music distribution business. Previously, the main way to access music on any home karaoke machine was to buy a karaoke CD+G, which is essentially a special music CD that has graphical lyric files on it. Outside music content companies dominated the sales of karaoke CDs as Singing Machine did not have the licensing relationships to sell its own karaoke content. Going forward, the Company is betting that consumers are willing to ditch their antiquated CDs in favor of picking and choosing their favorite songs from the Company’s library of digital karaoke content.
Atkinson comments, “It’s the old razor and razor-blade business model that we think will transform this Company. Singing Machine is already the most trusted brand in home karaoke and we currently do not take full advantage of our position as the market leader status. We believe over time we can convert all of our machines into a recurring revenue stream where our machines can provide the gateway to karaoke music downloads or subscriptions.”
Atkinson added, “We now have 10% of our machines able to play digital downloads from our online music store. In addition, 40% of our lineup is able to stream karaoke content via Bluetooth using our Mobile Karaoke App, available on the iOS App Store.” The Company charges $2.00 per digital download or offers subscription packages to stream any song from its online library for either 48-hours, 1 month, or 1 year.
A Singing Machine staffer nails a tough Whitney Houston song and the room erupts with applause. As the Company moves into the holiday season, which has always traditionally been its strongest quarter, it hopes there will be a lot more to applause in its future. Third quarter results are expected to be announced by February 15, 2016.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
