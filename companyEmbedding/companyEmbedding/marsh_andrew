MARSH RISK CONSULTING















	Product Liability

 


Unique liability challenges exist for businesses in relation to the manufacture, sale, and distribution of products. This includes warranty issues relating to the performance of the products. For example, the product may be defectively designed or manufactured in a negligent manner, causing serious harm to those using it. Alternatively, there is the potential of contractual liability arising from others involved in the chain of commerce.
Marsh provides a broad range of support to clients and their defense counsel including:

Historical insurance policy organization and analysis.
Collection, organization and analysis of claim information.
Identification and organization of unallocated expenses.
Loss allocation modeling to support insurance recoveries.
Design of settlement schemes and negotiation with insurers.
Creation or enhancement of insurance billing system.

We also provide support to clients with insufficient insurance limits, and/or self-administered clients that are looking to lessen their exposure through risk transfer including:

Evaluation, recommendation, and implementation of best practices to either put the program in the best light for prospective insurers or reduce cost if risk is retained.
Elimination or reduction of risk through loss portfolio transfers.

These services provide a number of benefits including:

Favorable settlements with insurers.
Financial planning and forecasting (including Chapter 11).
Insurance recovery predictions based on changing assumptions.
Proof of damages for trial purposes.
Viable bill to insurers and prompt recovery.
Cost-effective risk transfer.

Marsh has strategies that can minimize the impact of product liability and mass tort exposures, as well as other external liabilities, on your bottom line.

Software Development
This is a list of some of the conceptual and experimental tools I have developed as a by-product of my work on PerformativeDesign.com. My main apps rely on a back-end system that is not yet ready for release, so those listed here are primarily demonstrative and/or educational in nature. For info on some of my previous desktop and Flash-based apps, see the Past Computer Software section.









Web Applications


Interesting Experiments


Interactive Diagrams


Processing Applications





Web Applications
These are browser-based web apps that use mainly WebGL and SVG. They should run fine in any reasonably recent
                    desktop, phone or tablet web browser without requiring any special plugins.

Cross-Browser Issues
These apps get updated quite often and many browsers cache files. Thus, if any app appears to look funny
                    or behave wierdly, use the browser Refresh button to update cached files.
iPad: On some older iPads you may have to cycle the orientation of the page to/from portrait and back
                    to get the WebGL canvas to scale properly. To look good on a hi-res screen, the WebGL canvas has to be
                    drawn at a multiple of the device's pixel ratio and then scaled back to page size using CSS. For some
                    reason iPads sometimes ignore this CSS scaling during the first page render.
iPhone: Whilst the canvas scales fine on an iPhone, everything else appears to scale completely
                    differently to any other device, including the iPad, and there seems no way of getting rid of the address
                    bar at the top. Of course this is the only device type that I don't really have access to for extensive
                    testing, but I am working on it.





Interesting Experiments
The following are some simple experiments with different web technologies and concepts, available here as they may be of interest to some people, but having no purpose other than as tests or demonstrations of whether a particular approach is practical or even viable.

Processing Applications
These apps were written using Processing and are available here as standalone Desktop and Android apps. You will need to have Java already installed on your computer in order to run them.

The intention was for these to form part of the PerformativeDesign.com website. However embedding Java applets in web pages is very much a dead-end now as both Edge and Chrome no longer support the Java plugin, and it looks like Oracle will soon depreciate it anyway. However, they are available here as standalone apps as I still think they may be useful.

Justin Marsh
 Arthur Andrew Medical
 Title: Founder and CEO
 Est: 1999   |  www.arthurandrew.com
Justin Marsh, co-founder and CEO of  Arthur  Andrew Medical, is shining a light on an unconventional approach  to improving  health. But it all started far from the world of  medicine.
Marsh left college with an electronics   engineering degree and began his career working as a subcontractor for   Motorola, Intel and AMD, developing and installing software.
“Ultimately, it wasn’t my education that   allowed me to get into my current industry, it was more by chance and  some key  contacts that pointed me in this direction,” Marsh says.
Marsh switched careers when he joined the   medical field as an investor, eventually buying out all of his partners  to  become the CEO of Arthur Andrew Medical. The company’s name derives  from the  middle names of the two founders, Thomas Arthur Aldrich and  Justin Andrew  Marsh.
The Scottsdale-based  company began in 1999 as  an international broker and distributor of enzymes and  probiotics. To  launch the line, Marsh took out a portion of equity from his house and  relied on  revolving credit. In 2003, Arthur Andrew Medical had a  breakthrough when it  found enzymes in Japan that  it claimed surpassed  any available in North America.  Enzymes — along with several other  benefits — convert our food to energy,  eliminate viruses, and purify  our blood. When they are formulated with  materials found in nature,  their beneficial uses can increase. These  formulations are known as  nutraceuticals or dietary supplements.
Arthur Andrew Medical teamed up with  specialized doctors to  formulate these enzymes and create  nutraceuticals as a natural and alternative  way to heal and help  patients. The company’s line now consists of seven  products that  perform several different functions.
The business originally began with the intent  of selling only  to health care professionals. But Marsh says that as  customers wanted more  availability of the product, the company decided  to open up the line to  distribution across the U.S.,  and one day it  plans to expand internationally.
The company has a staff of 10 and a sales force  that includes  more than 20 contractors and distributors. Besides the  office in Scottsdale, Arthur Andrew Medical has a satellite office  in  San Diego.  With four competitors worldwide, including three right here  in Arizona, the company  must work hard to earn consumers’ trust. One  challenge the company struggles  with is creative marketing.
“We are not permitted to say that we can  diagnose, treat, cure  or prevent any disease without first spending  millions of dollars on FDA  approval,” Marsh says, adding that as a  result, the company relies on patient  and doctor referrals.
With a claimed 70 percent rate of returning customers, this  hurdle hasn’t stopped Arthur Andrew Medical from achieving success.
“Unlike pharmaceuticals, our products are   effective without any concern of becoming habit-forming or causing  damaging  side effects,” Marsh says. “We have had success with patients  that were  considered untreatable with conventional methods.”
Marsh  says his main goal is for people to know that, depending  on the  product, the FDA does not always have the final say.He adds there are   options that can help when conventional medicine can’t.
“We approach medicine in an entirely different manner,” Marsh  says. “We know our products work and we know there are no risks.”
Today, despite the poor economy, the  company  continues to grow. Marsh says Arthur Andrew Medical is on track to   exceed its growth expectations for this year, with record-breaking sales  logged  in March.
“It seems the public eye is  beginning to see  the value of nutraceuticals as the cost of maintaining good  health is  much less expensive than recovering from poor health,” Marsh says.

HI to one and all,
Please can you tell me what the dangers are now that Japan has been struck by a nuclear disaster of unprecedented proportions.
Will you still use enzymes from Japan?
regards,
Martin
