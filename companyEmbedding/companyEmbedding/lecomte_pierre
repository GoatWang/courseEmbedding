Prior to joining Bain, Pierre worked in brand management with Yahoo and the Nabisco Biscuit Company, managing brands such as SnackWell’s and Chips Ahoy.

What was the first job you had?  I had a newspaper route when I was young but have never considered myself a “morning person” so moved on to other jobs! My first “official” job was working as a cook at a fast food restaurant. Little did I know that twenty years later I would become an active restaurant investor, so perhaps there was some foreshadowing. I also held odd jobs in college, including working in the “awards and medals” office at a military base and as a telephone market researcher. The latter taught me the power of real market diligence, so I guess I really have  been training for this job for years?What attracted you to the business of brand building?I’ve been a student of brands all my life. This will sound really odd, but as a kindergartner, I remember my favorite “toy” in the classroom being an empty bottle of Scope from a play grocery kit! Something about the package and label design fascinated me. Today, I enjoy understanding how brands build an emotional connection with consumers in addition to filling a need at a great value. These are the brands that can win in competitive categories. These days, nobody likes to shop with me, as I can’t walk through a supermarket or drugstore without spending time in each aisle checking out shelfsets! What have you learned from working with entrepreneurs?What makes entrepreneurs special is their willingness to take risks and seize opportunities that many of us would over-analyze. So I have a tremendous amount of respect for those who put in the creativity, time, and energy to build something from the bottom-up at the risk of their own wealth, family, and personal satisfaction. But I also believe that pairing their entrepreneurial vision with our cross-category experiences and management disciplines is a powerful combination that allow brands to grow. At TSG, we’re proud to have partnered with exceptional entrepreneurs and management teams to create iconic consumer brands.If you were to start your own business, what would it be and why?I’ve always had a fantasy of owning the beach shack that rents all the umbrellas, chairs, and gear. Who doesn’t want to work on the beach all-day right? But then I get to thinking about the store economics, how seasonal a business it is, how hot the sand must be, how it won’t feel like vacation anymore and realize I should stick to helping entrepreneurs realize their dreams!What is your greatest accomplishment?  It’s still in process. Raising a daughter to find her own self while avoiding the shortcomings or biases that all of us have as parents is not easy, but I hope to someday list it as my best thing I ever did.
