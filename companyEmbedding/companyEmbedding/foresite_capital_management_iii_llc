What are analysts saying about Aimmune Therapeutics stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Aimmune Therapeutics stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company which is engaged in the development of desensitization treatments for peanut and other food allergies. The Company's characterized oral desensitization immunotherapy includes AR101, a product for the treatment of peanut allergy in children and adults which is in clinical trial stage. Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. is headquartered in Brisbane, California.   " (7/27/2017)
2. Piper Jaffray Companies analysts commented, "Today Aimmune reported 4Q16 financial results, ending the quarter with $249M in cash. We think this cash funds the company through at least YE18. By this time, we should have results from its Phase III PALISADE program in peanut allergy and we see compelling efficacy as well as safety here as the key value-creating event for AIMT shares around YE17/early '18. By YE18, we also expect a BLA filing submitted for use in kids and teens. Based on guidance of BLA timing, and assuming the full year for BLA prep, filing and review (despite the BTD status granted to AR101), we're modestly adjusting first US peds/teens sales from 2019 to 2020, resulting in a new PT of $38. Despite this change, we continue to recommend AIMT in advance of 12-month clinical progress including, importantly, PALISADE up-dosing completion around mid'17 which we see as potentially reducing clinical risk for the program." (3/15/2017)

Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy).

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: $36.25 (67.82% upside)

What are analysts saying about Aimmune Therapeutics stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Aimmune Therapeutics stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company which is engaged in the development of desensitization treatments for peanut and other food allergies. The Company's characterized oral desensitization immunotherapy includes AR101, a product for the treatment of peanut allergy in children and adults which is in clinical trial stage. Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. is headquartered in Brisbane, California.   " (7/27/2017)
2. Piper Jaffray Companies analysts commented, "Today Aimmune reported 4Q16 financial results, ending the quarter with $249M in cash. We think this cash funds the company through at least YE18. By this time, we should have results from its Phase III PALISADE program in peanut allergy and we see compelling efficacy as well as safety here as the key value-creating event for AIMT shares around YE17/early '18. By YE18, we also expect a BLA filing submitted for use in kids and teens. Based on guidance of BLA timing, and assuming the full year for BLA prep, filing and review (despite the BTD status granted to AR101), we're modestly adjusting first US peds/teens sales from 2019 to 2020, resulting in a new PT of $38. Despite this change, we continue to recommend AIMT in advance of 12-month clinical progress including, importantly, PALISADE up-dosing completion around mid'17 which we see as potentially reducing clinical risk for the program."

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
