  Rated 4 out of 5 by 1reviewer.Rated 4 out of 5 by Crimson Colin excellent, feature laden measuring tape For me, the best feeling and easily used tape measure I've used. I have a 16' and 25', and use this one more frequently. The finger stop is great for fast measurements, double sided marking means it can be used upside down or straight up easily, the oversized gripper is easy to grab onto an edge at length. It's highly flexible and durable, the scale built in makes jobsite print reading even easier. The belt clip can be attached at many angles to many surfaces on my tool belt or normal work jeans, making it customizable to the user. Only place I see room for improvement is the gripper tends to cause the tape to flip over at long (8-10 foot) standouts or during vertical measuring, and the spring retraction is a bit slower than models some users may be used to. More a matter of taste, and still my favorite tape!

16 ft. Tape Measure

Milwaukee tape measures are nothing but heavy duty. Using nylon blade protection and a 5-point reinforced frame, they offer up to 10X longer blade life, by resisting contamination wear and increasing protection when dropped. An additional innovative feature is the finger stop, which protects your finger when the blade retracts.

excellent, feature laden measuring tape
For me, the best feeling and easily used tape measure I've used. I have a 16' and 25', and use this one more frequently. The finger stop is great for fast measurements, double sided marking means it can be used upside down or straight up easily, the oversized gripper is easy to grab onto an edge at length. It's highly flexible and durable, the scale built in makes jobsite print reading even easier. The belt clip can be attached at many angles to many surfaces on my tool belt or normal work jeans, making it customizable to the user. Only place I see room for improvement is the gripper tends to cause the tape to flip over at long (8-10 foot) standouts or during vertical measuring, and the spring retraction is a bit slower than models some users may be used to. More a matter of taste, and still my favorite tape!

Frame Size Information
If you look on the inside of the arm of your glasses you find will something that looks like: 52 [] 16 135.
This is information on the size of your glasses: the lens diameter, the bridge width and the arm length, all measured in millimetres.



The Eye Width, or Lens Diameter, is the width of the lens (in mm), measured from the bridge. (In this example, the Eye Width is 52.)
The Bridge Width is the gap above your nose between the lenses. It should be comfortable. Too tight, and the glasses could pinch your nose; too loose and the glasses will not be stable on your face. (In this example, the Bridge Width is 16.)
The Temple Length, or Arm Length, is usually one of three standards ďż˝ 135, 140 or 145mm. The arm should be long enough to sit comfortably over your ears. Glasses with straight arms do not always have this measurement indicated. (In this example, the Temple Length is 135.)

 "Ordered 4 pair of sunglasses because the price was right. One pair is no longer available.  So far I have received the Gucci--OMG-they are spectacular and $200 less than Nordstroms!" 













Benjamin Knipping ()






 ""VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE !!! I received my order today and it took 9 days since I ordered and I ordered it on a weekend - so probably it took one week to process. Ray Ban sunglasses are definitely no fake and the prescription glasses are excellent. I will order again - in a store it would have cost me almost 300$ what I got at ezcontactsusa for less than 100$. AMAZING !!!" " 













Sebrina Brown (Bonney Lake, WA)






 "I ordered the Coach HC6013 Eyeglasses Julayne. I received them exactly one week after ordering them. They are PERFECT! They came with the original case, original lenses, and cloth wipe. I couldnt be more pleased with the service and my glasses. I have referred several friends and Im sure this will not be my last order."

			Project 5117


















	As supported by a national alliance with the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and with the ongoing support of the American Bankers Association and Protective Life, Project 5117’s mission is to strengthen the economy by focusing on empowering those who earn less than $50,000 a year. Led by co-chairs Dr. Bernice King, Ambassador Andrew Young and John Hope Bryant, Project 5117 is supported by a broad range of services, from homeownership counseling, to credit card debt management, a program that helps those with low credit scores raise their score to 700, and the comprehensive entrepreneurship-training course HOPE Business In A Box Academies.

	Project 5117 stands for:



5 million youth empowered with a new level of financial literacy through unique financial dignity education programs, that have successfully been taught in 3,500 schools across the country. The program ensures basic consumer protection education for a generation, while making smart cool, so they stay in school.



1 million of these empowered youth will have an opportunity to become future entrepreneurs and local job creators through HOPE Business In A Box Academies, supported by a 100-year partnership with the Gallup Organization. This effort powerfully reconnects education with aspiration in the lives of our youth. By the year 2020 there will be 2,000 HOPE Business In A Box Academies across the United States, in both urban and rural communities. 2013 Pilot Results



1,000 first-ever bottom-up empowerment centers, branch banks with HOPE Inside units spread through out America and 5,000 certified locations containing “HOPE Inside Plus” units. This plan is consistent with the long-term growth strategies of top regional and money-center banks, and appreciates the under-utilized, 100,000 unit branch banking network across America.



700 Credit Score Communities will be attained through the expansion of HOPE Inside and “HOPE Inside Plus” locations. These communities will have access to credit counseling, education on credit and money management, and debt management, offered in an individual or group setting. 




	With the launch of this next phase of Operation HOPE’s work, which operates at the level of national scale, and measurable local impact -- community-by-community and across the country -- we are now injecting into society a pragmatic and tangible plan of action, which everyone can play a meaningful role in.  It is our way of answering some of the questions posed by Dr. King in the Poor People’s Campaign, in both word and deed.

                    I came to Muncie in 2003 for Ball State, I stayed for the past 14 years for the city.  Muncie has an overwhelming lust for improvement.  You can see negativity, crime and pitfalls in any town in America.  What impresses me most about Muncie is the crazy amount of people in Muncie that get involved to showcase how positive this city really is.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Tom Ford FT 5117 Eyeglasses 
                        Find many unisex frames in our selection of Tom Ford eyeglasses. When you want a neutral style, find it out of the many black plastic frames by Tom Ford. Although the brand carries the typical rectangular plastic style, wayfarer and aviator frames, also made from medium-thickness black plastic, are another option. Additionally, the brand has a selection of metal unisex frames, also with a similar angular style.  Not all Tom Ford glasses are unisex, and we carry some specific men�s and women�s style. As one of the most well-known high fashion brands, Tom Ford represents sophistication without going over the top, and all of the eyeglasses in our selection capture this.
