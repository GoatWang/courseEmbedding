Activist Jana seeks to scuttle EQT’s $6.7 billion acquisition of Rice Energy

Jul. 3, 2017 at 10:50 a.m. ET
by David Benoit 









Rice Energy's stock soars after deal to be bought by EQT in a $6.7 billion deal
Shares of Rice Energy Inc.  rocketed 26% in premarket trade Monday, after the oil and natural gas company announced an agreement to be acquired by EQT Corp.  in a deal valued at $6.7 billion. Under terms of the deal, EQT will pay 0.37 of its shares and $5.30 in cash for each Rice stock outstanding. Based on Friday's closing prices, that values Rice shares at about $27.04 each, a 37% premium. EQT shares tumbled 6.4% ahead of the open. EQT said it will assume or refinance about $1.5 billion of debt and preferred equity. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. EQT will obtain Rice's midstream assets, which include 92% interest in Rice Midstream GP Holdings LP, which owns 100% of the general partner incentive distribution rights and 28% of the limited partner interests in Rice Midstream Partners LP . "This transaction brings together two of the top Marcellus and Utica producers to form a natural gas operating position that will be unmatched in the industry," said EQT Chief Executive Steve Schlotterbeck.  Rice's stock has lost 7.8% year to date through Friday, while EQT shares have dropped 10%, the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  has tumbled 12% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

                   Investor Relations              





      Overview          

EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) conducts its business through two business segments: EQT Production and EQT Midstream. EQT Production has been a major player in the Appalachian Basin for over 125 years.  EQT owns approximately 3.6 million gross acres – including approximately 790,000 gross acres in the Marcellus play, more than 13,600 gross productive wells, and 13.5 trillion cubic feet of proved natural gas, NGL, and crude oil reserves. EQT continues to be a leader in the use of advanced horizontal drilling technology – designed to minimize the potential impact of drilling-related activities and reduce the overall environmental footprint. Through safe and responsible operations, the Company is committed to meeting the country’s growing demand for clean-burning energy. EQT is seizing opportunities created by the Appalachian Basin’s growing production of natural gas and other energy products. In 2015, EQT GP Holdings, LP (NYSE: EQGP) was formed to own partnership interests in EQT Midstream Partners, LP, (NYSE: EQM), a growth-oriented limited partnership formed by EQT to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream assets in the Appalachian Basin. EQT Midstream Partners provides midstream services to EQT and third-party companies through its strategically located transmission, storage, and gathering systems that service the Marcellus and Utica regions. EQT Midstream Partners owns approximately 950 miles of FERC-regulated interstate pipelines; and also owns more than 1,800 miles of high- and low-pressure gathering lines that have multiple delivery interconnects with the transmission and storage system. EQT owns a 90% interest in EQT GP Holdings. EQT GP Holdings owns the general partner interest, all of the incentive distribution rights, and a portion of the limited partner interests in EQT Midstream Partners.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Jul 27 17
EQT Production announced unaudited earnings and operating results for second quarter and six months ended of June 30, 2017. EQT Production’s operating income totaled $52.8 million for the quarter, compared to an operating loss of $447.7 million in the second quarter 2016. The $500.5 million increase was primarily attributable to increases in gains on derivatives not designated as hedges, an increase in the average realized price, and an increase in production sales volume, partly offset by increased operating expenses. Operating revenue totaled $631.1 million for the second quarter 2017, which was $554.1 million higher than the second quarter 2016. EQT Production’s adjusted operating loss, totaled $4.2 million for the quarter, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $118.1 million in 2016. Adjusted operating revenue was $566.1 million for the quarter, which was $176.0 million higher than the same period last year, primarily due to a higher average realized sales price and increased production sales volume. Capital expenditures were $455,721,000 against $234,325,000 a year ago. 

For the six months, total operating revenues were $1,459,763,000 against $560,660,000 a year ago. Operating income was $310,195,000 against loss of $453,213,000 a year ago. Capital expenditures were $1,401,179,000 against $471,891,000 a year ago.

EQT Production's operating income totaled $257.4 million for the quarter, compared to an operating loss of $5.5 million in the first quarter 2016. The $262.9 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the average realized price, increases in gains on derivatives not designated as hedges, an increase in product ion sales volume, and increases in pipeline and net marketing services revenue, partly offset by increased operating expenses.

Activist Jana seeks to scuttle EQT’s $6.7 billion acquisition of Rice Energy

Jul. 3, 2017 at 10:50 a.m. ET
by David Benoit 









Rice Energy's stock soars after deal to be bought by EQT in a $6.7 billion deal
Shares of Rice Energy Inc.  rocketed 26% in premarket trade Monday, after the oil and natural gas company announced an agreement to be acquired by EQT Corp.  in a deal valued at $6.7 billion. Under terms of the deal, EQT will pay 0.37 of its shares and $5.30 in cash for each Rice stock outstanding. Based on Friday's closing prices, that values Rice shares at about $27.04 each, a 37% premium. EQT shares tumbled 6.4% ahead of the open. EQT said it will assume or refinance about $1.5 billion of debt and preferred equity. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. EQT will obtain Rice's midstream assets, which include 92% interest in Rice Midstream GP Holdings LP, which owns 100% of the general partner incentive distribution rights and 28% of the limited partner interests in Rice Midstream Partners LP . "This transaction brings together two of the top Marcellus and Utica producers to form a natural gas operating position that will be unmatched in the industry," said EQT Chief Executive Steve Schlotterbeck.  Rice's stock has lost 7.8% year to date through Friday, while EQT shares have dropped 10%, the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  has tumbled 12% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

EQT Reports Second Quarter 2017 Earnings













EQT: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 07/14/2017 settlement date, and EQT Corp is the #136 most shorted of the S&P 500 components, based on 5.60 "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then divided by the average daily volume, to express the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.

The most recent short interest data has been released for the 04/13/2017 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.

On Jun 23, we issued an updated research report on energy player EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report)	. The company has a significant presence in the prospective Marcellus play and will likely boost its footprint further in the shale resources following the acquisition of Rice Energy Inc. (RICE  -  Free Report)	. The buyout will help boost the company’s natural gas production significantly. However, EQT Corp.’s sole exposure to Appalachian Basin is a concern.The company’s business primarily entails production, gathering and transportation of natural gas. Natural gas is known for producing significantly less CO2 – a major pollutant – when burned to produce heat or power. With natural gas’ demand set to grow, we expect the company to generate significant cash flow from operations.Recently, in a landmark deal, EQT Corp. decided to acquire Rice Energy for a total consideration of $6.7 billion. With the completion of the deal, the upstream companies will create the largest natural gas producer in the U.S. Most importantly, the acquisition will significantly raise EQT Corp.’s core acreage positions in the Marcellus and Utica shale plays. Post acquisition, the average sales volumes of natural gas for EQT Corp. will surge to 3.6 billion cubic feet equivalent per day (Bcfe/D) from 1.3 Bcfe. Also, the transaction will help the combined entity lower operating cost and realize cost synergy of $2.5 billion.Investors should know that the acquisition will likely increase EQT Corp.’s footprint in the Marcellus shale play to 670,000 net acres from 187,000 net acres. Also, total undeveloped locations in the region will jump to 3,700 from 980. In the Pennsylvania & West Virginia Utica resources, the acquisition is anticipated to raise the core presence of EQT Corp. from 105,000 net acres to 616,000 net acres. Additionally, undeveloped areas will increase to 3,680 from 630.However, the persistently low commodity prices have been affecting the business of upstream energy players like Abraxas Petroleum Corporation (AXAS  -  Free Report)	 and Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report)	. The same risk is applicable to the upstream business of the company.Moreover, in the last one year, the firm has underperformed the Zacks categorized Oil & Gas-U.S Exploration & Production industry. During the aforesaid period, EQT Corp.’s stock lost 32.2%, wider than the broader industry’s decline of 23.4%.Also, as of Feb 8, 2017, Moody’s Investors Services has rated the long-term debt of EQT Corp. as “Baa3” and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service (S&P) rated the same as “BBB”. It is to be noted that “Baa3” is the lowest grade investment rating of Moody’s while “BBB” is among the lower investment grade ratings. If there is further downgrade of ratings following weak oil and gas prices it will be difficult for the company to raise capital on favorable terms for financing growth projects.The Best & Worst of ZacksToday you are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" free of charge.

Corporate Profile
Not every company can say it mixes the experience and strength of an organization that has been in the natural gas industry for nearly 130 years with the attitude and innovation of a startup, but EQT does just that. Through our production activities, EQT has developed smarter and cleaner drilling technologies, enabling us to become one of the country’s largest natural gas producers. Operating in six states, we are a technology-driven leader in the use of horizontal drilling and green completions.Through our midstream operations, we are fulfilling a need for safer, more technologically-advanced energy infrastructure by building and operating new pipelines, and storage facilities.     We are committed to meeting the country’s growing demand for clean energy, while continuing to promote safety, provide a rewarding workplace, and enrich the communities where our employees live and work. EQT stands out from the pack with its vision, innovation, sound business practices, and environmental conscientiousness.
