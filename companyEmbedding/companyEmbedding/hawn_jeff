Insurance technology company Vertafore announced that Jeff Hawn has been named chairman and chief executive officer, effective April 13.
Bryan Taylor, capital partner and lead director at TPG Capital, said Hawn was chosen after a “rigorous” selection process. “He has built a tremendous track record of generating shareholder value by empowering his teams to innovate and deliver breakthrough solutions, all with a relentless focus on the needs of the customer,” Taylor said.

No. 9 private company: The Attachmate Group

Back to Gallery
















With 65,000 corporate and government enterprise software customers worldwide — including a big presence in Asia, Latin America and Europe - The Attachmate Group is not dependent on just the domestic economy.
"Nearly half of our revenues come from outside the U.S.," said Jeff Hawn, Attachmate's chairman and CEO. "That puts us in a position of being a function of the global economy. That tends to help balance things out for us."



Attachmate Group's $1.2 billion in annual revenue last year secured it a top 10 spot on the Chronicle's private company list.
New products pay off

Earlier investments in new products reaped rewards last year. One example was a product to automate customers' information technology processes. The company started developing it in 2008 and carried on through 2009. It reaped dividends in 2010, as did other product investments.
"The big challenge was to have the determination to continue to invest in things customers care about," Hawn said. "Fortunately we did and saw those new investments make a difference for us in 2010, financially and in how our customers think about us."
Attachmate's clients are large organizations. Its enterprise software runs information technology services such as network operating systems, better access to data, security, corporate email, Internet and other processes.
In April this year, Attachmate Group completed a $2.2 billion acquisition of Novell and its products to help businesses manage computing services. At that point, Attachmate Group - new to Chronicle's private company list - designated Houston as its headquarters.
The company consists of four business units: Novell, SUSE, Attachmate and NetIQ. From a product and sales standpoint they run mostly independently of each other as customers are likely to see them as individual entities, not part of a business group, Hawn said. Elements of the company have been around for 30 years, with two units tracing their roots to the early 1980s, and two to the 1990s.
In hiring mode
Attachmate Group has about 4,000 employees worldwide, with about 300 based in Houston. It is currently hiring, part of what Hawn calls a "constant mode" of adding resources.
Hawn is clearly optimistic about where Attachmate Group is headed, but as someone who grew up in Houston's petroleum culture and saw the downturn in the 1980s, then saw what happened across the economy in 2007-08, he prefers to keep his forecasting cautious.
"I sleep with one eye open about economic conditions," he said. "We don't need a boom, we just want stability. Our key is we keep it simple." We focus on great products, service and support and making sure customers see us as easy to do business with."

History[edit]
Attachmate Corporation[edit]
Attachmate, founded in 1982 by Frank W. Pritt and Julia Pritt focused initially on the IBM terminal emulation market, and became a major technology employer in the Seattle area. Based in Bellevue, Washington, the company became one of the largest PC software companies in the world, with offices in more than 50 cities in North America and in 30 countries. The company made several acquisitions, through mergers and purchases, to expand its range of host access hardware and software solutions.
Attachmate served 80% of Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies, with over 13 million users worldwide. Attachmate's major development locations included their headquarters in Bellevue, an office in Bellingham, Washington, and a facility in Cincinnati, Ohio. In the early days, Attachmate focused on 3270 emulation for PCs with some hardware 3270 boards as well. Attachmate invested heavily in its sales and marketing organization worldwide in the early 1990s and quickly grew its market share from 3rd in the host-connectivity market to 1st with its EXTRA! Personal Client product. The company continued to grow organically as well as through acquisition of KEA Systems (makers of KEAterm VT340 and VT420 terminal emulators, and KEA X x terminal software), and DCA (makers of IRMA line of emulators, INFOconnect, Crosstalk communications software, and OpenMind collaborative software). Later, the company also acquired The Wollongong Group (makers of Pathway TCP and Emissary).
After the acquisition of DCA, the company quickly dominated the 3270, 5250 and VT marketplace, and built its revenues in excess of $400 million in 1995 - as compared to roughly $40M just five years earlier. A Senior Management transition led by incoming CEO Jim Lindner made an attempt to create a unified product strategy and take the company public. The strategy received positive reviews from customers and the press initially but eventually stalled as a clash between Pre and Post DCA-merger management destabilized product development and Frank Pritt took back the helm in July 1996.[1][2]
Bill Boisvert, formerly of Paccar, was the next president from January 1998[3] until his resignation in October 2000 after a year of layoffs and flat revenues.[4]
The next stage of its history was marked by tight fiscal management and managing to the bottom line. As revenues were impacted through the bursting tech bubble after 2001, Attachmate was hit with successive rounds of layoffs. In 2001, the Burnaby development center was closed; in June 2002 the Cincinnati development center was closed and the company's VP of Development was fired.[5]
On April 18, 2005, it was announced that three investment companies, Golden Gate Capital, Francisco Partners, and Thoma Cressey Equity Partners, would buy Attachmate. Attachmate would be merged with long-time competitor WRQ, whom the investors had bought previously.[6]
Attachmate no longer sells or supports 3270 IRMA, SDLC, or ISCA SDLC hardware adapters, or provides driver downloads. In February 2007, they sold their remaining hardware inventory to Alpine Computer Systems, a legacy equipment reseller, and refers customers to them for sales and service on hardware adapters and drivers.

In 1981, Doug Walker, Mike Richer and Marty Quinn founded Walker, Richer & Quinn (WRQ) to integrate microcomputers with existing IT environments. The company set its sights on the Hewlett-Packard market, launching the first commercially viable terminal emulator for the HP 3000. Based in Seattle, Washington, WRQ was one of the 20 largest software companies, and consistently ranked in Fortune magazine’s “100 Best companies to Work for in America,” and Washington CEO magazine’s “Best Companies to Work For.”[when?]. Two companies, Express Metrix and NetMotion Wireless, were spun off by WRQ in 2000 and 2001, respectively, and are operating successfully today.
On 6 December 6, 2004 it was announced that WRQ had been purchased by an investment group consisting of Francisco Partners, Golden Gate Capital and Thoma Cressey Equity Partners.
Attachmate and WRQ merger[edit]
The same investment group proceeded to buy Attachmate as well. The agreement for the sale was made on 18 April 2005.[7] WRQ and Attachmate had been long-time competitors in the host emulation business when it was announced that the companies would be merged. The merger was completed on 3 October 2005 and the new company was named AttachmateWRQ.[8]
In June 2005, shortly after the merger was made official, AttachmateWRQ announced that its corporate headquarters would be located in WRQ's Seattle, Washington location. The vacated headquarters of Attachmate in the Factoria neighborhood of Bellevue, Washington were quickly filled by T-Mobile, who already occupied part of the building.
The company continued to support both Attachmate and WRQ product sets (which overlap in many cases) until products could be merged or replaced.
NetIQ acquisition[edit]
NetIQ, founded in 1995 by Ching-Fa Hwang, Her-daw Che, Hon Wong, Ken Prayoon Cheng and Thomas R. Kemp, was a company that provided systems management and security management software. It provided businesses worldwide with solutions to monitor, analyze, and optimize the performance, availability, and security of IT infrastructure. Its flagship products included AppManager and Security Manager. The company headquarters were in San Jose, California, with about 900 employees worldwide. Their Nasdaq ticker symbol was NTIQ.
NetIQ's toolset included systems, security, VoIP and Administration software.
On April 27, 2006, AttachmateWRQ announced an agreement to acquire NetIQ for about 495 million USD, and that the deal would close in 90 days.[9] NetIQ would be merged into AttachmateWRQ, creating a single company with $400 million annual revenue and over 40,000 customers in 60 countries. On June 20, they announced that NetIQ shareholders had approved this purchase, and the acquisition would be complete by the end of that month.[10]
On July 5, 2006, both companies released a press release announcing the closing of the deal. The new company would do business under the name Attachmate Corporation.[11]
OnDemand acquisition and sale[edit]
On March 7, 2006, AttachmateWRQ announced that they had acquired OnDemand Software.[12] OnDemand Software develops an award-winning product called WinINSTALL, which is for desktop management in IT environments. This product is similar to AttachmateWRQ's existing NetWizard product.
On June 30, 2008, Scalable Software announced in a press release that they had acquired the WinINSTALL business unit (substantially all assets of the former OnDemand) from Attachmate.[13]
Novell acquisition[edit]
Novell announced in November 2010 that it had agreed to be acquired by Attachmate for $2.2 billion.
On April 27, 2011, The Attachmate Group announced the completion of the acquisition of Novell, Inc., a leader in intelligent workload management, under the terms of the definitive agreement disclosed on November 22, 2010.[14]
On May 2, 2011, immediately following the sale, Attachmate laid off hundreds of Novell employees.[15]
Novell now operates as two separate business units under the Novell and SUSE brand names and joins Attachmate and NetIQ as holdings of The Attachmate Group. Certain intellectual property assets are planned to be sold to CPTN Holdings, a consortium of companies led by Microsoft.[16]
Acquisition by Micro Focus[edit]
On 15 September 2014, the British firm Micro Focus International announced that it would acquire the Attachmate Group for US$1.2 billion in shares.[17][18]

We provide a lot of sensitive information that can be used to satisfy your curiosity, protect your family, and find the truth about the people in your life. You may not use our service or the information it provides to make decisions about consumer credit, employers, insurance, tenant screening, or any other purposes that would require FCRA compliance.
