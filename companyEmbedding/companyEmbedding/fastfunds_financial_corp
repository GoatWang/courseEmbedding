    Investment Highlights  Building a Portfolio of Strong, Revenue-Generating Subsidiaries 	Diversified Business Verticals in Rapidly Growing Markets 	Positioned in Cannabis, Financial Services, Plant Botany & More 	Established Distribution Agreement Solidifies Industry Foothold     FINANCIAL SERVICES FFFC's entry into the financial services sector came with the 2014 acquisition of 49% of Cannabis Merchant Financial Solutions, Inc. (CMFS). This FFFC subsidiary has developed the Green Card and Tommy Chong Green Card, a reloadable stored value card with a rewards feature, and the Tommy Chong Frequent Buyers Card. Functions as a gift card or rewards card. It is significant to note that both the reloadable stored value cards and gift cards are multi-billion businesses in other business verticals. In November 2014, FFFC signed a license agreement with celebrity actor, activist, writer and musician Tommy Chong as representative and spokesman for its flagship card products. The company believes the Tommy Chong celebrity status as supported by his over 4.5 million social media followers will be an important products differentiator as it advances its business plan in this vertical. To date FFFC is developing a national group of master resellers, distributors and sales representatives for these card products. This undertaking is continuing. FFFC has already signed a number of merchants and vendors for these products during this pre-launch period. An early fall social media launch is being planned, ahead of the forthcoming 2016 presidential elections which many forecasters are predicting further legalization approvals. Significant key manpower resources are being identified as well as selection of the lead social media development entity.    METHODS FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN PLANT BOTANY  Development of methods and technologies to significantly enhance plant growth and purity will be in great demand as the cannabis industry develops. Improvements in plant botany is a multi-billion sector of the agricultural industry today, especially in the food sector. In May 2015, FFFC signed an operating agreement with Wisconsin-based Sanidor Systems to create Pure Grow Systems, LLC. Under the terms of the agreement, FFFC acquired 49% interest in Pure Grow and participation in 50% of the profits. Pure Grow's mission is dedicated to the healthy production and processing of raw materials used for medicinal or other health related purposes. One of the products in the Pure Grow System's line provides technology in potentially clean, sanitize and disinfect the processing environments of plants and herbs used in the formulation of alternative botanical and herbal therapies. The Pure Grow management team has a long history in the development of herbal and medicinal products. They have an understanding of the need for cleaner and safer ingredients for medical products.    SECURITY SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT Without the ability to deposit cash in banks, the marijuana industry is essentially a cash-only business. Abundance of cash, combined with high products sales operating margins makes the cannabis business a target for criminal activities. The security industry in the U.S. is estimated to exceed $300 billion dollars. FFFC's plan is to enter this potentially lucrative market through our acquisition of an existing, operational security company. In mid-2014, FFFC acquired a 70% interest in Canton, Ohio-based Brawnstone Security, Inc., a diversified security, training and investigations company. Brawnstone presently services 15 clients and has a staff of 33 professionals. It is equipped for installation of business security systems, intrusion devices and technology based solutions. FFFC has devoted significant resources in restructuring the Brawnstone balance sheet and restoring higher margins by increasing the company's operating efficiency. These initiatives have borne fruit at the present time: Brawnstone has an annual revenue run rate of $750,000. FFFC's strategy is to use the Brawnstone platform to enter the cannabis market plan in late 2015 or early 2016. The company's research shows that operating margins for cannabis-related security services could exceed current billing levels by at least 100%.  Distribution Partnership  FFFC's Pure Grow Systems has established a distribution agreement with Pazoo, Inc. (OTC: PZOO) in which Pazoo has the right to distribute the Pure Grow Systems product line to cannabis-related companies in select states in the United States. Pazoo is focused on providing best-in-class laboratory testing of cannabis and cannabinoids to protect consumers from impurities, contaminants and other irregularities. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Harris Lee, and its partnership with MA & Associates, Pazoo provides industry-leading laboratory testing of cannabis. Pazoo's subsidiaries are currently licensed to test cannabis in Nevada, Oregon and Colorado, with other states to come. Additionally, Pazoo delivers a comprehensive array of health and wellness information on its website www.pazoo.com. The agreement between Pazoo and Pure Grow centers around the distribution of Pure Grow's new, state-of-the-art sanitizing and disinfection systems. Specifically designed to optimize the yields of medicinal plant cultivators by delivering 99.99% coverage with a 99.99% kill ratio for bacteria, viruses, mold and other pests that often plague these operations. The technology is highly efficient and uses 100% biodegradeable actives which provide far superior outcomes while cutting labor costs from hours to minutes. This system will reduce the cost of sanitizing a facility by at least 70%. The effectiveness of this product along, along with Pazoo's growing laboratory presence, provides the opportunity to set a high-standard for the purity of medicinal cannabis as the industry matures.  Molds, mildews, and harmful bacteria are the most common environmental toxins found in botanical and horticultural growing operations. Left unchecked, these naturally occurring contaminants can infect the leaves and buds of the plants. In the few states that mandate testing, mold, mildew, salmonella, and e-coli have caused the destruction of thousands of pounds of cannabis. Pure Grow System's products kills mold, mildew, harmful bacteria and other viruses to eradicate them in the grow rooms.  Cleaner rooms mean cleaner plants. Pure Grow Systems, LLC, is poised to launch its website along with its first product line in the early part of August.  CANNABIS ANGEL INC.  FFFC's wholly owned subsidiary, Cannabis Angel, Inc. (CA) will evaluate and provide corporate development services and early seed financing for worthwhile development stage cannabis ventures. CA's mission is to incubate these enterprises for their progress to the next level of growth. To date, CA has made investments in companies involved in the distribution of cannabis related products and development of a social media website. It is significant to point out that all of FFFCs activities in the cannabis industry are ancillary, or pick and shovel, and are evaluated to insure compliance with all State and Federal Laws.  The Company's strategy is to seek potential growth opportunities, develop and incubate them, and seek industry partners for the commercialization phase.  These affiliations may take the form of partnerships, joint ventures or spin-offs.                FastFunds Financial Corp.  319 Clematis Street, Suite 400 West Palm Beach, FL 33401 Phone: (516) 514-9042 www.FastFundsFinancial.com  info@fastfundsfinancial.com                                                                             Press Releases & Company Updates                                                                         Click here for the Yahoo Finance Tommy Chong interview  October 11, 2016  FastFunds Financial Announces Overview of New Tommy Chong Affinity Program WEST PALM BEACH, FL / ACCESSWIRE / October 11, 2016 / FastFunds Financial Corporation (FFFC) (the "Company" or "FastFunds") announced today it is completing all of the necessary actions to launch the first known national loyalty program targeting the MMJ industry. eNcentive Concepts will be partners with Tommy Chong in this endeavor, which will be titled the "Affinity Connextions" Program.
