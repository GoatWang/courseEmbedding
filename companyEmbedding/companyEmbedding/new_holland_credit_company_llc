What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order.

Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

WHY MONITOR YOUR EXPERIAN BUSINESS CREDIT REPORT?


Business credit reports form the basis for decisions other businesses make about you. 
By using a convenient, online
 business credit reporting service from Experian,
you can make sure that data in your business credit report is accurate, which will enable the following financial decisions:




How much business credit a supplier will extend to you
What interest rates you will pay
How much money lending institutions will loan you
How your customers view you
What your insurance premiums will be
The level of potential investor interest








WHY EVALUATE OTHER COMPANIES' BUSINESS CREDIT REPORTS?

Many experienced and successful entrepreneurs all agree that success is in the details. By utilizing an objective
 business credit reporting service from Experian to monitor a partner or supplier's company credit report, you can discover the following in advance: 




The status of prospective customers' payment practices
Existing clients' business conditions
Suppliers' historical relationships with others
Notifications about changes to suppliers' or customers' business credit reports
What your competitors are doing
Other financially pertinent details




Having immediate access to such data can mean the difference between your profit
and loss — your success and failure.

BUSINESS CREDIT REPORT AND SCORE


A good business credit report and score are essential for getting the money you need to successfully run and grow your business.
A good credit score can save you money with lower interest rates, provide business credit without the need for a personal guarantee, and improve
the overall image of your company.

Business credit reports can also serve a vital role in managing credit risk with companies that you deal with.

The information in Experian's business credit reports is continually updated, always accessible and includes:
Experian credit ranking score and credit summary, Key facts about the business, Corporate registration and contact information, Key personnel, and a lot more.

Experian's Business Information Services is a leader in providing data and predictive insights to organizations, 
helping them mitigate risk and improve profitability. The company's business database provides comprehensive, 
third-party-verified information on 99.9 percent of all U.S. companies, with the industry’s most extensive data 
on the broad spectrum of small and midsize businesses.

Enrollment in Experian's Business Credit Advantage unlimited access
and monitoring service is the best way to manage and grow your business credit.
Unlimited access to your business credit report gives you the tools you need
to manage and grow your credit score.  And, automatic email alerts provide you
the monitoring tools to watch your credit file for any inquires or derogatory
filings.  

Enroll in Business Credit Monitoring today!


















WHY MONITOR YOUR EXPERIAN BUSINESS CREDIT REPORT?


Business credit reports form the basis for decisions other businesses make about you. 
By using a convenient, online
 business credit reporting service from Experian,
you can make sure that data in your business credit report is accurate, which will enable the following financial decisions:




How much business credit a supplier will extend to you
What interest rates you will pay
How much money lending institutions will loan you
How your customers view you
What your insurance premiums will be
The level of potential investor interest








WHY EVALUATE OTHER COMPANIES' BUSINESS CREDIT REPORTS?

Many experienced and successful entrepreneurs all agree that success is in the details. By utilizing an objective
 business credit reporting service from Experian to monitor a partner or supplier's company credit report, you can discover the following in advance: 




The status of prospective customers' payment practices
Existing clients' business conditions
Suppliers' historical relationships with others
Notifications about changes to suppliers' or customers' business credit reports
What your competitors are doing
Other financially pertinent details




Having immediate access to such data can mean the difference between your profit
and loss — your success and failure.





TIP OF THE WEEK


BOOST YOUR BUSINESS - LEARN HOW BUILDING SMART BUSINESS CREDIT CAN HELP YOU TODAY

Your business's credit score is one of the first things lenders, suppliers and even some customers look at before deciding to do business with you.

Increasing your score can:
• Make it easier for you to get loans and lines of credit
• Improve your credit terms
• Lower your interest rates and insurance premiums
• Boost investor interest in your business

However, before you can start improving your business credit score, you have to know what it is -- and what's in your company credit profile. That's where Business Credit AdvantageSM can help. It gives you unlimited access to your business's credit report and score so you'll always know what's in your company credit profile and be able to make it work to your advantage.

You'll also receive daily monitoring of your business credit score and automatic email notification of changes, so you can easily manage your business credit -- and begin taking steps to improve it.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

BUSINESS CREDIT REPORT AND SCORE


A good business credit report and score are essential for getting the money you need to successfully run and grow your business.
A good credit score can save you money with lower interest rates, provide business credit without the need for a personal guarantee, and improve
the overall image of your company.

Business credit reports can also serve a vital role in managing credit risk with companies that you deal with.

The information in Experian's business credit reports is continually updated, always accessible and includes:
Experian credit ranking score and credit summary, Key facts about the business, Corporate registration and contact information, Key personnel, and a lot more.

Experian's Business Information Services is a leader in providing data and predictive insights to organizations, 
helping them mitigate risk and improve profitability. The company's business database provides comprehensive, 
third-party-verified information on 99.9 percent of all U.S. companies, with the industry’s most extensive data 
on the broad spectrum of small and midsize businesses.

Enrollment in Experian's Business Credit Advantage unlimited access
and monitoring service is the best way to manage and grow your business credit.
Unlimited access to your business credit report gives you the tools you need
to manage and grow your credit score.  And, automatic email alerts provide you

filings.  

Enroll in Business Credit Monitoring today!


















WHY MONITOR YOUR EXPERIAN BUSINESS CREDIT REPORT?


Business credit reports form the basis for decisions other businesses make about you. 
By using a convenient, online
 business credit reporting service from Experian,
you can make sure that data in your business credit report is accurate, which will enable the following financial decisions:




How much business credit a supplier will extend to you
What interest rates you will pay
How much money lending institutions will loan you
How your customers view you
What your insurance premiums will be
The level of potential investor interest








WHY EVALUATE OTHER COMPANIES' BUSINESS CREDIT REPORTS?

Many experienced and successful entrepreneurs all agree that success is in the details. By utilizing an objective
 business credit reporting service from Experian to monitor a partner or supplier's company credit report, you can discover the following in advance: 




The status of prospective customers' payment practices
Existing clients' business conditions
Suppliers' historical relationships with others
Notifications about changes to suppliers' or customers' business credit reports
What your competitors are doing
Other financially pertinent details




Having immediate access to such data can mean the difference between your profit
and loss — your success and failure.





TIP OF THE WEEK

WHY MONITOR YOUR EXPERIAN BUSINESS CREDIT REPORT?


Business credit reports form the basis for decisions other businesses make about you. 
By using a convenient, online
 business credit reporting service from Experian,
you can make sure that data in your business credit report is accurate, which will enable the following financial decisions:




How much business credit a supplier will extend to you
What interest rates you will pay
How much money lending institutions will loan you
How your customers view you
What your insurance premiums will be
The level of potential investor interest








WHY EVALUATE OTHER COMPANIES' BUSINESS CREDIT REPORTS?

Many experienced and successful entrepreneurs all agree that success is in the details. By utilizing an objective
 business credit reporting service from Experian to monitor a partner or supplier's company credit report, you can discover the following in advance: 




The status of prospective customers' payment practices
Existing clients' business conditions
Suppliers' historical relationships with others
Notifications about changes to suppliers' or customers' business credit reports
What your competitors are doing
Other financially pertinent details




Having immediate access to such data can mean the difference between your profit
and loss — your success and failure.





TIP OF THE WEEK


BOOST YOUR BUSINESS - LEARN HOW BUILDING SMART BUSINESS CREDIT CAN HELP YOU TODAY

Your business's credit score is one of the first things lenders, suppliers and even some customers look at before deciding to do business with you.

Increasing your score can:
• Make it easier for you to get loans and lines of credit
• Improve your credit terms
• Lower your interest rates and insurance premiums
• Boost investor interest in your business

However, before you can start improving your business credit score, you have to know what it is -- and what's in your company credit profile. That's where Business Credit AdvantageSM can help. It gives you unlimited access to your business's credit report and score so you'll always know what's in your company credit profile and be able to make it work to your advantage.

You'll also receive daily monitoring of your business credit score and automatic email notification of changes, so you can easily manage your business credit -- and begin taking steps to improve it.

CREDIT SCORE RATINGS
POOR (300-561)
Nearly 15% of the U.S. population has a credit score of 561 or less. A Poor score makes it difficult for you to qualify for the best interest rates on loans, and lenders may require you to have a cosigner and/or a significant down payment.



CREDIT SCORE RATINGS
FAIR (562-665)
For many lenders, Fair is viewed as an "average" credit score. You are not likely to be offered the best interest rates on loans or credit cards, but the terms in most cases will be better than for those with Poor scores.



CREDIT SCORE RATINGS
GOOD (666-754)
Good scores get better lending rates. This range typically indicates you are effectively managing your finances, and you are likely to be offered better interest rates on loans or credit cards.



CREDIT SCORE RATINGS
GREAT (755-850)
You're in the top range! This means you're a very low-risk borrower and have done a superb job of managing your finances. You'll most likely get the very best interest rates on loans or credit cards.








Why do I need to check my Credit Scores?
Good credit scores are your passport to competitive interest rates for mortgages, cars, credit card offers, insurance premiums, and more.  Strong scores are worth money because they save you in excess costs.









Credit FAQs

How can I reach customer care?

							Customer Care is available toll-free seven days a week at1-800-972-7204.
						
What should I watch for in my credit reports?

							In addition to confirming your basic information, such as your name, address, and social security number, also watch for errors and signs of fraud:
							
New accounts that you do not recall opening
Derogatory information that is not up to date, such as loan payment history (note that bankruptcies stay on your credit file for several years)
Derogatory information that is incorrect, including missed payments, collection actions, eviction, or repossessions
Excessive inquiries into your file

Why is it important to check my credit reports?

							It's wise to check your credit reports frequently for signs of fraud. If someone obtains your social security number, only a few additional pieces of information are necessary to perpetrate fraud in your name. Common types of identity theft include fraudulent bank accounts, credit cards, utilities, and loans. According to the FTC, victims of identity theft spend an average of 175 hours and $800 to clear their names. Early detection is the key to avoid suffering long-term financial consequences.
						
How many credit reports do I have?

							Most consumers have three credit reports in their name – one from each credit reporting agency (TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian). ScoreSense provides you access to the information that all three credit reporting agencies keep on file for you. You can refresh your credit reports and scores with ScoreSense every month.
						
Why are my credit scores so important?

							Your credit scores are used by lenders to represent your overall level of credit risk. They are essentially numerical summaries of the information in your credit reports. The higher your scores, the better your credit, and the more likely lenders will be to give you a favorable interest rate on a loan. Each of the three major credit bureaus has its own method for determining a credit score, but they are essentially equivalent.
						
How high or low can my credit scores be?

							Credit scores range from 300 to 850 – the higher your scores, the more favorable interest rates you will receive on a loan.
						
Will checking my credit reports adversely affect my credit?

							Requesting your own credit reports will not affect your credit rating. On the other hand, inquiries such as mortgage, loan, and credit card applications will affect your scores if several of these inquiries occur over a relatively short time frame. Some studies have indicated that this suggests you may be a higher credit risk.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
