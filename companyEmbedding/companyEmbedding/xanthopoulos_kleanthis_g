LA JOLLA, Calif., June 1, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Regulus Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:  RGLS), a biopharmaceutical company leading the discovery and development of innovative medicines targeting microRNAs, announced today that Kleanthis G. Xanthopoulos, Ph.D. has resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of Regulus' Board of Directors, effective today, to pursue investment opportunities in the biotechnology industry.  Paul Grint, M.D., who previously served as Chief Medical Officer of Regulus, has been appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of Regulus' Board of Directors effective today.  In addition, Neil W. Gibson, Ph.D., who has served as Chief Scientific Officer, will continue through June 30, 2015 at the company as President's Fellow to assist Dr. Grint in assembling a new leadership team.  
"I am extremely proud of our achievements at Regulus and am excited about the future of the company and microRNA therapeutics as they become a new and major class of drugs.  RG-101, our GalNAc-conjugated anti-miR-122, is moving rapidly into Phase II and our 'Clinical Map Initiative' strategy is on track to create multiple clinical programs," said Kleanthis G. Xanthopoulos, Ph.D. "Paul shares a common vision to continue to build a leading biopharmaceutical company based on our innovative microRNA platform across multiple therapeutic areas.  I am truly honored to have been a part of building this great company."  
"Under Kleanthis' leadership, Regulus has grown from a small, private company to a rapidly maturing, publicly traded biopharmaceutical company with an exciting technology platform, multiple strategic alliances and collaborations with leading large pharmaceutical companies, and a robust microRNA therapeutics pipeline," said Stelios Papadopoulos, Ph.D., Chairman of the Board of Directors of Regulus.  "We thank Kleanthis for his contributions over the last seven years - his passion for building the company and dedication to discovering and developing therapeutics for patients in need have benefited Regulus greatly."  
Dr. Papadopoulos continued, "We are pleased to appoint Paul as President and Chief Executive Officer and believe that he is perfectly positioned to lead the company.  He has over two decades of executive level experience in drug development and is a recognized leader in our industry.  In particular, his appointment is important at this time as the company increases its investment and focus on RG-101."  
Dr. Grint also commented, "I am honored for the opportunity to lead this great company and particularly excited about entering into multiple Phase II studies for RG-101, with critical four-week combination data coming by year-end.  In addition, we remain focused on the advancement of the overall portfolio and have many key catalysts on the horizon.  In the near term, we expect to initiate our first-in-human clinical study of RG-012, our anti-miR-21 for the treatment of Alport syndrome, and we are aggressively pursuing additional attractive microRNA targets to expand our leadership in the field."  
About Regulus
Regulus Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:  RGLS) is a biopharmaceutical company leading the discovery and development of innovative medicines targeting microRNAs.  Regulus has leveraged its oligonucleotide drug discovery and development expertise to develop a well-balanced microRNA therapeutics pipeline complemented by a maturing microMarkersSM biomarkers platform and a rich intellectual property estate to retain its domain dominant leadership in the microRNA field.  Under its 'Clinical Map Initiative', Regulus is developing RG-101, a GalNAc-conjugated anti-miR targeting microRNA-122 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection, and RG-012, an anti-miR targeting microRNA-21 for the treatment of Alport syndrome, a life-threatening kidney disease driven by genetic mutations with no approved therapy. In addition, RG-125, a GalNAc-conjugated anti-miR targeting microRNA-103/107 for the treatment of NASH in patients with type 2 diabetes/pre-diabetes, has been selected for clinical development.  Regulus is also advancing several programs toward clinical development in orphan disease indications, oncology and fibrosis.  Regulus' commitment to innovation has resulted in multiple peer-reviewed publications in notable scientific journals and has resulted in the formation of strategic alliances with AstraZeneca and Sanofi and a research collaboration with Biogen focused on microRNA biomarkers.  Regulus maintains its corporate headquarters in La Jolla, CA.  For more information, please visit http://www.regulusrx.com.

"He will continue to have an integral role in the setting of Anadys' strategic direction as a member of our board. The end of the year is the right time for him to make the move given the Company's strong position. In his new role he will be able to share his visionary thinking and operations expertise with other entrepreneurs in the life sciences industry. Although we will miss his inspirational leadership at Anadys, we are happy to see him continuing to contribute as a board member."

Dr. Xanthopoulos commented: "I am proud of our accomplishments at Anadys and excited about our current clinical programs and deep pipeline. I am also excited about continuing to help shape Anadys from a position on the board as well as in having the opportunity to provide other entrepreneurs with counsel in my future role in venture capital. Steve and the other members of our team share a common vision in building a leading pharmaceutical franchise with a focus on antivirals and cancer drugs. I am honored to be part of that."

New Position -- President, Pharmaceuticals

In his new position, Dr. Worland will lead all of Anadys' strategic planning, corporate development and research & development efforts. He has been involved with the development and implementation of the company's strategic plan since joining Anadys in 2001 as Chief Scientific Officer. Dr. Worland was promoted to Executive Vice President, Head of Research and Development, in October 2004. In December 2005 he was named Executive Vice President, Pharmaceuticals.
