Home of the Secret Society of Smoked Mullet, what?


                    
                    Englewood is a shared community, shared by Charlotte County and Sarasota County in Florida.   This picturesque little town is the gateway to Charlotte Counties beautiful...

                    Englewood is a shared community, shared by Charlotte County and Sarasota County in Florida.   This picturesque little town is the gateway to Charlotte Counties beautiful pristine Beaches on the Gulf of Mexico. You have not lived until you jump into the beautiful green/blue water of the Gulf and watch dolphins, manatees and even manta rays swimming by you  (Don't touch them please, our nature friends are very sensitive)   The string of beaches include Stump Pass Beach, Englewood Beach,  Blind Pass--to us locals, that would be middle beach--and Manasota Beach.   I think Dr. Beach has never named any of our beaches on the top ten list, because he wants to keep them a secret to himself!!!  Who knows, I could be right about that!   

Oh, by the way, The Secret Society of The Smoked Mullets was started in 1996 when Englewood Florida Chamber President Nita Edmondson (Cole) was looking for a special recognition award for those in the Englewood community who had contributed to the area's successes, but may never have been recognized.  The name originated from Englewood's famous dish: the smoked mullet. Historical tales say when the mullet ran in Lemon Bay in the early days, they literally jumped into the rowboats, and "got tangled up in the ladies petticoats."  Anyone can be nominated, but past generations are given priority. Only the past winners can bring the names to the nomination meeting, and vote for the winners.  It's a lifetime honor to be chosen. Membership does not expire. (source, Englewood Chamber of Commerce)

                    Englewood still has the old Florida charm.  I love the drive down North Beach Road on Manasota Key.  Check out the shops on Dearborn Street and then watch the sun go down from the Lock & Key across from Chadwick Park on Englewood Beach.  I always feel relaxed in this coastal town.

                    Mabank was founded in 1846 by Lorenzo D. Stover. Other settler soon arrived and among them was John R. Jones, a merchant who named the community Lawn City after a popular cotton dress material he sold.  The town's name was changed to Lawndale when the post office cam in 1887. In 1900 because the Southern Pacific Railroad went around Lawndale.  Seeing the potential of the railroad, G. W. Mason and Thomas Eubank set aside one-square-mile area of their ranch and called it Mabank.  The rest his history (see www.CityofMabank.org for more details). The down town area has that historic persona with a real down town area. The Mabank Independent School District, which serves Mabank and Gun Barrel City, has very good educational ratings (see www.mabankisd.net).
