What is Web hosting?



                                    Web hosting is the technology that puts your website online. It is one of the
                                    three essential components of establishing your Web presence: a domain
                                    name (Web address), a website and a Web host. Your domain name tells
                                    people where to find you, your website is viewed by your visitors, and hosting
                                    makes your site part of the Internet. Quite simply, the definition of Web hosting
                                    is an online storage service for any content displayed or accessed through
                                    your website. Common examples of stored information include images, video,
                                    or design templates.
Learn why Web Hosting at Web.com is a good choice




How do I know which Web hosting package is best for me?

                                        biggest differentiators between hosting packages are the size of disk space, monthly data transfer, number of emailboxes 
                                        and tools such as open source applications and programming languages. After you determine how you plan to use your site and the amount of traffic you expect on your site, you'll be able to identify which package is best for your business.

FAQs


What is Web hosting?



                                    Web hosting is the technology that puts your website online. It is one of the
                                    three essential components of establishing your Web presence: a domain
                                    name (Web address), a website and a Web host. Your domain name tells
                                    people where to find you, your website is viewed by your visitors, and hosting
                                    makes your site part of the Internet. Quite simply, the definition of Web hosting
                                    is an online storage service for any content displayed or accessed through
                                    your website. Common examples of stored information include images, video,
                                    or design templates.
Learn why Web Hosting at Web.com is a good choice




How do I know which Web hosting package is best for me?


In order to choose a hosting package that will fit your needs, begin by thinking about the goals of your business. The 
                                        biggest differentiators between hosting packages are the size of disk space, monthly data transfer, number of emailboxes 
                                        and tools such as open source applications and programming languages. After you determine how you plan to use your site and the amount of traffic you expect on your site, you'll be able to identify which package is best for your business.
Essential Web Hosting
package is designed for small business owners who want a simple online presence. Websites with this package might include basic content with limited multimedia and blog usage. Interaction with customers occurs mainly through easy forms or a simple blog.
Professional Web Hosting
package is designed for small- to medium- sized businesses whose websites contain sizable dynamic content, such as numerous multimedia files. Interaction with customers occurs through complex forms, robust blogs and frequent site visits.
Premium Web Hosting
package is designed for small-to medium-sized businesses that want to manage multiple large, high-traffic websites on a single platform. These websites would include multimedia files and various dynamic interactions with customers.



What are the differences between Web hosting companies?


Reliability and customer service are two key points to consider. Web.com offers 100% dedicated technical customer service, via phone or email.



How do I build a website myself using a website design template?


The website templates included in the Web.com Shared packages offer an inexpensive way to establish an Internet presence quickly. Our Website Builder Tool comes with a large variety of website design templates which can be easily customized to reflect your company's image and purpose.



Can I use Microsoft® Expression® Web, Dreamweaver® or other website design software packages?


Yes. Web.com packages come with file transfer (FTP) capabilities to allow you to upload website content, including complete website pages built with design software.






Improve Your Business With Dependable Web Hosting
Your business may have the most clickable domain name and the most user-friendly website, but only reliable, secure Web hosting ensures customers can find you and keep coming back for business. Careful consideration of a Web host is vital because:

Web hosting keeps your business online. A hosting service ensures websites are accessible on the World Wide Web. Without a host, your website will not appear to users who type in the Web address.
Secure Internet connections via Web hosts guarantee uptime.  A Web host’s data center provides Internet connectivity for your website, which makes it crucial to choose a Web host with strong, stable capabilities
A Web host can provide your business with other features that enhance websites.  Excellent Web hosting services don’t just guarantee your website is displayed — they also offer services to make the website-creation process less painless for your business and more appealing to your customers. These additional features include benefits such as free website creation, customizable features to add to your website, automatic data backup for your website, and FTP access.

“

I’ve been operating multiple websites since 2001 and have worked with dozens of web development teams. Vgroup is certainly one of the top teams I’ve worked with and are hands-down the best WebStore / Ecommerce developers. I demand great attention to detail on my projects and Vgroup’s highly skilled team went above and beyond my requirements.

Craig Romero

When Lush Décor moved over to the Shopify platform from the Amazon platform, we did it without the help of an IT department. We can’t say enough about how beneficial Vikas and the V Group have been to our business.

I would highly recommend V Group to any company that is transitioning to a Shopify web site. They are highly responsive and know how to get your site up and running in record time. Vikas and his team of coders are experienced and just need to be turned loose to get the job done.

Jon Bernstein

It was great working with V Group Inc in creating our own online e-commerce store. We needed to migrate our online store from a different platform to Shopify, and V Group made it a breeze for us. The transition was seamless and our new store on Shopify looked better than before! All thanks to V Group!

V Group did a great job helping us create our Shopify store. They were very professional and worked quickly to get our website functioning.

Style Scores:



A Value | C Growth | A Momentum | A VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

What is Web hosting?



                                    Web hosting is the technology that puts your website online. It is one of the
                                    three essential components of establishing your Web presence: a domain
                                    name (Web address), a website and a Web host. Your domain name tells
                                    people where to find you, your website is viewed by your visitors, and hosting
                                    makes your site part of the Internet. Quite simply, the definition of Web hosting
                                    is an online storage service for any content displayed or accessed through
                                    your website. Common examples of stored information include images, video,
                                    or design templates.

                                        and tools such as open source applications and programming languages. After you determine how you plan to use your site and the amount of traffic you expect on your site, you'll be able to identify which package is best for your business.

                                        and tools such as open source applications and programming languages. After you determine how you plan to use your site and the amount of traffic you expect on your site, you'll be able to identify which package is best for your business.

Improve Your Business With Dependable Web Hosting
Your business may have the most clickable domain name and the most user-friendly website, but only reliable, secure Web hosting ensures customers can find you and keep coming back for business. Careful consideration of a Web host is vital because:

Web hosting keeps your business online. A hosting service ensures websites are accessible on the World Wide Web. Without a host, your website will not appear to users who type in the Web address.
Secure Internet connections via Web hosts guarantee uptime.  A Web host’s data center provides Internet connectivity for your website, which makes it crucial to choose a Web host with strong, stable capabilities
A Web host can provide your business with other features that enhance websites.  Excellent Web hosting services don’t just guarantee your website is displayed — they also offer services to make the website-creation process less painless for your business and more appealing to your customers.
