Fitch Rates Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2015-4 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2015-4
    





August 26, 2015 04:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to the notes issued by 
      Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2015-4:
    

      --$203,400,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$188,760,000 class A-2-A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$188,760,000 class A-2-B notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$153,700,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$170,500,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$183,100,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$109,200,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$70,460,000 class E notes 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: The collateral backing 2015-4 is consistent 
      with that of 2015-3, with a weighted average (WA) FICO score of 600 and 
      an internal WA loss forecast score (LFS) of 555. The WA seasoning is 
      approximately two months, new vehicles total 38.5% and the pool is 
      geographically diverse.
    

      Increased Extended-Term Contracts: Loans with terms of 60+ months total 
      91.6%, with 73-75 month term loans totalling 16% in 2015-4. Fitch 
      applied a stress to the loss proxy to account for the risk posed by 
      these loans, since performance history is limited and the expectation is 
      that they will perform worse than loans with terms less than or equal to 
      72 months.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement and Structure: The cash flow distribution 
      is a sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) 
      totals 49.85% for the class A notes, consistent with the prior SDART 
      transaction, while excess spread totals 10.54%.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Although within range of 
      the 2010-2012 performance, recent 2013 - 2015 losses are tracking 
      slightly higher to date, driven by marginally weaker collateral 
      underwriting and lower recoveries from softer used vehicle values.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: SCUSA recorded solid financial results recently 
      and has been profitable since 2007. Fitch rates Santander, majority 
      owner of SCUSA, 'A-/F2'/Outlook Stable.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: SCUSA demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced 
      by historical portfolio and securitization performance. Fitch deems 
      SCUSA capable to service this series.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of SCUSA would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions 
      on the notes.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to Santander 
      Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2015-3 to increased credit losses over the 
      life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction 
      displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses. This 
      shows a potential downgrade of one or two categories under Fitch's 
      moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario, especially for the subordinate 
      bonds. The notes could experience downgrades of three or more rating 
      categories, potentially leading to distressed ratings (below 'Bsf') or 
      possibly default, under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 150 loans 
      from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its 
      analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on the analysis. A 
      copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link at the bottom of 
      this rating action commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in the reports titled 'Santander Drive Auto 
      Receivables Trust 2015-4 -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those 
      of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions' dated June 12, 2015.

Moody's Assigns Definitive Ratings To Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1 Asset Backed Notes

                            [Dow Jones & Company, Inc. · 2007-04-04] - The following is a press release  from Moody's Investors Service: Moody's Assigns Definitive Ratings To Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1 Asset Backed Notes $1.2 Billion of Asset-Backed Securities Rated.
                        

                            New York,  April 04, 2007 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned ratings to the  notes issued by Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1.
                        

                            This  is the first subprime auto loan securitization for 2007 and the first  public transaction for Drive Financial Services Inc. (successor to Drive Financial Services LP).
                        

                            The complete rating action is as follows:
                        


                                Issuer: Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1
                            

                                $204,000,000 5.324% Class A-1 Asset backed Notes, rated Prime-1
                            

                                $340,000,000 5.20% Class A-2 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $185,000,000 5.05% Class A-3 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $471,000,000 LIBOR + 0.05% Class A-4 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            


                            Moody's said the rating of Prime-1 for the Class A-1 notes is based primarily on the expected cashflows on the underlying receivables during the collection periods prior to the Class A-1 final maturity date, and partially on the financial guaranty insurance policy provided by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), whose insurance financial  strength rating is Aaa. The ratings of Aaa for the remaining classes of notes are based primarily on the FGIC policy. Moody's believes the risk  assumed by FGIC in insuring the notes is investment- grade at closing.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Affirms 7 Classes from Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2015-4HomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets close in 2 hrs 4 minsS&P 5002,469.96-5.46 (-0.22%)Dow 3021,806.68+10.13 (+0.05%)Nasdaq6,375.56-6.62 (-0.10%)Today's ChartsDon't get blindsided by Tesla's shiny new Model 3Fitch Affirms 7 Classes from Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2015-4Business WireAugust 4, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings has affirmed Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust (SDART) 2015-4 transaction as follows:--Class A-2-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-2-B at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class B at 'AAsf'; Outlook revised to Positive from Stable;--Class C at 'Asf'; Outlook revised to Positive from Stable;--Class D at 'BBBsf'; Outlook revised to Positive from Stable;--Class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook revised to Positive from Stable.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations on the outstanding notes reflect loss coverage levels consistent with current ratings. The transactions have performed within Fitch's cumulative net loss expectations to date.The Positive Outlooks placed on the subordinate notes are the result of increased loss coverage available to the notes. Due to better-than-expected performance, Fitch has adjusted its loss proxy for 2015-4 to 15% from 17.25%.The ratings reflect the quality of Santander Consumer USA's (SC) retail auto loan originations, the sound financial and legal structure of the transaction, and the strength of the servicing provided by SC.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.In Fitch's initial review of the transactions, the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base case loss expectations. To date, the transactions have exhibited strong performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations, with rising loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, a material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pools to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.DUE DILIGENCE USAGENo third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of the transactions in this review initially rated on or after Sept. 26, 2011 can be found in the respective appendices listed below. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated March 2, 2016.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 18 Jul 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=884963Criteria for Interest Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds (pub. 17 May 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=879815Criteria for Servicing Continuity Risk in Structured Finance (pub. 17 Dec 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=875586Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=883130Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=878723Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1009975Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1009975Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/creditdesk/PolicyRegulation.faces?context=2&detail=31ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.
