JEMS: The Open Source Platform for SOA



            With many enterprises already making the JBoss Enterprise Middleware System  
(JEMS) the foundation of their SOA strategy, JBoss has completed its natural  
evolution as an interoperable, open source platform inherently suitable as a  
foundation for SOA. Until now, enterprises looking to implement and realize  
the benefits of an SOA have had to choose between pricey, monolithic,  
proprietary platforms or an assortment of open source and proprietary  
components that need to be cobbled together. In contrast, as this session  
will show, JEMS delivers the only cohesive suite of market-leading open  
source middleware products that can be used alone, in combination with other  
vendor solutions, or as a whole to build and deploy applications, business  
processes and web services.

Cloud Computing & All That
It Touches In One Location Cloud Computing - Big Data - Internet of Things
SDDC - WebRTC - DevOps
                     

                      
                      
                      
    Cloud computing is become a norm within enterprise IT. 

 The competition among public cloud providers is red hot, private cloud continues to grab increasing shares of IT budgets, and hybrid cloud strategies are beginning to conquer the enterprise IT world. 
                 

 Big Data is driving dramatic leaps in resource requirements and capabilities, and now the Internet of Things promises an exponential leap in the size of the Internet and Worldwide Web.  

                   The world of SDX now encompasses Software-Defined Data Centers (SDDCs) as the technology world prepares for the Zettabyte Age. 

                      Add the key topics of WebRTC and DevOps into the mix, and you have three days of pure cloud computing that you simply cannot miss. 

Delegates will leave Cloud Expo with dramatically increased understanding the entire scope of the entire cloud computing spectrum from storage to security.


 Cloud Expo - the world's most established event - offers a vast selection of 130+ technical and strategic Industry Keynotes, General Sessions, Breakout Sessions, and signature Power Panels. The exhibition floor features 100+ exhibitors offering specific solutions and comprehensive strategies. The floor also features two Demo Theaters that give delegates the opportunity to get even closer to the technology they want to see and the people who offer it.  Attend Cloud Expo. Craft your own custom experience. Learn the latest from the world's best technologists. Find the vendors you want and put them to the test.  See you in New York!
