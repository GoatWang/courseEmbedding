Joseph Calleja, better known in the music world as Joe C., died in his sleep Thursday night at his home in Taylor, Mich.; he was twenty-six. The Detroit rapper was best known for his work as part of part of the carnivalesque ensemble that was Kid Rock's backing group, Twisted Brown Trucker.
"I'm Not a Fucking Midgit!" read a t-shirt that Joe C. (who claimed to be three-foot-nine, but armed with "a ten-foot dick") wore during Kid Rock's performance at Woodstock in 1999. Though the term was frequently placed on the rapper due to his height, he actually suffered from celiac disease, a digestive disorder that placed him through the rigors of daily dialysis (for several hours each night) and a parade of medication.
A regular attendee at Kid Rock's Motor City performances, Joe C. joined Rock's entourage in 1994 after impressing Rock by reciting most of his lyrics. Joe C. played a small, but prominent role in Rock's breakthrough album, Devil Without a Cause, adding a memorable verse to the title track and appearing in Rock's video for "Cowboy," going mano y mano with fellow little fellow Gary Coleman. He also offered a take on "Kyle's Mom's a Big Bitch" to the soundtrack for South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut. Though he would take breaks from Rock's tours to take care of his health, Joe C. could be counted on to add his distinctive energy to some of Rock's higher profile performances including Woodstock, the 2000 Grammys and a World Wrestling Federation appearance.
"Family and friends are everything; without them, all of the fame and fortune means nothing," Kid Rock said in a statement. "We have lost a part of our family. Joey gave us and the world his love. He brought a smile to everyone who has ever known or seen him. In a world full of confusion, Joey made all of us laugh. He gave us the gift of joy. Joey, thank you. We will never forget you. We love you."
"Joe C. was an extraordinary inspiration," said Jason Flom, President of Lava Records, Rock's label. "He overcame tremendous adversity to become a great performer and a truly wonderful human being. Despite living with chronic pain, Joe C. never let his condition prevent him from living life to the fullest."
Rock intended to record an album by Joe C. for his Top Dog records, but there is no word yet on whether the two recorded sufficient material for a release.

Need help calculating a materials estimate?

Aggregates
Aggregates are an engineered granular material consisting of crushed stone, gravel and sand of varying mineralogies, manufactured to specific sizes, grades and chemistry for use in construction, chemical and industrial applications.









Ready Mixed Concrete
Martin Marietta provides the highest quality products and services. We partner with our customers to finish all projects in a timely manner with superior results. To facilitate this, we offer unique performance-driven mix designs and a wide range of ancillary products to meet specification requirements and provide additional value to the construction community.








Asphalt
Asphalt is America’s most recycled material. Reclaimed asphalt is not just reusable as a "black rock" – the asphalt cement in the reclaimed pavement is reactivated to become an integral part of the new pavement. The recycled asphalt cement replaces part of the new asphalt cement and aggregate required for the pavement, reducing costs for road agencies and preserving valuable natural resources.








Cement
Martin Marietta operates energy-efficient and modern cement production facilities that are among the top tier in the United States, providing a sustainable building material critical for durable and resilient construction needs across all market segments. Commonly referred to as portland cement, these products range from general-purpose types to oil well cements and specialty masonry and plastering cements. Among the most widely-utilized building material in the world, cement touches virtually every aspect of our lives, and builds the homes, hospitals, offices, public buildings, ports, roads, bridges, highways, sidewalks and foundations across the country.








Cement Treated Materials
Cement Treated Material (CTM) is a simple, plant-mixed, highly compacted mixture of granular aggregates, Portland cement and water.  As the cement hydrates, the mixture becomes a hard, durable paving material.  A bituminous wearing surface is placed on the CTM to complete the pavement structure.

The zapping new Joe Pickett novel from the New York Times smash hit creator. Everything about the man is a puzzle: the huge farm in the remote Black Hills of Wyoming that no one ever visits, the ladies who live with him, the mystery philanthropies, the private airstrip, the sudden vanishings. What's more, particularly the tenacious bits of gossip that the man's riches originates from murdering individuals. Joe Pickett, still authoritatively an amusement superintendent however now for the most part a troubleshooter for the representative, is alloted to discover what in all actuality, yet he finds significantly more than he'd anticipated. There are two other men living up at that farm. One is a stone-frosty executioner who takes a moment abhorrence to Joe. The other is new—yet Joe knows him great. The principal man doesn't panic Joe. The second is another story completely.
