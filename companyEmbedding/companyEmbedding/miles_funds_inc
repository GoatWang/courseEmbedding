Active Equity Management
Equity Philosophy
We believe that the key to generating long term excess returns for clients is fundamental stock selection. We focus on buying:

High quality stocks;
With strong upside versus downside potential;
At a time when the market is also appreciating them.

This approach is managed within a risk framework to minimize impacts from unintended factors.

Our well defined and repeatable investment process places an emphasis on stock selection and portfolio construction, and is singularly focused on maintaining a specific portfolio profile.
Miles Capital's equity team leverages a proprietary relative ranking process, focused on:

Sector-by-sector analysis of quantitative factors;
In-depth fundamental research to identify stocks with desired alpha generating characteristics;
Unique assessment of upside versus downside potential;
Continual risk monitoring; and
A strict sell discipline.

Risk management is the foundation of our process. Our investment approach is focused on:

extent, and quality of the services that IMG has been providing to VINTAGE Fund 
will remain unchanged. To assure that this occurs West Bancorp negotiated long  
term employment contracts with key employees of IMG, including its portfolio    
managers - Jeffrey Lorenzen, Laurie Mardis, Kevin Croft and IMG operations      
manager Amy Mitchell. Most if not all of the other IMG employees that currently 
provide services to VINTAGE have been retained.

 SUPPLEMENT TO STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
 DATED JANUARY 3, 2006

This supplements the Statement of Additional Information dated July 31, 2005 of 
the Vintage Mutual Funds Government Assets Fund T Shares, Liquid Assets Fund -  
S, S2, T, and I Shares, Municipal Assets Fund - S, T, and I Shares,             
Institutional Reserves Fund, Institutional Money Market Fund, Vintage Limited   
Term Bond Fund, Vintage Bond Fund and Vintage Municipal Bond Fund (collectively 
the "Funds").                                                                   

On December 30, 2005 West Bancorporation, Inc. ("West Bancorp") acquired all of 
the outstanding stock of Investors Management Group, Ltd. from AMCORE Investment
Group, N.A. ("AMCORE"). West Bancorp is a publicly traded bank holding company  
that owns and operates West Bank, an Iowa state chartered bank. West Bank       
operates several branches in greater Des Moines, Iowa as well as other locations
in Iowa. West Bancorp and West Bank have offices in West Des Moines, Iowa. West 
Bancorp also owns and operates WB Capital Management Inc. d/b/a VMF Capital, a  
registered investment advisor, which provides investment advisory services to   
West Bank's customers.                                                          

In anticipation of this transaction Shareholders of the Funds approved a new    
Investment Advisory Agreement for the Funds with IMG at a Special Shareholders  
Meeting held on December 16, 2005. The new Investment Advisory Agreement is     
identical in form to the Investment Advisory Agreement previously in effect,    
except that it has a different term. The initial term of the new Investment     
Advisory Agreement is January 1, 2006 and terminates June 30, 2007. Thereafter, 
the new Investment Advisory Agreement will continue in effect for successive    
annual periods, provided its continuance is approved at least annually by (1) a 
majority vote, cast in person at a meeting called for that purpose of the       
VINTAGE Directors that are not interested persons of VINTAGE or (2) a vote of   
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of each Vintage Fund.       

P-->4974th�Page�of�5TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�4th
Notwithstanding the acquisition of IMG by West Bancorp, the operation of IMG as 
the investment adviser to VINTAGE and VINTAGE's day-to-day management, including
the portfolio managers, will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future. IMG   
and its personnel (including, those personnel with responsibilities for         
providing services to VINTAGE), resources, and investment process will remain   
unchanged and the financial viability of IMG will remain unchanged. The nature, 
extent, and quality of the services that IMG has been providing to VINTAGE Fund 
will remain unchanged. To assure that this occurs West Bancorp negotiated long  
term employment contracts with key employees of IMG, including its portfolio    
managers - Jeffrey Lorenzen, Laurie Mardis, Kevin Croft and IMG operations      
manager Amy Mitchell. Most if not all of the other IMG employees that currently 
provide services to VINTAGE have been retained. However, Patricia Bonavia       
resigned as Vice President of the Vintage Mutual Funds, Inc. as well as an      
officer and Director of IMG. The position of Vice President of the Funds is     
currently vacant.                                                               

The distribution of the Funds will remain unchanged. However, with the          
acquisition of IMG by West Bancorp, shares of the Funds may be purchased, in    
accordance with procedures established by the Distributor, through              
broker/dealers, banks, investment advisory firms and other financial            
institutions ("Participating Organizations") which may continue to include      
AMCORE and its affiliates as well as affiliates of West Bancorp. Customers      
purchasing shares of the Funds may include officers, directors, or employees of 
West Bancorp or its affiliates.                                                 

As was the case prior to the acquisition as it related to AMCORE transactions   
with the Funds, IMG on behalf of the Funds, will not execute portfolio          
transactions through, acquire portfolio securities issued by, make savings      
deposits in, or enter into repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with West
Bancorp, the Distributor, Bisys or their affiliates, and will not give          
preference to West Bancorp correspondents with respect to such transactions,    
securities, savings deposits, repurchase agreements, and reverse repurchase     
agreements. Furthermore, in making investment recommendations for the Funds, IMG
will not inquire or take into consideration whether an issuer of securities     
proposed for purchase or sale by the Funds is a customer of West Bancorp or its 
subsidiaries or affiliates and, in dealing with its customers, West Bancorp, its
subsidiaries, and affiliates will not inquire or take into consideration whether
securities of such customers are held by the Funds.                             

As was the case with respect to AMCORE, IMG, West Bancorp and their affiliates  
believe that they possess the legal authority to perform the services for the   
Funds described in the Prospectus and the SAI, without violation of applicable  
statutes and regulations. Future changes in either federal or state statutes and
regulations relating to the permissible activities of banks or bank holding     
companies and the subsidiaries or affiliates of those entities, as well as      
further judicial or administrative decisions or interpretations of present and  
future statutes and regulations, could prevent or restrict IMG, West Bancorp and
their affiliates from continuing to perform such services for the Funds.        
Depending upon the nature of any changes in the services which could be provided
by IMG, West Bancorp and their affiliates, the Board of Directors of the Funds  
would review the Funds' relationship with IMG or West Bancorp and consider      
taking all action necessary in the circumstances.                               

P-->497Last�Page�of�5TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�5th
Should future legislative, judicial, or administrative action prohibit or       
restrict the activities of IMG, West Bancorp and their affiliates and/or its    
affiliated and correspondent banks in connection with customer purchases of     
shares of the Funds, those banks might be required to alter materially or       
discontinue the services offered by them to customers. It is not anticipated,   
however, that any change in the Funds method of operations would affect its net 
asset value per share or result in financial losses to any customer.            

As was the case prior to the acquisition of IMG by West Bancorp, as authorized  
by the Fund's Rule 12b-1 Plan, the Distributor may enter into Shareholder       
Agreements with Participating Organizations, including IMG's parent or its      
affiliates (now West Bancorp), pursuant to which the Participating Organization 
agrees to provide certain administrative and shareholder support services in    
connection with shares of a Fund purchased and held by the Participating        
Organization for the accounts of its customers and shares of a Fund purchased   
and held by Customers of the Participating Organization, including, those       
described in the Statement of Additional information.                           

With the acquisition of IMG by West Bancorp, IMG is currently evaluating and    
assessing its and the Funds' policies with respect to voting proxies received by
the Funds. Until changes are recommended, the policies currently in effect for  
the Funds have been temporarily approved by West Bank and will apply            
substituting West Bancorp for AMCORE therein.
