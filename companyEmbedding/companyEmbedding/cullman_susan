Job Details
               The WISH List was founded in 1992 by a forward-thinking group of Republicans determined to transform America's political landscape.  WISH looks for the best and the brightest American women  --  intelligent candidates at the local, state and federal levels who confront today's issues with a fresh perspective and a solid belief in core Republican principles: Individual freedoms and responsibilities;A sound economy;Limited government;Healthy communities;An educated citizenry; andA strong and secure nation.Our first year, 1992, proved to be a banner year. WISH helped elect three outstanding women, all of whom quickly rose to the top of the U.S. House GOP leadership ranks: Rep. Jennifer Dunn (WA-8), who served as Vice Chair of the Republican Conference and waged an historic race for the office of Majority Leader; Rep. Deborah Pryce (OH-15), current Republican Conference Chair and Deputy Majority Whip; and former Rep. Tillie Fowler (FL-4), who served as Republican Conference Vice Chair before her retirement in 2002.  In 1993, The WISH List helped Christine Todd Whitman win election as the first woman governor in New Jersey history. Four years later, in 1997, WISH again played a critical role in Governor Whitman's re-election  --  a victory which made her the first Republican woman in the nation to be re-elected governor. In 1994, WISH helped Olympia Snowe of Maine, then the longest-serving Republican woman in Congress, win her bid for the United States Senate. (She has subsequently been re-elected, also with WISH help!) In 1996, WISH members helped add another Maine Republican woman to the Senate  --  Sen. Susan Collins, who won re-election to a second term by a wide margin in 2002!  In 1998, The WISH List's staunch support helped enable Rep. Judy Biggert (IL-13) to win a hard-fought primary battle and go on to claim distinction as the only newly-elected GOP woman in Congress that year. WISH's backing also helped fuel the successful re-elections of such influential veteran congresswomen as Reps. Nancy Johnson to Connecticut's Sixth District, as well as Marge Roukema (NJ-5) and Connie Morella (MD-8). The 2000 Election brought more success  --  the re-election of all The WISH List incumbents in the running, as well as the victory of Rep. Shelley Moore Capito as the new Congresswoman for West Virginia's 2nd District.  Even more victories came WISH's way during the 2001-2002 cycle. WISH-endorsed Republican Linda Lingle won election as the first woman governor in Hawaii history and the first Republican governor in that state in 40 years. Ginny Brown-Waite defeated a well-funded five-term Democrat incumbent to win her bid for Florida's 5th Congressional District seat. Overall, a majority of The WISH List's endorsed women candidates across the country won in races ranging from county commissioner to U.S. Senator.  Similarly, during the 2003-2004 election cycle, The WISH List saw a majority of its nearly 200 endorsed women candidates win election victories -- including U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski, the first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate from Alaska. Her successful election brings to four the number of pro-choice Republican women now serving in the U.S. Senate.  Contributions to The WISH List are not tax deductible.

Edgar
 M. Cullman, the man who led General Cigar Co. for decades and made 
Macanudo one of the best-selling brands in the history of the premium 
cigar business, died yesterday afternoon. He was 93 years old. He passed
 at his home in Connecticut surrounded by his loved ones."Edgar
 Sr. was a giant and a visionary. A legend for more than 45 years in 
America's premium cigar industry," said Marvin R. Shanken, editor and 
publisher of Cigar Aficionado magazine. "This is a sad day."
Cullman,
 who was known as "Sr." to many in the cigar business, had a long, 
storied list of industry achievements. He was the chief executive 
officer of General Cigar and Culbro Corp. during the 1970s and 1990s, 
and shaped General Cigar into one of the world's largest producers of 
premium cigars, building Macanudo into a global powerhouse. He 
negotiated a deal for the U.S. rights to the Partagas cigar brand, 
bought Villazon & Co. (makers of Punch and Hoyo de Monterrey), and 
was among the pioneers in advertising cigars. At one point his company 
owned premium cigar factories in Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and 
Honduras. Cullman loved the cigar business, and was particularly proud 
of the rounded style of head General Cigar became known for, a type of 
construction he dubbed "the Cullman cap." He is also a member of Cigar Aficionado's Hall of Fame.
"He was an incredible man and gentleman,” said Dan Carr, president of General Cigar. “He had a large space in his heart for our industry, the people within it, and all those that enjoyed a fine cigar. It was an honor for me to know him, and learn from him. He will surely be missed for a long time by so many people.”
Cullman's
 great grandfather was a tobacco dealer in Germany. He immigrated to the
 United States. Cullman's father, born in the United States, bought 
tobacco from around the U.S. and the world. "Dad started in the tobacco 
business buying Havana seed, Connecticut broadleaf, some Cuban 
tobacco—actually very little—and tobacco in Wisconsin and Ohio," Cullman
 told Cigar Aficionado
 during a wide-ranging interview that appeared in the Autumn 1994 issue 
of the magazine. "He also imported Sumatra tobacco from the Dutch East 
Indies. He would go to the auctions in Amsterdam for the wrapper tobacco
 from Indonesia."
At one point Culbro Corp., the Cullman family company 
that later became the parent company of General Cigar, grew 1,800 acres 
of cigar tobacco in Connecticut, far more than is grown in the entire 
valley today. Cullman's brother Joseph Cullman III was the chairman of 
Philip Morris from 1967 to 1978. Cullman's son Edgar Cullman Jr. worked 
alongside his father at General Cigar Co.
A
 veteran of the Second World War, Cullman learned how to roll cigars in 
New York City in 1944 at H. Anton Bock, a cigar company located at 
Second Avenue between 65 and 66 Streets. "I would go there at 6 a.m. and
 set up at the bench. First, I learned how to sort the tobacco, how to 
shake the tobacco, the Cuban tobacco that came in, how to open up the 
bales, how to then case [moisten] the tobacco so you could use it. How 
to count the leaves. Then I had to sit down at a bench and learn how to 
roll a cigar," he said to Cigar Aficionado in 1994. "I never made money 
or my living out of that, but I learned how to roll."
In
 1961, Cullman and a group of investors purchased General Cigar Co. for 
around $25 million. At the time General made inexpensive cigars selling 
for nickels and dimes: White Owl, William Penn, Van Dyck and Robert 
Burns, among other brands. In 1969, Culllman bought the Temple Hall 
cigar factory in Jamaica. "It was a very small factory, very 
unimportant. They made Creme de Jamaica," Cullman said in 1994. It also 
owned a tiny brand called Macanudo.
General
 Cigar created a new blend for Macanudo, coming up with a well-aged 
Connecticut-shade wrapper, a mild mix of filler and binder, and got the 
cigars into top restaurants and began to promote the product in the 
1970s. "We started to advertise Macanudo very strongly," said Cullman. 
The slogan called Macanudo "The Ultimate Cigar." It worked, and sales 
took off. Macanudo was the largest cigar brand sold in America before 
the debut of Cigar Aficionado magazine, and sales only got stronger after the magazine was published. At 
one point during the cigar boom, General had to temporarily stop making 
Macanudos due to shortages of the aged tobacco needed to make the 
cigars. They couldn't make enough.
Cullman's
 storied history with General Cigar began to end in 1999 when General 
Cigar sold its mass-market cigar business to Swedish Match AB. In 2000, Swedish Match acquired a controlling 
interest in General Cigar and in 2005 it bought out the remaining shares in the company, which put an end 
to Cullman's management of General. He never completely severed ties
 to the industry he loved so dear, however, and had a cigar made in his 
name.
A graduate of Yale, Cullman served on the Yale Development Board, and 
loved his Yale football games. He enjoyed games of tennis and fishing for 
salmon. He was a trustee of the Mount Sinai Medical Center, the Hotchkiss School, served on the boards of Bloomingdale Properties Inc. and Griffin
 Land & Nurseries Inc., and was a director on many corporate boards,
 including Mutual of Omaha, Companion Life Insurance Co. of New York, M.
 Lowenstein Corporation, U.S. Rubber Reclaiming Inc., 
Studebaker-Worthington Inc., and Centaur Communications.
Cullman
 is survived by his wife of 73 years, Louise; their three children, Edgar Cullman Jr., 
formerly the president of General Cigar, and his wife Ellie, Lucy Cullman Danziger and her husband Mike, and Susan Cullman and her husband John Kirby; six grandchildren, six great-grandchildren and three step-grandchildren. 
A memorial service will be held at a later date.
