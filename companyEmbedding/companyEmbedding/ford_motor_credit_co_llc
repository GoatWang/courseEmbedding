Ford Motor Credit Company LLC, d/b/a Ford Credit, is the financial services arm of Ford Motor Company, and is headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan.
Its business activities are concentrated primarily in the area of automobile loans in support of its parent company. The company offers consumer loans and leases to car buyers, as well as business loans and lines of credit to dealerships selling Ford Motor Company products. The firm also issues commercial paper and other debt instruments on Ford's behalf.
Ford Credit also owns Lincoln Automotive Financial Services, the arm that finances Lincoln vehicles.
Since the automotive industry crisis of 2008–10, Ford Credit has been the only financial arm of Detroit's "Big Three" still owned by its parent automaker due to the spinoff of GMAC (now Ally Financial) by General Motors and the purchase of Chrysler Financial (now TD Auto Finance) by Toronto-Dominion Bank.
