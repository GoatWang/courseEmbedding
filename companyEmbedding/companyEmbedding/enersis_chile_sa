Enersis is one of the main privately owned multinational electric power corporations in South America, with operations in five countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Peru. It currently holds direct and indirect participation in electric power generation, transmission, and distribution businesses.
The Enersis Group generating companies had an installed capacity of 14,832 MW, and through the distribution companies they supplied electricity to near 13.7 million customers, or approximately 45 million inhabitants.
The controlling shareholder of Enersis is Enel Energy Europe, which holds 60.62% ownership.
History[edit]
On June 19, 1981, Compañía Chilena de Electricidad S.A. was reorganized into a parent company and three subsidiaries. One of these was Compañía Chilena Metropolitana de Distribucion Electrica S.A. In 1985, under the Chilean government's privatization policy, the process of transferring the share capital of Compañía Chilena Metropolitana de Distribucion Electrica S.A. to the private sector was begun, ending finally on August 10, 1987. In this process, the pension fund management companies (AFPs), company employees, institutional investors, and thousands of small shareholders joined the Company. Its organizational structure was based on activities or operative functions whose results were evaluated functionally and its profitability was limited by a tariff structure as a result of the Company's exclusive dedication to the electricity distribution business.[citation needed]
In 1987, the company's board proposed forming a division for each of the parent company's activities. Four subsidiaries were therefore created to be managed as business units each with its own objectives, thus expanding the company's activities toward other non-regulated activities but linked to the main business. This division was approved by the extraordinary shareholders meeting of November 25, 1987 which defined its new corporate objects. Compañía Chilena Metropolitana de Distribucion Electrica S.A. thus became an investment holding company.[citation needed]
In August 1988, as resolved at the preceding shareholders meeting in April 1988, one of the companies born from the division changed its name to Enersis S.A.[citation needed] Also in 1988, to meet its development and growth needs, the company was split into 5 business units which in turn gave birth to five subsidiaries:

Chilectra and Río Maipo were responsible for electricity.
Manso de Velasco concentrated on electrical engineering and construction services and real-estate management.
Synapsis in the area of information technology and data processing.
Diprel focused on providing procurement and commercialization of electrical product services.

In 2002, company expanded into telecommunications, information technology, and internet trading businesses.[citation needed]
In October 2014, after Endesa was acquired by Enel, Enersis SA became controlled by Enel.
Operations[edit]
Enersis is one of the largest private electricity groups in Latin America in terms of consolidated assets and operating revenue. It is engaged in generation, transmission and distribution.[citation needed]

SANTIAGO, Chile, April 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- ENERSIS CHILE S.A. (NYSE:    ENIC) today announced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has declared effective the Registration Statement on Form 20-F filed by Enersis Chile (the "Registration Statement") in connection with the spin-off by Enersis Américas S.A. (NYSE:    ENI) of Enersis Chile (the "Spin-off"). Each holder of record of (i) Enersis Américas common stock as of April 14, 2016 (the "Record Date"), will have the right to receive one share of Enersis Chile common stock for each share of Enersis Américas common stock held, and (ii) American Depositary Shares ("ADSs") of Enersis Américas as of the Record Date will have the right to receive one ADS of Enersis Chile for each ADS of Enersis Américas held.  








The Spin-off was approved at an Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting of Enersis Américas held on December 18, 2015. Enersis Américas shareholders will not be required to (i) pay for the shares of Enersis Chile common stock to be received by them in the Spin-Off, (ii) surrender or exchange shares of Enersis Américas common stock in order to receive Enersis Chile common stock, (iii) take any other action in connection with the Spin-Off.  
Enersis Chile and shares of Enersis Chile common stock are being registered with the Chilean Superintendence of Securities and Insurance (Superintendencia de Valores y Seguros, or the "SVS"). The SVS has not approved or disapproved of the securities (including in the form of ADSs).
Persons holding Enersis Américas ADSs in the facilities of The Depositary Trust Company ("DTC") will receive the distribution of Enersis Chile ADSs by book entry only, through the facilities of DTC on or about  April 26, 2016 (the "Distribution Date"). Persons holding Enersis Américas ADSs directly will receive the distribution of Enersis Chile ADSs in the form of certificated American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs"), representing Enersis Chile ADSs on or about the Distribution Date.
The distribution of Enersis Chile common stock and ADSs are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions including, but not limited to, registration of the shares of common stock with the SVS, the receipt of approval to list the shares of common stock on the Santiago Stock Exchange, the Valparaiso Stock Exchange and the Electronic Stock Exchange in Chile, and the other conditions summarized in the Registration Statement.
In the event there are any changes to the Record Date or the Distribution Date, Enersis Américas and Enersis Chile will publish any such changes in a press release that will also be furnished on a Form 6-K. In addition, Enersis Chile will coordinate with Citibank N.A., its depositary, to give at least 10 days' notice of any changes to the Record Date to the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") in accordance with NYSE's requirements.
There is currently no market for Enersis Chile common stock. The NYSE has authorized the listing of Enersis Chile ADRs under the symbol 'ENIC,' subject to official notice of distribution. Concurrent with the commencement of "regular way" trading of the Enersis Chile ADSs on the NYSE under the symbol 'ENIC', the ticker symbol for Enersis Américas' ADSs is expected to change from 'ENI' to 'ENIA' and the symbols for Enersis Américas' 7.40% Notes due December 1, 2016 and 6.60% Notes due December 1, 2016 will change to 'ENIA 16' and 'ENIA 26', respectively.
The Registration Statement filed with the SEC contains information about Enersis Chile and its businesses, details regarding the distribution of Enersis Chile ADSs and other important information. The Registration Statement is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov (http://www.sec.gov/).
Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the completion of the Spin-Off, timing of "when-issued" and "regular-way" trading and trading on the NYSE, Santiago Stock Exchange, the Electronic Stock Exchange and the Valparaíso Stock Exchange, conditions to the distribution, and statements about the objectives of the Spin-off, Enersis Chile's strategy and other non-historical matters. These statements are based on management's current expectations or beliefs, and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause the actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Such risks include a failure to successfully separate Enersis Chile from Enersis Américas, the satisfaction of conditions of the Spin-off, including the receipt of required approvals (including from the SVS), the ability of Enersis Chile's businesses to continue to grow and develop according to their business development plans, trends in the industries in which Enersis Chile's businesses operate, customer demand, the competitive landscape in which Enersis Chile's businesses operate, changes in regulation applicable to Enersis Chile's business, competition risk, regulatory risk, financial markets risk, operational risks, and other risks and factors, including those set forth under the heading "Risk Factors" in Enersis Chile's Registration Statement. Except as required by law, Enersis Chile undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.
