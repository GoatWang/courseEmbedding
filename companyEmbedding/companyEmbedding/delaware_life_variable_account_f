SPECIAL TERMS
Your Contract is a legal document that uses a number of specially defined terms. We explain most of the terms that we use in this Prospectus in the context where they arise, and some are self-explanatory. In addition, for convenient reference, we have compiled a list of these terms in the Glossary included at the back of this Prospectus as Appendix A. If, while you are reading this Prospectus, you come across a term that you do not understand, please refer to the Glossary for an explanation.
PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

The headings in this section correspond to headings in the Prospectus under which we discuss these topics in more detail.
The Annuity Contract
The MFS Regatta Flex-4 Fixed and Variable Annuity Contract provides a number of important benefits for your retirement planning. During the Accumulation Phase, you make Payments under the Contract and allocate them to one or more Variable Account or Fixed Account options. During the Income Phase, we make annuity payments to you or someone else based on the amount you have accumulated. The Contract provides tax-deferral so that you do not pay taxes on your earnings until you withdraw them. The Contract also provides a basic death benefit if you die during the Accumulation Phase. You may enhance the basic
death benefit by purchasing one or more optional death benefit riders.
The Accumulation Phase
Under most circumstances, you can buy the Contract with an initial Purchase Payment of $10,000 or more, and you can make additional Purchase Payments of at least $1,000 at any time during the Accumulation Phase. We will not normally accept a Purchase Payment if your Account Value is over $2 million or, if the Purchase Payment would cause your Account Value to exceed $2 million.
Variable Account Options: The Funds
You can allocate your Purchase Payments among Sub-Accounts investing in a number of Fund options. Each Fund is a separate series of the MFS/Sun Life Series Trust, an open-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The investment returns on the Funds are not guaranteed. You can make or lose money. You can make transfers among the Funds and the Fixed Account Options.
The Fixed Account Options: The Guarantee Periods
You can allocate your Purchase Payments to the Fixed Account and elect to invest in one or more of the Guarantee Periods we make available from time to time. Each Guarantee Period earns interest at a Guaranteed Interest Rate that we publish. We may change the Guaranteed Interest Rate from time to time, but no Guaranteed Interest Rate will ever be less than the minimum guaranteed interest rate permitted by law. Once we have accepted your allocation to a particular Guarantee Period, we promise that the Guaranteed Interest Rate applicable to that allocation will not change for the duration of the Guarantee Period. We may offer Guarantee Periods of different durations or stop offering some Guarantee Periods. Once we stop offering a Guarantee Period of a particular duration, future allocations, transfers, or renewals into that Guarantee Period will not be permitted.
Expense Summary
The Contract has insurance features and investment features, and there are costs related to each.

If your Account Value is less than $100,000 on your Account Anniversary, we deduct a $50 Annual Account Fee. We will waive the Account Fee if your Contract was fully invested in the Fixed Account during the entire Account Year.
We deduct a mortality and expense risk charge of 1.20% of the average daily value of the Contract invested in the Variable Account, if your initial Purchase Payment was less than $1,000,000, or 0.95% if your initial Purchase Payment was $1,000,000 or more. We also deduct an administrative charge of 0.15% of the average daily value of the Contract invested in the Variable Account.

If you take more than a specified amount of money out of your Contract, we assess a withdrawal charge against each Purchase Payment withdrawn. The withdrawal charge (also known as a "contingent deferred sales charge") starts at 6% in the first Contract year and declines to 0% after four years.
Currently, you can make 12 free transfers each year; however, we reserve the right to impose a charge of up to $15 per transfer.
If you elect one or more of the optional death benefit riders, we will deduct, during the Accumulation Phase, an additional charge of from the assets of the Variable Account ranging from 0.15% to 0.40% of the average daily value of your Contract, depending upon which optional death benefit rider(s) you have elected.
In addition to the charges we impose under the Contract, there are also charges (which include management fees and operating expenses) imposed by the Funds, which range from 0.82% to 1.87% of the average daily net assets of the Fund, depending upon which Fund(s) you have selected.
The Income Phase: Annuity Provisions
If you want to receive regular income from your annuity, you can select one of a several Annuity Options. Subject to the Maximum Annuity Commencement Date, you can choose to receive annuity payments from either the Fixed Account or from the available Variable Account options. If you choose to have any part of your annuity payments come from the Variable Account, the dollar amount of the payments may fluctuate with the performance of the Funds. You decide when your Income Phase will begin but, once it begins, you cannot change your choice of annuity payment options.

Death Benefit
If you die before the Contract reaches the Income Phase, the beneficiary will receive a death benefit. The amount of the death benefit depends upon your age on the Contract Date and whether you choose the basic death benefit or, for a fee, one or more of the optional death benefit rider. If you are 85 or younger on your Contract Date, the basic death benefit pays the greatest of your Account Value, your total Purchase Payments (adjusted for withdrawals), or your cash Surrender Value, all calculated as of your Death Benefit Date. If you are 86 or older on your Contract Date, the basic death benefit is equal
to the Surrender Value. Subject to availability in your state, you may enhance the basic death benefit by electing one or more of the optional death benefit riders. You must make your election before the date on which your Contract becomes effective. The riders are only available if you are younger than 80 on the Contract Date. Any optional death benefit rider election may not be changed after your Contract is issued.
Withdrawals, Withdrawal Charge and Market Value Adjustment
You can withdraw money from your Contract during the Accumulation Phase. You may withdraw a portion of your Account Value each year without the imposition of a withdrawal charge. During the first four Account Years, this "free withdrawal amount" equals 10% of the amount of all Purchase Payments made. All other amounts are subject to a withdrawal charge. Withdrawals made from the Fixed Account may also be subject to a Market Value Adjustment (see prospectus under "Market Value Adjustment"). You may also have to pay income taxes and tax penalties on money you withdraw.

Right to Return
Your Contract contains a "free look" provision. If you cancel your Contract within 10 days after receiving it, we will send you, depending upon the laws of your state, either the full amount of all of your Purchase Payments or your Account Value as of the day we receive your cancellation request. (This amount may be more or less than the original Purchase Payment). We will not deduct a withdrawal charge or a Market Value Adjustment.
Tax Considerations
Your earnings are not taxed until you take them out. If you withdraw money during the Accumulation Phase, earnings come out first and are taxed as income. If you are younger than 59 1/2 when you take money out, you may be charged a 10% federal tax penalty.

(1) 

The information relating to Fund expenses was provided by the Fund and we have not independently verified it. You should consult the Fund prospectus for more information about Fund expenses. All expense figures are shown after expense reimbursements or waivers, except for the bracketed figures which show what the expense figures would have been absent reimbursement and waiver. All expense figures are based on actual expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, except that the expense figures shown for Funds with less than 12 months of investment experience are estimates for the year 2002. Such Funds include the Global Telecommunications - S Class, Mid Cap Value - S Class, and Strategic Value - S Class.


 

 


(2) 

Each Fund has an expense offset arrangement which reduces the Fund's custodian fee based upon the amount of cash maintained by the Fund with its custodian and dividend disbursing agent. Each Fund may enter into such other arrangements and directed brokerage arrangements (which would also have the effect of reducing the Fund's expenses). Any such fee reductions are not reflected under "Other Fund Expenses" in the table. Had these fee reimbursements been taken into account, "Total Annual Fund Expenses" for certain of the Funds would be as follows:

MFS has contractually agreed to bear the expenses of the Global Telecommunications - S Class, Mid Cap Value - S Class, and Strategic Value - S Class such that "Other Fund Expenses," after taking into account the expense offset arrangement described in Footnote (2), above, do not exceed 0.25% annually. These contractual fee arrangements will continue until at least May 1, 2003, unless changed with the consent of the Series Fund's Board of Directors; provided, however, that a Fund's contractual fee arrangement will terminate prior to May 1, 2003, in the event that the Fund's "Other Fund Expenses" equal or fall below 0.25% annually.



EXAMPLES
The following Examples should not be considered to be representations of past or future expenses, and actual expenses may be greater or lower than those shown. The Examples assume that all current waivers and reimbursements continue throughout all periods.
If you surrender your Contract at the end of the applicable time period, you would pay the following expenses on a $1,000 investment, assuming an average Contract size of $50,000, a 5% annual return, and no optional death benefit riders have been elected:

CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Historical information about the value of the units we use to measure the variable portion of your Contract ("Variable Accumulation Units") is included in the back of this Prospectus as Appendix I.
THE ANNUITY CONTRACT
Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) (the "Company", "we" or "us") and Sun Life of Canada (U.S.) Variable Account F (the "Variable Account") offer the Contract to groups and individuals for use in connection with their retirement plans. The Contract is available on a group basis and, in certain states, may be available on an individual basis. We issue an Individual Contract directly to the individual owner of the Contract. We issue a Group Contract to the Owner, covering all individuals
participating under the Group Contract; each individual receives a Certificate that evidences his or her participation under the Group Contract.
In this Prospectus, unless we state otherwise, we refer to both the owners of Individual Contracts and participating individuals under Group Contracts as "Participants" and we address all Participants as "you"; we use the term "Contracts" to include Individual Contracts, Group Contracts, and Certificates issued under Group Contracts. For the purpose of determining benefits under both Individual Contracts
and Group Contracts, we establish an Account for each Participant, which we will refer to as "your" Account or a "Participant Account."
Your Contract provides a number of important benefits for your retirement planning. It has an Accumulation Phase, during which you make payments under the Contract and allocate them to one or more Variable Account or Fixed Account options, and an Income Phase, during which we make annuity payments based on the amount you have accumulated. Your Contract provides tax deferral, so that you do not pay taxes on your earnings under your Contract until you withdraw them. It provides a basic death benefit if you die during the Accumulation Phase. You may enhance the basic death benefit by electing one or more optional
death benefit riders and paying an additional charge for each optional death benefit rider you elect. Finally, if you so elect, during the Income Phase we will make annuity payments to you or someone else for life or for another period that you choose.
You choose these benefits on a variable or fixed basis or a combination of both. When you choose Variable Account investment options or a Variable Annuity option, your benefits will be responsive to changes in the economic environment, including inflationary forces and changes in rates of return available from different types of investments. With these variable options, you assume all investment risk under your Contract. When you choose a Guarantee Period in our Fixed Account or a Fixed Annuity option, we assume the investment risk, except in the case of early withdrawals in the Accumulation Phase, where you bear the risk of unfavorable interest rate changes. You may also bear the risk that the interest rates we will offer in the future and the rates we will use in determining your Fixed Annuity may not exceed our minimum guaranteed rate. Our minimum guaranteed interest rate
will never be less than that permitted by law.
The Contract is designed for use in connection with retirement and deferred compensation plans, some of which qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment under Sections 401, 403, 408 or 408A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Contract is also designed so that it may be used in connection with certain non-tax-qualified retirement plans, such as payroll savings plans and such other groups (trusteed or nontrusteed) as may be eligible under applicable law. We refer to Contracts used with plans that receive favorable tax treatment as "Qualified Contracts," and all other Contracts
as "Non-Qualified Contracts."
COMMUNICATING TO US ABOUT YOUR CONTRACT
All materials sent to us, including Purchase Payments, must be sent to our Annuity Mailing Address as set forth on the first page of this Prospectus. For all telephone communications, you must call (800) 752-7215.
Unless this Prospectus states differently, we will consider all materials sent to us and all telephone communications to be received on the date we actually receive them at our Annuity Mailing Address. However, we will consider all financial transactions, including Purchase Payments, withdrawal requests and transfer instructions, to be received on the next Business Day if we receive them (1) on a day that is not a Business Day or (2) after 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time.
When we specify that notice to us must be in writing, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to accept notice in another form.
SUN LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA (U.S.)
We are a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of Delaware on January 12, 1970. We do business in 49 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, and we have an insurance company subsidiary that does business in New York. Our Executive Office mailing address is One Sun Life Executive Park, Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts 02481.
We are an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada ("Sun Life (Canada)"). Sun Life (Canada) completed its demutualization on March 22, 2000. As a result of the demutualization, a new holding company, Sun Life Financial Services of Canada Inc. ("Sun Life Financial"), is now the ultimate parent of Sun Life (Canada) and the Company. Sun Life Financial, a corporation organized in Canada, is a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with common shares listed on the Toronto, New York, London, and Manila stock exchanges.
THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT
We established the Variable Account as a separate account on July 13, 1989, pursuant to a resolution of our Board of Directors. The Variable Account funds the Contract and various other variable annuity and variable life insurance product contracts which we offer. These other products may have features, benefits and charges that are different from those under the Contract.

Under Delaware insurance law and the Contract, the income, gains or losses of the Variable Account are credited to or charged against the assets of the Variable Account without regard to the other income, gains, or losses of the Company. These assets are held in relation to the Contract and other variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts that provide benefits that vary in accordance with the investment performance of the Variable Account. Although the assets maintained in the Variable Account will not be charged with any
liabilities arising out of any other business we conduct, all obligations arising under a Contract, including the promise to make annuity payments, are general corporate obligations of the Company.
The assets of the Variable Account are divided into Sub-Accounts. Each Sub-Account invests exclusively in shares of a specific Fund. All amounts allocated to the Variable Account will be used to purchase Fund shares as designated by you at their net asset value. Any and all distributions made by the Funds with respect to the shares held by the Variable Account will be reinvested to purchase additional Fund shares at their net asset value. Deductions will be made from the Variable Account for cash withdrawals, annuity payments, death benefits, Account Fees, Contract charges against the assets of the Variable Account for the assumption of mortality and expense risks, administrative expenses and any applicable taxes. The Variable Account will be fully invested in Fund shares at all times.
VARIABLE ACCOUNT OPTIONS: THE FUNDS
 
The MFS/Sun Life Series Trust (the "Series Fund") is an open-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Our affiliate, Massachusetts Financial Services Company ("MFS"), serves as the investment adviser to the Series Fund.
The Series Fund is composed of a number of independent portfolios of securities, each of which has separate investment objectives and policies. Shares of the Series Fund are issued in 31 series (each, a "Fund"), each corresponding to one of the portfolios. The Contract provides for investment by the
Sub-Accounts in shares of the Funds described below. Additional portfolios may be added to the Series Fund which may or may not be available for investment by the Variable Account.

Each Fund pays fees to MFS, as its investment adviser, for services rendered pursuant to investment advisory agreements. MFS also serves as investment adviser to each of the funds in the MFS Family of Funds, and to certain other investment companies established by MFS and/or us. MFS Institutional Advisers, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MFS, provides investment advice to substantial private clients. MFS and its predecessor organizations have a history of money management dating from 1924. MFS operates as an autonomous organization and the obligation of performance with respect to the investment advisory and underwriting agreements (including supervision of the sub-advisers noted below) is solely that of MFS. We undertake no obligation in this regard.
MFS may serve as the investment adviser to other mutual funds which have similar investment goals and principal investment policies and risks as the Funds, and which may be managed by a Fund's portfolio manager(s). While a Fund may have many similarities to these other funds, its investment performance will differ from their investment performance. This is due to a number of differences between the Fund and these similar products, including differences in sales charges, expense ratios and cash flows.
The Series Fund also offers its shares to other separate accounts established by the Company and our New York subsidiary in connection with variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts. Although we do not anticipate any disadvantages to this arrangement, there is a possibility that a material conflict may arise between the interests of the Variable Account and one or more of the other separate accounts investing in the Series Fund. A conflict may occur due to differences in tax laws affecting the operations of variable life and variable annuity separate accounts, or some other reason. We and the Series Fund's Board of Trustees will monitor events for such conflicts, and, in the event of a conflict, we will take steps necessary to remedy the conflict, including withdrawal of the Variable
Account from participation in the Fund which is involved in the conflict or substitution of shares of other Funds or other mutual funds.
More comprehensive information about the Series Fund and the management, investment objectives, policies, restrictions, expenses and potential risks of each Fund may be found in the accompanying current Series Fund Prospectus. You should read the Series Fund Prospectus carefully before investing. The statement of additional information of the Series Fund is available by calling (800) 752-7215.
THE FIXED ACCOUNT
The Fixed Account is made up of all the general assets of the Company other than those allocated to any separate account. Amounts you allocate to Guarantee Periods become part of the Fixed Account, and are available to fund the claims of all classes of our customers, including claims for benefits under the Contracts.
We will invest the assets of the Fixed Account in those assets we choose that are allowed by applicable state insurance laws. In general, these laws permit investments, within specified limits and subject to certain qualifications, in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common stocks, real estate mortgages, real estate and certain other investments. We intend to invest primarily in investment-grade fixed income securities (i.e., rated by a nationally recognized rating service within the 4 highest grades) or instruments we believe are of comparable quality.
We are not obligated to invest amounts allocated to the Fixed Account according to any particular strategy, except as may be required by applicable state insurance laws. You will not have a direct or indirect interest in the Fixed Account investments.
THE FIXED ACCOUNT OPTIONS: THE GUARANTEE PERIODS
 
You may elect one or more Guarantee Period(s) from those we make available. From time to time, we may offer Guarantee Periods of different durations or stop offering some Guarantee Periods. Once we stop offering a Guarantee Period of a particular duration, allocations, transfers or renewals into that Guarantee Period will not be permitted. We publish Guaranteed Interest Rates for each Guarantee Period offered. We may change the Guaranteed Interest Rates we offer from time to time, but no Guaranteed Interest Rate will ever be less than the minimum guaranteed rate permitted by state law. Also, once we have accepted your allocation to a particular Guarantee Period, we promise that the Guaranteed Interest Rate applicable to that allocation will not change for the duration of the Guarantee Period.
We determine Guaranteed Interest Rates at our discretion. We do not have a specific formula for establishing the rates for different Guarantee Periods. Our determination will be influenced by the interest rates on fixed income investments in which we may invest amounts allocated to the Guarantee Periods. We will also consider other factors in determining these rates, including regulatory and tax requirements, sales commissions and administrative expenses borne by us, general economic trends and competitive factors. We cannot predict the level of future interest rates.
We may from time to time at our discretion offer special interest rates for new Purchase Payments that are higher than the rates we are then offering for renewals or transfers.
Early withdrawals from your allocation to a Guarantee Period, including cash withdrawals, transfers and commencement of an annuity option, may be subject to a Market Value Adjustment, which could decrease or increase the value of your Account. See "Withdrawals, Withdrawal Charge and Market Value Adjustment."
THE ACCUMULATION PHASE
During the Accumulation Phase of your Contract, you make payments into your Account, and your earnings accumulate on a tax-deferred basis. The Accumulation Phase begins with our acceptance of your first Purchase Payment and ends the Business Day before your Annuity Commencement Date. The Accumulation Phase will end sooner if you surrender your Contract or if the Covered Person dies before the Annuity Commencement Date.
Issuing Your Contract
When you purchase a Contract, a completed Application and the initial Purchase Payment are sent to us for acceptance. When we accept an Individual Contract, we issue the Contract to you. When we accept a Group Contract, we issue the Contract to the Owner; we issue a Certificate to you as a Participant.
We will credit your initial Purchase Payment to your Account within 2 Business Days of receiving your completed Application. If your Application is not complete, we will notify you. If we do not have the necessary information to complete the Application within 5 Business Days, we will send your money back to you or ask your permission to retain your Purchase Payment until the Application is made complete. Then we will apply the Purchase Payment within 2 Business Days of when the Application is complete.
Amount and Frequency of Purchase Payments
The amount of Purchase Payments may vary; however, we will not accept an initial Purchase Payment of less than $10,000, and each additional Purchase Payment must be at least $1,000, unless we waive these limits. In addition, we will not accept a Purchase Payment if your Account Value is over $2 million, or if the Purchase Payment would cause your Account Value to exceed $2 million, unless we have approved the Payment in advance. Within these limits, you may make Purchase Payments at any time during the Accumulation Phase.
Allocation of Net Purchase Payments
You may allocate your Purchase Payments among the different Sub-Accounts and Guarantee Periods we offer, but any allocation to a Guarantee Period must be at least $1,000. Over the life of your Contract, you may allocate amounts among as many as 18 of the available investment options.
In your Application, you may specify the percentage of each Purchase Payment to be allocated to each Sub-Account or Guarantee Period. These percentages are called your allocation factors. Your allocation factors will remain in effect as long as your selected Sub-Accounts and Guarantee Periods continue to be available for investment. You may, however, change the allocation factors for future Payments by sending us notice of the change in a form acceptable to us. We will use your new allocation factors for the first Purchase Payment we receive with or after we have received notice of the change, and for all future Purchase Payments, until we receive another change notice.
Although it is currently not our practice, we may deduct applicable premium taxes or similar taxes from your Purchase Payments (see "Contract Charges -- Premium Taxes"). In that case, we will credit your Net Purchase Payment, which is the Purchase Payment minus the amount of those taxes.
Your Account
When we accept your first Purchase Payment, we establish an Account for you, which we maintain throughout the Accumulation Phase of your Contract.
Your Account Value
Your Account Value is the sum of the value of the 2 components of your Contract, the Variable Account portion of your Contract ("Variable Account Value") and the Fixed Account portion of your Contract ("Fixed Account Value"). These 2 components are calculated separately, as described below under "Variable Account Value" and "Fixed Account Value."
Variable Account Value
     Variable Accumulation Units
In order to calculate your Variable Account Value, we use a measure called a Variable Accumulation Unit for each Sub-Account. Your Variable Account Value is the sum of your Account Value in each Sub-Account, which is the number of your Variable Accumulation Units for that Sub-Account times the value of each Unit.
     Variable Accumulation Unit Value
The value of each Variable Accumulation Unit in a Sub-Account reflects the net investment performance of that Sub-Account. We determine that value once on each day that the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading, at the close of trading, which is currently 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time. (The close of trading is determined by the New York Stock Exchange.) We also may determine the value of Variable Accumulation Units of a Sub-Account on days the Exchange is closed if there is enough trading in securities held by that Sub-Account to materially affect the value of the Variable Accumulation Units. Each day we make a valuation is called a "Business Day." The period that begins at the time Variable Accumulation Units are valued on a Business Day and ends at that time on the next Business Day is called a "Valuation Period." On days other than Business Days, the value of a Variable Accumulation Unit does not change.
To measure these values, we use a factor -- which we call the "Net Investment Factor" -- which represents the net return on the Sub-Account's assets. At the end of any Valuation Period, the value of a Variable Accumulation Unit for a Sub-Account is equal to the value of that Sub-Account's Variable Accumulation Units at the end of the previous Valuation Period, multiplied by the Net Investment Factor. We calculate the Net Investment Factor by dividing (1) the net asset value of a Fund share held in the Sub-Account at the end of that Valuation Period, plus the per share amount of any dividend or capital gains distribution made by that Fund during the Valuation Period, by (2) the net asset value per share of the Fund share at the end of the previous Valuation Period; then, for each day in the Valuation Period, we deduct a factor representing the asset-based insurance charges (the mortality and expense risk charges and the administrative expense charge) plus any
applicable charge for optional death benefit riders. See "Contract Charges".
For a hypothetical example of how we calculate the value of a Variable Accumulation Unit, see the Statement of Additional Information.
     Crediting and Canceling Variable Accumulation Units
When we receive an allocation to a Sub-Account either from a Net Purchase Payment or a transfer of Account Value, we credit that amount to your Account in Variable Accumulation Units. Similarly, we cancel Variable Accumulation Units when you transfer or withdraw amounts from a Sub-Account, or when we deduct certain charges under the Contract. We determine the number of Units credited or canceled by dividing the dollar amount by the Variable Accumulation Unit value for that Sub-Account at the end of the Valuation Period during which the transaction or charge is effective.
Fixed Account Value
Your Fixed Account value is the sum of all amounts allocated to Guarantee Periods, either from Net Purchase Payments, transfers or renewals, plus interest credited on those amounts, and minus withdrawals, transfers out of Guarantee Periods, and any deductions for charges under the Contract taken from your Fixed Account Value.
A Guarantee Period begins the day we apply your allocation and ends when all calendar years (or months if the Guarantee Period is less than one year) in the Guarantee Period (measured from the end of the calendar month in which the amount was allocated to the Guarantee Period) have elapsed. The last day of the Guarantee Period is its Renewal Date.
Each additional Purchase Payment, transfer or renewal credited to your Fixed Account Value will result in a new Guarantee Period with its own Renewal Date. Amounts allocated at different times to Guarantee Periods of the same duration may have different Renewal Dates.
     Crediting Interest
We credit interest on amounts allocated to a Guarantee Period at the applicable Guaranteed Interest Rate for the duration of the Guarantee Period. During the Guarantee Period, we credit interest daily at a rate that yields the Guaranteed Interest Rate on an annual effective basis.
     Guarantee Amounts
Each separate allocation you make to a Guarantee Period, together with interest credited thereon, is called a Guarantee Amount. Each Guarantee Amount is treated separately for purposes of determining the Market Value Adjustment. We may restrict a Guarantee Period that will extend beyond your Maximum Annuity Commencement Date. Renewals into a Guarantee Period that will extend beyond your maximum Annuity Commencement Date will result in an application of a Market Value Adjustment upon annuitization or withdrawals. Each new allocation to a Guarantee Period must be at least $1,000.
     Renewals
We will notify you in writing between 45 and 75 days before the Renewal Date for any Guarantee Amount. If you would like to change your Fixed Account option, we must receive from you prior to the Renewal Date:


1)

written notice electing a different Guarantee Period from among those we then offer, or


 

 


2)

written instructions to transfer the Guarantee Amount to one or more Sub-Accounts, in accordance with the transfer privilege provisions of the Contract (see "Transfer Privilege.")


If we receive no instructions from you prior to the Renewal Date, we will automatically renew your Fixed Account allocation into a new Guarantee Period of the same duration as the last Guarantee Period. If we are no longer offering a Guarantee Period of the same duration, we will automatically transfer your Fixed Account allocation into the Money Market Sub-Account.
A Guarantee Amount will not renew into a Guarantee Period that will extend beyond your Maximum Annuity Commencement Date. In that case, unless you notify us otherwise, we will automatically renew your Guarantee Amount into the Money Market Sub-Account.
     Early Withdrawals
If you withdraw, transfer, or annuitize an allocation to a Guarantee Period 30 days prior to the Renewal Date, we will apply a Market Value Adjustment to the transaction. This could result in an increase or a decrease of your Account Value, depending on interest rates at the time. You bear the risk that you will receive less than your principal if the Market Value Adjustment applies.
Transfer Privilege
     Permitted Transfers
During the Accumulation Phase, you may transfer all or part of your Account Value to one or more Sub-Accounts or Guarantee Periods then available, subject to the following restrictions:


 

You may not make more than 12 transfers in any Account Year;


 

 


 

The amount transferred from a Sub-Account must be at least $1,000, unless you are transferring your entire balance in that Sub-Account;


 

 


 

Your Account Value remaining in a Sub-Account must be at least $1,000;


 

 


 

The amount transferred from a Guarantee Period must be the entire Guarantee Amount, except for transfers of interest credited during the current Account Year;


 

 


 

At least 30 days must elapse between transfers to and from Guarantee Periods;


 

 


 

Transfers to or from Sub-Accounts are subject to terms and conditions that may be imposed by the Funds; 


 

 


 

The total number of Sub-Accounts and Guarantee Periods within an Account may not exceed 18 over the lifetime of the Contract; and


 

 


 

We impose additional restrictions on market timers, which are further described below.


These restrictions do not apply to transfers made under any approved Optional Program. At our discretion, we may waive some or all of these restrictions.
 
There is usually no charge imposed on transfers; however, we reserve the right to impose a transfer charge of $15 for each transfer. Transfers out of a Guarantee Period more than 30 days before the Renewal Date or any time after the Renewal Date or any time after the Renewal Date will be subject to the Market Value Adjustment described below. Under current law, there is no tax liability for transfers.
     Requests for Transfers
You may request transfers in writing or by telephone. If the request is by telephone, it must be made before the earlier of (a) 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on a Business Day, or (b) the close of the New York Stock Exchange on days that the Stock Exchange closes before 4:00 p.m. Otherwise, your transfer request will be effective on the next Business Day. The telephone transfer privilege is available automatically, and does not require your written election. We will require personal identifying information to process a request for a transfer made by telephone. We will not be liable for following instructions communicated by telephone that we reasonably believe are genuine.
Your transfer request will be effective as of the close of the Business Day if we receive your transfer request before the earlier of (a) 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on a Business Day, or (b) the close of the New York Stock Exchange on days that the Stock Exchange closes before 4:00 p.m. Otherwise, your transfer request will be effective on the next Business Day.
     Market Timers
The Contracts are not designed for professional market timing organizations or other entities using programmed and frequent transfers. If you wish to employ such strategies, you should not purchase a Contract. Accordingly, transfers may be subject to restrictions if exercised by a market timing firm or any other third party authorized to initiate transfer transactions on behalf of multiple Participants. In imposing such restrictions, we may, among other things, not accept (1) the transfer instructions of any agent acting under a power of attorney on behalf of more than one Participant, or (2) the transfer instructions of individual Participants who have executed preauthorized transfer forms
that are submitted at the same time by market timing firms or other third parties on behalf of more than one Participant. We will not impose these restrictions unless our actions are reasonably intended to prevent the use of such transfers in a manner that will disadvantage or potentially impair the Contract rights of other Participants.
In addition, the Series Fund has reserved the right to temporarily or permanently refuse exchange requests from the Variable Account if, in MFS' judgment, a Fund would be unable to invest effectively in accordance with its investment objective and policies, or would otherwise potentially be adversely affected. In particular, a pattern of exchanges that coincide with a market timing strategy may be disruptive to a Fund and therefore may be refused. Accordingly, the Variable Account may not be in a position to effectuate transfers and may refuse transfer requests without prior notice. We also reserve the right, for similar reasons, to refuse or delay exchange requests involving transfers to or from the Fixed Account.
Waivers; Reduced Charges; Credits; Special Guaranteed Interest Rates
We may reduce or waive the withdrawal charge, mortality and expense risk charges, the administrative service fee or the annual Account Fee, credit additional amounts, grant special Guaranteed Interest Rates in certain situations, or offer other options or benefits. These situations may include sales of Contracts (1) where selling and/or maintenance costs associated with the Contracts are reduced, such as the sale of several Contracts to the same Participant, sales of large Contracts, and certain group sales, and (2) to officers, directors and employees of the
Company or its affiliates, registered representatives and employees of broker-dealers with a current selling agreement with the Company and affiliates of such representatives and broker-dealers, employees of affiliated asset management firms, and persons who have retired from such positions ("Eligible Employees") and immediate family members of Eligible Employees. Eligible Employees and their immediate family members may also purchase a Contract without regard to minimum Purchase Payment requirements. For other situations in which withdrawal charges may be waived, see "Withdrawals, Withdrawal Charge and Market Value Adjustment."
Optional Programs
     Dollar-Cost Averaging
Dollar-cost averaging allows you to invest gradually, over time, in up to 12 Sub-Accounts. You may select a dollar-cost averaging program at no extra charge by allocating a minimum of $1,000 to a designated Sub-Account or to a Guarantee Period we make available in connection with the program. Amounts allocated to the Fixed Account under the program will earn interest at a rate declared by the Company for the Guarantee Period you select. Previously applied amounts may not be transferred to a Guarantee Period made available in connection with this program. At regular time intervals, we will transfer the same amount automatically to one or more Sub-Accounts that you choose, up to a maximum of 12 Sub-Accounts. The program continues until your Account Value allocated to the program is depleted or you elect to stop the program. The final amount transferred from the Fixed Account
will include all interest earned.
No Market Value Adjustment (either positive or negative) will apply to amounts automatically transferred from the Fixed Account under the dollar-cost averaging program. However, if you discontinue or alter the program prior to completion, amounts remaining in the Fixed Account will be transferred to the Money Market Fund investment option under the Contract, unless you instruct us otherwise, and the Market Value Adjustment will be applied. Any new allocation of a Purchase Payment to the program will be treated as commencing a new dollar-cost averaging program and is subject to the $1,000 minimum.
The main objective of a dollar-cost averaging program is to minimize the impact of short-term price fluctuations on Account Value. In general, since you transfer the same dollar amount to the variable investment options at set intervals, dollar-cost averaging allows you to purchase more Variable Accumulation Units (and, indirectly, more Fund shares) when prices are low and fewer Variable Accumulation Units (and, indirectly, fewer Fund shares) when prices are high. Therefore, you may achieve a lower average cost per Variable Accumulation Unit over the long term. A dollar-cost averaging program allows you to take advantage of market fluctuations. However, it is important to understand that a dollar-cost averaging program does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. We do not allow transfers into any of the Guarantee Periods.
     Asset Allocation
One or more asset allocation programs may be available in connection with the Contract, at no extra charge. Asset allocation is the process of investing in different asset classes -- such as equity funds, fixed income funds, and money market funds -- depending on your personal investment goals, tolerance for risk, and investment time horizon. By spreading your money among a variety of asset classes, you may be able to reduce the risk and volatility of investing, although there are no guarantees, and asset allocation does not insure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Currently, you may select one of the available asset allocation models, each of which represents a combination of Sub-Accounts with a different level of risk. These models, as well as the terms and conditions of the asset allocation program, are fully described in a separate brochure. We may add or delete programs in the future.
If you elect an asset allocation program, we will automatically allocate your Purchase Payments among the Sub-Accounts represented in the model you choose. By electing an asset allocation program, you thereby authorize us to automatically reallocate your investment options, as determined by the terms of the asset allocation program, to reflect the current composition of the model you have selected, without further instruction, until we receive notification that you wish to terminate the program, or choose a different model.
     Systematic Withdrawal Program
If you have an Account Value of $10,000 or more, you may select our Systematic Withdrawal Program.
Under this program, you determine the amount and frequency of regular withdrawals you would like to receive from your Fixed Account Value and/or Variable Account Value and we will effect them automatically. The withdrawals under this program may be subject to surrender charges or a Market Value Adjustment. They may also be included as income and subject to a 10% federal tax penalty. You should consult your tax adviser before choosing this option.
You may change or stop this program at any time, by written notice to us.
     Portfolio Rebalancing Program
Under the Portfolio Rebalancing Program, we transfer funds among all Sub-Accounts to maintain the percentage allocation you have selected among these Sub-Accounts. At your election, we will make these transfers on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis.
Portfolio Rebalancing does not permit transfers to or from any Guarantee Period.
     Secured Future Program
Under the Secured Future Program, we divide your Purchase Payments between the Fixed Account and the Variable Account. For the Fixed Account portion, you choose a Guarantee Period from among those we offer. We then allocate to that Guarantee Period the portion of your Purchase Payment necessary so that, at the end of the Guarantee Period, your Fixed Account allocation, including interest, will equal the entire amount of your original Purchase Payment. The remainder of the original Purchase Payment will be invested in the Sub-Accounts of your choice. At the end of the Guarantee Period, you will be guaranteed the amount of your original Purchase Payment (assuming no withdrawals), plus you will have the benefit, if any, of the investment performance of the Sub-Accounts you have chosen.
WITHDRAWALS, WITHDRAWAL CHARGE AND MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENT
Cash Withdrawals
     Requesting a Withdrawal
At any time during the Accumulation Phase, you may withdraw in cash all or any portion of your Account Value. To make a withdrawal, you must send us a written request at our Annuity Mailing Address. Your request must specify whether you want to withdraw the entire amount of your Account or, if less, the amount you wish to receive.
All withdrawals may be subject to a withdrawal charge (see "Withdrawal Charge"), and withdrawals from your Fixed Account Value also may be subject to a Market Value Adjustment (see "Market Value Adjustment"). Withdrawals also may have adverse income tax consequences, including a 10% penalty tax (see "Tax Considerations"). You should carefully consider these tax consequences before requesting a cash withdrawal.
     Full Withdrawals
If you request a full withdrawal, we calculate the amount we will pay you as follows: We start with the total value of your Account at the end of the Valuation Period during which we receive your withdrawal request; we deduct the Account Fee for the Account Year in which the withdrawal is made; we add or subtract the amount of any Market Value Adjustment applicable to your Fixed Account Value; and finally, we deduct any applicable withdrawal charge.
A full withdrawal results in the surrender of your Contract, and cancellation of all rights and privileges under your Contract.
     Partial Withdrawals
If you request a partial withdrawal, we will pay you the actual amount specified in your request and then adjust the value of your Account by deducting the amount paid, adding or deducting any Market Value Adjustment applicable to amounts withdrawn from the Fixed Account, and deducting any applicable withdrawal charge.
You may specify the amount you want withdrawn from each Sub-Account and/or Guarantee Amount to which your Account is allocated. If you do not so specify, we will deduct the total amount you request pro rata, based on your Account Value at the end of the Valuation Period during which we receive your request.
If you request a partial withdrawal that would result in your Account Value being reduced to an amount less than the Account Fee for the Account Year in which you make the withdrawal, we will treat it as a request for a full withdrawal.
     Time of Payment
We will pay you the applicable amount of any full or partial withdrawal within 7 days after we receive your withdrawal request, except in cases where we are permitted, and choose, to defer payment under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and applicable state insurance law. Currently, we may defer payment of amounts you withdraw from the Variable Account only for the following periods:


-

When the New York Stock Exchange is closed (except weekends and holidays) or when trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted;


 

 


-

When it is not reasonably practical to dispose of securities held by a Fund or to determine the value of the net assets of a Fund, because an emergency exists; or


 

 


-

When an SEC order permits us to defer payment for the protection of Participants.


We also may defer payment of amounts you withdraw from the Fixed Account for up to 6 months from the date we receive your withdrawal request. We do not pay interest on the amount of any payments we defer.
     Withdrawal Restrictions for Qualified Plans
If your Contract is a Qualified Contract, you should carefully check the terms of your retirement plan for limitations and restrictions on cash withdrawals.
Special restrictions apply to withdrawals from Contracts used for Section 403(b) annuities (see "Tax Considerations -- Tax-Sheltered Annuities").
Withdrawal Charge
We do not deduct any sales charge from your Purchase Payments when they are made. However, we may impose a withdrawal charge (known as a "contingent deferred sales charge") on certain amounts you withdraw. We impose this charge to defray some of our expenses related to the sale of the Contracts, such as commissions we pay to agents, the cost of sales literature, and other promotional costs and transaction expenses.
     Free Withdrawal Amount
In each Account Year you may withdraw a portion of your Account Value -- which we call the "free withdrawal amount" -- before incurring the withdrawal charge.
The "free withdrawal amount" is equal to 10% of the amount of all Purchase Payments you have made. After the fourth Account Anniversary, any amount you withdraw is free of withdrawal charges.
The "free withdrawal amount" that you do not use in an Account Year is not cumulative. In other words, it will not be carried forward or available for use in future Account Years.
For an example of how we calculate the "free withdrawal amount," see Appendix B.
     Withdrawal Charge on Purchase Payments
If you withdraw more than the free withdrawal amount in any Account Year, we consider the excess amount to be withdrawn first from Payments that you have not previously withdrawn. We impose the withdrawal charge on the amount of these Payments. Thus, the maximum amount on which we will impose the withdrawal charge in any year will never be more than the total of all Payments that you have not previously withdrawn.
The amount of your withdrawal, if any, that exceeds the total of the free withdrawal amount plus the aggregate amount of all Payments not previously withdrawn, is not subject to the withdrawal charge.
     Order of Withdrawal
When you make a withdrawal, we consider the free withdrawal amount to be withdrawn first. We consider Purchase Payments that you have not already withdrawn to be withdrawn next. Once all Purchase Payments are withdrawn, the balance withdrawn is considered to be earnings and is not subject to a withdrawal charge.
     Calculation of Withdrawal Charge
We calculate the amount of the withdrawal charge by multiplying the amount you withdraw by a percentage. As set forth below, the percentage decreases according to the number of complete Account Years since your Contract Date. After your fourth Account Anniversary, any amount you withdraw is free of withdrawal charges.

The withdrawal charge will never be greater than 6% of the excess of your Account Value over the "free withdrawal amount," as defined above.
For a Group Contract, we may modify the withdrawal charges and limits, upon notice to the Owner of the Group Contract. However, any modification will apply only to Accounts established after the date of the modification.
For additional examples of how we calculate withdrawal charges, see Appendix B.
Types of Withdrawals Not Subject to Withdrawal Charge
     Nursing Home Waiver
If approved by your state, we will waive the withdrawal charge for a full or partial withdrawal if:


-

at least one year has passed since we issued your Contract, and


 

 


-

you are confined to an eligible nursing home and have been confined there for at least the preceding 180 days, or any shorter period required by your state.


An "eligible nursing home" means a licensed hospital or licensed skilled or intermediate care nursing facility at which medical treatment is available on a daily basis and daily medical records are kept for each patient. You must provide us evidence of confinement in the form we determine.
     Minimum Distributions
For each Qualified Contract, the free withdrawal amount in any Account Year will be the greater of the free withdrawal amount described above or any amounts required to be withdrawn to comply with the minimum distribution requirement of the Internal Revenue Code. This waiver of the withdrawal charge applies only to the portion of the required minimum distribution attributable to that Qualified Contract.
     Other Withdrawals
We do not impose the withdrawal charge on amounts you apply to provide an annuity, amounts we pay as a death benefit, except under the Cash Surrender method, or amounts you transfer among the Sub-Accounts, between the Sub-Accounts and the Fixed Account, or within the Fixed Account.
Market Value Adjustment
If permitted under the laws of your state, we will apply a Market Value Adjustment if you withdraw or transfer amounts from your Fixed Account Value more than 30 days before the end of the applicable Guarantee Period. For this purpose, using Fixed Account Value to provide an annuity is considered a withdrawal, and the Market Value Adjustment will apply. However, we will not apply the Market Value Adjustment to automatic transfers to a Sub-Account from a Guarantee Period as part of our dollar-cost averaging program.
We apply the Market Value Adjustment separately to each Guarantee Amount in the Fixed Account, that is to each separate allocation you have made to a Guarantee Period together with interest credited on that allocation. However, we do not apply the adjustment to the amount of interest credited during your current Account Year. Any withdrawal from a Guarantee Amount is attributed first to such interest.
A Market Value Adjustment may decrease, increase or have no effect on your Account Value. This will depend on changes in interest rates since you made your allocation to the Guarantee Period and the length of time remaining in the Guarantee Period. In general, if the Guaranteed Interest Rate we currently declare for Guarantee Periods equal to the balance of your Guarantee Period (or your entire Guarantee Period for Guarantee Periods of less than one year) is higher than your Guaranteed Interest Rate, the Market Value Adjustment is likely to decrease your Account Value. If our current Guaranteed Interest Rate is lower, the Market Value Adjustment is likely to increase your Account Value.
We determine the amount of the Market Value Adjustment by multiplying the amount that is subject to the adjustment by the following formula:
[(1 + I) / (1 + J + b)] ^ (N/12)   -1
where:


I

is the Guaranteed Interest Rate applicable to the Guarantee Amount from which you withdraw, transfer or annuitize;


 

 


J

is the Guaranteed Interest Rate we declare at the time of your withdrawal, transfer or annuitization for Guarantee Periods equal to the length of time remaining in the Guarantee Period applicable to your Guarantee Amount, rounded to the next higher number of complete years, for Guarantee Periods of one year or more. For any Guarantee Periods of less than one year, J is the Guaranteed Interest Rate we declare at the time of your withdrawal, transfer or annuitization for a Guarantee Period of the same length as your Guarantee Period. If, at that time, we do not offer the applicable Guarantee Period we will use an interest rate determined by straight-line interpolation of the Guaranteed Interest Rates for the Guarantee Periods we do offer;




N

is the number of complete months remaining in your Guarantee Period; and


 

 


b

is a factor that currently is 0%, but that in the future we may increase to up to 0.25%. Any increase would be applicable only to Participants who purchase their Contracts after the date of that increase. The "b" factor is the amount that will be used to cover market volatility (i.e., credit risk), basis risk, and /or liquidity costs.


We will apply the Market Value Adjustment to the amount being withdrawn after deduction of any Account Fee, if applicable, but before we impose any withdrawal charge on the amount withdrawn.
For examples of how we calculate the Market Value Adjustment, see Appendix B.
CONTRACT CHARGES
Account Fee
During the Accumulation Phase of your Contract, we will deduct from your Account an annual Account Fee of $50 to help cover the administrative expenses we incur related to the issuance of Contracts and the maintenance of Accounts. We deduct the Account Fee on each Account Anniversary. We deduct the Account Fee pro rata from each Sub-Account and each Guarantee Period, based on the allocation of your Account Value on your Account Anniversary.
We will not charge the Account Fee if:


(1)

your Account has been allocated only to the Fixed Account during the applicable Account Year; or


 

 


(2)

your Account Value is $100,000 or more on your Account Anniversary.


If you make a full withdrawal of your Account, we will deduct the full amount of the Account Fee at the time of the withdrawal. In addition, on the Annuity Commencement Date we will deduct a pro rata portion of the Account Fee to reflect the time elapsed between the last Account Anniversary and the day before the Annuity Commencement Date.
After the Annuity Commencement Date, we will deduct an annual Account Fee of $50 in the aggregate in equal amounts from each Variable Annuity payment we make during the year. We do not deduct any Account Fee from Fixed Annuity payments.
Administrative Expense Charge
We deduct an administrative expense charge from the assets of the Variable Account at an annual effective rate equal to 0.15% during both the Accumulation Phase and the Income Phase. This charge is designed to reimburse us for expenses we incur in administering the Contracts, Participant Accounts and the Variable Account that are not covered by the annual Account Fee.
Mortality and Expense Risk Charge
During both the Accumulation Phase and the Income Phase, we deduct a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Variable Account at an effective annual rate equal to 1.20%, if your initial Purchase Payment was less than $1,000,000, or 0.95% if your initial Purchase Payment was $1,000,000 or more. The mortality risk we assume arises from our contractual obligation to continue to make annuity payments to each Annuitant, regardless of how long the Annuitant lives and regardless of how long all Annuitants as a group live. This obligation assures each Annuitant that neither the longevity of fellow Annuitants nor an improvement in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect on the amount of any annuity payment received under the Contract. The mortality risk also arises from our contractual obligation to pay a death benefit upon the death of the Participant
prior to the Annuity Commencement Date. The expense risk we assume is the risk that the annual Account Fee and the administrative expense charge we assess under the Contract may be insufficient to cover the actual total administrative expenses we incur. If the amount of the charge is insufficient to cover the mortality and expense risks, we will bear the loss. If the amount of the charge is more than sufficient to cover the risks, we will make a profit on the charge. We may use this profit for any proper corporate purpose, including the payment of marketing and distribution expenses for the Contract.
Charges For Optional Death Benefit Riders
If you elect an optional death benefit rider, we will deduct, during the Accumulation Phase, a charge from the assets of the Variable Account depending upon which of the optional death benefit rider(s) you elect.

*As defined below
Premium Taxes
Some states and local jurisdictions impose a premium tax on us that is equal to a specified percentage of the Purchase Payments you make. In many states there is no premium tax. We believe that the amounts of applicable premium taxes currently range from 0% to 3.5%. You should consult a tax adviser to find out if your state imposes a premium tax and the amount of any tax.
In order to reimburse us for the premium tax we may pay on Purchase Payments, our policy is to deduct the amount of such taxes from the amount you apply to provide an annuity at the time of annuitization. However, we reserve the right to deduct the amount of any applicable tax from your Account at any time, including at the time you make a Purchase Payment or make a full or partial withdrawal. We do not make any profit on the deductions we make to reimburse premium taxes.
Fund Expenses
There are fees and charges deducted from each Fund. These fees and expenses are described in the Fund prospectus(es) and related Statements of Additional Information.
Modification in the Case of Group Contracts
For Group Contracts, we may modify the annual Account Fee, the administrative expense charge and the mortality and expense risk charge upon notice to Owners. However, such modification will apply only with respect to Participant Accounts established after the effective date of the modification.
DEATH BENEFIT
If the Covered Person dies during the Accumulation Phase, we will pay a death benefit to your Beneficiary, using the payment method elected (a single cash payment or one of our Annuity Options). If the Beneficiary is not living on the date of death of the Covered Person, we will pay the death benefit in one sum to your estate. We do not pay a death benefit if the Covered Person dies during the Income Phase. However, the Beneficiary will receive any annuity payments provided under an Annuity Option that is in effect. If your Contract names more than one Covered Person, we will pay the death benefit upon the first death of such Covered Persons.
Amount of Death Benefit
To calculate the amount of the death benefit, we use a "Death Benefit Date." The Death Benefit Date is the date we receive proof of the death of the Covered Person in an acceptable form ("Due Proof of Death") if you have elected a death benefit payment method before the death of the Covered Person and it remains in effect. Otherwise, the Death Benefit Date is the later of the date we receive Due Proof of Death or the date we receive the Beneficiary's election of either payment method or, if the Beneficiary is your spouse, Contract continuation. If we do not receive the Beneficiary's election within 60 days after we receive Due Proof of Death, we reserve the right to provide a lump sum to your Beneficiary.
The amount of the death benefit is determined as of the Death Benefit Date.
The Basic Death Benefit
In general, if you were 85 or younger on the date we accepted your Application, the death benefit will be the greatest of the following amounts:


1.

Your Account Value for the Valuation Period during which the Death Benefit Date occurs;


 

 


2.

The amount we would pay if you had surrendered your entire Account on the Death Benefit Date; and


 

 


3.

Your total Purchase Payments (adjusted for partial withdrawals as described in "Calculating the Death Benefit") as of the Death Benefit Date.


For examples of how to calculate this basic death benefit, see Appendix C.
If you were 86 or older on your Contract Date, the death benefit is equal to amount (2) above. Because this amount will reflect any applicable withdrawal charges and Market Value Adjustment, it may be less than your Account Value.
Optional Death Benefit Riders
Subject to availability in your state, you may enhance the "Basic Death Benefit" by electing one or more of the following optional death benefit riders. You must make your election before the date on which your Contract becomes effective. You will pay a charge for each optional death benefit rider you elect. (For a description of these charges, see "Charges for Optional Death Benefit Riders.") The riders are available only if you are younger than 80 on the Contract Date. Any optional death benefit election may not be changed after the Contract is issued. The death benefit under all optional death benefit riders will be adjusted for all partial withdrawals as described in the Prospectus
under the heading "Calculating the Death Benefit." For examples of how the death benefit is calculated under the optional death benefit riders, see Appendices D -- H.
     Maximum Anniversary Account Value ("MAV") Rider

Under this rider, the death benefit will be the greater of:


-

the amount payable under the "basic death benefit" (above), or


 

 


-

your highest Account Value on any Account Anniversary before your 81st birthday, adjusted for any subsequent Purchase Payments, partial withdrawals and charges made between that Account Anniversary and the Death Benefit Date.


     5% Premium Roll-Up ("5% Roll-Up") Rider

Under this rider, the death benefit will be the greater of:


-

the amount payable under the "basic death benefit" (above), or


 

 


-

the sum of your total Purchase Payments plus interest accruals, adjusted for partial withdrawals.


Under this rider, interest accrues at a rate of 5% per year on Purchase Payments and transfers to the Variable Account while they remain in the Variable Account. The 5% interest accruals will continue until the earlier of:


-

the first day of the month following your 80th birthday, or


 

 


-

the day the death benefit amount under this rider equals twice the total of your Purchase Payments and transferred amounts, adjusted for withdrawals.


     Earnings Enhancement ("EEB") Rider
If you elect this EEB Rider, your death benefit will be the amount payable under the basic death benefit, PLUS the "EEB amount." Calculated as of your Death Benefit Date, the "EEB amount" is determined as follows:


-

If you are 69 or younger on your Contract Date, the "EEB amount" will be 40% of the difference between your Account Value and your Net Purchase Payments, up to a cap of 40% of the Net Purchase Payments made prior to your death.


 

 


-

If you are between the ages of 70 and 79 on your Contract Date, the "EEB amount" will be 25% of the difference between your Account Value and your Net Purchase Payments, up to a cap of 25% of the Net Purchase Payments prior to your death.


     Earnings Enhancement Plus ("EEB Plus") Rider
If you elect this EEB Plus Rider, your death benefit will be the amount payable under the basic death benefit, PLUS the "EEB Plus amount." Calculated as of the Death Benefit Date, the "EEB Plus amount" is determined as follows:


-

If you are 69 or younger on your Contract Date, the "EEB Plus amount" will be 40% of the difference between your Account Value and your Net Purchase Payments, up to a cap of 100% of the Net Purchase Payments made prior to your death. After the 7th Contract year, the cap is 100% of the difference between your Net Purchase Payments and any Purchase Payments made within the twelve months prior to your death.


 

 


-

If you are between the ages of 70 and 79 on your Contract Date, the "EEB Plus amount" will be 25% of the difference between your Account Value and your Net Purchase Payments, up to a cap of 40% of the Net Purchase Payments made prior to your death. After the 7th Contract year, the cap is 40% of the difference between your Net Purchase Payments and any Purchase Payments made in the twelve months prior to your death.


     Earnings Enhancement Plus with MAV ("EEB Plus MAV") Rider
If you elect this EEB Plus MAV Rider, your death benefit will be the death benefit payable under the MAV Rider PLUS the "EEB Plus MAV amount." Calculated as of your Death Benefit Date, the "EEB Plus MAV amount" is as follows:


-

If you are 69 or younger on your Contract Date, the "EEB Plus MAV amount" will be 40% of the difference between the death benefit payable under the MAV Rider and your Net Purchase Payments, up to a cap of 100% of Net Purchase Payments made prior to your death. After your 7th Contract year, the cap is 100% of the difference between your Net Purchase Payments and any Purchase Payments made in the twelve months prior to your death.


 

 


-

If you are between the ages of 70 and 79 on your Contract Date, the "EEB Plus MAV amount" will be 25% of the difference between the death benefit payable under the MAV Rider and your Net Purchase Payments, up to a cap of 40% of Net Purchase Payments made prior to your death. After your 7th Contract year, the cap is 40% of the difference between your Net Purchase Payments and any Purchase Payments made in the twelve months prior to your death.


     Earnings Enhancement Plus with 5% Roll-Up ("EEB Plus 5% Roll-Up") Rider
If you elect this EEB Plus 5% Roll-Up Rider, your death benefit will be the death benefit payable under the 5% Roll-Up Rider PLUS the "EEB Plus 5% Roll-Up amount." Calculated as of your Death Benefit Date, the "EEB Plus 5% Roll-Up amount" is determined as follows:


-

If you are 69 or younger on your Contract Date, the "EEB Plus 5% Roll-Up amount" will be 40% of the difference between the death benefit payable under the 5% Roll-Up Rider and your Net Purchase Payments, up to a cap of 100% of Net Purchase Payments made prior to your death. After your 7th Contract year, the cap is 100% of the difference between your Net Purchase Payments and any Purchase Payments made in the twelve months prior to your death.


 

 


-

If you are between the ages of 70 and 79 on your Contract Date, the "EEB Plus 5% Roll-Up amount" will be 25% of the difference between the death benefit payable under the 5% Roll-Up Rider and your Net Purchase Payments, up to a cap of 40% of Net Purchase Payments made prior to your death. After your 7th Contract year, the cap is 40% of the difference between your Net Purchase Payments and any Purchase Payments made in the twelve months prior to your death.


     Selecting Multiple Death Benefit Riders
The MAV Rider, the 5% Roll-Up Rider, and the EEB Rider can be combined. If you elect more than one of these three optional death benefit riders, your death benefit will be calculated as follows:


-

MAV Rider combined with 5% Roll-Up Rider: The death benefit will equal the greater of the death benefit under the MAV Rider and the death benefit under the 5% Roll-Up Rider.


 

 


-

MAV Rider combined with EEB Rider: The death benefit will equal the death benefit under the MAV Rider, plus the "EEB amount." The "EEB amount" is calculated using the Account Value before the application of the MAV Rider.


 

 


-

EEB Rider combined with 5% Roll-Up Rider: The death benefit will equal the death benefit under the 5% Roll-Up Rider, plus the "EEB amount." The "EEB amount" is calculated using the Account Value before the application of the 5% Roll-Up Rider.


 

 


-

MAV Rider, the 5% Roll-Up Rider and the EEB Rider: The death benefit will equal the greater of the death benefit under the MAV Rider or the death benefit under the 5% Roll-Up Rider, plus the "EEB amount." The "EEB amount" is calculated using the Account Value before the application of the 5% Roll-Up Rider and the MAV Rider.


The EEB Plus, EEB Plus MAV, and EEB Plus 5% Roll-Up Riders are designed to be "comprehensive" riders and may not be combined with each other or with any of the other death benefit riders.
Spousal Continuance
If your spouse is your Beneficiary, upon your death your spouse may elect to continue the Contract as the Participant, rather than receive the death benefit amount. In that case, we will not pay a death benefit, but the Contract's Account Value will be equal to your Contract's death benefit amount, as defined under the "Basic Death Benefit" or any optional death benefit rider you have selected. All Contract provisions, including any optional death benefit riders you have selected, will continue as if your spouse had purchased the Contract
on the Death Benefit Date with a deposit equal to the death benefit amount. For purposes of calculating death benefits and expenses from that date forward, your spouse's age on the original effective date of the Contract will be used. Upon surrender or annuitization, this step-up to the spouse will not be treated as premium, but will be treated as income.
Calculating the Death Benefit
In calculating the death benefit amount payable under option (3) of the "Basic Death Benefit" or any of the optional death benefit riders, any partial withdrawals will reduce the death benefit amount to an amount equal to the death benefit amount immediately before the withdrawal multiplied by the ratio of the Account Value immediately after the withdrawal to the Account Value immediately before the withdrawal.
If the death benefit is the amount payable under options (2) or (3) of the "Basic Death Benefit" or under any of the optional death benefit riders, your Account Value may be increased by the excess, if any, of that amount over option (1) of the "Basic Death Benefit." Any such increase will be allocated to the Sub-Accounts in proportion to your Account Value in those Sub-Accounts on the Death Benefit Date. Such increase will be made only if the Beneficiary elects to annuitize, elects to defer annuitization, or elects to continue the Contract. Also, any portion of this new Account Value attributed to the Fixed Account will be transferred to the available Money Market Fund investment option (without the application of a Market Value Adjustment). If your spouse, as the named Beneficiary, elects to continue the Contract
after your death, your spouse may transfer any such Fixed Account portion back to the Fixed Account and begin a new Guarantee Period.
Method of Paying Death Benefit
The death benefit may be paid in a single cash payment or as an annuity (either fixed, variable or a combination), under one or more of our Annuity Options. We describe the Annuity Options in this Prospectus under "The Income Phase -- Annuity Provisions."
During the Accumulation Phase, you may elect the method of payment for the death benefit. If no such election is in effect on the date of your death, the Beneficiary may elect either a single cash payment or an annuity. If the Beneficiary is your spouse, the Beneficiary may elect to continue the Contract. These elections are made by sending us a completed election form, which we will provide. If we do not receive the Beneficiary's election within 60 days after we receive Due Proof of Death, we will pay the death benefit in a single cash payment.
If we pay the death benefit in the form of an Annuity Option, the Beneficiary becomes the Annuitant/Payee under the terms of that Annuity Option.
Non-Qualified Contracts
If your Contract is a Non-Qualified Contract, special distribution rules apply to the payment of the death benefit. The amount of the death benefit must be distributed either (1) as a lump sum within 5 years after your death, or (2) if in the form of an annuity, over a period not greater than the life or expected life of the "designated beneficiary" within the meaning of Section 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code, with payments beginning no later than one year after your death.
The person you have named as Beneficiary under your Contract, if any, will be the "designated beneficiary." If the named Beneficiary is not living and no contingent beneficiary has been named, the surviving Participant, if any, or the estate of the deceased Participant automatically becomes the designated beneficiary.
If the designated beneficiary is your surviving spouse, your spouse may continue the Contract in his or her own name as Participant. To make this election, your spouse must give us written notification within 60 days after we receive Due Proof of Death. The special distribution rules will then apply on the death of your spouse. To understand what happens when your spouse continues the Contract, see "Spousal Continuance," above.
During the Income Phase, if the Annuitant dies, the remaining value of the Annuity Option in place must be distributed at least as rapidly as the method of distribution under that option.
If the Participant is not a natural person, these distribution rules apply upon the death of any Annuitant.
Payments made in contravention of these special rules would adversely affect the treatment of the Contracts as annuity contracts under the Internal Revenue Code. Neither you nor the Beneficiary may exercise rights that would have that effect.
Selection and Change of Beneficiary
You select your Beneficiary in your Application. You may change your Beneficiary at any time by sending us written notice on our required form, unless you previously made an irrevocable Beneficiary designation. A new Beneficiary designation is not effective until we record the change.
Payment of Death Benefit
Payment of the death benefit in cash will be made within 7 days of the Death Benefit Date, except if we are permitted to defer payment in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940. If an Annuity Option is elected, the Annuity Commencement Date will be the first day of the second calendar month following the Death Benefit Date, and your Account will remain in effect until the Annuity Commencement Date.
Due Proof of Death
We accept any of the following as proof of any person's death:


-

An original certified copy of an official death certificate;


 

 


-

An original certified copy of a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction as to the finding of death; or


 

 


-

Any other proof we find satisfactory.


THE INCOME PHASE -- ANNUITY PROVISIONS
During the Income Phase, we make regular monthly annuity payments to the Annuitant.
The Income Phase of your Contract begins with the Annuity Commencement Date. On that date, we apply your Account Value, adjusted as described below, under the Annuity Option(s) you have selected, and we make the first annuity payment.
Once the Income Phase begins, no lump sum settlement option or cash withdrawals are permitted, except pursuant to Annuity Option D, Monthly Payments for a Specified Period Certain, as described below under the heading "Annuity Options," and you cannot change the Annuity Option selected. You may request a full withdrawal before the Annuity Commencement Date, which will be subject to all charges applicable on withdrawals (see "Withdrawals, Withdrawal Charge and Market Value Adjustment").
Selection of the Annuitant or Co-Annuitant
You select the Annuitant in your Application. The Annuitant is the person who receives annuity payments during the Income Phase and on whose life these payments are based. In your Contract, the Annuity Option(s) refer to the Annuitant as the "Payee." If you name someone other than yourself as Annuitant and the Annuitant dies before the Income Phase, you become the Annuitant.
In a Non-Qualified Contract, if you name someone other than yourself as Annuitant, you may also select a Co-Annuitant, who will become the new Annuitant if the original Annuitant dies before the Income Phase. If both the Annuitant and Co-Annuitant die before the Income Phase, you become the Annuitant. If you have named both an Annuitant and a Co-Annuitant, you may designate one of them to become the sole Annuitant as of the Annuity Commencement Date, if both are living at that time. If you have not made that designation on the 30th day before the Annuity Commencement Date, and both the Annuitant and the Co-Annuitant are still living, the Co-Annuitant will become the Annuitant.
When an Annuity Option has been selected as the method of paying the death benefit, the Beneficiary is the Payee of the annuity payment.
Selection of the Annuity Commencement Date
You select the Annuity Commencement Date in your Application. The following restrictions apply to the date you may select:


-

The earliest possible Annuity Commencement Date is the first day of the second month following your Contract Date.


 

 


-

The latest possible Annuity Commencement Date is the first day of the month following the Annuitant's 95th birthday. If there is a Co-Annuitant, the Annuity Commencement Date applies to the younger of the Annuitant and Co-Annuitant.


 

 


-

The Annuity Commencement Date must always be the first day of a month.


You may change the Annuity Commencement Date from time to time by sending us written notice, with the following additional limitations:


-

We must receive your notice at least 30 days before the current Annuity Commencement Date.


 

 


-

The new Annuity Commencement Date must be at least 30 days after we receive the notice.


There may be other restrictions on your selection of the Annuity Commencement Date imposed by your retirement plan or applicable law. In most situations, current law requires that for a Qualified Contract, certain minimum distributions must commence no later than April 1 following the year the Annuitant reaches age 70 1/2 (or, for Qualified Contracts other than IRAs, no later than April 1 following the year the Annuitant retires, if later than the year the Annuitant reaches age 70 1/2).
Annuity Options
We offer the following Annuity Options for payments during the Income Phase. Each Annuity Option may be selected for a Variable Annuity, a Fixed Annuity, or a combination of both. We may also agree to other settlement options, at our discretion.
     Annuity Option A -- Life Annuity
We provide monthly payments during the lifetime of the Annuitant. Annuity payments stop when the Annuitant dies. There is no provision for continuation of any payments to a Beneficiary.
     Annuity Option B -- Life Annuity with 60, 120, 180 Or 240 Monthly Payments Certain
We make monthly payments during the lifetime of the Annuitant. In addition, we guarantee that the Beneficiary will receive monthly payments for the remainder of the period certain, if the Annuitant dies during that period. The election of a longer period results in smaller monthly payments. If no Beneficiary is designated, we pay the discounted value of the remaining payments in one sum to the Annuitant's estate. The Beneficiary may also elect to receive the discounted value of the remaining payments in one sum. The discount rate for a Variable Annuity will be the assumed interest rate in effect; the discount rate for a Fixed Annuity will be based on the interest rate we used to determine the amount of each payment.
     Annuity Option C -- Joint and Survivor Annuity
We make monthly payments during the lifetime of the Annuitant and another person you designate and during the lifetime of the survivor of the two. We stop making payments when the survivor dies. There is no provision for continuance of any payments to a Beneficiary.
     Annuity Option D -- Monthly Payments for a Specified Period Certain
We make monthly payments for a specified period of time from 5 to 30 years, as you elect. If payments under this option are paid on a variable annuity basis, the Annuitant may elect to receive, at any time, some or all of the discounted value of the remaining payments, less any applicable withdrawal charge; the discount rate for this purpose will be the assumed interest rate in effect. If the Annuitant dies during the period selected, the remaining income payments are made as described under Annuity Option B. The election of this Annuity Option may result in the imposition of a penalty tax. The 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9-year periods certain are not available if your Account has been issued within the past 4 years.
Selection of Annuity Option
You select one or more of the Annuity Options, which you may change from time to time during the Accumulation Phase, as long as we receive your selection or change in writing at least 30 days before the Annuity Commencement Date. If we have not received your written selection on the 30th day before the Annuity Commencement Date, you will receive Annuity Option B, for a life annuity with 120 monthly payments certain.
You may specify the proportion of your Adjusted Account Value you wish to provide a Variable Annuity or a Fixed Annuity. Under a Variable Annuity, the dollar amount of payments will vary, while under a Fixed Annuity, the dollar amount of payments will remain the same. If you do not specify a Variable Annuity or a Fixed Annuity, your Adjusted Account Value will be divided between Variable Annuities and Fixed Annuities in the same proportions as your Account Value was divided between the Variable and Fixed Accounts on the Annuity Commencement Date. You may allocate your Adjusted Account Value applied to a Variable Annuity among the Sub-Accounts, or we will use your existing allocations.
There may be additional limitations on the options you may elect under your particular retirement plan or applicable law.
Remember that the Annuity Options may not be changed once annuity payments begin.
Amount of Annuity Payments
     Adjusted Account Value
The Adjusted Account Value is the amount we apply to provide a Variable Annuity and/or a Fixed Annuity. We calculate Adjusted Account Value by taking your Account Value on the Business Day just before the Annuity Commencement Date and making the following adjustments:


-

We deduct a proportional amount of the Account Fee, based on the fraction of the current Account Year that has elapsed.


 

 


-

If applicable, we apply the Market Value Adjustment to your Account Value in the Fixed Account, which may result in a deduction, an addition, or no change.


 

 


-

We deduct any applicable premium tax or similar tax if not previously deducted.


     Variable Annuity Payments
On the Annuity Commencement Date, we will exchange your Account's Variable Annuity Units for annuitization units which have annual insurance charges of 1.35% of your average daily net assets (1.10% if your initial Purchase Payment was $1,000,000 or more).
Variable Annuity payments may vary each month. We determine the dollar amount of the first payment using the portion of your Adjusted Account Value applied to a Variable Annuity and the Annuity Payment Rates in your Contract, which are based on an assumed interest rate of 3% per year, compounded annually. See "Annuity Payment Rates."
To calculate the remaining payments, we convert the amount of the first payment into Annuity Units for each Sub-Account; we determine the number of those Annuity Units by dividing the portion of the first payment attributable to the Sub-Account by the Annuity Unit Value of that Sub-Account for the Valuation Period ending just before the Annuity Commencement Date. This number of Annuity Units for each Sub-Account will remain constant (unless the Annuitant requests an exchange of Annuity Units). However, the dollar amount of the next Variable Annuity payment -- which is the sum of
the number of Annuity Units for each Sub-Account times its Annuity Unit Value for the Valuation Period ending just before the date of the payment -- will increase, decrease, or remain the same, depending on the net investment return of the Sub-Accounts.
If the net investment return of the Sub-Accounts selected is the same as the assumed interest rate of 3%, compounded annually, the payments will remain level. If the net investment return exceeds the assumed interest rate, payments will increase and, conversely, if it is less than the assumed interest rate, payments will decrease.
Please refer to the Statement of Additional Information for more information about calculating Variable Annuity Units and Variable Annuity payments, including examples of these calculations.
     Fixed Annuity Payments
Fixed Annuity payments are the same each month. We determine the dollar amount of each Fixed Annuity payment using the fixed portion of your Adjusted Account Value and the applicable Annuity Payment Rates. These will be either (1) the rates in your Contract, which are based on a minimum guaranteed interest rate of 2.5% per year, compounded annually, or (2) new rates we have published and are using on the Annuity Commencement Date, if they are more favorable. See "Annuity Payment Rates."
     Minimum Payments
If your Adjusted Account Value is less than $2,000, or the first annuity payment for any Annuity Option is less than $20, we will pay the Adjusted Account Value to the Annuitant in one payment.
Exchange of Variable Annuity Units
During the Income Phase, the Annuitant may exchange Annuity Units in one Sub-Account for Annuity Units in another Sub-Account, up to 12 times each Account Year. To make an exchange, the Annuitant sends us, at our Annuity Mailing Address, a written request stating the number of Annuity Units in the Sub-Account he or she wishes to exchange and the new Sub-Account for which Annuity Units are requested. The number of new Annuity Units will be calculated so the dollar amount of an annuity payment on the date of the exchange would not be affected. To calculate this number, we use Annuity Unit values for the Valuation Period during which we receive the exchange request.
Before exchanging Annuity Units in one Sub-Account for those in another, the Annuitant should carefully review the Fund prospectus(es) for the investment objectives and risk disclosure of the Funds in which the Sub-Accounts invest.
During the Income Phase, we permit only exchanges among Sub-Accounts. No exchanges to or from a Fixed Annuity are permitted.
Account Fee
During the Income Phase, we deduct the annual Account Fee of $50 in equal amounts from each Variable Annuity payment. We do not deduct the annual Account Fee from Fixed Annuity payments.
Annuity Payment Rates
The Contracts contain Annuity Payment Rates for each Annuity Option described in this Prospectus. The rates show, for each $1,000 applied, the dollar amount of (a) the first monthly Variable Annuity payment based on the assumed interest rate specified in the applicable Contract (3% per year, compounded annually), and (b) the monthly Fixed Annuity payment, when this payment is based on the minimum guaranteed interest rate specified in the Contract (at least 2.5% per year, compounded annually). We may change these rates under Group Contracts for Accounts established after the effective date of such change
(see "Other Contract Provisions -- Modification").
The Annuity Payment Rates may vary according to the Annuity Option elected and the adjusted age of the Annuitant. The Contracts also describe the method of determining the adjusted age of the Annuitant. The mortality table used in determining the Annuity Payment Rates for Annuity Options A, B and C is the Annuity 2000 Table.
Annuity Options as Method of Payment for Death Benefit
You or your Beneficiary may also select one or more Annuity Options to be used in the event of the Covered Person's death before the Income Phase, as described under the "Death Benefit" section of this Prospectus. In that case, your Beneficiary will be the Annuitant. The Annuity Commencement Date will be the first day of the second month beginning after the Death Benefit Date.
OTHER CONTRACT PROVISIONS
Exercise of Contract Rights
An Individual Contract belongs to the individual to whom the Contract is issued. A Group Contract belongs to the Owner. In the case of a Group Contract, the Owner may expressly reserve all Contract rights and privileges; otherwise, each Annuitant will be entitled to exercise such rights and privileges. In any case, such rights and privileges can be exercised without the consent of the Beneficiary (other than an irrevocably designated Beneficiary) or any other person. Such rights and privileges may be exercised only
during the lifetime of the Annuitant before the Annuity Commencement Date, except as the Contract otherwise provides.
The Annuitant becomes the Payee on and after the Annuity Commencement Date. The Beneficiary becomes the Payee on the death of the Covered Person prior to the Annuity Commencement Date, or on the death of the Annuitant after the Annuity Commencement Date. Such Payee may thereafter exercise such rights and privileges, if any, of ownership which continue.
Change of Ownership
Ownership of a Qualified Contract may not be transferred except to: (1) the Annuitant; (2) a trustee or successor trustee of a pension or profit sharing trust which is qualified under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code; (3) the employer of the Annuitant, provided that the Qualified Contract after transfer is maintained under the terms of a retirement plan qualified under Section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for the benefit of the Annuitant; (4) the trustee or custodian of an individual retirement account plan qualified under Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code for the benefit of the Participants under a Group Contract; or (5) as otherwise permitted from time to time by laws
and regulations governing the retirement or deferred compensation plans for which a Qualified Contract may be issued. Subject to the foregoing, a Qualified Contract may not be sold, assigned, transferred, discounted or pledged as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of an obligation or for any other purpose to any person other than the Company.
The Owner of a Non-Qualified Contract may change the ownership of the Contract prior to the Annuity Commencement Date; and each Participant, in like manner, may change the ownership interest in a Contract. A change of ownership will not be binding on us until we receive written notification. When we receive such notification, the change will be effective as of the date on which the request for change was signed by the Owner or Participant, as appropriate, but the change will be without prejudice to us on account of any payment we make or any action we take before receiving the change. If you change the Owner of a Non-Qualified Contract,
you will become immediately liable for the payment of taxes on any gain realized under the Contract prior to the change of ownership, including possible liability for a 10% federal excise tax.
Change of ownership may affect the availability of optional death benefit riders or the expenses incurred with the optional death benefit riders.
Voting of Fund Shares
We will vote Fund shares held by the Sub-Accounts at meetings of shareholders of the Funds or in connection with similar solicitations, but will follow voting instructions received from persons having the right to give voting instructions. During the Accumulation Phase, you will have the right to give voting instructions, in the case of a Group Contract where the Owner has reserved this right. During the Income Phase, the Payee -- that is the Annuitant or Beneficiary entitled to receive benefits -- is the person having such voting rights. We will vote any shares attributable to us and Fund shares for which no timely voting instructions are received in the same proportion as the shares for which we receive instructions from Owners, Participants and Payees, as applicable.
Owners of Qualified Contracts issued on a group basis may be subject to other voting provisions of the particular plan and of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Employees who contribute to plans that are funded by the Contracts may be entitled to instruct the Owners as to how to instruct us to vote the Fund shares attributable to their contributions. Such plans may also provide the additional extent, if any, to which the Owners shall follow voting instructions of persons with rights under the plans. If no voting instructions are received from any such person with respect to a particular Participant Account, the Owner may instruct the Company as to how to vote the number of Fund shares for which instructions
may be given.
Neither the Variable Account nor the Company is under any duty to provide information concerning the voting instruction rights of persons who may have such rights under plans, other than rights afforded by the Investment Company Act of 1940, or any duty to inquire as to the instructions received or the authority of Owners, Participants or others, as applicable, to instruct the voting of Fund shares. Except as the Variable Account or the Company has actual knowledge to the contrary, the instructions given by Owners under Group Contracts and Payees will be valid as they affect the Variable Account, the Company and any others having
voting instruction rights with respect to the Variable Account.
All Fund proxy material, together with an appropriate form to be used to give voting instructions, will be provided to each person having the right to give voting instructions at least 10 days prior to each meeting of the shareholders of the Fund. We will determine the number of Fund shares as to which each such person is entitled to give instructions as of the record date set by the Fund for such meeting, which is expected to be not more than 90 days prior to each such meeting. Prior to the Annuity Commencement Date, the number of Fund shares as to which voting instructions may be given to the Company is determined by dividing the value of all of the Variable Accumulation Units of the particular Sub-Account credited to the Participant Account by the net asset value of one Fund share as of the same date. On or after the Annuity Commencement Date, the number of Fund shares as to which
such instructions may be given by a Payee is determined by dividing the reserve held by the Company in the Sub-Account with respect to the particular Payee by the net asset value of a Fund share as of the same date. After the Annuity Commencement Date, the number of Fund shares as to which a Payee is entitled to give voting instructions will generally decrease due to the decrease in the reserve.
Periodic Reports
During the Accumulation Period we will send you, or such other person having voting rights, at least once during each Account Year, a statement showing the number, type and value of Accumulation Units credited to your Account and the Fixed Accumulation Value of your Account, which statement shall be accurate as of a date not more than 2 months previous to the date of mailing. These periodic statements contain important information concerning your transactions with respect to your Contract. It is your obligation to review each such statement carefully and to report to us, at the address or telephone number provided on the statement, any errors or discrepancies in the information presented therein within 60 days of the date of such statement. Unless we receive notice of any such error or discrepancy from you within such period, we may not be responsible for correcting the
error or discrepancy.
In addition, every person having voting rights will receive such reports or prospectuses concerning the Variable Account and the Funds as may be required by the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Securities Act of 1933. We will also send such statements reflecting transactions in your Account as may be required by applicable laws, rules and regulations.
Upon request, we will provide you with information regarding fixed and variable accumulation values.
Substitution of Securities
Shares of any or all Funds may not always be available for investment under the Contract. We may add or delete Funds or other investment companies as variable investment options under the Contract. We may also substitute for the shares held in any Sub-Account shares of another Fund or shares of another registered open-end investment company or unit investment trust, provided that the substitution has been approved, if required, by the SEC. In the event of any substitution pursuant to this provision, we may make appropriate endorsement to the Contract to reflect the substitution.
Change in Operation of Variable Account
At our election and subject to any necessary vote by persons having the right to give instructions with respect to the voting of Fund shares held by the Sub-Accounts, the Variable Account may be operated as a management company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or it may be deregistered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in the event registration is no longer required. Deregistration of the Variable Account requires an order by the SEC. In the event of any change in the operation of the Variable Account pursuant to this provision, we may make appropriate endorsement to the Contract to reflect the change and take such other action as may be necessary and appropriate to effect the change.
Splitting Units
We reserve the right to split or combine the value of Variable Accumulation Units, Annuity Units or any of them. In effecting any such change of unit values, strict equity will be preserved and no change will have a material effect on the benefits or other provisions of the Contract.
Modification
Upon notice to the Participant, in the case of an Individual Contract, and the Owner and Participant(s), in the case of a Group Contract (or the Payee(s) during the Income Phase), we may modify the Contract if such modification: (i) is necessary to make the Contract or the Variable Account comply with any law or regulation issued by a governmental agency to which the Company or the Variable Account is subject; (ii) is necessary to assure continued qualification of the Contract
under the Internal Revenue Code or other federal or state laws relating to retirement annuities or annuity contracts; (iii) is necessary to reflect a change in the operation of the Variable Account or the Sub-Account(s) (see "Change in Operation of Variable Account"); (iv) provides additional Variable Account and/or fixed accumulation options; or (v) as may otherwise be in the best interests of Owners, Participants, or Payees, as applicable. In the event of any such modification, we may make appropriate endorsement in the Contract to reflect such modification.
In addition, upon notice to the Owner, we may modify a Group Contract to change the withdrawal charges, Account Fee, mortality and expense risk charges, administrative expense charges, the tables used in determining the amount of the first monthly variable annuity and fixed annuity payments and the formula used to calculate the Market Value Adjustment, provided that such modification applies only to Participant Accounts established after the effective date of such modification. In order to exercise our modification rights in these particular instances, we must notify the Owner of such modification in writing. The notice shall specify the effective date of such modification which must be at least 60 days following the date we mail notice of modification. All of the charges and the annuity tables which are provided in the Group Contract
prior to any such modification will remain in effect permanently, unless improved by the Company, with respect to Participant Accounts established prior to the effective date of such modification.
Discontinuance of New Participants
We may limit or discontinue the acceptance of new Applications and the issuance of new Certificates under a Group Contract by giving 30 days prior written notice to the Owner. This will not affect rights or benefits with respect to any Participant Accounts established under such Group Contract prior to the effective date of such limitation or discontinuance.
Reservation of Rights
We reserve the right, to the extent permitted by law, to: (1) combine any 2 or more variable accounts; (2) add or delete Funds, sub-series thereof or other investment companies and corresponding Sub-Accounts; (3) add or remove Guarantee Periods available at any time for election by a Participant; and (4) restrict or eliminate any of the voting rights of Participants (or Owners) or other persons who have voting rights as to the Variable Account. Where required by law, we will obtain approval of changes from Participants or any appropriate regulatory authority. In the event of any change pursuant to this provision, we may make appropriate endorsement to the Contract to reflect the change.
Right to Return
If you are not satisfied with your Contract, you may return it by mailing or delivering it to us at our Annuity Mailing Address, as shown on the cover of this Prospectus, within 10 days after it was delivered to you. When we receive the returned Contract, it will be cancelled and we will refund to you your Account Value.
If applicable state law requires, we will return the full amount of any Purchase Payment(s) we received. State law may also require us to give you a longer "free look" period or allow you to return the Contract to your sales representative.
If you are establishing an Individual Retirement Account ("IRA"), the Internal Revenue Code requires that we give you a disclosure statement containing certain information about the Contract and applicable legal requirements. We must give you this statement on or before the date the IRA is established. If we give you the disclosure statement before the seventh day preceding the date the IRA is established, you will not have any right of revocation under the Code. If we give you the disclosure statement at a later date, then you may give us a notice of revocation at any time within 7 days after your Contract Date. Upon such revocation, we will refund your Purchase Payment(s). This right of revocation with respect to an IRA is in addition to the return privilege set forth in the preceding
paragraph. We allow a Participant establishing an IRA a "ten day free-look," notwithstanding the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
TAX CONSIDERATIONS
This section provides general information on the federal income tax consequences of ownership of a Contract based upon our understanding of current federal tax laws. Actual federal tax consequences will vary depending on, among other things, the type of retirement plan under which your Contract is issued. Also, legislation altering
the current tax treatment of annuity contracts could be enacted in the future and could apply retroactively to Contracts that were purchased before the date of enactment. We make no attempt to consider any applicable federal estate, federal gift, state, or other tax laws. We also make no guarantee regarding the federal, state, or local tax status of any Contract or any transaction involving any Contract.
You should consult a qualified tax professional for advice before purchasing a Contract or executing any other transaction (such as a rollover, distribution, withdrawal or payment) involving a Contract.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
The following discussion applies only to those Contracts issued in the United States. For a discussion of tax considerations effecting Contracts issued in Puerto Rico, see "Puerto Rico Tax Considerations," below.
     Deductibility of Purchase Payments
For federal income tax purposes, Purchase Payments made under Non-Qualified Contracts are not deductible. Under certain circumstances, Purchase Payments made under Qualified Contracts may be excludible or deductible from taxable income. Any such amounts will also be excluded from the "investment in the contract" for purposes of determining the taxable portion of any distributions from a Qualified Contract.
     Pre-Distribution Taxation of Contracts
Generally, an increase in the value of a Contract will not give rise to a current income tax liability to the Owner of a Contract or to any payee under the Contract until a distribution is received from the Contract. However, certain assignments or pledges
of a Contract or loans under a Contract will be treated as distributions to the Owner of the Contract and will accelerate the taxability of any increases in the value of a Contract.
Also, corporate (or other non-natural person) Owners of a Non-Qualified Contract will generally incur a current tax liability on Account Value increases. There are certain exceptions to this current taxation rule, including: (i) any Contract
that is an "immediate annuity", which the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") defines as a single premium contract with an annuity commencement date within one year of the date of purchase which provides for a series of substantially equal periodic payments (to be made not less frequently than annually) during the annuity period, and (ii) any Contract that the non-natural person holds as agent for a natural person (such as where a bank or other entity holds a Contract as trustee under a trust agreement).
You should note that a qualified retirement plan generally provides tax deferral regardless of whether the plan invests in an annuity contract. For that reason, no decision to purchase a Qualified Contract should be based on the assumption that the purchase of a Qualified Contract is necessary
to obtain tax deferral under a qualified plan.
 
     Distributions and Withdrawals from Non-Qualified Contracts

The Account Value of a Non-Qualified Contract will generally include both (i) an amount attributable to Purchase Payments, the return of which will not be taxable, and (ii) an amount attributable to investment earnings, the receipt of which will be taxable at ordinary income rates. The relative portions of any particular distribution that derive from nontaxable Purchase Payments and taxable investment earnings depend upon the nature and the timing of that distribution.
Any withdrawal of less than your entire Account Value under a Non-Qualified Contract before the Annuity Commencement Date, must be treated as a receipt of investment earnings. You may not treat such withdrawals as a non-taxable return of Purchase Payments unless you have first withdrawn the
entire amount of the Account Value that is attributable to investment earnings. For purposes of determining whether an Owner has withdrawn the entire amount of the investment earnings under a Non-Qualified Contract, the Code provides that all Non-Qualified deferred annuity contracts issued by the same company to the same Owner during any one calendar
year must be treated as one annuity contract.
A Payee who receives annuity payments under a Non-Qualified Contract after the Annuity Commencement Date, will generally be able to treat a portion of each payment as a nontaxable return of Purchase Payments and to treat only the remainder of each such payment as taxable investment earnings. Until the Purchase Payments have been fully recovered in this manner, the nontaxable portion of each payment will be determined by the ratio of (i)
the total amount of the Purchase Payments made under the Contract, to (ii) the Payee's expected return under the Contract. Once the Payee has received nontaxable payments in an amount equal to total Purchase Payments, no further exclusion is allowed and all future distributions will constitute
fully taxable ordinary income. If payments are terminated upon the death of the Annuitant or other Payee before the Purchase Payments have been fully recovered, the unrecovered Purchase Payments may be deducted on the final return of the Annuitant or other Payee.
A penalty tax of 10% may also apply to taxable cash withdrawals including lump-sum payments from Non-Qualified Contracts. This penalty will generally not apply to distributions made after age 59 1/2, to distributions pursuant to the death or disability of the distributions that are a part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made annually under a
lifetime annuity, or to distributions under an immediate annuity (as defined above).
Death benefits paid upon the death of a Contract Owner are not life insurance benefits and will generally be includable in the income of the recipient to the extent they represent investment earnings under the contract. For this purpose, the amount of the "investment in the contract" is not affected by the Owner's or Annuitant's death, i.e., the investment in the Contract
must still be determined by reference to the total Purchase Payments (excluding amounts that were deductible by, or excluded from the gross income of, the Owner of a Contract), less any Purchase Payments that were amounts previously received which were not includable in income. Special mandatory distribution rules also apply after the death of the Owner when the beneficiary is not the surviving spouse of the Owner. 

If death benefits are distributed in a lump sum, the taxable amount of those benefits will be determined in the same manner as upon a full surrender of the contract. If death benefits are distributed under an annuity option, the taxable amount of those benefits will be determined in the same manner as annuity payments, as described above. 
     Distributions and Withdrawals from Qualified Contracts
In most cases, all of the distributions you receive from a Qualified Contract will constitute fully taxable ordinary income. Also, a 10% penalty tax will apply to distributions prior to age 59 1/2, except in certain circumstances. 
If you receive an eligible rollover distribution from a Qualified Contract (other than from a Contract issued for use with an individual retirement account) and roll over some or all of that distribution to another eligible plan, the portion of such distribution that is rolled over will not be includible in your income. However, any eligible rollover
distribution will be subject to 20% mandatory withholding as described below. Because the amount of the cash paid to you as an eligible rollover distribution will be reduced by this withholding, you will not be able to roll over the entire account balance under your Contract, unless you use other funds equal to the tax withholding to complete the rollover.
An "eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution to you of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of your account, other than:


-

A distribution which is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made annually under a lifetime annuity or for a specified period of ten years or more;


 

 


-

Any required minimum distribution, or


 

 


-

Any hardship distribution.


Only you or your spouse may elect to roll over a distribution to an eligible retirement plan.
     Withholding
In the case of an eligible rollover distribution (as defined above) from a Qualified Contract (other than from a Contract issued for use with an individual retirement account), we (or the plan administrator) must withhold and remit to the U.S. Government 20% of the distribution, unless the Participant or Payee elects to make a direct rollover of the distribution to another qualified retirement plan that is eligible to receive the rollover; however, only you or your spouse may elect a direct rollover. In the case of a distribution from (i) a Non-Qualified Contract, (ii) a Qualified Contract issued for
use with an individual retirement account, or (iii) a Qualified Contract where the distribution is not an eligible rollover distribution, we will withhold and remit to the U.S. Government a part of the taxable portion of each distribution unless, prior to the distribution, the Participant or Payee provides us his or her taxpayer identification number and instructs us (in the manner prescribed) not to withhold. The Participant or Payee may credit against his or her federal income tax liability for the year of distribution any amounts that we (or the plan administrator) withhold.
     Investment Diversification and Control
The Treasury Department has issued regulations that prescribe investment diversification requirements for mutual fund series underlying nonqualified variable contracts. All Non-Qualified Contracts must comply with these regulations to qualify as annuities for federal income tax purposes. The owner of a Non-Qualified Contract that does not meet these guidelines will
be subject to current taxation on annual increases in value of the Contract. We believe that each Fund available as an investment option under the Contract complies with these regulations.
The preamble to the 1986 investment diversification regulations stated that the Internal Revenue Service may promulgate guidelines under which an owner's excessive control over investments underlying the contract will preclude the contract from qualifying as an annuity for federal tax purposes. We cannot predict whether such guidelines, if and when they may be promulgated, will be retroactive. We reserve the right to modify the Contract and/or the Variable
Account to the extent necessary to comply with any such guidelines, but cannot assure that such modifications would satisfy any retroactive guidelines.
     Tax Treatment of the Company and the Variable Account
As a life insurance company under the Code, we will record and report operations of the Variable Account separately from other operations. The Variable Account will not, however, constitute a regulated investment company or any other type of taxable entity distinct from our other operations. Under present law, we will not incur tax on the income of the Variable Account (consisting primarily of interest, dividends, and net capital gains) if we use this income to increase reserves under Contracts participating in the Variable Account.
     Qualified Retirement Plans
You may use Qualified Contracts with several types of qualified retirement plans. Because tax consequences will vary with the type of qualified retirement plan and the plan's specific terms and conditions, we provide below only brief, general descriptions of the consequences that follow from using Qualified Contracts in connection with various types of qualified retirement plans. We stress that the rights of any person to any benefits under these plans may be subject to the terms and conditions of the plans themselves, regardless of the terms of the Qualified Contracts that you are using. These terms and conditions may include restrictions on, among other things, ownership, transferability,
assignability, contributions and distributions.
     Pension and Profit-Sharing Plans
Sections 401(a), 401(k) and 403(a) of the Code permit business employers and certain associations to establish various types of retirement plans for employees. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 eliminated most differences between qualified retirement plans of corporations and those of self-employed individuals. Self-employed persons, as a general rule, may therefore use Qualified Contracts as a funding vehicle for their retirement plans.
     Tax-Sheltered Annuities
Section 403(b) of the Code permits public school employees and employees of certain types of charitable, educational and scientific organizations specified in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code to purchase annuity contracts and, subject to certain limitations, exclude the amount of purchase payments from gross income for tax purposes. The Code imposes restrictions on cash withdrawals from Section 403(b) annuities.
If the Contracts are to receive tax-deferred treatment, cash withdrawals of amounts attributable to salary reduction contributions (other than withdrawals of accumulation account value as of December 31, 1988) may be made only when the Participant attains age 59 1/2, separates from service with the employer, dies or becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section 72(m)(7) of the Code). These restrictions apply to (i) any post-1988 salary reduction contributions, (ii) any growth or interest on post-1988 salary reduction
contributions, (iii) any growth or interest on pre-1989 salary reduction contributions that occurs on or after January 1, 1989, and (iv) any pre-1989 salary reduction contributions since we do not maintain records that separately account for such contributions. . It is permissible, however, to withdraw post-1988 salary reduction contributions (but not the earnings attributable to such contributions) in cases of financial hardship. While the Internal Revenue Service has not issued specific rules defining financial hardship, we expect that to qualify for a hardship distribution, the Participant must have an immediate and heavy bona fide financial need and lack other resources reasonably available to satisfy the need. Hardship withdrawals (as well as certain other premature withdrawals) will be subject to a 10% tax penalty, in addition to any withdrawal charge applicable under the Contracts.
Under certain circumstances the 10% tax penalty will not apply if the withdrawal is for medical expenses.
Section 403(b) annuities, like IRAs, are subject to required minimum distributions under the Code. Section 403(b) annuities are unique, however, in that any account balance accruing before January 1, 1987 (the "pre-1987 balance") needs to comply with only the minimum distribution incidental benefit (MDIB) rule and not also with the minimum distribution rules set forth in Section 401(a)(9) of the Code. This special treatment for any pre-1987 balance is, however, conditioned upon the issuer identifying the pre-1987 balance and maintaining accurate records of changes to the balance. Since we do not maintain such records, your pre-1987 balance, if any, will not be eligible for special distribution treatment.
Under the terms of a particular Section 403(b) plan, the Participant may be entitled to transfer all or a portion of the Account Value to one or more alternative funding options. Participants should consult the documents governing their plan and the person who administers the plan for information as to such investment alternatives.
     Individual Retirement Accounts
Sections 219 and 408 of the Code permit eligible individuals to contribute to an individual retirement program, including Simplified Employee Pension Plans, Employer/Association of Employees Established Individual Retirement Account Trusts, and Simple Retirement Accounts. Such IRAs are subject to limitations on contribution levels, the persons who may be eligible, and on the time when distributions may commence. In addition, certain distributions from some other types of retirement plans may be placed in an IRA on a tax-deferred basis. If we sell Contracts for use with IRAs, the Internal Revenue Service or other agency may impose supplementary information requirements. We will provide purchasers of the Contracts for such purposes with any necessary information. You will have the
right to revoke the Contract under certain circumstances, as described in the section of this Prospectus entitled "Right to Return."
     Roth IRAs
Section 408A of the Code permits an individual to contribute to an individual retirement program called a Roth IRA. Unlike contributions to a traditional IRA under Section 408 of the Code, contributions to a Roth IRA are not tax-deductible. Provided certain conditions are satisfied, distributions are generally tax-free. Like traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs are subject to limitations on contribution amounts and the timing of distributions. If an individual converts a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA the full amount of the IRA is included in taxable income. The Internal Revenue Service and other agencies may impose special information requirements with respect to Roth IRAs. We will provide the necessary information for Contracts issued in connection with Roth IRAs.
     Status of Optional Death Benefit Riders
Under the Code, IRAs may not invest in life insurance policies. Regulations issued by the Treasury Department provide that death benefits under IRAs do not violate this rule, provided that the death benefit is no more than the greater of the total premiums paid (net of prior withdrawals) or the cash value of the IRA.
In certain circumstances, the death benefit payable under the Contract's Optional Death Benefit Riders may exceed both the total premiums paid (net of prior withdrawals) and the cash value of the Contract. We have filed the Contract and the EEB Plus, EEB Plus MAV, and EEB Plus 5% Roll-Up Optional Death Benefit Riders ("New Riders") with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") requesting a ruling approving the use of the Contract with the New Riders as an IRA. We have already received a favorable determination letter with respect to the following Optional Death Benefit Riders: EEB; MAV; 5% Roll-Up;
EEB and MAV; EEB and 5% Roll-Up; MAV and 5% Roll-Up; and EEB and MAV and 5% Roll-Up ("Old Riders").
Although we regard the New Riders as an investment protection feature that should not result in adverse tax treatment, we give no assurance that the IRS will approve the use of the Contract with the New Riders in IRAs. Denial of our request by the IRS could result in taxation of the entire balance of your IRA and penalty taxes. You should consult a qualified tax adviser before adding any of the New Riders to your Contract if it is an IRA.
Puerto Rico Tax Considerations
The Contract offered by this Prospectus is considered an annuity contract under Section 1022 of the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 1994, as amended (the "1994 Code"). Under the current provisions of the 1994 Code, no income tax is payable on increases in value of accumulation shares of annuity units credited to a variable annuity contract until payments are made to the annuitant or other payee under such contract.
When payments are made from your Contract in the form of an annuity, the annuitant or other payee will be required to include as gross income the lesser of the amount received during the taxable year or the portion of the amount received equal to 3% of the aggregate premiums or other consideration paid for the annuity. The amount, if any, in excess of the included amount is excluded from gross income as a return of premium. After an amount equal to the aggregate premiums or other consideration paid for the annuity has been excluded from gross income, all of the subsequent annuity payments are considered to be taxable income.
When a payment under a Contract is made in a lump sum, the amount of the payment would be included in the gross income of the Annuitant or other Payee to the extent it exceeds the Annuitant's aggregate premiums or other consideration paid.
The provisions of the 1994 Code with respect to qualified retirement plans described in this Prospectus vary significantly from those under the Internal Revenue Code. Although we currently offer the Contract in Puerto Rico in connection with qualified retirement plans, the text of this Prospectus under the heading "Federal Tax Status" dealing with such qualified retirement plans is inapplicable to Puerto Rico and should be disregarded.
For information regarding the income tax consequences of owning a Contract, you should consult a qualified tax adviser.
 
ADMINISTRATION OF THE CONTRACT
We perform certain administrative functions relating to the Contract, Participant Accounts, and the Variable Account. These functions include, but are not limited to, maintaining the books and records of the Variable Account and the Sub-Accounts; maintaining records of the name, address, taxpayer identification number, Contract number, Participant Account number and type, the status of each Participant Account and other pertinent information necessary to the administration and operation of the Contract; processing Applications, Purchase Payments, transfers and full and partial withdrawals; issuing Contracts
and Certificates; administering annuity payments; furnishing accounting and valuation services; reconciling and depositing cash receipts; providing confirmations; providing toll-free customer service lines; and furnishing telephonic transfer services.
DISTRIBUTION OF THE CONTRACT
We offer the Contract on a continuous basis. Contracts are sold by licensed insurance agents in those states where the Contract may be lawfully sold. Such agents will be registered representatives of broker-dealers registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 who are members of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and who have entered into distribution agreements with the Company and the general distributor, Clarendon Insurance Agency, Inc. ("Clarendon"), One Sun Life Executive Park, Wellesley
Hills, Massachusetts 02481. Clarendon, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
Commissions and other distribution compensation will be paid by the Company to the selling agents and will not be more than 5.50% of Purchase Payments. In addition, after the first Account Year, broker-dealers who have entered into distribution agreements with the Company may receive an annual renewal commission of no more than 1.00% of the Participant's Account Value. In addition to commissions, the Company may, from time to time, pay or allow additional promotional incentives, in the form of cash or other compensation. We reserve the right to offer these additional incentives only to certain broker-dealers that sell or are expected to sell during specified time periods certain minimum amounts of Contracts
or Certificates or other contracts offered by the Company. Promotional incentives may change at any time. Commissions may be waived or reduced in connection with certain transactions described in this Prospectus under the heading "Waivers; Reduced Charges; Credits; Special Guaranteed Interest Rates." During 2000 and 2001, approximately $6,273 and $318,504, respectively, in commissions were paid to and retained by Clarendon in connection with the distribution of the Contracts.
PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
From time to time the Variable Account may publish reports to shareholders, sales literature and advertisements containing performance information relating to the Sub-Accounts. This information may include standardized and non-standardized "Average Annual Total Return," "Cumulative Growth Rate" and "Compound Growth Rate." We may also advertise "yield" and "effective yield" for some variable options.
Average Annual Total Return measures the net income of the Sub-Account and any realized or unrealized gains or losses of the Fund in which it invests, over the period stated. Average Annual Total Return figures are annualized and represent the average annual percentage change in the value of an investment in a Sub-Account over that period. Standardized Average Annual Total Return information covers the period after the Variable Account was established or, if shorter, the life of the Series. Non-standardized Average Annual Total Return covers the life of each Fund, which may predate the Variable Account. Cumulative Growth Rate represents the cumulative change in the value of an investment in the Sub-Account for the period stated, and is arrived at by calculating the change in the Accumulation Unit Value of a Sub-Account between the first and the last day of the period being measured. The difference is expressed as a percentage of the Accumulation Unit Value at the
beginning of the base period. "Compound Growth Rate" is an annualized measure, calculated by applying a formula that determines the level of return which, if earned over the entire period, would produce the cumulative return.
Average Annual Total Return figures assume an initial purchase payment of $1,000 and reflect all applicable withdrawal and Contract charges. The Cumulative Growth Rate and Compound Growth Rate figures that we advertise do not reflect withdrawal charges or the Account Fee, although such figures do reflect all recurring charges. Results calculated without withdrawal and/or certain Contract charges will be higher. We may also use other types of rates of return that do not reflect withdrawal and Contract charges.
The performance figures used by the Variable Account are based on the actual historical performance of the underlying Funds for the specified periods, and the figures are not intended to indicate future performance. For periods before the date the Contracts became available, we calculate the performance information for the Sub-Account on a hypothetical basis. To do this, we reflect deductions of the current Contract fees and charges from the historical performance of the corresponding Funds.
Yield is a measure of the net dividend and interest income earned over a specific one month or 30-day period (7-day period for the available Money Market Sub-Account), expressed as a percentage of the value of the Sub-Account's Accumulation Units. Yield is an annualized figure, which means that we assume that the Sub-Account generates the same level of net income over a one-year period and compound that income on a semi-annual basis. We calculate the effective yield for the Money Market Sub-Account similarly, but include the increase due to assumed compounding. The Money Market Sub-Account's effective yield will be slightly higher than its yield as a result of its compounding effect.
The Variable Account may also from time to time compare its investment performance to various unmanaged indices or other variable annuities and may refer to certain rating and other organizations in its marketing materials. More information on performance and our computations is set forth in the Statement of Additional Information.
The Company may also advertise the ratings and other information assigned to it by independent industry ratings organizations. Some of these organizations are A.M. Best, Moody's Investor's Service, Standard and Poor's Insurance Rating Services, and Fitch. Each year A.M. Best reviews the financial status of thousands of insurers, culminating in the assignment of Best's rating. These ratings reflect A.M. Best's current opinion of the relevant financial strength and operating performance of an insurance company in comparison to the norms of the life/health industry. Best's ratings range from A++ to F. Standard and Poor's and Fitch's ratings measure the ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under insurance policies it issues. These two ratings do not measure the insurance company's ability to meet non-policy obligations. Ratings in general do not relate to the performance
of the Sub-Accounts.
We may also advertise endorsements from organizations, individuals or other parties that recommend the Company or the Contracts. We may occasionally include in advertisements (1) comparisons of currently taxable and tax deferred investment programs, based on selected tax brackets; or (2) discussions of alternative investment vehicles and general economic conditions.

INCORPORATION OF CERTAIN DOCUMENTS BY REFERENCE
The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001 filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is incorporated herein by reference. All documents or reports we file pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, after the date of this prospectus and prior to the termination of the offering, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into the prospectus.
The Company will furnish, without charge, to each person to whom a copy of this Prospectus is delivered, upon the written or oral request of such person, a copy of the documents referred to above which have been incorporated by reference into this Prospectus, other than exhibits to such documents (unless such exhibits are specifically incorporated by reference in this Prospectus). Requests for such documents should be directed to the Secretary, Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.), One Sun Life Executive Park, Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts 02481,
telephone (800) 225-3950.
STATE REGULATION
The Company is subject to the laws of the State of Delaware governing life insurance companies and to regulation by the Commissioner of Insurance of Delaware. An annual statement is filed with the Commissioner of Insurance on or before March 1st in each year relating to the operations of the Company for the preceding year and its financial condition on December 31st of such year. Its books and records are subject to review or examination by the Commissioner or his agents at any time and a full examination of its operations is conducted at periodic intervals.
The Company is also subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the other states and jurisdictions in which it is licensed to operate. The laws of the various jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to licensing to transact business, overseeing trade practices, licensing agents, approving policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum rates for accumulation of surrender values, prescribing the form and content of required financial statements and regulating the type and amounts of investments permitted. Each insurance company is required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies in each of the fire jurisdictions in which it does business and its operations and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at regular intervals.
In addition, many states regulate affiliated groups of insurers, such as the Company, Sun Life (Canada) and its affiliates, under insurance holding company legislation. Under such laws, inter-company transfers of assets and dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries may be subject to prior notice or approval, depending on the size of such transfers and payments in relation to the financial positions of the companies involved. Under insurance guaranty fund laws in most states, insurers doing business therein can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for policyholder losses incurred by insolvent companies. The amount of any future assessments of the Company under these laws cannot be reasonably estimated. However,
most of these laws do provide that an assessment may be excused or deferred if it would threaten an insurer's own financial strength and many permit the deduction of all or a portion of any such assessment from any future premium or similar taxes payable.
Although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the business of insurance, federal initiatives often have an impact on the business in a variety of ways. Current and proposed federal measures which may significantly affect the insurance business include employee benefit regulation, removal of barriers preventing banks from engaging in the insurance business, tax law changes affecting the taxation of insurance companies, the tax treatment of insurance products and its impact on the relative desirability of various personal investment vehicles.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
There are no pending legal proceedings affecting the Variable Account. We and our subsidiaries are engaged in various kinds of routine litigation which, in management's judgment, is not of material importance to our respective total assets or material with respect to the Variable Account.
ACCOUNTANTS

WITHDRAWALS, WITHDRAWAL CHARGES AND THE MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENT
PART 1: VARIABLE ACCOUNT (THE MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT) WITHDRAWAL CHARGE CALCULATION:

FULL WITHDRAWAL:

The table below presents three examples of the withdrawal charge resulting from a full withdrawal of your Account, based on hypothetical Account Values.

(a) 

The free withdrawal amount in any year is equal to 10% of all of the Purchase Payments you have made. In Account Year 1, the free withdrawal amount is $4,000, which equals 10% of the Purchase Payment of $40,000. On a full withdrawal of $41,000, the amount subject to a withdrawal charge is $37,000, which equals the Account Value of $41,000 minus the free withdrawal amount of $4,000.


 

 


(b) 

In Account Year 3, the free withdrawal amount is $4,000, which equals 10% of the Purchase Payment of $40,000. The Account Value minus the free withdrawal amount is $47,700 minus $4,000, which equals $43,700; however, the amount subject to a withdrawal charge is capped at the amount of your unliquidated Purchase Payments. Therefore, the amount subject to a withdrawal charge is $40,000, which is the amount of your unliquidated Purchase Payments.


 

 


(c) 

In Account Year 5, you have passed your fourth Account Anniversary, so no withdrawal charges apply to any withdrawals you make.


PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL
Assume a single Purchase Payment of $40,000 is made on the Contract Date, no additional Purchase Payments are made, no partial withdrawals have been taken prior to the fourth Account Year, and there is a series of 4 partial withdrawals made during the fourth Account Year of $3,000, $8,000, $12,000, and $22,000.

(a) 

In Account Year 4, the free withdrawal amount is $4,000, which equals 10% of the Purchase Payment of $40,000. The partial withdrawal amount of $3,000 is less than the free withdrawal amount, so there is no withdrawal charge.


 

 


(b) 

ince a partial withdrawal of $3,000 was taken, the remaining free withdrawal amount in Account Year 4 is $4,000 - $3,000 = $1,000. Therefore, $1,000 of the $8,000 withdrawal is not subject to a withdrawal charge, and $7,000 is subject to a withdrawal charge. Of the $11,000 withdrawn to date, $4,000 has been from the free withdrawal amount and $7,000 has been from Purchase Payments. Therefore, the amount of unliquidated Purchase Payments is $33,000.


 

 


(c) 

Since $4,000 of the two prior Account Year 4 partial withdrawals was taken from the free withdrawal amount, the remaining free withdrawal amount in Account year 4 is $4,000 - $4,000 = $0. Therefore, the entire $12,000 withdrawal is subject to a withdrawal charge. Of the $23,000 withdrawn to date, $4,000 has been from the free withdrawal amount and $19,000 has been from Purchase Payments. Therefore, the amount of unliquidated Purchase Payments is $21,000.


 

 


(d) 

Since $4,000 of the three prior Account Year 4 partial withdrawals was taken from the free withdrawal amount, the remaining free withdrawal amount in Account Year 4 is $4,000 - $4,000 = $0. The amount of unliquidated Purchase Payments remaining before this withdrawal is $21,000. Therefore, $21,000 of the $22,000 withdrawal is taken from Purchase Payments and is subject to a withdrawal charge, and $1,000 of the withdrawal is taken from earnings and is not subject to a withdrawal charge. Of the $45,000 withdrawn to date, $4,000 has been from the free withdrawal amount, $40,000 has been from Purchase Payments, and $1,000 has been from earnings. The amount of unliquidated Purchase Payments is now equal to $0. Note that if the $3,000 remaining balance was withdrawn, it would all be from earnings and not subject to a withdrawal charge. The total Account Year 4 withdrawal charges would then be $2,000, which is the same amount that was assessed for a full liquidation
in Account Year 4 in the example on the previous page.


PART 2 -- FIXED ACCOUNT -- EXAMPLES OF THE MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENT ("MVA")
The MVA Factor is:
[(1 + I) / (1 + J + b)] ^ (N/12) -1
These examples assume the following:


(1)

The Guarantee Amount was allocated to a 5-year Guarantee Period with a Guaranteed Interest Rate of 6% or .06.


 

 


(2)

The date of surrender is 2 years from the Expiration Date (N = 24).


 

 


(3)

The value of the Guarantee Amount on the date of surrender is $11,910.16.


 

 


(4)

The interest earned in the current Account Year is $674.16.


 

 


(5)

No transfers or partial withdrawals affecting this Guarantee Amount have been made.


 

 


(6)

Withdrawal charges, if any, are calculated in the same manner as shown in the examples in Part 1.


EXAMPLE OF A NEGATIVE MVA:
Assume that on the date of surrender, the current rate (J) is 8% or .08 and the b factor is zero.


The  MVA  factor  

=

[(1 + I) / (1 + J + b)] ^ (N/12) -1


 

=

[(1 + .06) / (1 + .08)] ^ (24/12) - 1


 

=

(.981^ 2) -1


 

=

.963  -1


 

=

-  .037


The value of the Guarantee Amount less interest credited to the Guarantee Amount in the current Account Year is multiplied by the MVA factor to determine the MVA:
             ($11,910.16 - $674.16) X (-.037) = -$415.73
-$415.73 represents the MVA that will be deducted from the value of the Guarantee Amount before the deduction of any withdrawal charge.
For a partial withdrawal of $2,000 from this Guarantee Amount, the MVA would be ($2,000.00 - $674.16) X (-.037) = -$49.06. -$49.06 represents the MVA that will be deducted from the partial withdrawal amount before the deduction of any withdrawal charge.
EXAMPLE OF A POSITIVE MVA:
Assume that on the date of surrender, the current rate (J) is 5% or .05 and the b factor is zero.


The  MVA  factor  

=

[(1 + I) / (1 + J + b)] ^ (N/12) -1


 

=

[(1 + .06) / (1 + .05)] ^ (24/12) - 1


 

=

(1.010 ^ 2) -1


 

=

1.019  -1


 

=

.019


 
The value of the Guarantee Amount less interested credit to the Guarantee Amount in the current Account Year is multiplied by the MVA factor to determine the MVA:
             ($11,910.16 - $674.16) X .019 = $213.48
$213.48 represents the MVA that would be added to the value of the Guarantee Amount before the deduction of any withdrawal charge.
For a partial withdrawal of $2,000 from this Guarantee Amount, the MVA would be ($2,000.00 - $674.16) X .019 = $25.19.
$25.19 represents the MVA that would be added to the value of the partial withdrawal amount before the deduction of any withdrawal charge.
 
APPENDIX C
CALCULATION OF BASIC DEATH BENEFIT
EXAMPLE 1:
Assume a Purchase Payment of $60,000.00 is made on the Contract Date and an additional Purchase Payment of $40,000.00 is made one year later. Assume that all of the money is invested in the Sub-Accounts, that no Withdrawals are made and that the Account Value on the Death Benefit Date is $80,000.00. The calculation of the Death Benefit to be paid is as follows:


The Basic Death Benefit is the greatest of:

 

 


    Account Value 

=

$ 80,000.00


    Cash Surrender Value* 

=

$ 76,500.00


    Purchase Payments 

=

$100,000.00


The Basic Death Benefit would therefore be:

=

$100,000.00



EXAMPLE 2:
Assume a Purchase Payment of $60,000.00 is made on the Contract Date and an additional Purchase Payment of $40,000.00 is made one year later. Assume that all of the money is invested in the Sub-Accounts and that the Account Value is $80,000.00 just prior to a $20,000.00 withdrawal. The Account Value on the Death Benefit Date is $60,000.00.


The Basic Death Benefit is the greatest of:

 

 


    Account Value 

=

$ 60,000.00


    Cash Surrender Value* 

=

$ 57,000.00


    Adjusted Purchase Payments** 

=

$ 75,000.00


The Basic Death Benefit would therefore be:

=

$ 75,000.00



**Adjusted Purchase Payments can be calculated as follows:
Payments X (Account Value after withdrawal divided by Account Value before withdrawal) $100,000.00 X ($60,000.00 divided by $80,000.00)
*Cash Surrender Value is the amount we would pay you if you surrendered your entire Account Value. For a description of how Cash Surrender Value is calculated, see "Full Withdrawals" under the subheading "Cash Withdrawals."
 
APPENDIX D
CALCULATION OF EARNINGS ENHANCEMENT OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT
EXAMPLE 1:
Assume a Purchase Payment of $60,000 is made on the Contract Date, and an additional Purchase Payment of $40,000 is made one year later. Assume that all of the money is invested into the Sub-Accounts, no withdrawals are made and the Account Value on the Death Benefit Date is $135,000. In addition, this Contract was issued prior to the owner's 70th birthday. Assume death occurs in Account Year 7. The calculation of the Death Benefit to be paid is as follows:


The Death Benefit Amount will be the greatest of:

 

 


    Account Value 

=

$135,000


    Cash Surrender Value* 

=

$135,000


    Total of Adjusted Purchase Payments 

=

$100,000


The Death Benefit Amount would therefore 

=

$135,000


  --plus--



The EEB amount, calculated as follows:

 

 


    Account Value minus Adjusted Purchase Payments 

=

$ 35,000


    40% of the above amount 

=

$ 14,000


    Cap of 40% of Adjusted Purchase Payments 

=

$ 40,000


The lesser of the above two amounts = the EEB amount 

=

$ 14,000


The total Death Benefit would be the amount paid on the Basic Death Benefit plus the EEB amount = $135,000 + $14,000 = $149,000.
EXAMPLE 2:
Assume a Purchase Payment of $60,000 is made on the Contract Date, and an additional Purchase Payment of $40,000 is made one year later. Assume that all of the money is invested into the Sub-Accounts and that the Account Value is $135,000 just prior to a $20,000 withdrawal. The Account Value on the Death Benefit Date is $115,000. In addition, this Contract was issued prior to the owner's 70th birthday.


The Death Benefit Amount will be the greatest of:

 

 


    Account Value 

=

$115,000


    Cash Surrender Value* 

=

$115,000


    Total of Adjusted Purchase Payments** 

=

$ 85,185


The Death Benefit Amount would therefore 

=

$115,000


  --plus--


The EEB amount, calculated as follows:

 

 


    Account Value minus Adjusted Purchase Payments

=

$ 29,815


    40% of the above amount 

=

$ 11,926


    Cap of 40% of Adjusted Purchase Payments 

=

$ 34,074


The lesser of the above two amounts = the EEB amount

=

$ 11,926


The total Death Benefit would be the amount paid on the Basic Death Benefit plus the EEB amount = $115,000 + $11,926 = $126,926.
* Cash Surrender Value is the amount we would pay you if you surrendered your entire Account Value. For a description of how Cash Surrender Value is calculated, see "Full Withdrawals" under the subheading "Cash Withdrawals."
** Adjusted Purchase Payments can be calculated as follows:
Payments x (Account Value after withdrawal / Account Value before withdrawal) = $100,000 x ($115,000 / $135,000) = $85,185
 
 
APPENDIX E
CALCULATION OF DEATH BENEFIT WHEN EEB AND MAV AND 5% ROLL-UP RIDERS ARE SELECTED
Assume a Purchase Payment of $60,000 is made on the Contract Date, and an additional Purchase Payment of $40,000 is made one year later. Assume that all of the money is invested in Variable Accounts. No withdrawals are made. The Account Value at the Death Benefit Date is $135,000, the value of the Purchase Payments accumulated at 5% until the Death Benefit Date is $140,000, and the Maximum Anniversary Value is $142,000. Assume death occurs in Account Year 7. The calculation of the death benefit to be paid is as follows:

The EEB amount, calculated as follows:

 

 


    Account Value minus Adjusted Purchase Payments 

=

$ 35,000


    40% of the above amount 

=

$ 14,000


    Cap of 40% of Adjusted Purchase Payments 

=

$ 40,000


The lesser of the above two amounts = the EEB amount 

=

$ 14,000


The total Death Benefit would be the amount paid on the Maximum Anniversary Rider plus the EEB amount = $142,000 + $14,000 = $156,000.
*Cash Surrender Value is the amount we would pay you if you surrendered your entire Account Value. For a description of how Cash Surrender Value is calculated, see "Full Withdrawals" under the subheading "Cash Withdrawals."

=

$ 35,000


    40% of the above amount 

=

$ 14,000


    Cap of 100% of Adjusted Purchase Payments 

=

$100,000


The lesser of the above two amounts = the EEB Plus amount

=

$ 14,000



The total Death Benefit would be the amount paid on the Basic Death Benefit plus the EEB Plus amount = $135,000 + $14,000 = $149,000.

$ 16,000


    Cap of 100% of Adjusted Purchase Payments 

=

$100,000


The lesser of the above two amounts = the EEB Plus MAV amount

APPENDIX J
INVESTMENT OPTIONS AND EXPENSES FOR INITIAL CLASS SHARES
 
The variable Fund options shown in this prospectus are the "Service Class" shares of the MFS/Sun Life Series Trust. The Service Class was first offered for sale on August 27, 2001. All Contracts purchased on or after that date are invested in the Service Class.
Each Fund also has an "Initial Class" of shares. All Contracts purchased before August 27, 2001, are invested in the "Initial Class." The following Initial Class Funds are available to owners of such Contracts:


     Bond Series

     Massachusetts Investors Growth Stock Series


     Capital Appreciation Series

     Massachusetts Investors Trust Series


     Capital Opportunities Series

     Mid Cap Growth Series


     Emerging Growth Series

     Money Market Series


     Emerging Markets Equity Series

     New Discovery Series


     Global Asset Allocation Series

     Research Series


     Global Governments Series

     Research Growth and Income Series


     Global Growth Series

     Research International Series


     Global Telecommunications Series

     Strategic Growth Series


     Global Total Return Series

     Strategic Income Series


     Government Securities Series

     Technology Series


     High Yield Series

     Total Return Series


     International Growth Series

     Utilities Series


     International Investors Trust Series

     Value Series


     Managed Sectors Series

 



 
The shares of the Initial Class have the same investment objectives, policies, and strategies as the shares of the Service Class. The only differences between the two classes are their expense ratios. The UNDERLYING FUND ANNUAL EXPENSES and accompanying "EXAMPLES" associated with Initial Class expenses are shown below:

(1) 

The information relating to Fund expenses was provided by the Fund and we have not independently verified it. You should consult the Fund prospectus for more information about Fund expenses. All expense figures are shown after expense reimbursements or waivers, except for the bracketed figures which show what the expense figures would have been absent reimbursement and waiver. All expense figures are based on actual expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, except that the expense figures shown for Funds with less than 12 months of investment experience are estimates for the year 2002. Such a Fund is the Global Telecommunications Series.


 

 


(2) 

Each Fund has an expense offset arrangement which reduces the Fund's custodian fee based upon the amount of cash maintained by the Fund with its custodian and dividend disbursing agent. Each Fund may enter into such other arrangements and directed brokerage arrangements (which would also have the effect of reducing the Fund's expenses). Any such fee reductions are not reflected under "Other Fund Expenses" in the table. Had these fee reimbursements been taken into account, "Total Annual Fund Expenses" for certain of the Funds would be as follows:

(3)

MFS has contractually agreed to bear the expenses of the Global Telecommunications Series such that "Other Fund Expenses," after taking into account the expense offset arrangement described in Footnote (2), above, do not exceed 0.25% annually. These contractual fee arrangements will continue until at least May 1, 2003, unless changed with the consent of the Series Fund's Board of Directors; provided, however, that the Fund's contractual fee arrangement will terminate prior to May 1, 2003, in the event that the Fund's "Other Fund Expenses" equal or fall below 0.25% annually.



 
EXAMPLES
If you surrender your Contract at the end of the applicable time period, you would pay the following expenses on a $1,000 investment, assuming an average Contract size of $50,000, a 5% annual return and no optional death benefit riders have been elected:

SPECIAL TERMS
Your Contract is a legal document that uses a number of specially defined terms. We explain most of the terms that we use in this Prospectus in the context where they arise, and some are self-explanatory. In addition, for convenient reference, we have compiled a list of these terms in the Glossary included at the back of this Prospectus as Appendix A. If, while you are reading this Prospectus, you come across a term that you do not understand, please refer to the Glossary for an explanation.
PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS

The headings in this section correspond to headings in the Prospectus under which we discuss these topics in more detail.
The Annuity Contract
The Futurity Select Four Fixed and Variable Annuity Contract provides a number of important benefits for your retirement planning. During the Accumulation Phase, you make Payments under the Contract and allocate them to one or more Variable Account or Fixed Account options. During the Income Phase, we make annuity payments to you or someone else based on the amount you have accumulated. The Contract provides tax-deferral so that you do not pay taxes on your earnings until you withdraw them. The Contract also provides a basic death benefit if you die during the Accumulation Phase. You may enhance the basic
death benefit by purchasing one or more optional death benefit riders.
The Accumulation Phase
Under most circumstances, you can buy the Contract with an initial Purchase Payment of $10,000 or more, and you can make additional Purchase Payments of at least $1,000 at any time during the Accumulation Phase. We will not normally accept a Purchase Payment if your Account Value is over $2 million or, if the Purchase Payment would cause your Account Value to exceed $2 million.
Variable Account Options: The Funds
You can allocate your Purchase Payments among Sub-Accounts investing in a number of Fund options. Each Fund is either a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or a separate series of shares of such a mutual fund. The investment returns on the Funds are not guaranteed. You can make or lose money. You can make transfers among the Funds and the Fixed Account Options.
The Fixed Account Options: The Guarantee Periods
You can allocate your Purchase Payments to the Fixed Account and elect to invest in one or more of the Guarantee Periods we make available from time to time. Each Guarantee Period earns interest at a Guaranteed Interest Rate that we publish. We may change the Guaranteed Interest Rate from time to time, but no Guaranteed Interest Rate will ever be less than the minimum guaranteed interest rate permitted by law. Once we have accepted your allocation to a particular Guarantee Period, we promise that the Guaranteed Interest Rate applicable to that allocation will not change for the duration of the Guarantee Period. We may offer Guarantee Periods of different durations or stop offering some Guarantee Periods. Once we stop offering a Guarantee Period of a particular duration, future allocations, transfers, or renewals into that Guarantee Period will not be permitted.
Expense Summary
The Contract has insurance features and investment features, and there are costs related to each.

If your Account Value is less than $100,000 on your Account Anniversary, we deduct a $50 Annual Account Fee. We will waive the Account Fee if your Contract was fully invested in the Fixed Account during the entire Account Year.
We deduct a mortality and expense risk charge of 1.20% of the average daily value of the Contract invested in the Variable Account, if your initial Purchase Payment was less than $1,000,000, or 0.95% if your initial Purchase Payment was $1,000,000 or more. We also deduct an administrative charge of 0.15% of the average daily value of the Contract invested in the Variable Account.

If you take more than a specified amount of money out of your Contract, we assess a withdrawal charge against each Purchase Payment withdrawn. The withdrawal charge (also known as a "contingent deferred sales charge") starts at 6% in the first Contract year and declines to 0% after four years.
Currently, you can make 12 free transfers each year; however, we reserve the right to impose a charge of up to $15 per transfer.
If you elect one or more of the optional death benefit riders, we will deduct, during the Accumulation Phase, an additional charge of from the assets of the Variable Account ranging from 0.15% to 0.40% of the average daily value of your Contract, depending upon which optional death benefit rider(s) you have elected.
In addition to the charges we impose under the Contract, there are also charges (which include management fees and operating expenses) imposed by the Funds, which range from 0.65% to 1.45% of the average daily net assets of the Fund, depending upon which Fund(s) you have selected.
The Income Phase: Annuity Provisions
If you want to receive regular income from your annuity, you can select one of a several Annuity Options. Subject to the Maximum Annuity Commencement Date, you can choose to receive annuity payments from either the Fixed Account or from the available Variable Account options. If you choose to have any part of your annuity payments come from the Variable Account, the dollar amount of the payments may fluctuate with the performance of the Funds. You decide when your Income Phase will begin but, once it begins, you cannot change your choice of annuity payment options.

Death Benefit
If you die before the Contract reaches the Income Phase, the beneficiary will receive a death benefit. The amount of the death benefit depends upon your age on the Contract Date and whether you choose the basic death benefit or, for a fee, one or more of the optional death benefit rider. If you are 85 or younger on your Contract Date, the basic death benefit pays the greatest of your Account Value, your total Purchase Payments (adjusted for withdrawals), or your cash Surrender Value, all calculated as of your Death Benefit Date. If you are 86 or older on your Contract Date, the basic death benefit is equal
to the Surrender Value. Subject to availability in your state, you may enhance the basic death benefit by electing one or more of the optional death benefit riders. You must make your election before the date on which your Contract becomes effective. The riders are only available if you are younger than 80 on the Contract Date. Any optional death benefit rider election may not be changed after your Contract is issued.
Withdrawals, Withdrawal Charge and Market Value Adjustment
You can withdraw money from your Contract during the Accumulation Phase. You may withdraw a portion of your Account Value each year without the imposition of a withdrawal charge. During the first four Account Years, this "free withdrawal amount" equals 10% of the amount of all Purchase Payments made. All other amounts are subject to a withdrawal charge. Withdrawals made from the Fixed Account may also be subject to a Market Value Adjustment (see prospectus under "Market Value Adjustment"). You may also have to pay income taxes and tax penalties on money you withdraw.

Right to Return
Your Contract contains a "free look" provision. If you cancel your Contract within 10 days after receiving it, we will send you, depending upon the laws of your state, either the full amount of all of your Purchase Payments or your Account Value as of the day we receive your cancellation request. (This amount may be more or less than the original Purchase Payment). We will not deduct a withdrawal charge or a Market Value Adjustment.
Tax Considerations
Your earnings are not taxed until you take them out. If you withdraw money during the Accumulation Phase, earnings come out first and are taxed as income. If you are younger than 59 1/2 when you take money out, you may be charged a 10% federal tax penalty.

(1) 

The information relating to Fund expenses was provided by the Funds and we have not independently verified it. You should consult the Fund prospectuses for more information about Fund expenses.


 

 


(2) 

All expense figures are shown after expense reimbursements or waivers, except for the bracketed figures which show what the expense figures would have been absent reimbursement. All expense figures are based on actual expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, except that (a) the expense figures shown for SCSM Alger Growth Fund, SCSM Alger Growth & Income Fund, SCSM Alger Small Capitalization Fund, and Sun CapitalSM All Cap Fund are estimates for the year 2002 and (b) certain information relating to the Lord Abbett Series Fund has been restated to reflect the fees and expenses that will be applicable during 2002
as described in note (8) below. No actual expense figures are shown for the Funds listed in (a) because each of them commenced operations in either April or May of 2002, and, therefore, has less than 10 months of investment experience.


 

 


(3)

Effective May 1, 2002, the following Funds' names will change from AIM V.I. Growth and Income Fund, AIM V.I. International Equity Fund, and AIM V.I. Value Fund to AIM V.I. Core Equity Fund, AIM V.I. International Growth Fund, and AIM V.I. Premier Equity Fund, respectively


 

 


(4) 

For the year ended December 31, 2001, the investment advisor voluntarily agreed to waive fund expenses to the extent such expenses exceed the "Total Fund Annual Expenses" shown in the table.


 

 


(5)

The investment advisers to the following Goldman Sachs VIT Funds have voluntarily agreed to reduce or limit certain "Other Fund Expenses (excluding management fees, taxes, interest, and brokerage fees, litigation, indemnification, and other extraordinary expenses) to the extent such expenses exceed a certain percentage per annum of such Funds' average daily net assets:




Goldman Sachs VIT CORESM Large Capital Growth Fund

0.20%


Goldman Sachs VIT CORESM Small Cap Equity Fund

0.25%


Goldman Sachs VIT CORESM U.S. Equity Fund

0.20%


Goldman Sachs VIT Internet Tollkeeper

0.25%


Goldman Sachs VIT Capital Growth

0.25%


Goldman Sachs VIT Growth and Income Fund

0.25%


Goldman Sachs VIT International Equity Fund

0.35%





Fee waivers and expense reimbursements for the Goldman Sachs VIT Funds may be discontinued at any time.






(6) 

The INVESCO VIF Dynamics and INVESCO VIF Small Company Growth Funds' actual "Other Fund Expenses" and "Total Annual Fund Expenses" were lower than the figures shown, because their custodian fees were reduced under an expense offset arrangement.


 

 


(7)

Through fiscal year 2002, an affiliate of the adviser has agreed to reimburse the Fund to the extent certain expenses exceed the following percentages of the Fund's average daily net assets:





JPMorgan U.S. Disciplined Equity Portfolio

0.85%


JPMorgan International Opportunities Portfolio

1.20%


JPMorgan Small Company Portfolio

1.15%




(8)

The information in the fee table relating to the Mid Cap Value and International Portfolios has been restated to reflect the fees and expenses that will be applicable during 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2001, Lord, Abbett & Co. voluntarily waived a portion of its management fees for the Mid Cap Value and International Portfolios and subsidized a portion of the Portfolios' expenses to the extent necessary to maintain the "Other Fund Expenses" and "12b-1or Services Fees" of each Portfolio at an aggregate of 0.35% of its average daily net assets. For the year 2002, Lord, Abbett & Co. does not intend to waive it management fees for the Mid Cap Value and International Portfolios but has contractually agreed to continue to reimburse a portion of the Portfolios' expenses to the extent necessary to maintain its "Other Fund Expenses" and "12b-1 or Service Fees" of each
Portfolio at an aggregate of 0.35% of its average daily net assets. 


 

 


(9) 

The expenses shown are those of the Portfolios' Service Class 2. Actual annual operating expenses of the Fidelity Funds were lower than those shown in the table because a portion of the brokerage commissions that each Fund paid was used to reduce the Fund's expenses, through arrangements with the Fund's custodian, credits realized as a result of uninvested cash balances were used to reduce a portion of the Fund's custodian expenses. Fidelity may terminate these offsets at any time.


 

 


(10) 

The MFS/SUN Life Series Trust has an expense offset arrangement which reduces the Fund's custodian fee based upon the amount of cash maintained by the Fund with its custodian and dividend disbursing agent, and may enter into such other arrangements and directed brokerage arrangement (which would also have the effect of reducing the Fund's expenses). Any such fee reductions are not reflected in the table. Had these fee reductions been taken into account, "Total Annual Fund Expenses" would have been lower for certain series:




MFS/Sun Life Emerging Growth - S Class

MFS/Sun Life Massachusetts Investors Growth Stock - S Class 

1.06%




(11) 

For the year ended December 31, 2001, the investment adviser waived all investment advisory fees of all Funds other than Sun Capital Investment Grade Bond Fund(R), Sun Capital Money Market Fund(R), Sun Capital Real Estate Fund(R), SCSM Davis Venture Value Fund, SCSM Value Mid Cap Fund, SCSM Blue Chip Mid Cap Fund, and SCSM Select Equity Fund, for which the investment adviser waived a portion of its fees. Fee waivers and expense reimbursements for the Sun Capital Funds may be discontinued at any time. To the extent that the expense ratio of any Fund in the Sun Capital Advisers Trust falls below the Fund's expense limit, the Fund's adviser reserves the right to be reimbursed for management fees waived and Fund
expenses paid by it during the prior two years. If the Securities and Exchange Commission approves Sun Life's pending application for an order to substitute shares of the SCSM Alger Funds and SCSM Value Funds for shares of certain other mutual funds held by Sun Life separate accounts that issue variable annuities and variable life insurance, then the investment adviser may contractually limit the "Management Fees" and reimburse the "Other Fund Expenses" of the SCSM Alger Funds and SCSMValue Funds for a period of two years from the date of the substitution.


 

 


(12) 

The management fee for each of the SCSM Davis Funds decreases to 0.70% as the daily net assets of each Fund exceed $500 million.


 

 


(13) 

The management fee for each of the SCSM INVESCO Funds decreases to 1.00% as the daily net assets of the Funds exceed $750 million.


 

 


(14) 

The management fee for each of the SCSM Neuberger Berman Funds decreases to 0.90% as the daily net assets of the Funds exceed $750 million.


 

 


(15) 

The management fee for each of the SCSM Value Funds decreases to 0.75% as the daily net assets of each Fund exceed $400 million, and decreases to 0.70% as the daily net assets of each Fund exceed $800 million.


 

 


(16) 

The management fees for each of the SCSM Blue Chip Mid Cap Fund, the SCSM Investors Foundation Fund, and the SCSM Select Equity Fund decreases to 0.75%, 0.70%, and 0.70% respectively, as the daily net assets of each Fund exceed $300 million.

CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Historical information about the value of the units we use to measure the variable portion of your Contract ("Variable Accumulation Units") is included in the back of this Prospectus as Appendix I.
THE ANNUITY CONTRACT
Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) (the "Company", "we" or "us") and Sun Life of Canada (U.S.) Variable Account F (the "Variable Account") offer the Contract to groups and individuals for use in connection with their retirement plans. The Contract is available on a group basis and, in certain states, may be available on an individual basis. We issue an Individual Contract directly to the individual owner of the Contract. We issue a Group Contract to the Owner, covering all individuals
participating under the Group Contract; each individual receives a Certificate that evidences his or her participation under the Group Contract.
In this Prospectus, unless we state otherwise, we refer to both the owners of Individual Contracts and participating individuals under Group Contracts as "Participants" and we address all Participants as "you"; we use the term "Contracts" to include Individual Contracts, Group Contracts, and Certificates issued under Group Contracts. For the purpose of determining benefits under both Individual Contracts
and Group Contracts, we establish an Account for each Participant, which we will refer to as "your" Account or a "Participant Account."
Your Contract provides a number of important benefits for your retirement planning. It has an Accumulation Phase, during which you make payments under the Contract and allocate them to one or more Variable Account or Fixed Account options, and an Income Phase, during which we make annuity payments based on the amount you have accumulated. Your Contract provides tax deferral, so that you do not pay taxes on your earnings under your Contract until you withdraw them. It provides a basic death benefit if you die during the Accumulation Phase. You may enhance the basic death benefit by electing one or more optional
death benefit riders and paying an additional charge for each optional death benefit rider you elect. Finally, if you so elect, during the Income Phase we will make annuity payments to you or someone else for life or for another period that you choose.
You choose these benefits on a variable or fixed basis or a combination of both. When you choose Variable Account investment options or a Variable Annuity option, your benefits will be responsive to changes in the economic environment, including inflationary forces and changes in rates of return available from different types of investments. With these variable options, you assume all investment risk under your Contract. When you choose a Guarantee Period in our Fixed Account or a Fixed Annuity option, we assume the investment risk, except in the case of early withdrawals in the Accumulation Phase, where you bear the risk of unfavorable interest rate changes. You may also bear the risk that the interest rates we will offer in the future and the rates we will use in determining your Fixed Annuity may not exceed our minimum guaranteed rate. Our minimum guaranteed interest rate
will never be less than that permitted by law.
The Contract is designed for use in connection with retirement and deferred compensation plans, some of which qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment under Sections 401, 403, 408 or 408A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Contract is also designed so that it may be used in connection with certain non-tax-qualified retirement plans, such as payroll savings plans and such other groups (trusteed or nontrusteed) as may be eligible under applicable law. We refer to Contracts used with plans that receive favorable tax treatment as "Qualified Contracts," and all other Contracts
as "Non-Qualified Contracts."
COMMUNICATING TO US ABOUT YOUR CONTRACT
All materials sent to us, including Purchase Payments, must be sent to our Annuity Mailing Address as set forth on the first page of this Prospectus. For all telephone communications, you must call (888) 786-2435.
Unless this Prospectus states differently, we will consider all materials sent to us and all telephone communications to be received on the date we actually receive them at our Annuity Mailing Address. However, we will consider all financial transactions, including Purchase Payments, withdrawal requests and transfer instructions, to be received on the next Business Day if we receive them (1) on a day that is not a Business Day or (2) after 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time.
When we specify that notice to us must be in writing, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to accept notice in another form.
SUN LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA (U.S.)
We are a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of Delaware on January 12, 1970. We do business in 49 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, and we have an insurance company subsidiary that does business in New York. Our Executive Office mailing address is One Sun Life Executive Park, Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts 02481.
We are an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada ("Sun Life (Canada)"). Sun Life (Canada) completed its demutualization on March 22, 2000. As a result of the demutualization, a new holding company, Sun Life Financial Services of Canada Inc. ("Sun Life Financial"), is now the ultimate parent of Sun Life (Canada) and the Company. Sun Life Financial, a corporation organized in Canada, is a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with common shares listed on the Toronto, New York, London, and Manila stock exchanges.
THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT
We established the Variable Account as a separate account on July 13, 1989, pursuant to a resolution of our Board of Directors. The Variable Account funds the Contract and various other variable annuity and variable life insurance product contracts which we offer. These other products may have features, benefits and charges that are different from those under the Contract.

Under Delaware insurance law and the Contract, the income, gains or losses of the Variable Account are credited to or charged against the assets of the Variable Account without regard to the other income, gains, or losses of the Company. These assets are held in relation to the Contract and other variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts that provide benefits that vary in accordance with the investment performance of the Variable Account. Although the assets maintained in the Variable Account will not be charged with any liabilities arising out of any other business we conduct, all obligations arising
under a Contract, including the promise to make annuity payments, are general corporate obligations of the Company.
The assets of the Variable Account are divided into Sub-Accounts. Each Sub-Account invests exclusively in shares of a specific Fund. All amounts allocated to the Variable Account will be used to purchase Fund shares as designated by you at their net asset value. Any and all distributions made by the Funds with respect to the shares held by the Variable Account will be reinvested to purchase additional Fund shares at their net asset value. Deductions will be made from the Variable Account for cash withdrawals, annuity payments, death benefits, Account Fees, Contract charges against the assets
 
of the Variable Account for the assumption of mortality and expense risks, administrative expenses and any applicable taxes. The Variable Account will be fully invested in Fund shares at all times.
VARIABLE ACCOUNT OPTIONS: THE FUNDS
The Contract offers Sub-Accounts that invest in a number of Fund investment options, which are briefly discussed below. Each Fund is a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or a separate series of shares of such a mutual fund.
More comprehensive information about the Funds, including a discussion of their management, investment objectives, expenses, and potential risks, is found in the current prospectuses for the Funds (the "Fund Prospectuses"). The Fund Prospectuses should be read in conjunction with this Prospectus before you invest. A copy of each Fund Prospectus, as well as a Statement of Additional Information for each Fund, may be obtained without charge from the company by calling (888) 786-2435 or by writing to Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.), c/o Retirement Products and Services, P.O. Box 9133, Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts
02481.

The Funds may also be available to registered separate accounts offering variable annuity and variable life products of other affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies, as well as to the Variable Account and other separate accounts of the Company. Although we do not anticipate any disadvantages to this, there is a possibility that a material conflict may arise between the interests of the Variable Account and one or more of the other separate accounts participating in the Funds. A conflict may occur due to a change in law affecting the operations of variable life and variable annuity separate accounts, differences in the voting instructions of the Participants and Payees and those of other companies, or some other reason. In the event of conflict, we will take any steps necessary to protect Participants and Payees, including withdrawal of the Variable Account from
participation in the underlying Funds which are involved in the conflict or substitution of shares of other Funds.
Certain of the investment advisers, transfer agents, or underwriters to the Funds may reimburse us for administrative costs in connection with administering the Funds as options under the Contracts. These amounts are not charged to the Funds or Participants, but are paid from assets of the advisers, transfer agents, or underwriters, except for the administrative costs of the Lord Abbett Series Trust Portfolios and the Rydex Funds, which are paid from Fund assets and reflected in the fee table.
Certain publicly available mutual funds may have similar investment goals and principal investment policies and risks as one or more of the Funds, and may be managed by a Fund's portfolio manager(s). While a Fund may have many similarities to these other funds, its investment performance will differ from their investment performance. This is due to a number of differences between a Fund and these similar products, including differences in sales charges, expense ratios and cash flows.
THE FIXED ACCOUNT
The Fixed Account is made up of all the general assets of the Company other than those allocated to any separate account. Amounts you allocate to Guarantee Periods become part of the Fixed Account, and are available to fund the claims of all classes of our customers, including claims for benefits under the Contracts.
We will invest the assets of the Fixed Account in those assets we choose that are allowed by applicable state insurance laws. In general, these laws permit investments, within specified limits and subject to certain qualifications, in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common stocks, real estate mortgages, real estate and certain other investments. We intend to invest primarily in investment-grade fixed income securities (i.e., rated by a nationally recognized rating service within the 4 highest grades) or instruments we believe are of comparable quality.

We are not obligated to invest amounts allocated to the Fixed Account according to any particular strategy, except as may be required by applicable state insurance laws. You will not have a direct or indirect interest in the Fixed Account investments.
THE FIXED ACCOUNT OPTIONS: THE GUARANTEE PERIODS
You may elect one or more Guarantee Period(s) from those we make available. From time to time, we may offer Guarantee Periods of different durations or stop offering some Guarantee Periods. Once we stop offering a Guarantee Period of a particular duration, allocations, transfers or renewals into that Guarantee Period will not be permitted. We publish Guaranteed Interest Rates for each Guarantee Period offered. We may change the Guaranteed Interest Rates we offer from time to time, but no Guaranteed Interest Rate will ever be less than the minimum guaranteed rate permitted by state law. Also, once we have accepted your allocation to a particular Guarantee Period, we promise that the Guaranteed Interest Rate applicable to that allocation will not change for the duration of the Guarantee Period.
We determine Guaranteed Interest Rates at our discretion. We do not have a specific formula for establishing the rates for different Guarantee Periods. Our determination will be influenced by the interest rates on fixed income investments in which we may invest amounts allocated to the Guarantee Periods. We will also consider other factors in determining these rates, including regulatory and tax requirements, sales commissions and administrative expenses borne by us, general economic trends and competitive factors. We cannot predict the level of future interest rates.
We may from time to time at our discretion offer special interest rates for new Purchase Payments that are higher than the rates we are then offering for renewals or transfers.
Early withdrawals from your allocation to a Guarantee Period, including cash withdrawals, transfers and commencement of an annuity option, may be subject to a Market Value Adjustment, which could decrease or increase the value of your Account. See "Withdrawals, Withdrawal Charge and Market Value Adjustment."
THE ACCUMULATION PHASE
During the Accumulation Phase of your Contract, you make payments into your Account, and your earnings accumulate on a tax-deferred basis. The Accumulation Phase begins with our acceptance of your first Purchase Payment and ends the Business Day before your Annuity Commencement Date. The Accumulation Phase will end sooner if you surrender your Contract or if the Covered Person dies before the Annuity Commencement Date.
 
 
 
Issuing Your Contract
When you purchase a Contract, a completed Application and the initial Purchase Payment are sent to us for acceptance. When we accept an Individual Contract, we issue the Contract to you. When we accept a Group Contract, we issue the Contract to the Owner; we issue a Certificate to you as a Participant.
We will credit your initial Purchase Payment to your Account within 2 Business Days of receiving your completed Application. If your Application is not complete, we will notify you. If we do not have the necessary information to complete the Application within 5 Business Days, we will send your money back to you or ask your permission to retain your Purchase Payment until the Application is made complete. Then we will apply the Purchase Payment within 2 Business Days of when the Application is complete.
Amount and Frequency of Purchase Payments
The amount of Purchase Payments may vary; however, we will not accept an initial Purchase Payment of less than $10,000, and each additional Purchase Payment must be at least $1,000, unless we waive these limits. In addition, we will not accept a Purchase Payment if your Account Value is over $2 million, or if the Purchase Payment would cause your Account Value to exceed $2 million, unless we have approved the Payment in advance. Within these limits, you may make Purchase Payments at any time during the Accumulation Phase.
Allocation of Net Purchase Payments
You may allocate your Purchase Payments among the different Sub-Accounts and Guarantee Periods we offer, but any allocation to a Guarantee Period must be at least $1,000. Over the life of your Contract, you may allocate amounts among as many as 18 of the available investment options.
In your Application, you may specify the percentage of each Purchase Payment to be allocated to each Sub-Account or Guarantee Period. These percentages are called your allocation factors. Your allocation factors will remain in effect as long as your selected Sub-Accounts and Guarantee Periods continue to be available for investment. You may, however, change the allocation factors for future Payments by sending us notice of the change in a form acceptable to us. We will use your new allocation factors for the first Purchase Payment we receive with or after we have received notice of the change, and for all future Purchase Payments, until we receive another change notice.
Although it is currently not our practice, we may deduct applicable premium taxes or similar taxes from your Purchase Payments (see "Contract Charges -- Premium Taxes"). In that case, we will credit your Net Purchase Payment, which is the Purchase Payment minus the amount of those taxes.
Your Account
When we accept your first Purchase Payment, we establish an Account for you, which we maintain throughout the Accumulation Phase of your Contract.
Your Account Value
Your Account Value is the sum of the value of the 2 components of your Contract, the Variable Account portion of your Contract ("Variable Account Value") and the Fixed Account portion of your Contract ("Fixed Account Value"). These 2 components are calculated separately, as described below under "Variable Account Value" and "Fixed Account Value."
Variable Account Value
     Variable Accumulation Units
In order to calculate your Variable Account Value, we use a measure called a Variable Accumulation Unit for each Sub-Account. Your Variable Account Value is the sum of your Account Value in each Sub-Account, which is the number of your Variable Accumulation Units for that Sub-Account times the value of each Unit.
 
     Variable Accumulation Unit Value
The value of each Variable Accumulation Unit in a Sub-Account reflects the net investment performance of that Sub-Account. We determine that value once on each day that the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading, at the close of trading, which is currently 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time. (The close of trading is determined by the New York Stock Exchange.) We also may determine the value of Variable Accumulation Units of a Sub-Account on days the Exchange is closed if there is enough trading in securities held by that Sub-Account to materially affect the value of the Variable Accumulation Units. Each day we make a valuation is called a "Business Day." The period that begins at the time Variable Accumulation Units are valued on a Business Day and ends at that time on the next Business Day is called a "Valuation Period." On days other than Business Days, the value of a Variable Accumulation Unit does not change.
To measure these values, we use a factor -- which we call the "Net Investment Factor" -- which represents the net return on the Sub-Account's assets. At the end of any Valuation Period, the value of a Variable Accumulation Unit for a Sub-Account is equal to the value of that Sub-Account's Variable Accumulation Units at the end of the previous Valuation Period, multiplied by the Net Investment Factor. We calculate the Net Investment Factor by dividing (1) the net asset value of a Fund share held in the Sub-Account at the end of that Valuation Period, plus the per share amount of any dividend or capital gains distribution made by that Fund during the Valuation Period, by (2) the net asset value per share of the Fund share at the end of the previous Valuation Period; then, for each day in the valuation period, we deduct a factor representing the asset-based insurance charges (the mortality and expense risk charges and the administrative expense charge) plus any
applicable charge for optional death benefit riders. See "Contract Charges".
For a hypothetical example of how we calculate the value of a Variable Accumulation Unit, see the Statement of Additional Information.
     Crediting and Canceling Variable Accumulation Units
When we receive an allocation to a Sub-Account either from a Net Purchase Payment or a transfer of Account Value, we credit that amount to your Account in Variable Accumulation Units. Similarly, we cancel Variable Accumulation Units when you transfer or withdraw amounts from a Sub-Account, or when we deduct certain charges under the Contract. We determine the number of Units credited or canceled by dividing the dollar amount by the Variable Accumulation Unit value for that Sub-Account at the end of the Valuation Period during which the transaction or charge is effective.
Fixed Account Value
Your Fixed Account value is the sum of all amounts allocated to Guarantee Periods, either from Net Purchase Payments, transfers or renewals, plus interest credited on those amounts, and minus withdrawals, transfers out of Guarantee Periods, and any deductions for charges under the Contract taken from your Fixed Account Value.
A Guarantee Period begins the day we apply your allocation and ends when all calendar years (or months if the Guarantee Period is less than one year) in the Guarantee Period (measured from the end of the calendar month in which the amount was allocated to the Guarantee Period) have elapsed. The last day of the Guarantee Period is its Renewal Date.
Each additional Purchase Payment, transfer or renewal credited to your Fixed Account Value will result in a new Guarantee Period with its own Renewal Date. Amounts allocated at different times to Guarantee Periods of the same duration may have different Renewal Dates.
     Crediting Interest
We credit interest on amounts allocated to a Guarantee Period at the applicable Guaranteed Interest Rate for the duration of the Guarantee Period. During the Guarantee Period, we credit interest daily at a rate that yields the Guaranteed Interest Rate on an annual effective basis.
     Guarantee Amounts
Each separate allocation you make to a Guarantee Period, together with interest credited thereon, is called a Guarantee Amount. Each Guarantee Amount is treated separately for purposes of determining the Market Value Adjustment. We may restrict a Guarantee Period that will extend beyond your Maximum Annuity Commencement Date. Renewals into a Guarantee Period that will extend beyond your maximum Annuity Commencement Date will result in an application of a Market Value Adjustment upon annuitization or withdrawals. Each new allocation to a Guarantee Period must be at least $1,000.
     Renewals
We will notify you in writing between 45 and 75 days before the Renewal Date for any Guarantee Amount. If you would like to change your Fixed Account option, we must receive from you prior to the Renewal Date:


1)

written notice electing a different Guarantee Period from among those we then offer, or


 

 


2)

written instructions to transfer the Guarantee Amount to one or more Sub-Accounts, in accordance with the transfer privilege provisions of the Contract (see "Transfer Privilege.")


If we receive no instructions from you prior to the Renewal Date, we will automatically renew your Fixed Account allocation into a new Guarantee Period of the same duration as the last Guarantee Period. If we are no longer offering a Guarantee Period of the same duration, we will automatically transfer your Fixed Account allocation into the Money Market Sub-Account.
A Guarantee Amount will not renew into a Guarantee Period that will extend beyond your Maximum Annuity Commencement Date. In that case, unless you notify us otherwise, we will automatically renew your Guarantee Amount into the Money Market Sub-Account.
     Early Withdrawals
If you withdraw, transfer, or annuitize an allocation to a Guarantee Period 30 days prior to the Renewal Date, we will apply a Market Value Adjustment to the transaction. This could result in an increase or a decrease of your Account Value, depending on interest rates at the time. You bear the risk that you will receive less than your principal if the Market Value Adjustment applies.
Transfer Privilege
     Permitted Transfers
During the Accumulation Phase, you may transfer all or part of your Account Value to one or more Sub-Accounts or Guarantee Periods then available, subject to the following restrictions:


o

You may not make more than 12 transfers in any Account Year;


 

 


o

The amount transferred from a Sub-Account must be at least $1,000, unless you are transferring your entire balance in that Sub-Account;


 

 


o

Your Account Value remaining in a Sub-Account must be at least $1,000;


 

 


o

The amount transferred from a Guarantee Period must be the entire Guarantee Amount, except for transfers of interest credited during the current Account Year;


 

 


o

At least 30 days must elapse between transfers to and from Guarantee Periods;


 

 


o

Transfers to or from Sub-Accounts are subject to terms and conditions that may be imposed by the Funds; 


 

 


o

The total number of Sub-Accounts and Guarantee Periods within an Account may not exceed 18 over the lifetime of the Contract; and


 

 


o

We impose additional restrictions on market timers, which are further described below.


These restrictions do not apply to transfers made under any approved Optional Program. At our discretion, we may waive some or all of these restrictions.
There is usually no charge imposed on transfers; however, we reserve the right to impose a transfer charge of $15 for each transfer. Transfers out of a Guarantee Period more than 30 days before the Renewal Date or any time after the Renewal Date or any time after the Renewal Date will be subject to the Market Value Adjustment described below. Under current law, there is no tax liability for transfers.
     Requests for Transfers
You may request transfers in writing or by telephone. If the request is by telephone, it must be made before the earlier of (a) 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on a Business Day, or (b) the close of the New York Stock Exchange on days that the Stock Exchange closes before 4:00 p.m. Otherwise, your transfer request will be effective on the next Business Day. The telephone transfer privilege is available automatically, and does not require your written election. We will require personal identifying information to process a request for a transfer made by telephone. We will not be liable for following instructions communicated by telephone that we reasonably believe are genuine.
Your transfer request will be effective as of the close of the Business Day if we receive your transfer request before the earlier of (a) 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on a Business Day, or (b) the close of the New York Stock Exchange on days that the Stock Exchange closes before 4:00 p.m. Otherwise, your transfer request will be effective on the next Business Day.
     Market Timers
The Contracts are not designed for professional market timing organizations or other entities using programmed and frequent transfers. If you wish to employ such strategies, you should not purchase a Contract. Accordingly, transfers may be subject to restrictions if exercised by a market timing firm or any other third party authorized to initiate transfer transactions on behalf of multiple Participants. In imposing such restrictions, we may, among other things, not accept (1) the transfer instructions of any agent acting under a power of attorney on behalf of more than one Participant, or (2) the transfer instructions of individual Participants who have executed preauthorized transfer forms
that are submitted at the same time by market timing firms or other third parties on behalf of more than one Participant. We will not impose these restrictions unless our actions are reasonably intended to prevent the use of such transfers in a manner that will disadvantage or potentially impair the Contract rights of other Participants.
In addition, the Series Fund has reserved the right to temporarily or permanently refuse exchange requests from the Variable Account if, in the Fund manager's judgment, a Fund would be unable to invest effectively in accordance with its investment objective and policies, or would otherwise potentially be adversely affected. In particular, a pattern of exchanges that coincide with a market timing strategy may be disruptive to a Fund and therefore may be refused. Accordingly, the Variable Account may not be in a position to effectuate transfers and may refuse transfer requests without prior notice. We also reserve the right, for similar reasons, to refuse or delay exchange requests involving transfers to or from the Fixed Account.
Waivers; Reduced Charges; Special Guaranteed Interest Rates
We may reduce or waive the withdrawal charge, mortality and expense risk charges, the administrative service fee or the annual Account Fee, credit additional amounts, grant special Guaranteed Interest Rates in certain situations, or offer other options or benefits. These situations may include sales of Contracts (1) where selling and/or maintenance costs associated with the Contracts are reduced, such as the sale of several Contracts to the same Participant, sales of large Contracts, and certain group sales, and (2) to officers, directors and employees of the
Company or its affiliates, registered representatives and employees of broker-dealers with a current selling agreement with the Company and affiliates of such representatives and broker-dealers, employees of affiliated asset management firms, and persons who have retired from such positions ("Eligible Employees") and immediate family members of Eligible Employees. Eligible Employees and their immediate family members may also purchase a Contract without regard to minimum Purchase Payment requirements. For other situations in which withdrawal charges may be waived, see "Withdrawals, Withdrawal Charge and Market Value Adjustment."
Optional Programs
     Dollar-Cost Averaging
Dollar-cost averaging allows you to invest gradually, over time, in up to 12 Sub-Accounts. You may select a dollar-cost averaging program at no extra charge by allocating a minimum of $1,000 to a designated Sub-Account or to a Guarantee Period we make available in connection with the program.
Amounts allocated to the Fixed Account under the program will earn interest at a rate declared by the Company for the Guarantee Period you select. Previously applied amounts may not be transferred to a Guarantee Period made available in connection with this program. At regular time intervals, we will transfer the same amount automatically to one or more Sub-Accounts that you choose, up to a maximum of 12 Sub-Accounts. The program continues until your Account Value allocated to the program is depleted or you elect to stop the program. The final amount transferred from the Fixed Account will include all interest earned.
No Market Value Adjustment (either positive or negative) will apply to amounts automatically transferred from the Fixed Account under the dollar-cost averaging program. However, if you discontinue or alter the program prior to completion, amounts remaining in the Fixed Account will be transferred to the Money Market Fund investment option under the Contract, unless you instruct us otherwise, and the Market Value Adjustment will be applied. Any new allocation of a Purchase Payment to the program will be treated as commencing a new dollar-cost averaging program and is subject to the $1,000 minimum.
The main objective of a dollar-cost averaging program is to minimize the impact of short-term price fluctuations on Account Value. In general, since you transfer the same dollar amount to the variable investment options at set intervals, dollar-cost averaging allows you to purchase more Variable Accumulation Units (and, indirectly, more Fund shares) when prices are low and fewer Variable Accumulation Units (and, indirectly, fewer Fund shares) when prices are high. Therefore, you may achieve a lower average cost per Variable Accumulation Unit over the long term. A dollar-cost averaging program allows you to take advantage of market fluctuations. However, it is important to understand that a dollar-cost averaging program does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. We do not allow transfers into any of the Guarantee Periods.
     Asset Allocation
One or more asset allocation programs may be available in connection with the Contract, at no extra charge. Asset allocation is the process of investing in different asset classes -- such as equity funds, fixed income funds, and money market funds -- depending on your personal investment goals, tolerance for risk, and investment time horizon. By spreading your money among a variety of asset classes, you may be able to reduce the risk and volatility of investing, although there are no guarantees, and asset allocation does not insure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Currently, you may select one of the available asset allocation models, each of which represents a combination of Sub-Accounts with a different level of risk. These models, as well as the terms and conditions of the asset allocation program, are fully described in a separate brochure. We may add or delete programs in the future.
If you elect an asset allocation program, we will automatically allocate your Purchase Payments among the Sub-Accounts represented in the model you choose. By electing an asset allocation program, you thereby authorize us to automatically reallocate your investment options, as determined by the terms of the asset allocation program, to reflect the current composition of the model you have selected, without further instruction, until we receive notification that you wish to terminate the program, or choose a different model.
     Systematic Withdrawal Program
If you have an Account Value of $10,000 or more, you may select our Systematic Withdrawal Program.
Under this program, you determine the amount and frequency of regular withdrawals you would like to receive from your Fixed Account Value and/or Variable Account Value and we will effect them automatically. The withdrawals under this program may be subject to surrender charges or a Market Value Adjustment. They may also be included as income and subject to a 10% federal tax penalty. You should consult your tax adviser before choosing this option.
You may change or stop this program at any time, by written notice to us.
     Portfolio Rebalancing Program
Under the Portfolio Rebalancing Program, we transfer funds among all Sub-Accounts to maintain the percentage allocation you have selected among these Sub-Accounts. At your election, we will make these transfers on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis.
Portfolio Rebalancing does not permit transfers to or from any Guarantee Period.
     Principal Returns Program
Under the Principal Returns Program, we divide your Purchase Payments between the Fixed Account and the Variable Account. For the Fixed Account portion, you choose a Guarantee Period from among those we offer. We then allocate to that Guarantee Period the portion of your Purchase Payment necessary so that, at the end of the Guarantee Period, your Fixed Account allocation, including interest, will equal the entire amount of your original Purchase Payment. The remainder of the original Purchase Payment will be invested in the Sub-Accounts of your choice. At the end of the Guarantee Period, you will be guaranteed the amount of your original Purchase Payment (assuming no withdrawals), plus you will have the benefit, if any, of the investment performance of the Sub-Accounts you have chosen.
WITHDRAWALS, WITHDRAWAL CHARGE AND MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENT
Cash Withdrawals
     Requesting a Withdrawal
At any time during the Accumulation Phase, you may withdraw in cash all or any portion of your Account Value. To make a withdrawal, you must send us a written request at our Annuity Mailing Address. Your request must specify whether you want to withdraw the entire amount of your Account or, if less, the amount you wish to receive.
All withdrawals may be subject to a withdrawal charge (see "Withdrawal Charge"), and withdrawals from your Fixed Account Value also may be subject to a Market Value Adjustment (see "Market Value Adjustment"). Withdrawals also may have adverse income tax consequences, including a 10% penalty tax (see "Tax Considerations"). You should carefully consider these tax consequences before requesting a cash withdrawal.
     Full Withdrawals
If you request a full withdrawal, we calculate the amount we will pay you as follows: We start with the total value of your Account at the end of the Valuation Period during which we receive your withdrawal request; we deduct the Account Fee for the Account Year in which the withdrawal is made; we add or subtract the amount of any Market Value Adjustment applicable to your Fixed Account Value; and finally, we deduct any applicable withdrawal charge.
A full withdrawal results in the surrender of your Contract, and cancellation of all rights and privileges under your Contract.
     Partial Withdrawals
If you request a partial withdrawal, we will pay you the actual amount specified in your request and then adjust the value of your Account by deducting the amount paid, adding or deducting any
Market Value Adjustment applicable to amounts withdrawn from the Fixed Account, and deducting any applicable withdrawal charge.
You may specify the amount you want withdrawn from each Sub-Account and/or Guarantee Amount to which your Account is allocated. If you do not so specify, we will deduct the total amount you request pro rata, based on your Account Value at the end of the Valuation Period during which we receive your request.
If you request a partial withdrawal that would result in your Account Value being reduced to an amount less than the Account Fee for the Account Year in which you make the withdrawal, we will treat it as a request for a full withdrawal.
     Time of Payment
We will pay you the applicable amount of any full or partial withdrawal within 7 days after we receive your withdrawal request, except in cases where we are permitted, and choose, to defer payment under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and applicable state insurance law. Currently, we may defer payment of amounts you withdraw from the Variable Account only for the following periods:


o

When the New York Stock Exchange is closed (except weekends and holidays) or when trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted;


 

 


o

When it is not reasonably practical to dispose of securities held by a Fund or to determine the value of the net assets of a Fund, because an emergency exists; or


 

 


o

When an SEC order permits us to defer payment for the protection of Participants.


We also may defer payment of amounts you withdraw from the Fixed Account for up to 6 months from the date we receive your withdrawal request. We do not pay interest on the amount of any payments we defer.
     Withdrawal Restrictions for Qualified Plans
If your Contract is a Qualified Contract, you should carefully check the terms of your retirement plan for limitations and restrictions on cash withdrawals.
Special restrictions apply to withdrawals from Contracts used for Section 403(b) annuities (see "Tax Considerations -- Tax-Sheltered Annuities").
Withdrawal Charge
We do not deduct any sales charge from your Purchase Payments when they are made. However, we may impose a withdrawal charge (known as a "contingent deferred sales charge") on certain amounts you withdraw. We impose this charge to defray some of our expenses related to the sale of the Contracts, such as commissions we pay to agents, the cost of sales literature, and other promotional costs and transaction expenses.
     Free Withdrawal Amount
In each Account Year you may withdraw a portion of your Account Value -- which we call the "free withdrawal amount" -- before incurring the withdrawal charge.
The "free withdrawal amount" is equal to 10% of the amount of all Purchase Payments you have made. After the fourth Account Anniversary, any amount you withdraw is free of withdrawal charges.
The "free withdrawal amount" that you do not use in an Account Year is not cumulative. In other words, it will not be carried forward or available for use in future Account Years.
For an example of how we calculate the "free withdrawal amount," see Appendix B.
     Withdrawal Charge on Purchase Payments
If you withdraw more than the free withdrawal amount in any Account Year, we consider the excess amount to be withdrawn first from Payments that you have not previously withdrawn. We impose the withdrawal charge on the amount of these Payments. Thus, the maximum amount on which we will impose the withdrawal charge in any year will never be more than the total of all Payments that you have not previously withdrawn.
The amount of your withdrawal, if any, that exceeds the total of the free withdrawal amount plus the aggregate amount of all Payments not previously withdrawn, is not subject to the withdrawal charge.
     Order of Withdrawal
When you make a withdrawal, we consider the free withdrawal amount to be withdrawn first. We consider Purchase Payments that you have not already withdrawn to be withdrawn next. Once all Purchase Payments are withdrawn, the balance withdrawn is considered to be earnings and is not subject to a withdrawal charge.
     Calculation of Withdrawal Charge
We calculate the amount of the withdrawal charge by multiplying the amount you withdraw by a percentage. As set forth below, the percentage decreases according to the number of complete Account Years since your Contract Date. After your fourth Account Anniversary, any amount you withdraw is free of withdrawal charges.


Number of

Withdrawal


Contract Date

Charge


0-1

6%


1-2

2-3

5%


3-4

0%



The withdrawal charge will never be greater than 6% of the excess of your Account Value over the "free withdrawal amount," as defined above.
For a Group Contract, we may modify the withdrawal charges and limits, upon notice to the Owner of the Group Contract. However, any modification will apply only to Accounts established after the date of the modification.
For additional examples of how we calculate withdrawal charges, see Appendix B.
Types of Withdrawals not Subject to Withdrawal Charge
     Nursing Home Waivers
If approved by your state, we will waive the withdrawal charge for a full or partial withdrawal if:


o

at least one year has passed since we issued your Contract, and


 

 


o

you are confined to an eligible nursing home and have been confined there for at least the preceding 180 days, or any shorter period required by your state.


An "eligible nursing home" means a licensed hospital or licensed skilled or intermediate care nursing facility at which medical treatment is available on a daily basis and daily medical records are kept for each patient. You must provide us evidence of confinement in the form we determine.
     Minimum Distributions
For each Qualified Contract, the free withdrawal amount in any Account Year will be the greater of the free withdrawal amount described above or any amounts required to be withdrawn to comply with the minimum distribution requirement of the Internal Revenue Code. This waiver of the withdrawal charge applies only to the portion of the required minimum distribution attributable to that Qualified Contract.
     Other Withdrawals
We do not impose the withdrawal charge on amounts you apply to provide an annuity, amounts we pay as a death benefit, except under the Cash Surrender method, or amounts you transfer among the Sub-Accounts, between the Sub-Accounts and the Fixed Account, or within the Fixed Account.
Market Value Adjustment
If permitted under the laws of your state, we will apply a Market Value Adjustment if you withdraw or transfer amounts from your Fixed Account Value more than 30 days before the end of the applicable Guarantee Period. For this purpose, using Fixed Account Value to provide an annuity is considered a withdrawal, and the Market Value Adjustment will apply. However, we will not apply the Market Value Adjustment to automatic transfers to a Sub-Account from a Guarantee Period as part of our dollar-cost averaging program.
We apply the Market Value Adjustment separately to each Guarantee Amount in the Fixed Account, that is to each separate allocation you have made to a Guarantee Period together with interest credited on that allocation. However, we do not apply the adjustment to the amount of interest credited during your current Account Year. Any withdrawal from a Guarantee Amount is attributed first to such interest.
A Market Value Adjustment may decrease, increase or have no effect on your Account Value. This will depend on changes in interest rates since you made your allocation to the Guarantee Period and the length of time remaining in the Guarantee Period. In general, if the Guaranteed Interest Rate we currently declare for Guarantee Periods equal to the balance of your Guarantee Period (or your entire Guarantee Period for Guarantee Periods of less than one year) is higher than your Guaranteed Interest Rate, the Market Value Adjustment is likely to decrease your Account Value. If our current Guaranteed Interest Rate is lower, the Market Value Adjustment is likely to increase your Account Value.

We determine the amount of the Market Value Adjustment by multiplying the amount that is subject to the adjustment by the following formula:
[(1 + I) / (1 + J + b)] ^ (N/12)   -1
where:


I

is the Guaranteed Interest Rate applicable to the Guarantee Amount from which you withdraw, transfer or annuitize;


 

 


J

is the Guaranteed Interest Rate we declare at the time of your withdrawal, transfer or annuitization for Guarantee Periods equal to the length of time remaining in the Guarantee Period applicable to your Guarantee Amount, rounded to the next higher number of complete years, for Guarantee Periods of one year or more. For any Guarantee Periods of less than one year, J is the Guaranteed Interest Rate we declare at the time of your withdrawal, transfer or annuitization for a Guarantee Period of the same length as your Guarantee Period. If, at that time, we do not offer the applicable Guarantee Period we will use an interest rate determined by straight-line interpolation of the Guaranteed Interest Rates for the Guarantee Periods we do offer;


 

 


N

is the number of complete months remaining in your Guarantee Period; and


 

 


b

is a factor that currently is 0%, but that in the future we may increase to up to 0.25%. Any increase would be applicable only to Participants who purchase their Contracts after the date of that increase.


The "b" factor is the amount that will be used to cover market volatility (i.e., credit risk), basis risk, and /or liquidity costs.
We will apply the Market Value Adjustment to the amount being withdrawn after deduction of any Account Fee, if applicable, but before we impose any withdrawal charge on the amount withdrawn.
For examples of how we calculate the Market Value Adjustment, see Appendix B.
CONTRACT CHARGES
Account Fee
During the Accumulation Phase of your Contract, we will deduct from your Account an annual Account Fee of $50 to help cover the administrative expenses we incur related to the issuance of Contracts and the maintenance of Accounts. We deduct the Account Fee on each Account Anniversary. We deduct the Account Fee pro rata from each Sub-Account and each Guarantee Period, based on the allocation of your Account Value on your Account Anniversary.
We will not charge the Account Fee if:


(1)

your Account has been allocated only to the Fixed Account during the applicable Account Year; or


 

 


(2)

your Account Value is $100,000 or more on your Account Anniversary.


If you make a full withdrawal of your Account, we will deduct the full amount of the Account Fee at the time of the withdrawal. In addition, on the Annuity Commencement Date we will deduct a pro rata portion of the Account Fee to reflect the time elapsed between the last Account Anniversary and the day before the Annuity Commencement Date.
After the Annuity Commencement Date, we will deduct an annual Account Fee of $50 in the aggregate in equal amounts from each Variable Annuity payment we make during the year. We do not deduct any Account Fee from Fixed Annuity payments.
Administrative Expense Charge
We deduct an administrative expense charge from the assets of the Variable Account at an annual effective rate equal to 0.15% during both the Accumulation Phase and the Income Phase. This charge is designed to reimburse us for expenses we incur in administering the Contracts, Participant Accounts and the Variable Account that are not covered by the annual Account Fee.
Mortality and Expense Risk Charge
During both the Accumulation Phase and the Income Phase, we deduct a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Variable Account at an effective annual rate equal to 1.20%, if your initial Purchase Payment was less than $1,000,000, or 0.95% if your initial Purchase Payment was $1,000,000 or more. The mortality risk we assume arises from our contractual obligation to continue to make annuity payments to each Annuitant, regardless of how long the Annuitant lives and regardless of how long all Annuitants as a group live. This obligation assures each Annuitant that neither the longevity of fellow Annuitants nor an improvement in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect on the amount of any annuity payment received under the Contract. The mortality risk also arises from our contractual obligation to pay a death benefit upon the death of the Participant
prior to the Annuity Commencement Date. The expense risk we assume is the risk that the annual Account Fee and the administrative expense charge we assess under the Contract may be insufficient to cover the actual total administrative expenses we incur. If the amount of the charge is insufficient to cover the mortality and expense risks, we will bear the loss. If the amount of the charge is more than sufficient to cover the risks, we will make a profit on the charge. We may use this profit for any proper corporate purpose, including the payment of marketing and distribution expenses for the Contract.
Charges for Optional Death Benefit Riders
If you elect an optional death benefit rider, we will deduct, during the Accumulation Phase, a charge from the assets of the Variable Account depending upon which of the optional death benefit rider(s) you elect.

*As defined below
Premium Taxes
Some states and local jurisdictions impose a premium tax on us that is equal to a specified percentage of the Purchase Payments you make. In many states there is no premium tax. We believe that the amounts of applicable premium taxes currently range from 0% to 3.5%. You should consult a tax adviser to find out if your state imposes a premium tax and the amount of any tax.
In order to reimburse us for the premium tax we may pay on Purchase Payments, our policy is to deduct the amount of such taxes from the amount you apply to provide an annuity at the time of annuitization. However, we reserve the right to deduct the amount of any applicable tax from your Account at any time, including at the time you make a Purchase Payment or make a full or partial withdrawal. We do not make any profit on the deductions we make to reimburse premium taxes.
Fund Expenses
There are fees and charges deducted from each Fund. These fees and expenses are described in the Fund prospectus(es) and related Statements of Additional Information.
Modification in the Case of Group Contracts
For Group Contracts, we may modify the annual Account Fee, the administrative expense charge and the mortality and expense risk charge upon notice to Owners. However, such modification will apply only with respect to Participant Accounts established after the effective date of the modification.
DEATH BENEFIT
If the Covered Person dies during the Accumulation Phase, we will pay a death benefit to your Beneficiary, using the payment method elected (a single cash payment or one of our Annuity Options). If the Beneficiary is not living on the date of death of the Covered Person, we will pay the death benefit in one sum to your estate. We do not pay a death benefit if the Covered Person dies during the Income Phase. However, the Beneficiary will receive any annuity payments provided under an Annuity Option that is in effect. If your Contract names more than one Covered Person, we will pay the death benefit upon the first death of such Covered Persons.
Amount of Death Benefit
To calculate the amount of the death benefit, we use a "Death Benefit Date." The Death Benefit Date is the date we receive proof of the death of the Covered Person in an acceptable form ("Due Proof of Death") if you have elected a death benefit payment method before the death of the Covered Person and it remains in effect. Otherwise, the Death Benefit Date is the later of the date we receive Due Proof of Death or the date we receive the Beneficiary's election of either payment method or, if the Beneficiary is your spouse, Contract continuation. If we do not receive the Beneficiary's election within 60 days after we receive Due Proof of Death, we reserve the right to provide a lump sum to your Beneficiary.
The amount of the death benefit is determined as of the Death Benefit Date.
The Basic Death Benefit
In general, if you were 85 or younger on the date we accepted your Application, the death benefit will be the greatest of the following amounts:


1.

Your Account Value for the Valuation Period during which the Death Benefit Date occurs;


 

 


2.

The amount we would pay if you had surrendered your entire Account on the Death Benefit Date; and


 

 


3.

Your total Purchase Payments (adjusted for partial withdrawals as described in "Calculating the Death Benefit") as of the Death Benefit Date.


For examples of how to calculate this basic death benefit, see Appendix C.
If you were 86 or older on your Contract Date, the death benefit is equal to amount (2) above. Because this amount will reflect any applicable withdrawal charges and Market Value Adjustment, it may be less than your Account Value.
Optional Death Benefit Riders
Subject to availability in your state, you may enhance the "Basic Death Benefit" by electing one or more of the following optional death benefit riders. You must make your election before the date on which your Contract becomes effective. You will pay a charge for each optional death benefit rider you elect. (For a description of these charges, see "Charges for Optional Death Benefit Riders.") The Riders are available only if you are younger than 80 on the Contract Date. Any optional death benefit election may not be changed after the Contract is issued. The death benefit under all optional death benefit riders will be adjusted for all partial withdrawals as described in the Prospectus
under the heading "Calculating the Death Benefit." For examples of how the death benefit is calculated under the optional death benefit riders, see Appendices D - H.
     Maximum Anniversary Account Value ("MAV") Rider

Under this rider, the death benefit will be the greater of:


o

the amount payable under basic death benefit (above), or


 

 


o

your highest Account Value on any Account Anniversary before your 81st birthday, adjusted for any subsequent Purchase Payments, partial withdrawals and charges made between that Account Anniversary and the Death Benefit Date.


     5% Premium Roll-Up ("5% ROLL-UP") Rider

Under this rider, the death benefit will be the greater of:


o

the amount payable under basic death benefit (above), or


 

 


o

the sum of your total Purchase Payments plus interest accruals, adjusted for partial withdrawals.


Under this rider, interest accrues at a rate of 5% per year on Purchase Payments and transfers to the Variable Account while they remain in the Variable Account. The 5% interest accruals will continue until the earlier of:


o

the first day of the month following your 80th birthday, or


 

 


o

the day the death benefit amount under this rider equals twice the total of your Purchase Payments and transferred amounts, adjusted for withdrawals.


     Earnings Enhancement ("EEB") Rider
If you elect this EEB Rider, your death benefit will be the amount payable under the basic death benefit, PLUS the "EEB amount." Calculated as of your Death Benefit Date, the "EEB amount" is determined as follows:


o

If you are 69 or younger on your Contract Date, the "EEB amount" will be 40% of the difference between your Account Value and your Net Purchase Payments, up to a cap of 40% of the Net Purchase Payments made prior to your death.


 

 


o

If you are between the ages of 70 and 79 on your Contract Date, the "EEB amount" will be 25% of the difference between your Account Value and your Net Purchase Payments, up to a cap of 25% of the Net Purchase Payments prior to your death.


     Earnings Enhancement Plus ("EEB Plus") Rider
If you elect this EEB Plus Rider, your death benefit will be the amount payable under the basic death benefit, PLUS the "EEB Plus amount." Calculated as of the Death Benefit Date, the "EEB Plus amount" is determined as follows:


o

If you are 69 or younger on your Contract Date, the "EEB Plus amount" will be 40% of the difference between your Account Value and your Net Purchase Payments, up to a cap of 100% of the Net Purchase Payments made prior to your death. After the 7th Contract year, the cap is 100% of the difference between your Net Purchase Payments and any Purchase Payments made within the twelve months prior to your death.


 

 


o

If you are between the ages of 70 and 79 on your Contract Date, the "EEB Plus amount" will be 25% of the difference between your Account Value and your Net Purchase Payments, up to a cap of 40% of the Net Purchase Payments made prior to your death. After the 7th Contract year, the cap is 40% of the difference between your Net Purchase Payments and any Purchase Payments made in the twelve months prior to your death.


     Earnings Enhancement Plus with MAV ("EEB Plus MAV") Rider
If you elect this EEB Plus MAV Rider, your death benefit will be the death benefit payable under the MAV Rider PLUS the "EEB Plus MAV amount." Calculated as of your Death Benefit Date, the "EEB Plus MAV amount" is as follows:


o

If you are 69 or younger on your Contract Date, the "EEB Plus MAV amount" will be 40% of the difference between the death benefit payable under the MAV Rider and your Net Purchase Payments, up to a cap of 100% of Net Purchase Payments made prior to your death. After your 7th Contract year, the cap is 100% of the difference between your Net Purchase Payments and any Purchase Payments made in the twelve months prior to your death.


 

 


o

If you are between the ages of 70 and 79 on your Contract Date, the "EEB Plus MAV amount" will be 25% of the difference between the death benefit payable under the MAV Rider and your Net Purchase Payments, up to a cap of 40% of Net Purchase Payments made prior to your death. After your 7th Contract year, the cap is 40% of the difference between your Net Purchase Payments and any Purchase Payments made in the twelve months prior to your death.


     Earnings Enhancement Plus with 5% Roll-Up ("EEB Plus 5% Roll-Up") Rider
If you elect this EEB Plus 5% Roll-Up Rider, your death benefit will be the death benefit payable under the 5% Roll-Up Rider PLUS the "EEB Plus 5% Roll-Up amount." Calculated as of your Death Benefit Date, the "EEB Plus 5% Roll-Up amount" is determined as follows:


o

If you are 69 or younger on your Contract Date, the "EEB Plus 5% Roll-Up amount" will be 40% of the difference between the death benefit payable under the 5% Roll-Up Rider and your Net Purchase Payments, up to a cap of 100% of Net Purchase Payments made prior to your death. After your 7th Contract year, the cap is 100% of the difference between your Net Purchase Payments and any Purchase Payments made in the twelve months prior to your death.


 

 


o

If you are between the ages of 70 and 79 on your Contract Date, the "EEB Plus 5% Roll-Up amount" will be 25% of the difference between the death benefit payable under the 5% Roll-Up Rider and your Net Purchase Payments, up to a cap of 40% of Net Purchase Payments made prior to your death. After your 7th Contract year, the cap is 40% of the difference between your Net Purchase Payments and any Purchase Payments made in the twelve months prior to your death.


     Selecting Multiple Death Benefit Riders
The MAV Rider, the 5% Roll-Up Rider, and the EEB Rider can be combined. If you elect more than one of these three optional death benefit riders, your death benefit will be calculated as follows:


o

MAV Rider combined with 5% Roll-Up Rider: The death benefit will equal the greater of the death benefit under the MAV Rider and the death benefit under the 5% Roll-Up Rider.


 

 


o

MAV Rider combined with EEB Rider: The death benefit will equal the death benefit under the MAV Rider, plus the "EEB amount." The "EEB amount" is calculated using the Account Value before the application of the MAV Rider.


 

 


o

EEB Rider combined with 5% Roll-Up Rider: The death benefit will equal the death benefit under the 5% Roll-Up Rider, plus the "EEB amount." The "EEB amount" is calculated using the Account Value before the application of the 5% Roll-Up Rider.


 

 


o

MAV Rider, the 5% Roll-Up Rider and the EEB Rider: The Death Benefit Will Equal The Greater Of The Death Benefit Under The MAV Rider Or The Death Benefit Under The 5% Roll-Up Rider, Plus The "EEB Amount." The "EEB Amount" Is Calculated Using The Account Value Before The Application Of The 5% Roll-Up Rider And The MAV Rider.


The EEB Plus, EEB Plus MAV, and EEB Plus 5% Roll-Up Riders are designed to be "comprehensive" riders and may not be combined with each other or with any of the other death benefit riders.
Spousal Continuance
If your spouse is your sole Beneficiary, upon your death your spouse may elect to continue the Contract as the Participant, rather than receive the death benefit amount. In that case, we will not pay a death benefit, but the Contract's Account Value will be equal to your Contract's death benefit amount, as defined under the "Basic Death Benefit" or any optional death benefit rider you have selected. All Contract provisions, including any optional death benefit riders you have selected, will continue as if your spouse had purchased the Contract
on the Death Benefit Date with a deposit equal to the death benefit amount. For purposes of calculating death benefits and expenses from that date forward, your spouse's age on the original effective date of the Contract will be used. Upon surrender or annuitization, this step-up to the spouse will not be treated as premium, but will be treated as income.
Calculating the Death Benefit
In calculating the death benefit amount payable under option (3) of the "Basic Death Benefit" or any of the optional death benefit riders, any partial withdrawals will reduce the death benefit amount to an amount equal to the death benefit amount immediately before the withdrawal multiplied by the ratio of the Account Value immediately after the withdrawal to the Account Value immediately before the withdrawal.
If the death benefit is the amount payable under options (2) or (3) of the "Basic Death Benefit" or under any of the optional death benefit riders, your Account Value may be increased by the excess, if any, of that amount over option (1) of the "Basic Death Benefit." Any such increase will be allocated to the Sub-Accounts in proportion to your Account Value in those Sub-Accounts on the Death Benefit Date. Such increase will be made only if the Beneficiary elects to annuitize, elects to defer annuitization, or elects to continue the Contract. Also, any portion of this new Account Value attributed to the Fixed Account will be transferred to the available Money Market Fund investment option (without the application of a Market Value Adjustment). If your spouse, as the named Beneficiary, elects to continue the Contract
after your death, your spouse may transfer any such Fixed Account portion back to the Fixed Account and begin a new Guarantee Period.
Method of Paying Death Benefit
The death benefit may be paid in a single cash payment or as an annuity (either fixed, variable or a combination), under one or more of our Annuity Options. We describe the Annuity Options in this Prospectus under "The Income Phase -- Annuity Provisions."
During the Accumulation Phase, you may elect the method of payment for the death benefit. If no such election is in effect on the date of your death, the Beneficiary may elect either a single cash payment or an annuity. If the Beneficiary is your spouse, the Beneficiary may elect to continue the Contract. These elections are made by sending us a completed election form, which we will provide. If we do not receive the Beneficiary's election within 60 days after we receive Due Proof of Death, we will pay the death benefit in a single cash payment.
If we pay the death benefit in the form of an Annuity Option, the Beneficiary becomes the Annuitant/Payee under the terms of that Annuity Option.
Non-Qualified Contracts
If your Contract is a Non-Qualified Contract, special distribution rules apply to the payment of the death benefit. The amount of the death benefit must be distributed either (1) as a lump sum within 5 years after your death, or (2) if in the form of an annuity, over a period not greater than the life or expected life of the "designated beneficiary" within the meaning of Section 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code, with payments beginning no later than one year after your death.
The person you have named as Beneficiary under your Contract, if any, will be the "designated beneficiary." If the named Beneficiary is not living and no contingent beneficiary has been named, the surviving Participant, if any, or the estate of the deceased Participant automatically becomes the designated beneficiary.
If the designated beneficiary is your surviving spouse, your spouse may continue the Contract in his or her own name as Participant. To make this election, your spouse must give us written notification within 60 days after we receive Due Proof of Death. The special distribution rules will then apply on the death of your spouse. To understand what happens when your spouse continues the Contract, see "Spousal Continuance," above.
During the Income Phase, if the Annuitant dies, the remaining value of the Annuity Option in place must be distributed at least as rapidly as the method of distribution under that option.
If the Participant is not a natural person, these distribution rules apply upon the death of any Annuitant.
Payments made in contravention of these special rules would adversely affect the treatment of the Contracts as annuity contracts under the Internal Revenue Code. Neither you nor the Beneficiary may exercise rights that would have that effect.
Selection and Change of Beneficiary
You select your Beneficiary in your Application. You may change your Beneficiary at any time by sending us written notice on our required form, unless you previously made an irrevocable Beneficiary designation. A new Beneficiary designation is not effective until we record the change.
Payment of Death Benefit
Payment of the death benefit in cash will be made within 7 days of the Death Benefit Date, except if we are permitted to defer payment in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940. If an Annuity Option is elected, the Annuity Commencement Date will be the first day of the second calendar month following the Death Benefit Date, and your Account will remain in effect until the Annuity Commencement Date.
Due Proof of Death
We accept any of the following as proof of any person's death:


o

An original certified copy of an official death certificate;


 

 


o

An original certified copy of a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction as to the finding of death; or


 

 


o

Any other proof we find satisfactory.


THE INCOME PHASE -- ANNUITY PROVISIONS
During the Income Phase, we make regular monthly annuity payments to the Annuitant.
The Income Phase of your Contract begins with the Annuity Commencement Date. On that date, we apply your Account Value, adjusted as described below, under the Annuity Option(s) you have selected, and we make the first annuity payment.
Once the Income Phase begins, no lump sum settlement option or cash withdrawals are permitted, except pursuant to Annuity Option D, Monthly Payments for a Specified Period Certain, as described below under the heading "Annuity Options," and you cannot change the Annuity Option selected. You may request a full withdrawal before the Annuity Commencement Date, which will be subject to all charges applicable on withdrawals (see "Withdrawals, Withdrawal Charge and Market Value Adjustment").
Selection of the Annuitant or Co-Annuitant
You select the Annuitant in your Application. The Annuitant is the person who receives annuity payments during the Income Phase and on whose life these payments are based. In your Contract, the Annuity Option(s) refer to the Annuitant as the "Payee." If you name someone other than yourself as Annuitant and the Annuitant dies before the Income Phase, you become the Annuitant.
In a Non-Qualified Contract, if you name someone other than yourself as Annuitant, you may also select a Co-Annuitant, who will become the new Annuitant if the original Annuitant dies before the Income Phase. If both the Annuitant and Co-Annuitant die before the Income Phase, you become the Annuitant. If you have named both an Annuitant and a Co-Annuitant, you may designate one of them to become the sole Annuitant as of the Annuity Commencement Date, if both are living at that time. If you have not made that designation on the 30th day before the Annuity Commencement Date, and both the Annuitant and the Co-Annuitant are still living, the Co-Annuitant will become the Annuitant.
When an Annuity Option has been selected as the method of paying the death benefit, the Beneficiary is the Payee of the annuity payment.

Selection of the Annuity Commencement Date
You select the Annuity Commencement Date in your Application. The following restrictions apply to the date you may select:


o

The earliest possible Annuity Commencement Date is the first day of the second month following your Contract Date.


 

 


o

The latest possible Annuity Commencement Date is the first day of the month following the Annuitant's 95th birthday. If there is a Co-Annuitant, the Annuity Commencement Date applies to the younger of the Annuitant and Co-Annuitant.


 

 


o

The Annuity Commencement Date must always be the first day of a month.


You may change the Annuity Commencement Date from time to time by sending us written notice, with the following additional limitations:


o

We must receive your notice at least 30 days before the current Annuity Commencement Date.


 

 


o

The new Annuity Commencement Date must be at least 30 days after we receive the notice.


There may be other restrictions on your selection of the Annuity Commencement Date imposed by your retirement plan or applicable law. In most situations, current law requires that for a Qualified Contract, certain minimum distributions must commence no later than April 1 following the year the Annuitant reaches age 70 1/2 (or, for Qualified Contracts other than IRAs, no later than April 1 following the year the Annuitant retires, if later than the year the Annuitant reaches age 70 1/2).
Annuity Options
We offer the following Annuity Options for payments during the Income Phase. Each Annuity Option may be selected for a Variable Annuity, a Fixed Annuity, or a combination of both. We may also agree to other settlement options, at our discretion.
     Annuity Option A -- Life Annuity
We provide monthly payments during the lifetime of the Annuitant. Annuity payments stop when the Annuitant dies. There is no provision for continuation of any payments to a Beneficiary.
     Annuity Option B -- Life Annuity with 60, 120, 180 or 240 Monthly Payments Certain
We make monthly payments during the lifetime of the Annuitant. In addition, we guarantee that the Beneficiary will receive monthly payments for the remainder of the period certain, if the Annuitant dies during that period. The election of a longer period results in smaller monthly payments. If no Beneficiary is designated, we pay the discounted value of the remaining payments in one sum to the Annuitant's estate. The Beneficiary may also elect to receive the discounted value of the remaining payments in one sum. The discount rate for a Variable Annuity will be the assumed interest rate in effect; the discount rate for a Fixed Annuity will be based on the interest rate we used to determine the amount of each payment.
     Annuity Option C -- Joint and Survivor Annuity
We make monthly payments during the lifetime of the Annuitant and another person you designate and during the lifetime of the survivor of the two. We stop making payments when the survivor dies. There is no provision for continuance of any payments to a Beneficiary.
     Annuity Option D -- Monthly Payments for a Specified Period Certain
We make monthly payments for a specified period of time from 5 to 30 years, as you elect. If payments under this option are paid on a variable annuity basis, the Annuitant may elect to receive, at any time, some or all of the discounted value of the remaining payments, less any applicable withdrawal charge; the discount rate for this purpose will be the assumed interest rate in effect. If the Annuitant dies during the period selected, the remaining income payments are made as described under Annuity Option B. The election of this Annuity Option may result in the imposition of a penalty tax. The 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9-year periods certain are not available if your Account has been issued within the past 4 years.
Selection of Annuity Option
You select one or more of the Annuity Options, which you may change from time to time during the Accumulation Phase, as long as we receive your selection or change in writing at least 30 days before the Annuity Commencement Date. If we have not received your written selection on the 30th day before the Annuity Commencement Date, you will receive Annuity Option B, for a life annuity with 120 monthly payments certain.
You may specify the proportion of your Adjusted Account Value you wish to provide a Variable Annuity or a Fixed Annuity. Under a Variable Annuity, the dollar amount of payments will vary, while under a Fixed Annuity, the dollar amount of payments will remain the same. If you do not specify a Variable Annuity or a Fixed Annuity, your Adjusted Account Value will be divided between Variable Annuities and Fixed Annuities in the same proportions as your Account Value was divided between the Variable and Fixed Accounts on the Annuity Commencement Date. You may allocate your Adjusted Account Value applied to a Variable Annuity among the Sub-Accounts, or we will use your existing allocations.
There may be additional limitations on the options you may elect under your particular retirement plan or applicable law.
Remember that the Annuity Options may not be changed once Annuity Payments begin.
Amount of Annuity Payments
     Adjusted Account Value
The Adjusted Account Value is the amount we apply to provide a Variable Annuity and/or a Fixed Annuity. We calculate Adjusted Account Value by taking your Account Value on the Business Day just before the Annuity Commencement Date and making the following adjustments:


o

We deduct a proportional amount of the Account Fee, based on the fraction of the current Account Year that has elapsed.


 

 


o

If applicable, we apply the Market Value Adjustment to your Account Value in the Fixed Account, which may result in a deduction, an addition, or no change.


 

 


o

We deduct any applicable premium tax or similar tax if not previously deducted.


     Variable Annuity Payments
On the Annuity Commencement Date, we will exchange your Account's Variable Annuity Units for annuitization units which have annual insurance charges of 1.35% of your average daily net assets (1.10% if your initial Purchase Payment was $1,000,000 or more).
Variable Annuity payments may vary each month. We determine the dollar amount of the first payment using the portion of your Adjusted Account Value applied to a Variable Annuity and the Annuity Payment Rates in your Contract, which are based on an assumed interest rate of 3% per year, compounded annually. See "Annuity Payment Rates."
To calculate the remaining payments, we convert the amount of the first payment into Annuity Units for each Sub-Account; we determine the number of those Annuity Units by dividing the portion of the first payment attributable to the Sub-Account by the Annuity Unit Value of that Sub-Account for the Valuation Period ending just before the Annuity Commencement Date. This number of Annuity Units for each Sub-Account will remain constant (unless the Annuitant requests an exchange of Annuity Units). However, the dollar amount of the next Variable Annuity payment -- which is the sum of the number of Annuity Units for each Sub-Account times its Annuity Unit Value for the Valuation Period ending just before the date of the payment -- will increase, decrease, or remain the same, depending on the net investment return of the Sub-Accounts.
If the net investment return of the Sub-Accounts selected is the same as the assumed interest rate of 3%, compounded annually, the payments will remain level. If the net investment return exceeds the assumed interest rate, payments will increase and, conversely, if it is less than the assumed interest rate, payments will decrease.
Please refer to the Statement of Additional Information for more information about calculating Variable Annuity Units and Variable Annuity payments, including examples of these calculations.
     Fixed Annuity Payments
Fixed Annuity payments are the same each month. We determine the dollar amount of each Fixed Annuity payment using the fixed portion of your Adjusted Account Value and the applicable Annuity Payment Rates. These will be either (1) the rates in your Contract, which are based on a minimum guaranteed interest rate of 2.5% per year, compounded annually, or (2) new rates we have published and are using on the Annuity Commencement Date, if they are more favorable. See "Annuity Payment Rates."
     Minimum Payments
If your Adjusted Account Value is less than $2,000, or the first annuity payment for any Annuity Option is less than $20, we will pay the Adjusted Account Value to the Annuitant in one payment.
Exchange of Variable Annuity Units
During the Income Phase, the Annuitant may exchange Annuity Units in one Sub-Account for Annuity Units in another Sub-Account, up to 12 times each Account Year. To make an exchange, the Annuitant sends us, at our Annuity Mailing Address, a written request stating the number of Annuity Units in the Sub-Account he or she wishes to exchange and the new Sub-Account for which Annuity Units are requested. The number of new Annuity Units will be calculated so the dollar amount of an annuity payment on the date of the exchange would not be affected. To calculate this number, we use Annuity Unit values for the Valuation Period during which we receive the exchange request.
Before exchanging Annuity Units in one Sub-Account for those in another, the Annuitant should carefully review the Fund prospectus(es) for the investment objectives and risk disclosure of the Funds in which the Sub-Accounts invest.
During the Income Phase, we permit only exchanges among Sub-Accounts. No exchanges to or from a Fixed Annuity are permitted.
Account Fee
During the Income Phase, we deduct the annual Account Fee of $50 in equal amounts from each Variable Annuity payment. We do not deduct the annual Account Fee from Fixed Annuity payments.
 
 
Annuity Payment Rates
The Contracts contain Annuity Payment Rates for each Annuity Option described in this Prospectus. The rates show, for each $1,000 applied, the dollar amount of (a) the first monthly Variable Annuity payment based on the assumed interest rate specified in the applicable Contract (3% per year, compounded annually), and (b) the monthly Fixed Annuity payment, when this payment is based on the minimum guaranteed interest rate specified in the Contract (at least 2.5% per year, compounded annually). We may change these rates under Group Contracts for Accounts established after the effective date of such change
(see "Other Contract Provisions -- Modification").
The Annuity Payment Rates may vary according to the Annuity Option elected and the adjusted age of the Annuitant. The Contracts also describe the method of determining the adjusted age of the Annuitant. The mortality table used in determining the Annuity Payment Rates for Annuity Options A, B and C is the Annuity 2000 Table.
Annuity Options as Method of Payment for Death Benefit
You or your Beneficiary may also select one or more Annuity Options to be used in the event of the Covered Person's death before the Income Phase, as described under the "Death Benefit" section of this Prospectus. In that case, your Beneficiary will be the Annuitant. The Annuity Commencement Date will be the first day of the second month beginning after the Death Benefit Date.
OTHER CONTRACT PROVISIONS
Exercise of Contract Rights
An Individual Contract belongs to the individual to whom the Contract is issued. A Group Contract belongs to the Owner. In the case of a Group Contract, the Owner may expressly reserve all Contract rights and privileges; otherwise, each Annuitant will be entitled to exercise such rights and privileges. In any case, such rights and privileges can be exercised without the consent of the Beneficiary (other than an irrevocably designated Beneficiary) or any other person. Such rights and privileges may be exercised only
during the lifetime of the Annuitant before the Annuity Commencement Date, except as the Contract otherwise provides.
The Annuitant becomes the Payee on and after the Annuity Commencement Date. The Beneficiary becomes the Payee on the death of the Covered Person prior to the Annuity Commencement Date, or on the death of the Annuitant after the Annuity Commencement Date. Such Payee may thereafter exercise such rights and privileges, if any, of ownership which continue.
Change of Ownership
Ownership of a Qualified Contract may not be transferred except to: (1) the Annuitant; (2) a trustee or successor trustee of a pension or profit sharing trust which is qualified under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code; (3) the employer of the Annuitant, provided that the Qualified Contract after transfer is maintained under the terms of a retirement plan qualified under Section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for the benefit of the Annuitant; (4) the trustee or custodian of an individual retirement account plan qualified under Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code for the benefit of the Participants under a Group Contract; or (5) as otherwise permitted from time to time by laws
and regulations governing the retirement or deferred compensation plans for which a Qualified Contract may be issued. Subject to the foregoing, a Qualified Contract may not be sold, assigned, transferred, discounted or pledged as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of an obligation or for any other purpose to any person other than the Company.
The Owner of a Non-Qualified Contract may change the ownership of the Contract prior to the Annuity Commencement Date; and each Participant, in like manner, may change the ownership interest in a Contract. A change of ownership will not be binding on us until we receive written notification. When we receive such notification, the change will be effective as of the date on which the request for change was signed by the Owner or Participant, as appropriate, but the change will be without prejudice to us on account of any payment we make or any action we take before receiving the change. If you change the Owner of a Non-Qualified Contract,
you will become immediately liable for the payment of taxes on any gain realized under the Contract prior to the change of ownership, including possible liability for a 10% federal excise tax.
Change of ownership may affect the availability of optional death benefit riders or the expenses incurred with the optional death benefit riders.
Voting of Fund Shares
We will vote Fund shares held by the Sub-Accounts at meetings of shareholders of the Funds or in connection with similar solicitations, but will follow voting instructions received from persons having the right to give voting instructions. During the Accumulation Phase, you will have the right to give voting instructions, in the case of a Group Contract where the Owner has reserved this right. During the Income Phase, the Payee -- that is the Annuitant or Beneficiary entitled to receive benefits -- is the person having such voting rights. We will vote any shares attributable to us and Fund shares for which no timely voting instructions are received in the same proportion as the shares for which we receive instructions from Owners, Participants and Payees, as applicable.
Owners of Qualified Contracts issued on a group basis may be subject to other voting provisions of the particular plan and of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Employees who contribute to plans that are funded by the Contracts may be entitled to instruct the Owners as to how to instruct us to vote the Fund shares attributable to their contributions. Such plans may also provide the additional extent, if any, to which the Owners shall follow voting instructions of persons with rights under the plans. If no voting instructions are received from any such person with respect to a particular Participant Account, the Owner may instruct the Company as to how to vote the number of Fund shares for which instructions
may be given.
Neither the Variable Account nor the Company is under any duty to provide information concerning the voting instruction rights of persons who may have such rights under plans, other than rights afforded by the Investment Company Act of 1940, or any duty to inquire as to the instructions received or the authority of Owners, Participants or others, as applicable, to instruct the voting of Fund shares. Except as the Variable Account or the Company has actual knowledge to the contrary, the instructions given by Owners under Group Contracts and Payees will be valid as they affect the Variable Account, the Company and any others having
voting instruction rights with respect to the Variable Account.
All Fund proxy material, together with an appropriate form to be used to give voting instructions, will be provided to each person having the right to give voting instructions at least 10 days prior to each meeting of the shareholders of the Fund. We will determine the number of Fund shares as to which each such person is entitled to give instructions as of the record date set by the Fund for such meeting, which is expected to be not more than 90 days prior to each such meeting. Prior to the Annuity Commencement Date, the number of Fund shares as to which voting instructions may be given to the Company is determined by dividing the value of all of the Variable Accumulation Units of the particular Sub-Account credited to the Participant Account by the net asset value of one Fund share as of the same date. On or after the Annuity Commencement Date, the number of Fund shares as to which
such instructions may be given by a Payee is determined by dividing the reserve held by the Company in the Sub-Account with respect to the particular Payee by the net asset value of a Fund share as of the same date. After the Annuity Commencement Date, the number of Fund shares as to which a Payee is entitled to give voting instructions will generally decrease due to the decrease in the reserve.
Periodic Reports
During the Accumulation Period we will send you, or such other person having voting rights, at least once during each Account Year, a statement showing the number, type and value of Accumulation Units credited to your Account and the Fixed Accumulation Value of your Account, which statement shall be accurate as of a date not more than 2 months previous to the date of mailing. These periodic statements contain important information concerning your transactions with respect to your Contract. It is your obligation to review each such statement carefully and to report to us, at the address or telephone number provided on the statement, any errors or discrepancies in the information presented therein within 60 days of the date of such statement. Unless we receive notice of any such error or discrepancy from you within such period, we may not be responsible for correcting the
error or discrepancy.
In addition, every person having voting rights will receive such reports or prospectuses concerning the Variable Account and the Funds as may be required by the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Securities Act of 1933. We will also send such statements reflecting transactions in your Account as may be required by applicable laws, rules and regulations.
Upon request, we will provide you with information regarding fixed and variable accumulation values.
Substitution of Securities
Shares of any or all Funds may not always be available for investment under the Contract. We may add or delete Funds or other investment companies as variable investment options under the Contract. We may also substitute for the shares held in any Sub-Account shares of another Fund or shares of another registered open-end investment company or unit investment trust, provided that the substitution has been approved, if required, by the SEC. In the event of any substitution pursuant to this provision, we may make appropriate endorsement to the Contract to reflect the substitution.
Change in Operation of Variable Account
At our election and subject to any necessary vote by persons having the right to give instructions with respect to the voting of Fund shares held by the Sub-Accounts, the Variable Account may be operated as a management company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or it may be deregistered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in the event registration is no longer required. Deregistration of the Variable Account requires an order by the SEC. In the event of any change in the operation of the Variable Account pursuant to this provision, we may make appropriate endorsement to the Contract to reflect the change and take such other action as may be necessary and appropriate to effect the change.
Splitting Units
We reserve the right to split or combine the value of Variable Accumulation Units, Annuity Units or any of them. In effecting any such change of unit values, strict equity will be preserved and no change will have a material effect on the benefits or other provisions of the Contract.
Modification
Upon notice to the Participant, in the case of an Individual Contract, and the Owner and Participant(s), in the case of a Group Contract (or the Payee(s) during the Income Phase), we may modify the Contract if such modification: (i) is necessary to make the Contract or the Variable Account comply with any law or regulation issued by a governmental agency to which the Company or the Variable Account is subject; (ii) is necessary to assure continued qualification of the Contract
under the Internal Revenue Code or other federal or state laws relating to retirement annuities or annuity contracts; (iii) is necessary to reflect a change in the operation of the Variable Account or the Sub-Account(s) (see "Change in Operation of Variable Account"); (iv) provides additional Variable Account and/or fixed accumulation options; or (v) as may otherwise be in the best interests of Owners, Participants, or Payees, as applicable. In the event of any such modification, we may make appropriate endorsement in the Contract to reflect such modification.
In addition, upon notice to the Owner, we may modify a Group Contract to change the withdrawal charges, Account Fee, mortality and expense risk charges, administrative expense charges, the tables used in determining the amount of the first monthly variable annuity and fixed annuity payments and the formula used to calculate the Market Value Adjustment, provided that such modification applies only to Participant Accounts established after the effective date of such modification. In order to exercise our modification rights in these particular instances, we must notify the Owner of such modification in writing. The notice shall specify the effective date of such modification which must be at least 60 days following the date we mail notice of modification. All of the charges and the annuity tables which are provided in the Group Contract
prior to any such modification will remain in effect permanently, unless improved by the Company, with respect to Participant Accounts established prior to the effective date of such modification.
Discontinuance of New Participants
We may limit or discontinue the acceptance of new Applications and the issuance of new Certificates under a Group Contract by giving 30 days prior written notice to the Owner. This will not affect rights or benefits with respect to any Participant Accounts established under such Group Contract prior to the effective date of such limitation or discontinuance.
Reservation of Rights
We reserve the right, to the extent permitted by law, to: (1) combine any 2 or more variable accounts; (2) add or delete Funds, sub-series thereof or other investment companies and corresponding Sub-Accounts; (3) add or remove Guarantee Periods available at any time for election by a Participant; and (4) restrict or eliminate any of the voting rights of Participants (or Owners) or other persons who have voting rights as to the Variable Account. Where required by law, we will obtain approval of changes from Participants or any appropriate regulatory authority. In the event of any change pursuant to this provision, we may make appropriate endorsement to the Contract to reflect the change.
Right to Return
If you are not satisfied with your Contract, you may return it by mailing or delivering it to us at our Annuity Mailing Address, as shown on the cover of this Prospectus, within 10 days after it was delivered to you. When we receive the returned Contract, it will be cancelled and we will refund to you your Account Value.
If applicable state law requires, we will return the full amount of any Purchase Payment(s) we received. State law may also require us to give you a longer "free look" period or allow you to return the Contract to your sales representative.
If you are establishing an Individual Retirement Account ("IRA"), the Internal Revenue Code requires that we give you a disclosure statement containing certain information about the Contract and applicable legal requirements. We must give you this statement on or before the date the IRA is established. If we give you the disclosure statement before the seventh day preceding the date the IRA is established, you will not have any right of revocation under the Code. If we give you the disclosure statement at a later date, then you may give us a notice of revocation at any time within 7 days after your Contract Date. Upon such revocation, we will refund your Purchase Payment(s). This right of revocation with respect to an IRA is in addition to the return privilege set forth in the preceding
paragraph. We allow a Participant establishing an IRA a "ten day free-look," notwithstanding the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
TAX CONSIDERATIONS
This section provides general information on the federal income tax consequences of ownership of a Contract based upon our understanding of current federal tax laws. Actual federal tax consequences will vary depending on, among other things, the type of retirement plan under which your Contract is issued. Also, legislation altering the current tax treatment of annuity contracts could be enacted in the future and could apply retroactively to Contracts that were purchased before the date of enactment. We make no attempt to consider any applicable federal estate, federal gift, state, or other tax laws. We
also make no guarantee regarding the federal, state, or local tax status of any Contract or any transaction involving any Contract. You should consult a qualified tax professional for advice before purchasing a Contract or executing any other transaction (such as a rollover, distribution, withdrawal or payment) involving a Contract.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
The following discussion applies only to those Contracts issued in the United States. For a discussion of tax considerations effecting Contracts issued in Puerto Rico, see "Puerto Rico Tax Considerations," below.
     Deductibility of Purchase Payments
For federal income tax purposes, Purchase Payments made under Non-Qualified Contracts are not deductible. Under certain circumstances, Purchase Payments made under Qualified Contracts may be excludible or deductible from taxable income. Any such amounts will also be excluded from the "investment in the contract" for purposes of determining the taxable portion of any distributions from a Qualified Contract.
     Pre-Distribution Taxation of Contracts
Generally, an increase in the value of a Contract will not give rise to a current income tax liability to the Owner of a Contract or to any payee under the Contract until a distribution is received from the Contract. However, certain assignments or pledges of a Contract or loans under a Contract will be treated as distributions to the Owner of the Contract
and will accelerate the taxability of any increases in the value of a Contract.
Also, corporate (or other non-natural person) Owners of a Non-Qualified Contract will generally incur a current tax liability on Account Value increases. There are certain exceptions to this current taxation rule, including: (i) any Contract that is an "immediate annuity", which the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") defines as a single premium contract with an annuity commencement date within one year of the date of purchase which provides for a series of substantially equal periodic payments (to be made not less frequently than annually) during the annuity period, and (ii) any Contract that
the non-natural person holds as agent for a natural person (such as where a bank or other entity holds a Contract as trustee under a trust agreement).
You should note that a qualified retirement plan generally provides tax deferral regardless of whether the plan invests in an annuity contract. For that reason, no decision to purchase a Qualified Contract should be based on the assumption that the purchase of a Qualified Contract is necessary to obtain tax deferral under a qualified plan.
 
     Distributions and Withdrawals from Non-Qualified Contracts
The Account Value of a Non-Qualified Contract will generally include both (i) an amount attributable to Purchase Payments, the return of which will not be taxable, and (ii) an amount attributable to investment earnings, the receipt of which will be taxable at ordinary income rates. The relative portions of any particular distribution that derive from nontaxable Purchase Payments and taxable investment earnings depend upon the nature and the timing of that distribution.
Any withdrawal of less than your entire Account Value under a Non-Qualified Contract before the Annuity Commencement Date, you must be treated as a receipt of investment earnings. You may not treat such withdrawals as a non-taxable return of Purchase Payments unless you have first withdrawn the entire amount of the Account Value that is attributable to investment earnings. For purposes of determining whether an Owner has withdrawn the entire amount of the investment earnings under a Non-Qualified Contract, the Code provides that all Non-Qualified deferred annuity contracts issued by the same company to the same Owner during
any one calendar year must be treated as one annuity contract.
A Payee who receives annuity payments under a Non-Qualified Contract after the Annuity Commencement Date will generally be able to treat a portion of each payment as a nontaxable return of Purchase Payments and to treat only the remainder of each such payment as taxable investment earnings. Until the Purchase Payments have been fully recovered in this manner, the nontaxable portion of each payment will be determined by the ratio of (i) the total amount of the Purchase Payments be made under the Contract, to (ii) the Payee's expected return under the Contract. Once the Payee has received nontaxable payments in an amount equal to total Purchase Payments, no further
exclusion is allowed and all future distributions will constitute fully taxable ordinary income. If payments are terminated upon the death of the Annuitant or other Payee before the Purchase Payments have been fully recovered, the unrecovered Purchase Payments may be deducted on the final return of the Annuitant or other Payee.
A penalty tax of 10% may also apply to taxable cash withdrawals, including lump-sum payments from Non-Qualified Contracts. This penalty will not apply to distributions made after age 59 1/2, to distributions pursuant to the death or disability of the owner, or to distributions that are a part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made annually under a lifetime annuity, or to distributions under an immediate annuity (as defined above).
Death benefits paid upon the death of a Contract Owner are not life insurance benefits and will generally be includable in the income of the recipient to the extent they represent investment earnings under the contract. For this purpose, the amount of the "investment in the contract" is not affected by the Owner's or Annuitant's death, i.e., the investment in the Contract must still be determined by reference to the total Purchase Payments, less (excluding amounts that were deductible by, or excluded from the gross income of, the Owner of a Contract),
any Purchase Payments that were amounts previously received which were not includable in income. Special mandatory distribution rules also apply after the death of the Owner when the beneficiary is not the surviving spouse of the Owner.

If death benefits are distributed in a lump sum, the taxable amount of those benefits will be determined in the same manner as upon a full surrender of the contract. If death benefits are distributed under an annuity option, the taxable amount of those benefits will be determined in the same manner as annuity payments, as described above.
     Distributions and Withdrawals from Qualified Contracts
In most cases, all of the distributions you receive from a Qualified Contract will constitute fully taxable ordinary income. Also, a 10% penalty tax will apply to distributions prior to age 59 1/2, except in certain circumstances.

If you receive an eligible rollover distribution from a Qualified Contract (other than from a Contract issued for use with an individual retirement account) and roll over some or all of that distribution to another eligible plan, the portion of such distribution that is rolled over will not be includible in your income. However, any eligible rollover distribution is will be subject to 20% mandatory withholding as described below. Because the amount of the cash paid to you as an eligible rollover distribution will be reduced by this withholding, you will not be able to roll over the entire account balance under your Contract, unless you use other funds equal
to the tax withholding to complete the rollover.
An "eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution to you of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of your account, other than:


o

A distribution which is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made annually under a lifetime annuity or for a specified period of ten years or more;


 

 


o

Any required minimum distribution, or


 

 


o

Any hardship distribution.


Only you or your spouse may elect to roll over a distribution to an eligible retirement plan.
     Withholding
In the case of an eligible rollover distribution (as defined above) from a Qualified Contract (other than from a Contract issued for use with an individual retirement account), we (or the plan administrator) must withhold and remit to the U.S. Government 20% of the distribution, unless the Participant or Payee elects to make a direct rollover of the distribution to another qualified retirement plan that is eligible to receive the rollover; however, only you or your spouse may elect a direct rollover. In the case of a distribution from (i) a Non-Qualified Contract, (ii) a Qualified Contract issued for
use with an individual retirement account, or (iii) a Qualified Contract where the distribution is not an eligible rollover distribution, we will withhold and remit to the U.S. Government a part of the taxable portion of each distribution unless, prior to the distribution, the Participant or Payee provides us his or her taxpayer identification number and instructs us (in the manner prescribed) not to withhold. The Participant or Payee may credit against his or her federal income tax liability for the year of distribution any amounts that we (or the plan administrator) withhold.
     Investment Diversification and Control
The Treasury Department has issued regulations that prescribe investment diversification requirements for mutual fund series underlying nonqualified variable contracts. All Non-Qualified Contracts must comply with these regulations to qualify as annuities for federal income tax purposes. The owner of a Non-Qualified Contract that does not meet these guidelines will be subject to current taxation on annual increases in value of the Contract. We believe that each Fund available as an investment option under the Contract
complies with these regulations.
The preamble to the 1986 investment diversification regulations stated that the Internal Revenue Service may promulgate guidelines under which an owner's excessive control over investments underlying the contract will preclude the contract from qualifying as an annuity for federal tax purposes. We cannot predict whether such guidelines, if and when they may be promulgated, will be retroactive. We reserve the right to modify the Contract and/or the Variable Account to the extent necessary to comply with any such guidelines, but cannot assure that such modifications would satisfy any retroactive guidelines.
     Tax Treatment of the Company and the Variable Account
As a life insurance company under the Code, we will record and report operations of the Variable Account separately from other operations. The Variable Account will not, however, constitute a regulated investment company or any other type of taxable entity distinct from our other operations. Under present law, we will not incur tax on the income of the Variable Account (consisting primarily of interest, dividends, and net capital gains) if we use this income to increase reserves under Contracts participating in the Variable Account.
     Qualified Retirement Plans
You may use Qualified Contracts with several types of qualified retirement plans. Because tax consequences will vary with the type of qualified retirement plan and the plan's specific terms and conditions, we provide below only brief, general descriptions of the consequences that follow from using Qualified Contracts in connection with various types of qualified retirement plans. We stress that the rights of any person to any benefits under these plans may be subject to the terms and conditions of the plans themselves, regardless of the terms of the Qualified Contracts that you are using. These terms and conditions may include restrictions on, among other things, ownership, transferability,
assignability, contributions and distributions.
     Pension and Profit-Sharing Plans
Sections 401(a), 401(k) and 403(a) of the Code permit business employers and certain associations to establish various types of retirement plans for employees. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 eliminated most differences between qualified retirement plans of corporations and those of self-employed individuals. Self-employed persons, as a general rule, may therefore use Qualified Contracts as a funding vehicle for their retirement plans.
     Tax-Sheltered Annuities
Section 403(b) of the Code permits public school employees and employees of certain types of charitable, educational and scientific organizations specified in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code to purchase annuity contracts and, subject to certain limitations, exclude the amount of purchase payments from gross income for tax purposes. The Code imposes restrictions on cash withdrawals from Section 403(b) annuities.
If the Contracts are to receive tax-deferred treatment, cash withdrawals of amounts attributable to salary reduction contributions (other than withdrawals of accumulation account value as of December 31, 1988) may be made only when the Participant attains age 59 1/2, separates from service with the employer, dies or becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section 72(m)(7) of the Code). These restrictions apply to (i) any post-1988 salary reduction contributions, (ii) any growth or interest on post-1988 salary reduction contributions, (iii) any growth or interest on pre-1989 salary reduction contributions that occurs on or after January 1, 1989, and (iv) any pre-1989 salary reduction contributions since we do not maintain records that separately account for such contributions. It is permissible, however, to withdraw post-1988 salary reduction contributions (but not the earnings
attributable to such contributions) in cases of financial hardship. While the Internal Revenue Service has not issued specific rules defining financial hardship, we expect that to qualify for a hardship distribution, the Participant must have an immediate and heavy bona fide financial need and lack other resources reasonably available to satisfy the need. Hardship withdrawals (as well as certain other premature withdrawals) will be subject to a 10% tax penalty, in addition to any withdrawal charge applicable under the Contracts. Under certain circumstances the 10% tax penalty will not apply if the withdrawal is for medical expenses.
Section 403(b) annuities, like IRAs, are subject to required minimum distributions under the Code. Section 403(b) annuities are unique, however, in that any account balance accruing before January 1, 1987 (the "pre-1987 balance") needs to comply with only the minimum distribution incidental benefit (MDIB) rule and not also with the minimum distribution rules set forth in Section 401(a)(9) of the Code. This special treatment for any pre-1987 balance is, however, conditioned upon the issuer identifying the pre-1987 balance and maintaining accurate records of changes to the balance. Since we do not maintain such records, your pre-1987 balance, if any, will not be eligible for special distribution treatment.
Under the terms of a particular Section 403(b) plan, the Participant may be entitled to transfer all or a portion of the Account Value to one or more alternative funding options. Participants should consult the documents governing their plan and the person who administers the plan for information as to such investment alternatives.
     Individual Retirement Accounts
Sections 219 and 408 of the Code permit eligible individuals to contribute to an individual retirement program, including Simplified Employee Pension Plans, Employer/Association of Employees Established Individual Retirement Account Trusts, and Simple Retirement Accounts. Such IRAs are subject to limitations on contribution levels, the persons who may be eligible, and on the time when distributions may commence. In addition, certain distributions from some other types of retirement plans may be placed in an IRA on a tax-deferred basis. If we sell Contracts for use with IRAs, the Internal Revenue Service or other agency may impose supplementary information requirements. We will provide purchasers of the Contracts for such purposes with any necessary information. You will have the
right to revoke the Contract under certain circumstances, as described in the section of this Prospectus entitled "Right to Return."
     Roth IRAs
Section 408A of the Code permits an individual to contribute to an individual retirement program called a Roth IRA. Unlike contributions to a traditional IRA under Section 408 of the Code, contributions to a Roth IRA are not tax-deductible. Provided certain conditions are satisfied, distributions are generally tax-free. Like traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs are subject to limitations on contribution amounts and the timing of distributions. If an individual converts a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA the full amount of the IRA is included in taxable income. The Internal Revenue Service and other agencies may impose special information requirements with respect to Roth IRAs. We will provide the necessary information for Contracts issued in connection with Roth IRAs.
     Status of Optional Death Benefit Riders
Under the Code, IRAs may not invest in life insurance policies. Regulations issued by the Treasury Department provide that death benefits under IRAs do not violate this rule, provided that the death benefit is no more than the greater of the total premiums paid (net of prior withdrawals) or the cash value of the IRA.
In certain circumstances, the death benefit payable under the Contract's Optional Death Benefit Riders may exceed both the total premiums paid (net of prior withdrawals) and the cash value of the Contract. We have filed the Contract and the EEB Plus, EEB Plus MAV, and EEB Plus 5% Roll-Up Optional Death Benefit Riders ("New Riders") with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") requesting a ruling approving the use of the Contract with the New Riders as an IRA. We have already received a favorable determination letter with respect to the following Optional Death Benefit Riders: EEB; MAV; 5% Roll-Up;
EEB and MAV; EEB and 5% Roll-Up; MAV and 5% Roll-Up; and EEB and MAV and 5% Roll-Up ("Old Riders").
Although we regard the New Riders as an investment protection feature that should not result in adverse tax treatment, we give no assurance that the IRS will approve the use of the Contract with the New Riders in IRAs. Denial of our request by the IRS could result in taxation of the entire balance of your IRA and penalty taxes. You should consult a qualified tax adviser before adding any of the New Riders to your Contract if it is an IRA.
Puerto Rico Tax Considerations
The Contract offered by this Prospectus is considered an annuity contract under Section 1022 of the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 1994, as amended (the "1994 Code"). Under the current provisions of the 1994 Code, no income tax is payable on increases in value of accumulation shares of annuity units credited to a variable annuity contract until payments are made to the annuitant or other payee under such contract.
When payments are made from your Contract in the form of an annuity, the annuitant or other payee will be required to include as gross income the lesser of the amount received during the taxable year or the portion of the amount received equal to 3% of the aggregate premiums or other consideration paid for the annuity. The amount, if any, in excess of the included amount is excluded from gross income as a return of premium. After an amount equal to the aggregate premiums or other consideration paid for the annuity has been excluded from gross income, all of the subsequent annuity payments are considered to be taxable income.
When payments are made from your Contract in the form of an annuity, the annuitant or other payee will be required to include as gross income the lesser of the amounts received during the taxable year or the portion of each payment equal to 3% of the aggregate premiums or other consideration paid for the annuity. The amount, if any, in excess of the included amount is excluded from gross income. After an amount equal to the aggregate amount excluded from gross income has been received, all of the annuity payments are considered to be taxable income.
When a payment under a Contract is made in a lump sum, the amount of the payment would be included in the gross income of the Annuitant or other Payee to the extent it exceeds the Annuitant's aggregate premiums or other consideration paid.
The provisions of the 1994 Code with respect to qualified retirement plans described in this Prospectus vary significantly from those under the Internal Revenue Code. Although we currently offer the Contract in Puerto Rico in connection with qualified retirement plans, the text of this Prospectus under the heading "Federal Tax Status" dealing with such qualified retirement plans is inapplicable to Puerto Rico and should be disregarded.
For information regarding the income tax consequences of owning a Contract, you should consult a qualified tax adviser.
ADMINISTRATION OF THE CONTRACT
We perform certain administrative functions relating to the Contract, Participant Accounts, and the Variable Account. These functions include, but are not limited to, maintaining the books and records of the Variable Account and the Sub-Accounts; maintaining records of the name, address, taxpayer identification number, Contract number, Participant Account number and type, the status of each Participant Account and other pertinent information necessary to the administration and operation of the Contract; processing Applications, Purchase Payments, transfers and full and partial withdrawals; issuing Contracts
and Certificates; administering annuity payments; furnishing accounting and valuation services; reconciling and depositing cash receipts; providing confirmations; providing toll-free customer service lines; and furnishing telephonic transfer services.
DISTRIBUTION OF THE CONTRACT
We offer the Contract on a continuous basis. Contracts are sold by licensed insurance agents in those states where the Contract may be lawfully sold. Such agents will be registered representatives of broker-dealers registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 who are members of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and who have entered into distribution agreements with the Company and the general distributor, Clarendon Insurance Agency, Inc. ("Clarendon"), One Sun Life Executive Park, Wellesley
Hills, Massachusetts 02481. Clarendon, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
Commissions and other distribution compensation will be paid by the Company to the selling agents and will not be more than 5.50% of Purchase Payments. In addition, after the first Account Year, broker-dealers who have entered into distribution agreements with the Company may receive an annual renewal commission of no more than 1.00% of the Participant's Account Value. In addition to commissions, the Company may, from time to time, pay or allow additional promotional incentives, in the form of cash or other compensation. We reserve the right to offer these additional incentives only to certain broker-dealers that sell or are expected to sell during specified time periods certain minimum amounts of Contracts
or Certificates or other contracts offered by the Company. Promotional incentives may change at any time. Commissions may be waived or reduced in connection with certain transactions described in this Prospectus under the heading "Waivers; Reduced Charges; Credits; Special Guaranteed Interest Rates." During 2000 and 2001, approximately $6,168 and $522,481, respectively in commissions were paid to and retained by Clarendon in connection with the distribution of the Contracts.
PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
From time to time the Variable Account may publish reports to shareholders, sales literature and advertisements containing performance information relating to the Sub-Accounts. This information may include standardized and non-standardized "Average Annual Total Return," "Cumulative Growth Rate" and "Compound Growth Rate." We may also advertise "yield" and "effective yield" for some variable options.
Average Annual Total Return measures the net income of the Sub-Account and any realized or unrealized gains or losses of the Fund in which it invests, over the period stated. Average Annual Total Return figures are annualized and represent the average annual percentage change in the value of an investment in a Sub-Account over that period. Standardized Average Annual Total Return information covers the period after the Variable Account was established or, if shorter, the life of the Series. Non-standardized Average Annual Total Return covers the life of each Fund, which may predate the Variable Account. Cumulative Growth Rate represents the cumulative change in the value of an investment in the Sub-Account for the period stated, and is arrived at by calculating the change in the Accumulation Unit Value of a Sub-Account between the first and the last day of the period being measured. The difference is expressed as a percentage of the Accumulation Unit Value at the
beginning of the base period. "Compound Growth Rate" is an annualized measure, calculated by applying a formula that determines the level of return which, if earned over the entire period, would produce the cumulative return.
Average Annual Total Return figures assume an initial purchase payment of $1,000 and reflect all applicable withdrawal and Contract charges. The Cumulative Growth Rate and Compound Growth Rate figures that we advertise do not reflect withdrawal charges or the Account Fee, although such figures do reflect all recurring charges. Results calculated without withdrawal and/or certain Contract charges will be higher. We may also use other types of rates of return that do not reflect withdrawal and Contract charges.
The performance figures used by the Variable Account are based on the actual historical performance of the underlying Funds for the specified periods, and the figures are not intended to indicate future performance. For periods before the date the Contracts became available, we calculate the performance information for the Sub-Account on a hypothetical basis. To do this, we reflect deductions of the current Contract fees and charges from the historical performance of the corresponding Funds.
Yield is a measure of the net dividend and interest income earned over a specific one month or 30-day period (7-day period for the available Money Market Sub-Account), expressed as a percentage of the value of the Sub-Account's Accumulation Units. Yield is an annualized figure, which means that we assume that the Sub-Account generates the same level of net income over a one-year period and compound that income on a semi-annual basis. We calculate the effective yield for the Money Market Sub-Account similarly, but include the increase due to assumed compounding. The Money Market Sub-Account's effective yield will be slightly higher than its yield as a result of its compounding effect.
The Variable Account may also from time to time compare its investment performance to various unmanaged indices or other variable annuities and may refer to certain rating and other organizations in its marketing materials. More information on performance and our computations is set forth in the Statement of Additional Information.
The Company may also advertise the ratings and other information assigned to it by independent industry ratings organizations. Some of these organizations are A.M. Best, Moody's Investor's Service, Standard and Poor's Insurance Rating Services, and Fitch. Each year A.M. Best reviews the financial status of thousands of insurers, culminating in the assignment of Best's rating. These ratings reflect A.M. Best's current opinion of the relevant financial strength and operating performance of an insurance company in comparison to the norms of the life/health industry. Best's ratings range from A++ to F. Standard and Poor's and Fitch's ratings measure the ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under insurance policies it issues. These two ratings do not measure the insurance company's ability to meet non-policy obligations. Ratings in general do not relate to the performance
of the Sub-Accounts.
We may also advertise endorsements from organizations, individuals or other parties that recommend the Company or the Contracts. We may occasionally include in advertisements (1) comparisons of currently taxable and tax deferred investment programs, based on selected tax brackets; or (2) discussions of alternative investment vehicles and general economic conditions.

INCORPORATION OF CERTAIN DOCUMENTS BY REFERENCE
The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001 filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 (a) or 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is incorporated herein by reference. All documents or reports we file pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, after the date of this prospectus and prior to the termination of the offering, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into the prospectus.
The Company will furnish, without charge, to each person to whom a copy of this Prospectus is delivered, upon the written or oral request of such person, a copy of the documents referred to above which have been incorporated by reference into this Prospectus, other than exhibits to such documents (unless such exhibits are specifically incorporated by reference in this Prospectus). Requests for such documents should be directed to the Secretary, Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.), One Sun Life Executive Park, Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts 02481,
telephone (800) 225-3950.
STATE REGULATION
The Company is subject to the laws of the State of Delaware governing life insurance companies and to regulation by the Commissioner of Insurance of Delaware. An annual statement is filed with the Commissioner of Insurance on or before March lst in each year relating to the operations of the Company for the preceding year and its financial condition on December 31st of such year. Its books and records are subject to review or examination by the Commissioner or his agents at any time and a full examination of its operations is conducted at periodic intervals.
The Company is also subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the other states and jurisdictions in which it is licensed to operate. The laws of the various jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers with respect to licensing to transact business, overseeing trade practices, licensing agents, approving policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum rates for accumulation of surrender values, prescribing the form and content of required financial statements and regulating the type and amounts of investments permitted. Each insurance company is required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies in each of the fire jurisdictions in which it does business and its operations and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at regular intervals.
In addition, many states regulate affiliated groups of insurers, such as the Company, Sun Life (Canada) and its affiliates, under insurance holding company legislation. Under such laws, inter-company transfers of assets and dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries may be subject to prior notice or approval, depending on the size of such transfers and payments in relation to the financial positions of the companies involved. Under insurance guaranty fund laws in most states, insurers doing business therein can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for policyholder losses incurred by insolvent companies. The amount of any future assessments of the Company under these laws cannot be reasonably estimated. However,
most of these laws do provide that an assessment may be excused or deferred if it would threaten an insurer's own financial strength and many permit the deduction of all or a portion of any such assessment from any future premium or similar taxes payable.
Although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the business of insurance, federal initiatives often have an impact on the business in a variety of ways. Current and proposed federal measures which may significantly affect the insurance business include employee benefit regulation, removal of barriers preventing banks from engaging in the insurance business, tax law changes affecting the taxation of insurance companies, the tax treatment of insurance products and its impact on the relative desirability of various personal investment vehicles.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
There are no pending legal proceedings affecting the Variable Account. We and our subsidiaries are engaged in various kinds of routine litigation which, in management's judgment, is not of material importance to our respective total assets or material with respect to the Variable Account.

APPENDIX B
WITHDRAWALS, WITHDRAWAL CHARGES AND THE MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENT
PART 1: VARIABLE ACCOUNT (THE MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT) WITHDRAWAL CHARGE CALCULATION: FULL WITHDRAWAL:
Assume a Purchase Payment of $40,000 is made on the Contract Date, no additional Purchase Payments are made and there are no partial withdrawals. The table below presents three examples of the withdrawal charge resulting from a full withdrawal of your Account, based on hypothetical Account Values.

(a)

The free withdrawal amount in any year is equal to 10% of all of the Purchase Payments you have made. In Account Year 1, the free withdrawal amount is $4,000, which equals 10% of the Purchase Payment of $40,000. On a full withdrawal of $41,000, the amount subject to a withdrawal charge is $37,000, which equals the Account Value of $41,000 minus the free withdrawal amount of $4,000.


 

 


(b)

In Account Year 3, the free withdrawal amount is $4,000, which equals 10% of the Purchase Payment of $40,000. The Account Value minus the free withdrawal amount is $47,700 minus $4,000, which equals $43,700; however, the amount subject to a withdrawal charge is capped at the amount of your unliquidated Purchase Payments. Therefore, the amount subject to a withdrawal charge is $40,000, which is the amount of your unliquidated Purchase Payments.


 

 


(c)

In Account Year 5, you have passed your fourth Account Anniversary, so no withdrawal charges apply to any withdrawals you make.


PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL
Assume a single Purchase Payment of $40,000 is made on the Contract Date, no additional Purchase Payments are made, no partial withdrawals have been taken prior to the fourth Account Year, and there is a series of 4 partial withdrawals made during the fourth Account Year of $3,000, $8,000, $12,000, and $22,000.

(a) 

In Account Year 4, the free withdrawal amount is $4,000, which equals 10% of the Purchase Payment of $40,000. The partial withdrawal amount of $3,000 is less than the free withdrawal amount, so there is no withdrawal charge.


 

 


(b) 

Since a partial withdrawal of $3,000 was taken, the remaining free withdrawal amount in Account Year 4 is $4,000 - $3,000 = $1,000. Therefore, $1,000 of the $8,000 withdrawal is not subject to a withdrawal charge, and $7,000 is subject to a withdrawal charge. Of the $11,000 withdrawn to date, $4,000 has been from the free withdrawal amount and $7,000 has been from Purchase Payments. Therefore, the amount of unliquidated Purchase Payments is $33,000.


 

 


(c) 

Since $4,000 of the two prior Account Year 4 partial withdrawals was taken from the free withdrawal amount, the remaining free withdrawal amount in Account year 4 is $4,000 - $4,000 = $0. Therefore, the entire $12,000 withdrawal is subject to a withdrawal charge. Of the $23,000 withdrawn to date, $4,000 has been from the free withdrawal amount and $19,000 has been from Purchase Payments. Therefore, the amount of unliquidated Purchase Payments is $21,000.


 

 


(d) 

Since $4,000 of the three prior Account Year 4 partial withdrawals was taken from the free withdrawal amount, the remaining free withdrawal amount in Account Year 4 is $4,000 - $4,000 = $0. The amount of unliquidated Purchase Payments remaining before this withdrawal is $21,000. Therefore, $21,000 of the $22,000 withdrawal is taken from Purchase Payments and is subject to a withdrawal charge, and $1,000 of the withdrawal is taken from earnings and is not subject to a withdrawal charge. Of the $45,000 withdrawn to date, $4,000 has been from the free withdrawal amount, $40,000 has been from Purchase Payments, and $1,000 has been from earnings. The amount of unliquidated Purchase Payments is now equal to $0. Note that if the $3,000 remaining balance was withdrawn, it would all be from earnings and not subject to a withdrawal charge. The total Account Year 4 withdrawal charges would then be $2,000, which is the same amount that was assessed for a full liquidation
in Account Year 4 in the example on the previous page.


PART 2 -- FIXED ACCOUNT -- EXAMPLES OF THE MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENT ("MVA")
     The MVA Factor is:
[(1 + I) / (1 + J + b)] ^ (N/12) -1
     These examples assume the following:


(1)

The Guarantee Amount was allocated to a 5-year Guarantee Period with a Guaranteed Interest Rate of 6% or .06.


 

 


(2)

The date of surrender is 2 years from the Expiration Date (N = 24).


 

 


(3)

The value of the Guarantee Amount on the date of surrender is $11,910.16.


 

 


(4)

The interest earned in the current Account Year is $674.16.


 

 


(5)

No transfers or partial withdrawals affecting this Guarantee Amount have been made.


 

 


(6)

Withdrawal charges, if any, are calculated in the same manner as shown in the examples in Part 1.


EXAMPLE OF A NEGATIVE MVA:
Assume that on the date of surrender, the current rate (J) is 8% or .08 and the b factor is zero.


The MVA factor =

[(1 + I) / (1 + J + b)] ^ (N/12) -1


=

[(1 + .06) / (1 + .08)] ^ (24/12) - 1


=

(.981^ 2) -1


=

.963 -1


=

-.037


The value of the Guarantee Amount less interest credited to the Guarantee Amount in the current Account Year is multiplied by the MVA factor to determine the MVA:
($11,910.16 - $674.16) X (-.037) = -$415.73
-$415.73 represents the MVA that will be deducted from the value of the Guarantee Amount before the deduction of any withdrawal charge.
For a partial withdrawal of $2,000 from this Guarantee Amount, the MVA would be ($2,000.00 - $674.16) X (-.037) = -$49.06. -$49.06 represents the MVA that will be deducted from the partial withdrawal amount before the deduction of any withdrawal charge.
EXAMPLE OF A POSITIVE MVA:
Assume that on the date of surrender, the current rate (J) is 5% or .05 and the b factor is zero.


The MVA factor =

[(1 + I) / (1 + J + b)] ^ (N/12) -1


=

[(1 + .06) / (1 + .05)] ^ (24/12) - 1


=

(1.010^ 2) -1


=

1.019 -1


=

.019


The value of the Guarantee Amount less interested credit to the Guarantee Amount in the current Account Year is multiplied by the MVA factor to determine the MVA:
($11,910.16 - $674.16) X .019 = $213.48
$213.48 represents the MVA that would be added to the value of the
Guarantee Amount before the deduction of any withdrawal charge.
For a partial withdrawal of $2,000 from this Guarantee Amount, the MVA would be ($2,000.00 - $674.16) X .019 = $25.19.
$25.19 represents the MVA that would be added to the value of the partial withdrawal amount before the deduction of any withdrawal charge.
 
 
APPENDIX C
CALCULATION OF BASIC DEATH BENEFIT
EXAMPLE 1:
Assume a Purchase Payment of $60,000.00 is made on the Contract Date and an additional Purchase Payment of $40,000.00 is made one year later. Assume that all of the money is invested in the Sub-Accounts, that no Withdrawals are made and that the Account Value on the Death Benefit Date is $80,000.00. The calculation of the Death Benefit to be paid is as follows:


The Basic Death Benefit is the greatest of:

 

 


    Account Value 

=

$ 80,000.00


    Cash Surrender Value* 

=

$ 76,500.00


    Purchase Payments 

=

$100,000.00


The Basic Death Benefit would therefore be: 

 

$100,000.00



EXAMPLE 2:
Assume a Purchase Payment of $60,000.00 is made on the Contract Date and an additional Purchase Payment of $40,000.00 is made one year later. Assume that all of the money is invested in the Sub-Accounts and that the Account Value is $80,000.00 just prior to a $20,000.00 withdrawal. The Account Value on the Death Benefit Date is $60,000.00.


The Basic Death Benefit is the greatest of:

 

 


    Account Value 

=

$ 60,000.00


    Cash Surrender Value* 

=

$ 57,000.00


    Adjusted Purchase Payments** 

=

$ 75,000.00


The Basic Death Benefit would therefore be:

 

$ 75,000.00



*Cash Surrender Value is the amount we would pay you if you surrendered your entire Account Value. For a description of how Cash Surrender Value is calculated, see "Full Withdrawals" under the subheading "Cash Withdrawals."
**Adjusted Purchase Payments can be calculated as follows:
Payments X (Account Value after withdrawal divided by Account Value before withdrawal) $100,000.00 X ($60,000.00 divided by $80,000.00)
 
 
APPENDIX D
CALCULATION OF EARNINGS ENHANCEMENT OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT
EXAMPLE 1:
Assume a Purchase Payment of $60,000 is made on the Contract Date, and an additional Purchase Payment of $40,000 is made one year later. Assume that all of the money is invested into the Sub-Accounts, no withdrawals are made and the Account Value on the Death Benefit Date is $150,000. In addition, this Contract was issued prior to the owner's 70th birthday. Assume death occurs in Account Year 7. The calculation of the Death Benefit to be paid is as follows:


The Death Benefit Amount will be the greatest of:

 

 


    Account Value

=

$135,000


    Cash Surrender Value*

=

$135,000


    Total of Adjusted Purchase Payments

=

$100,000

    Account Value minus Adjusted Purchase Payments

=

$ 35,000


    40% of the above amount

=

$ 14,000


    Cap of 40% of Adjusted Purchase Payments

=

$ 40,000


The lesser of the above two amounts = the EEB amount

=

$ 14,000



The total Death Benefit would be the amount paid on the Basic Death Benefit plus the EEB amount = $135,000 + $14,000 = $149,000.
EXAMPLE 2:
Assume a Purchase Payment of $60,000 is made on the Contract Date, and an additional Purchase Payment of $40,000 is made one year later. Assume that all of the money is invested into the Sub-Accounts and that the Account Value is $135,000 just prior to a $20,000 withdrawal. The Account Value on the Death Benefit Date is $115,000. In addition, this Contract was issued prior to the owner's 70th birthday.


The Death Benefit Amount will be the greatest of:

 

 


    Account Value

=

$ 11,926


    Cap of 40% of Adjusted Purchase Payments

=

$ 34,074


The lesser of the above two amounts = the EEB amount

=

$ 11,926



The total Death Benefit would be the amount paid on the Basic Death Benefit plus the EEB amount = $115,000 + $11,926 = $126,926.
*Cash Surrender Value is the amount we would pay you if you surrendered your entire Account Value. For a description of how Cash Surrender Value is calculated, see "Full Withdrawals" under the subheading "Cash Withdrawals."
** Adjusted Purchase Payments can be calculated as follows:
Payments x (Account Value after withdrawal/Account Value before withdrawal) = $100,000 x ($115,000 divided by $135,000) = $85,185
 
 
APPENDIX E
CALCULATION OF DEATH BENEFIT WHEN EEB AND MAV AND 5% ROLL-UP RIDERS ARE SELECTED
Assume a Purchase Payment of $60,000 is made on the Contract Date, and an additional Purchase Payment of $40,000 is made one year later. Assume that all of the money is invested in Variable Accounts. No withdrawals are made. The Account Value at the Death Benefit Date is $135,000, the value of the Purchase Payments accumulated at 5% until the Death Benefit Date is $140,000, and the Maximum Anniversary Value is $142,000. Assume death occurs in Account Year 7. The calculation of the death benefit to be paid is as follows:

APPENDIX J
INVESTMENT OPTIONS AND EXPENSES FOR INITIAL CLASS SHARES MFS/SUN LIFE SERIES TRUST FUNDS
 
The MFS/Sun Life Series Trust Fund options shown in this prospectus are the "Service Class" shares of the Trust. The Service Class was first offered for sale on August 27, 2001. All Contracts purchased on or after that date are invested in the Service Class.

Each MFS/Sun Life Series Trust Fund also has an "Initial Class" of shares. All Contracts purchased before August 27, 2001, are invested in the "Initial Class." The following Initial Class Funds are available to owners of such Contracts:


     Capital Appreciation Series


     Emerging Growth Series


     Government Securities Series


     High Yield Series


     Massachusetts Investors Growth Stock Series


     Massachusetts Investors Trust Series


     New Discovery Series


     Total Return Series


     Utilities Series


 
The shares of the Initial Class have the same investment objectives, policies, and strategies as the shares of the Service Class. The only differences between the two classes are their expense ratios. The UNDERLYING FUND ANNUAL EXPENSES and accompanying EXAMPLES associated with Initial Class expenses are shown below:

The MFS/SUN Life Series Trust has an expense offset arrangement which reduces the Fund's custodian fee based upon the amount of cash maintained by the Fund with its custodian and dividend disbursing agent, and may enter into such other arrangements and directed brokerage arrangement (which would also have the effect of reducing the Fund's expenses). Any such fee reductions are not reflected in the table. Had these fee reductions been taken into account, "Total Annual Fund Expenses" would have been lower for certain series:

Learn about our current products offerings:





Assured Income 7SM Fixed Index AnnuityAmericans are living longer than ever thanks to advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles. This is great news, but longer lifespans mean extra years in retirement. You may even spend more years in retirement than you have at work. You may need to plan for more financial resources to have the retirement lifestyle you envision.
 
Assured Income 7SM Fixed Index Annuity is a flexible and straightforward solution built to provide you with guaranteed lifetime income. Your annuity gives you the choice of simple crediting options to grow your money and competitive guaranteed income you can depend upon and plan around. Assured Income 7SM offers an excellent balance of predictable guaranteed income and competitive accumulation.
 
Key Benefits
Assured Income 7SM gives you sought-after guaranteed lifetime income and simple, attractive crediting options to grow your money.
 
Guaranteed Principal to Protect Your Retirement MoneyUnlike other retirement products, a fixed index annuity is not an investment in individual securities. So when the markets do poorly, your account is guaranteed to not drop in value. Both your investment and any interest it earns are protected from principal loss, by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company.1
 

1If you withdraw your assets, your principal may be reduced by withdrawal and surrender charges, rider fees and a market value adjustment.


Choice of Indexes and Crediting Methods to Suite Your NeedsStraightforward options to grow your savings:
 

S&P 500® Index – Widely regarded as a premier benchmark for the domestic stock market.
Fixed Account – Credited with an interest rate that is current on the date the investment is effective.

You may elect more than one strategy and on each contract anniversary, you may reallocate your account value among the options available at that time.
 
For more detailed information on the index options and the crediting methods available, please see our Product Brochure.

Standard & Poor’s® and S&P® are registered trademarks of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”); Dow Jones® is a registered trademark of Dow Jones Trademark Holdings LLC (“Dow Jones”); and these trademarks have been licensed for use by SPDJI and sublicensed for certain purposes by Delaware Life.

Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit with Fee Refund Feature
Assured Income 7SM comes with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit that provides income for the owner and spouse (if elected), even if the account (cash) value should go to zero. The benefit base will grow by a guaranteed 9% per year (roll-up bonus credit) for 10 years (roll-up bonus period) for an annual cost. The benefit base is the amount on which your lifetime income is calculated. The benefit base is not a cash or surrender value or death benefit and is not available as a lump sum. This feature means you’ll know what your lifetime income will be, so you can make plans with real information.
 
Fee Refund Feature
 
The guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit also includes a unique fee refund feature. After 10 years (or less if the annuity’s owner dies) 100% of rider fees paid (within the last 10 contract years) are eligible for a refund if:
 

Lifetime income is never started, and 
No withdrawals of any kind (including RMDs) are taken. 


Bailout Endorsement
Assured Income 7SM comes with a “bailout” provision, that provides full or partial withdrawals from the contract without a surrender charge or market value adjustment if, the renewal cap for the S&P 500® 1-year point-to-point strategy is below the bailout cap rate.

Retirement Stages 7® Fixed Index AnnuityA long retirement could afford you the time to do the things you never had the chance to do while you were working, raising a family and paying a mortgage. You know that you’ll need the means to realize that goal, so you’re looking for the opportunity to continuously grow your savings while protecting it from market losses.
 
The unique features of Delaware Life’s Retirement Stages 7® Fixed Index Annuity give you conservative income potential, including optional riders that provide guaranteed lifetime income and a return of your premium payments free of surrender charges.1 You have a choice of index options available only from Delaware Life.  The flexibility of Retirement Stages 7® is designed to adapt to your needs through all the stages of your life – growing your savings while working, protecting your savings and providing reliable retirement income.
 

1Optional riders are available for an additional fee, subject to state availability and restrictions and limits apply.

 
Key Benefits
Retirement Stages 7® gives you flexibility and control to plan for the stages of your life your way with:
 Guaranteed Principal to Protect Your Retirement MoneyUnlike other retirement products, a fixed index annuity is not an investment in individual securities. So when the markets do poorly, your account is guaranteed to not drop in value. Both your investment and any interest it earns are protected from principal loss, by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company.1
 

1If you withdraw your assets, your principal may be reduced by withdrawal and surrender charges, rider fees and a market value adjustment.


Choice of Indexes and Crediting Methods to Suit Your NeedsChoose from an unusual, well thought-out selection of investment options and crediting methods designed to meet your evolving needs and goals:
 

CROCI Sectors III USD 5.5% Volatility Control Index – Sponsored by Deutsche Bank and dynamically allocates exposure between the CROCI Sectors Index, which invests in the 10 most undervalued stocks from each of the three most undervalued global industry sectors, and a cash component, using a volatility control mechanism to help limit overall volatility.
Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index – Sponsored by Deutsche Bank and dynamically allocates exposure across equities, gold, interest rates and cash based on their trailing nine month performance, using a volatility control mechanism to help limit overall volatility.
S&P 500® Index – Widely regarded as a premier benchmark for the domestic stock market.
Fixed Account – Credited with an interest rate that is current on the date the investment is effective.

 
You may elect more than one strategy and on each contract anniversary, you may reallocate your account value among the options available at that time. For more detailed information on the index options and the crediting methods available, please see our Product Brochure.

This premise may not be correct, and prospective investors must form their own view of the CROCI methodology and evaluate whether CROCI is appropriate for them. Please see the Disclosure Statement and Annuity Illustration for more information about the Deutsche Bank Indices and the Product.
Obligations to make payments under the Product are solely the obligation of Delaware Life Insurance Company and are not the responsibility of DB AG.  The selection of one or more of the Deutsche Bank Indices as a crediting option under the Product does not obligate Delaware Life Insurance Company or DB AG to invest annuity payments in the components of any of the Deutsche Bank Indices.
The Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index is calculated on an excess return basis reflecting the weighted performance of the Index constituents in excess of the performance of the Deutsche Bank Momentum Money Market Index. In addition, the Index also reflects the daily deduction of a 0.25% per annum fee.
While volatility controls may result in less fluctuation in rates of return as compared to indices without volatility controls, they may also reduce the overall rate of return as compared to products not subject to volatility controls.

 

There are risks associated with the CROCI methodology, the CROCI Sectors III Index and the CROCI Sectors III USD 5.5% Volatility Control (“CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC”) Index:

No assurance can be given that the CROCI methodology will be successful at identifying undervalued companies;
There is no assurance that (i) the three industry sectors chosen will outperform the other industry sectors or (ii) the 30 chosen stocks will outperform the remaining stocks in the component indices;
Even if the strategy of the CROCI Sectors III Index is successful and it outperforms the component indices, the level of the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may decline;
Because the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC is subject to a maximum notional exposure of 100% to the CROCI Sectors III Index and will not adjust its exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index by more than 10% on any day, the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may not be able to maintain a fixed target volatility level of 5.5%;
If the realized volatility of the CROCI Sectors III Index is less than 5.5%, the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may have a 100% exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index, but a target volatility level less than 5.5%;
Because the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC’s exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index on each day is calculated based on the historical realized volatility the CROCI Sectors III Index, the realized volatility of the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC could differ significantly from the target volatility level;
The CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC is subject to currency exchange rate risk; and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the sponsor and calculation agent of the Index, may adjust the Index and/or its components in a way that affects their respective levels and may have conflicts of interest.


 

There are risks associated with the Deutsche Bank Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index (the “Index”) and the Deutsche Bank Momentum Asset Allocator Index (the “Momentum Index”):

The Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index is calculated on an excess return basis reflecting the weighted performance of the Index constituents in excess of the performance of the Deutsche Bank Momentum Money Market Index. In addition, the Index also reflects the daily deduction of a 0.25% per annum fee;
On any day, the actual realized volatility of the Index could be significantly higher or lower than the target volatility of 5.5%;
There is no assurance that the strategy of the Momentum Index will be successful, and it may decline in value even if successful. Past performance of the Index is not indicative of future results; and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the sponsor and calculation agent of the Index, the Momentum Index and the Momentum Index’s underlying indices, may adjust such indices in a way that affects their respective levels and may have conflicts of interest.

Assured Income 7SM Fixed Index AnnuityAmericans are living longer than ever thanks to advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles. This is great news, but longer lifespans mean extra years in retirement. You may even spend more years in retirement than you have at work. You may need to plan for more financial resources to have the retirement lifestyle you envision.
 
Assured Income 7SM Fixed Index Annuity is a flexible and straightforward solution built to provide you with guaranteed lifetime income. Your annuity gives you the choice of simple crediting options to grow your money and competitive guaranteed income you can depend upon and plan around. Assured Income 7SM offers an excellent balance of predictable guaranteed income and competitive accumulation.
 
Key Benefits
Assured Income 7SM gives you sought-after guaranteed lifetime income and simple, attractive crediting options to grow your money.
 
Guaranteed Principal to Protect Your Retirement MoneyUnlike other retirement products, a fixed index annuity is not an investment in individual securities. So when the markets do poorly, your account is guaranteed to not drop in value. Both your investment and any interest it earns are protected from principal loss, by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company.1
 

1If you withdraw your assets, your principal may be reduced by withdrawal and surrender charges, rider fees and a market value adjustment.


Choice of Indexes and Crediting Methods to Suite Your NeedsStraightforward options to grow your savings:
 

S&P 500® Index – Widely regarded as a premier benchmark for the domestic stock market.
Fixed Account – Credited with an interest rate that is current on the date the investment is effective.

You may elect more than one strategy and on each contract anniversary, you may reallocate your account value among the options available at that time.
 
For more detailed information on the index options and the crediting methods available, please see our Product Brochure.

Standard & Poor’s® and S&P® are registered trademarks of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”); Dow Jones® is a registered trademark of Dow Jones Trademark Holdings LLC (“Dow Jones”); and these trademarks have been licensed for use by SPDJI and sublicensed for certain purposes by Delaware Life. Assured Income 7SM is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by SPDJI, Dow Jones, S&P, their respective affiliates and none of such parties make any representation regarding the advisability of investing in such product(s) nor do they have any liability for any errors, omissions, or interruptions of the S&P 500®.


Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit with Fee Refund Feature
Assured Income 7SM comes with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit that provides income for the owner and spouse (if elected), even if the account (cash) value should go to zero. The benefit base will grow by a guaranteed 9% per year (roll-up bonus credit) for 10 years (roll-up bonus period) for an annual cost. The benefit base is the amount on which your lifetime income is calculated. The benefit base is not a cash or surrender value or death benefit and is not available as a lump sum. This feature means you’ll know what your lifetime income will be, so you can make plans with real information.
 
Fee Refund Feature
 
The guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit also includes a unique fee refund feature. After 10 years (or less if the annuity’s owner dies) 100% of rider fees paid (within the last 10 contract years) are eligible for a refund if:
 

Lifetime income is never started, and 
No withdrawals of any kind (including RMDs) are taken. 


Bailout Endorsement
Assured Income 7SM comes with a “bailout” provision, that provides full or partial withdrawals from the contract without a surrender charge or market value adjustment if, the renewal cap for the S&P 500® 1-year point-to-point strategy is below the bailout cap rate. A cap is the maximum interest your FIA can earn in a year. No allocation to the Index account is required to receive this bailout protection. This benefit is provided to the owner at no cost. See the disclosure statement for more details.

  
Delaware Life Insurance Company is authorized to transact business in all states except New York, as well as in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Choice of Indexes and Crediting Methods to Suit Your NeedsChoose from an unusual, well thought-out selection of investment options and crediting methods designed to meet your evolving needs and goals:
 

CROCI Sectors III USD 5.5% Volatility Control Index – Sponsored by Deutsche Bank and dynamically allocates exposure between the CROCI Sectors Index, which invests in the 10 most undervalued stocks from each of the three most undervalued global industry sectors, and a cash component, using a volatility control mechanism to help limit overall volatility.
Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index – Sponsored by Deutsche Bank and dynamically allocates exposure across equities, gold, interest rates and cash based on their trailing nine month performance, using a volatility control mechanism to help limit overall volatility.
S&P 500® Index – Widely regarded as a premier benchmark for the domestic stock market.
Fixed Account – Credited with an interest rate that is current on the date the investment is effective.

 
You may elect more than one strategy and on each contract anniversary, you may reallocate your account value among the options available at that time. For more detailed information on the index options and the crediting methods available, please see our Product Brochure.
 

This Product (the “Product”) is not sponsored, endorsed, managed, sold or promoted by Deutsche Bank AG (DB AG) or any subsidiary or affiliate of DB AG.  The Deutsche Bank Indices are the exclusive property of DB AG.  “Deutsche Bank” and “CROCI” are proprietary marks of DB AG and its affiliates that have been licensed for certain uses and purposes to Delaware Life Insurance Company (DLIC).  Neither DB AG, CROCI, nor any affiliate of DB AG, nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the Deutsche Bank Indices: (1) is acting in a fiduciary or product management capacity or providing any endorsement of the Product or investment advice of any kind; (2) has any obligation to take the needs of DLIC, the sponsor of the Product, or its clients into consideration in determining, composing or calculating the Deutsche Bank Indices; (3) is responsible for or has participated in the determination of the timing of, prices at, quantities or valuation of the Product; (4) WARRANTS OR GUARANTEES THE ACCURACY AND/OR THE COMPLETENESS OF THE DEUTSCHE BANK INDICES OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN AND SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INTERRUPTIONS THEREIN OR THE ADMINISTRATION, MARKETING OR TRADING OF THE PRODUCT.  The CROCI Indices have been built on the premise that the CROCI Economic P/E is an effective indicator of inherent value. This premise may not be correct, and prospective investors must form their own view of the CROCI methodology and evaluate whether CROCI is appropriate for them. Please see the Disclosure Statement and Annuity Illustration for more information about the Deutsche Bank Indices and the Product.
Obligations to make payments under the Product are solely the obligation of Delaware Life Insurance Company and are not the responsibility of DB AG.  The selection of one or more of the Deutsche Bank Indices as a crediting option under the Product does not obligate Delaware Life Insurance Company or DB AG to invest annuity payments in the components of any of the Deutsche Bank Indices.
The Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index is calculated on an excess return basis reflecting the weighted performance of the Index constituents in excess of the performance of the Deutsche Bank Momentum Money Market Index. In addition, the Index also reflects the daily deduction of a 0.25% per annum fee.
While volatility controls may result in less fluctuation in rates of return as compared to indices without volatility controls, they may also reduce the overall rate of return as compared to products not subject to volatility controls.

 

There are risks associated with the CROCI methodology, the CROCI Sectors III Index and the CROCI Sectors III USD 5.5% Volatility Control (“CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC”) Index:

No assurance can be given that the CROCI methodology will be successful at identifying undervalued companies;
There is no assurance that (i) the three industry sectors chosen will outperform the other industry sectors or (ii) the 30 chosen stocks will outperform the remaining stocks in the component indices;
Even if the strategy of the CROCI Sectors III Index is successful and it outperforms the component indices, the level of the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may decline;
Because the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC is subject to a maximum notional exposure of 100% to the CROCI Sectors III Index and will not adjust its exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index by more than 10% on any day, the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may not be able to maintain a fixed target volatility level of 5.5%;
If the realized volatility of the CROCI Sectors III Index is less than 5.5%, the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may have a 100% exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index, but a target volatility level less than 5.5%;
Because the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC’s exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index on each day is calculated based on the historical realized volatility the CROCI Sectors III Index, the realized volatility of the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC could differ significantly from the target volatility level;
The CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC is subject to currency exchange rate risk; and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the sponsor and calculation agent of the Index, may adjust the Index and/or its components in a way that affects their respective levels and may have conflicts of interest.


 

There are risks associated with the Deutsche Bank Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index (the “Index”) and the Deutsche Bank Momentum Asset Allocator Index (the “Momentum Index”):

The Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index is calculated on an excess return basis reflecting the weighted performance of the Index constituents in excess of the performance of the Deutsche Bank Momentum Money Market Index. In addition, the Index also reflects the daily deduction of a 0.25% per annum fee;
On any day, the actual realized volatility of the Index could be significantly higher or lower than the target volatility of 5.5%;
There is no assurance that the strategy of the Momentum Index will be successful, and it may decline in value even if successful. Past performance of the Index is not indicative of future results; and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the sponsor and calculation agent of the Index, the Momentum Index and the Momentum Index’s underlying indices, may adjust such indices in a way that affects their respective levels and may have conflicts of interest.

Statements



A New Account Statement for Your Delaware Life Annuity
In October, Delaware Life introduced a new service support model for our annuity business. This change included moving account records to a new administrative system. As a result, the look and content of your quarterly variable annuity account statements will be changing, beginning with the year-end 2015 statement that will be mailed to you in January 2016. The new statement has been streamlined and includes what we believe is the essential information for understanding and managing your annuity.
To help you become familiar with your new statement and how to find more information online, please use these tools:








A Guide to Your New Delaware Life Annuity Statement



Frequently Asked Questions
I just received my quarterly statement. Why does it look different?
As you may know, Delaware Life recently introduced a new administrative support model for our annuity business. This new model included changes to our contact information, as well as our Account Access website and outgoing correspondence to our customers. Along with those changes, you will now see your Quarterly Statement information presented in a new format.

Will this be the way my statement looks in the future?
Although there is no time frame on the enhancements, we are actively working on building more content into our future variable annuity statements to enhance the information and details specific to your contract.

I used to be able to see my living benefit and death benefit details on my quarterly statement. Why is that no longer available?
We are actively working on building more content into our future statements. However, at this time, living benefit and death benefit information is not available on the statement.
Your living benefit and death benefit information is available on our Account Access site. If you have not already done so, please register on the Delaware Life Account Access site to view your account details. For immediate questions regarding your living benefit or death benefit, or for information you cannot locate on the Account Access site, please call one of our Customer Service representatives and they will be happy to assist you.

My statement used to list my beneficiary details. Where can I find this information?
You may log onto our Account Access website to access your beneficiary details. On the Account Access site, within the “People” tab, you will find all Primary and Contingent beneficiary information and percentages.

I used to get my rate of return on my statement. Why is it gone and how do I get that now?
As part of the new administrative support model for our annuity business, the personal rate of return is no longer available. Although we are unable to provide your personal rate of return, you may access your fund performance details on our Account Access website.

My year-end statement used to tell me what my Required Minimum Distribution value was, as well as my next year’s RMD amount. Where can I find that information?
As a result of changes to outgoing correspondence, this information will now be sent through a separate mailing that outlines your Required Minimum Distribution basis value and your current year’s RMD amount. This letter will be postmarked no later than January 31, 2016.

My previous statement provided me with my cost basis. Why can I not get it on this one?
Going forward we will not be displaying a breakdown of your cost basis on your quarterly statements. However, one of our Customer Service representatives will be happy to provide you with the cost basis for your non-qualified contract.

My transactions used to be broken out by subaccount, and now it is only showing the total transaction. Why?
By logging-on to the Delaware Life Account Access site, you will be able to view transaction detail at the sub account level by dollar amount. If you require additional information regarding a specific transaction, such as units purchased and sold, please call our Customer Service team.

I used to receive e-delivery of my statements. How do I re-establish e-delivery of my account statement?
E-Delivery will be offered and available to clients by the end of 2015, but you will have to re-elect this service once you’ve registered on the Account Access site. Until you do so, you will continue to receive mailed documents.
Financial Advisors must register for account access to receive their client statements.
You can log onto the Delaware Life Account Access site or we will be happy to assist you with registering your account today if you call our Customer Service team.

I rebalance my portfolio each quarter, why does the transaction history look different?
The values displayed are the net result of all money/units moved between all funds in order to rebalance to the original percentages you have allocated. In order to view each of the funds, and the corresponding dollar amounts moved between each, please log onto the Delaware Life Account Access site.

Your Annuity Contract is Secure and Unchanged
The terms, guarantees and values of your annuity contract remain unaffected, as does our commitment to you. Your contract is backed by the financial strength and claims-paying ability of Delaware Life Insurance Company, a leading U.S. provider of annuity and life insurance products. The Delaware Life group of companies is a financially strong, well-capitalized organization committed to serving our clients as prudent financial stewards, with more than 340,000 in-force annuity and life insurance policies representing approximately $36 billion in assets under management.1
1As of September 30, 2015.
