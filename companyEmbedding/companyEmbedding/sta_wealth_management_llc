						Management
						has
						expanded its services from investment management to also include private wealth and financial
						planning.
 Our highly specialized expert team of more than 20 seasoned executives, skilled advisors, and supporting staff are based in the CityCentre commercial and professional district of Houston, Texas, and share a steadfast dedication to serving our diverse worldwide client base. We seek to manage risk and optimize financial futures through proactive independent and proprietary research, strategic planning, and personal connection and collaboration.

 Learn More 








Wealth Management
STA Wealth Management has built a solid reputation for applying a conservative, disciplined
						approach to our clients’ financial needs that’s also very different:
 we don’t simply provide active portfolio management, but rather develop customized investment strategies targeting your unique requirements, preferences, and challenges. Our comprehensive suite of solutions features offerings as diverse as the individuals and organizations we serve, delivered with hands-on guidance driven by decades of proven success. 
Please select a wealth management service to learn
							more.






 


Planning.
 Our truly unique financial planning process is about far more than projections or specific solutions. We believe that the most important focus should be on your individual goals, visions, and objectives, and we partner with you personally to customize a tailored management plan for both securing and supplementing your financial future.  Learn More 





 


Investing.
 Successful investment is simple enough in theory: maximizing return while minimizing risk … However, at STA Wealth Management we know that in practice it’s much more complicated—and that’s why we’ve assembled people and processes that put decades of proven experience at your disposal, to build and manage a portfolio that’s uniquely your own.  Learn More 







 


Insurance.
 Insurance isn’t just a safety net for the unexpected or catastrophic—it can be a constructive tool for creating stability and confidence as you move through life. STA’s demonstrated expertise helps you leverage the power of insurance to provide protection and freedom.  Learn More

Portfolio Construction
To implement your customized strategy, we select appropriate investments, including equities, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, separately managed accounts, and insurance products to match your unique goals and requirements. 
Depending upon your particular situation, we may also review alternatives such as real estate, managed futures, and other investment vehicles.
Guided by your circumstances, objectives, and comfort level with investment risk, we thoroughly explore and credibly identify the appropriate mix of asset classes for you. All the while, we communicate our strategy with you—ensuring a common understanding and consistent execution, as well as valuable peace of mind for you as an informed participant in the investment process. A hallmark of our portfolio management and construction process, and one of our core operational strengths, is the integration of effective strategies for actively managing the risk that’s inherent to some degree in any investment activity. As financial markets evolve and often become more uncertain, our team continues to expand our expertise by utilizing a wide range of risk management strategies.
 





At STA Wealth Management we don’t limit our desired outcomes to simply outperforming a
            specific
            index and potentially taking excessive portfolio risk.
Instead, our most important target is achieving the returns necessary to meet your specific
            investment objectives, and every portfolio management step and decision is guided by that
            personal
            commitment to you.











Growth
The objective of this global asset allocation model is to provide total returns consisting of capital appreciation.
                  









Income with Growth
The objective of this global asset allocation model is to provide total returns consisting primarily of current income and secondarily of capital appreciation.
                  











Growth with Income
The objective of this global asset allocation model is to provide total returns consisting primarily of capital appreciation and secondarily of current income.
                  









Hedged Fixed Income
The objective of this global asset allocation model is to provide total returns consisting primarily of current income with moderate capital appreciation.
                  











Balanced
The objective of this global asset allocation model is to provide total returns consisting of a balanced blend of capital appreciation and current income.
                  









Fixed Income
The objective of this global asset allocation model is to provide total returns consisting of current income.
                  













                Fixed Income

Our fixed income makes up an important part of out overal portfolio construction.
            



The objective of our Fixed Income portion is to achieve capital appreciation and
                stable income through a portfolio of fixed income credit securities, which may
                include corporate bonds (both investment and non-investment grade), municipal bonds,
                agency bonds, convertible bonds, treasuries and foreign bonds.
              






Core Strategy
                

Our core strategy portion seeks to capitalize on long-term macro-trends, deep value
              strategies and non-correlated asset classes aimed at developing low volatility
              returns.



The primary asset classes include domestic equities, international and emerging
                equities, long-term commodity exposure (such as metals and agriculture), managed
                futures and currencies. The use of non-traditional asset classes provides low
                correlation performance opportunities. The use of alternative investments or private
                placements may be used as part of the core strategy. Adding this component is not
                done on a discretionary basis and is subject to accreditation and/or qualification
                certification.






Tactical
                Strategy

Market cycles create situations which, we believe, can be short-term, mis-priced
              (either upside or downside) opportunities.




                This represents the most “dynamic” strategy in the portfolio. We handle risk
                management in the Tactical Strategy portion of the portfolio by selling the
                positions to reduce risk or exposure in the portfolio.
              






Cash

Cash management is an essential function of portfolio management.



When our investment team believes that the risk outweighs the possible returns, cash
                may be raised to reduce risk of volatility. Cash may include money market and/or
                other cash equivalents.
