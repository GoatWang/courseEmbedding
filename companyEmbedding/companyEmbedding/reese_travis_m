Franchise Chatter Exclusive: Q&A Interview with Reese Travis, CEO of Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt, “America’s Frozen Yogurt”
by Franchise Chatter on August 17, 2011
in Executive Profile, Franchise Chatter Exclusive, Frozen Yogurt Franchises, Q & A Interview

















Before you even consider investing in a frozen yogurt franchise, take the time to learn what it really takes to succeed in this business.  Click here.

(Ambrosio’s note:  Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt is a fairly recent discovery of mine.  While doing some research on the ‘net, I stumbled upon a personal blog that had a comprehensive list of frozen yogurt franchises, both national and regional.  I was very impressed with what I read about Orange Leaf so I wrote about them in a blog post, which turned out to be very popular from day one.

Sensing a lot of interest for more information on Orange Leaf, I reached out to the company and, thankfully, their CEO Reese Travis accepted my invitation to do an exclusive interview with Franchise Chatter.  I must say that Orange Leaf is one of the most professional and responsive franchises I’ve worked with for these interviews, and to me, that speaks volumes. This is a terrific interview worth your time and I hope you all enjoy it.)
Curious About Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt’s Revenue Potential (Item 19, FDD)?  Click here.









Reese Travis has five years of medical sales experience at DePuy Orthopedics, Johnson and Johnson’s orthopedics implant company (where he was recognized for sales excellence), two years involvement with private equity and hedge fund groups, and one year as an Orange Leaf franchisee.  In 2010, Reese and a group of investors bought out the original owners of Orange Leaf, and have since the grown the chain from 15 stores to 97, and counting.
Reese Travis, CEO of Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt
1.  What made you decide to purchase Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt?
It all started in 2009 when my father-in-law took me to an Orange Leaf store in Edmond, Oklahoma. I remember him saying “It’s a great atmosphere, great product, it’s appealing to the masses. Let’s buy it.” We did our research and the more we learned, the more intrigued we were, so a group of friends and family put some money together and we were off as franchisees. We quickly opened one store in Norman and another in Lawton with others not far behind.
My partners and I could see the industry growing before us, so we approached the owners about buying the entire company. We knew we were buying a great product that was extremely competitive in the marketplace and we have been expanding our presence nationally ever since. When we started, Orange Leaf had 15 stores and now, just a year later, we are up to 97 stores in over 20 states, with 59 more coming soon.









2.  Why should someone interested in owning his or her own business consider a frozen yogurt franchise?
In this economy, people aren’t taking as many vacations or spending a lot of money on entertainment, but they’re still going out as families to enjoy time together over frozen yogurt. It’s an affordable treat and it’s not going anywhere any time soon. For franchisees, that means a reliable business and an investment they can feel good about.
My partners and I chose Orange Leaf because we saw the value in teaming up with a group that was selling a proprietary product in a fast-growing market. Franchising in general is a great option for investors because the hard work has been done for you. Corporate has already put in the time and effort to do solid market research, test what works and what doesn’t and, most importantly, build a good company track record. All you have to worry about is executing a successful business model.
Being an Orange Leaf franchisee is great because it allows you to be a part of a brand that’s bigger than yourself. You get to represent both the brand and the community by having a direct impact on the market without sacrificing customer interaction.
3.  What sets Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt apart from your competitors in the frozen yogurt industry?
We don’t just call ourselves America’s Frozen Yogurt — we are America’s Frozen Yogurt. We’ve got flavors people recognize and our proprietary product has the same smooth and creamy texture we have all come to expect in an American frozen dairy treat. It’s a healthier dessert alternative that reaches across all demographics and satisfies every sweet tooth.
4.  What qualities do you look for in a prospective franchisee?
We screen our potential franchisees very carefully. We are looking for franchisees with a real interest in being hands-on owners who are enthusiastic and community-driven. They have to be passionate about our brand and committed to maintaining its integrity.
5.  Can you describe the ideal territory and neighborhood for an Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt franchise?
Orange Leaf is a community-minded, family-focused establishment that strives to be a positive addition to every neighborhood we serve. We have yet to find a location where people don’t want a fun, friendly place to spend time with each other — without spending a lot of money. The self-serve yogurt industry is trendy, but it’s not a fleeting craze. We’ve created a sustainable business model and superior product that is sure to outlast the competition in any market we enter.
6.  Based on your observations, what concrete steps do your most successful franchisees take in order to build and grow their businesses?
The most successful franchisees are motivated by their customers’ positive experience. They see their business as a way to reach out and serve the community more than just frozen yogurt.
Orange Leaf is particularly focused on providing franchisees a model for hosting charity events and fundraisers to boost local morale. I love this company, but it would be for nothing if we didn’t use it to better the communities we serve. We’ve had so many franchisees doing great things, we even started a blog to keep track and spread the word. In Joplin, they passed out free yogurt to storm victims, volunteers, and emergency response teams. In Bossier City, they set up a donation for a tragically ill 6-year-old girl and her family. We are proud of our franchisees for taking initiative and representing Orange Leaf in such a positive way.
7.  What kind of ongoing support do you extend to your franchisees to help them become more successful?
We partner with our franchisees from the onset, making ourselves readily available for anything they may need to be successful. Once they’re through the application process, we bring out potential franchisees to Oklahoma for “Discovery Day” where they meet the corporate staff and get a feel for how we do things. We want them to become self-sufficient business operators, but that doesn’t mean they have to be experienced from the start. At Orange Leaf, we focus on the overall experience, so what we’re really looking for is someone who places as much value on the customer as we do. We can teach the spreadsheets and business end of it.
As a franchisor, I get to help franchisees achieve their dreams of business ownership and financial security in a family-friendly environment. I am a businessman at heart and have great expectations for my company, not the least of which is providing franchisees the tools to become self-sufficient business owners and operators. I relate to their position; I understand their wants and needs. It’s more than a company — it’s people. I do everything I can to be available for them and provide the necessary tools for success because I want nothing more than for each franchisee to feel confident and accomplished.
8.  What would you tell a prospective franchisee who wants to know about the profit potential of an Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt franchise?
Orange Leaf continues to stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly growing self-serve frozen yogurt industry. We have established a great product, strategic business model, and positive brand recognition. Consumer demand means franchisees have plenty of opportunity to grow their own business and our support system puts them in the best possible position to succeed.
9.  Can you describe your typical day as CEO of Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt? What do you enjoy most about your job?
The majority of my work day is spent focused on our franchisees. Whether it’s a prospect inquiring about the company or an existing owner looking for guidance, I truly enjoy interacting and forming relationships. The most satisfying part of my job is watching franchisees fulfill their potential as successful business operators.
10.  Is there anything else that you’d like to share with us about Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt?
In five years, we want to be the absolute leader in self-serve frozen yogurt.  We have new stores opening almost every week and we don’t intend to slow down. Our team members at the corporate office see our franchisees as business partners and are dedicated to helping them every step of the way.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

				Q&A: Reese Travis, CEO Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt, Oklahoma City 




			Published on Sunday, 01 July 2012		
 
						
							Written by Lisa White, Contributing Editor					

Reese Travis and his business partners were looking for a unique food concept that they could bring to Oklahoma. After considering creating a new chain, Travis went back to one that had already impressed him.
"A group of investors I work with tested the competition. We looked at starting our own concept, but kept coming back to Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt," Travis says. "We felt it had the best product and, after evaluating the price points, offered the best value."
A year after Travis opened Orange Leaf shops in Wichita Falls, Texas, and in Norman and Lawton, Okla., in 2009, he approached the chain's two owners about purchasing the company. The deal was done on April 2, 2010, and Travis and his partners moved Orange Leaf's headquarters from San Francisco to Oklahoma City.
At that time, the chain consisted of 15 stores. Just two years later, Orange Leaf has 151 locations, with two sites in Australia. At press time, there were 64 locations under construction. All locations are franchised, and there are 11 corporate-affiliated stores. The plan is to have 425 stores open in the next few years. "We will continue building it out and taking it to the next level," Travis says.
Orange Leaf was listed among the top 10 fastest-growing yogurt operations under $200 million in Technomic's Top 500 report. Sales were $46.5 million in 2011, a 210 percent increase from 2010 sales, which were $15 million.
FE&S spoke with Travis, who discussed Orange Leaf's concept, equipment requirements and unique approach to the frozen dessert segment.
FE&S: Describe your concept.
R.T.: We are a self-serve frozen yogurt concept. The majority of our stores have eight machines with two separate flavors for a total of 16 varieties. Customers determine the portion size, dispense the yogurt themselves, then move on to the toppings bar to choose from fruit, candy, sprinkles, etc. When it's time to check out, we weigh the cup with the yogurt and toppings inside. Customers are charged by the ounce.
FE&S: What makes your operation unique.
R.T.: There are a couple other self-serve concepts and some full-serve yogurt shops, but we have embraced our model. Customers can get exactly what they want and make the yogurt how they want it.
FE&S: Describe your locations.
R.T.: Orange Leaf stores are between 1,600 and 1,700 square feet, 18 to 20 feet wide and 16 to 20 feet deep. There is custom Orange Leaf seating in the front of the store. The self-serve area is located in the back, where there are cup stands with 16- and 24-ounce containers. This flows to the wall, which contains custom yogurt machines. Adjacent to this area is the toppings bar, which is right by the checkout area. The back of house is small, only 400 to 500 square feet. It includes worktables and blenders, since we do a lot of prep work. We fill and clean the yogurt machines from inside the kitchen. Shelves along the wall store ingredients. We also have a three-compartment sink and three four-door refrigerators, in addition to a freezer. Stores have between eight and 13 employees who work two six-hour shifts. We are open seven days a week from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.
FE&S: What do you look for when purchasing equipment?
R.T.: We are always looking for ways to become more efficient and encourage franchisees to look for good service providers. We provide listings of spec'd equipment. It's important to build relationships and find support mechanisms, even with something as simple as buying a refrigerator.
FE&S: What do you predict for the frozen yogurt segment in the years ahead?
R.T.: We're in this first wave, and there is room for more self-serve yogurt concepts. It's a land run in terms of who can get the best location. Our franchise model allows us to use people in their local market. They know traffic and consumer patterns and can get us great locations for our concepts. Our franchisees become pillars of the community, so we like to empower them.
