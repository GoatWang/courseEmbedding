HITA Cybersecurity Threat Center a Good Idea
Tweet
Share



The Health Information Trust Alliance (HITA) announced that it is building a Cybersecurity Incident Response and Coordination Center (Threat Center) where organizations can report incidents and get help remediating electronic medical security issues.
This is a good idea.  Currently, there is really no Threat Center-type facility for the healthcare data profession to turn to.  HITA, a part of HITRUST, is a good front group for this type of technology as well, being lead by most of the major names in the medical technology industry, including Kaiser Permanente, Cisco, and WellPoint.

Customer Service Trumps Empowerment
Tweet
Share



In a recent column on Health Data Management, Greg Gillespie  talks about the over-use of the world “empowerment” in health records technologies and online services in general.  He rightly points out that the word is often used to describe something that is not exactly empowering, just convenient, either for the consumer or for the company with the product.
He makes a very good point.  Quite often, internet banking services will describe their services as “empowering” when what their services really are is just convenient.  What is often not included in their ìempowermentî offers is increased customer service.

Is the Rush Towards Electronic Health Records At the Expense of Security?
Tweet
Share



The Redspin consulting firm released a report that includes some shocking information about patient health record data breaches this past year.  The report highlights one thing that seems certain: the rush to adopt electronic health record (EHR) systems at hospitals, clinics, and health care contractors is coming at the price of security for those records.
As we’ve outlined before here at MedeFile and as I will continue to say, security is not only the most important factor in any record keeping system that involves health records that can be identified with individual patients, but the most common means of stealing those records is through physical theft of the files, often from third-party vendors or providers to whom the data was outsourced for billing, lab work, or other related services.

The Nation’s Largest Healthcare System Experiments With PHRs
Tweet
Share



The U.S. Veteran’s Administration (VA) hospital system is the largest network of hospitals, doctors and clinics in the nation.  Starting about a year ago, the VA began experimenting with a new personal health record (PHR) system for veterans to use in conjunction with their VA medical benefits.
The system is relatively simple to start with, mostly allowing easier access to the VA system for things like appointment setting and reminders, health tips, prescription refills, and the like.  My HealtheVet is meant to grow slowly in functionality as the engineers building it find out what veterans want and need and implement it into plans for expansion.

Great New E-Health Tech Showcased At CES
Tweet
Share



The Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada this year had a lot of great gadgets and fun innovations.  This included some innovative new electronic health devices, some of which may change the game for the better.
It seems that every company building devices wants to get into the personal health monitor game.  This is good for those who like electronic and personal health records because the more of these devices that come to market, the lower their costs and more likely their adoption.  There were devices ranging from wearable weight loss monitors, fitness and workout gadgets, and more.  These were contrasted by more serious units for diagnostic and treatment.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

					Full Description



MedeFile International, Inc. (MedeFile), incorporated on January 26, 2001, through its subsidiary, MedeFile, Inc., markets a patient-centric, Internet-enabled Personal Health Record (iPHR) system for gathering, digitizing, maintaining, accessing and sharing an individual's actual medical records. The Company's products and services include MedeFile iPHR, MedeFile's Emergency Medical Information (EMI) Card, The Digital Health Profile (DHP), MedeDrive, MedeVault, MedeMinder, SecurMed and MedePro. MedeFile's products and services provide healthcare providers with the ability to reference the patient's actual past medical records. MedeFile iPHR solution gathers all of its members' actual medical records on behalf of each member, and creates a single electronic health record (EHR). The member can access the records around the clock or authorize a third party user on any Web-enabled device (including personal computer (PC), cell phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), e-reader), as well as the portable MedeDrive flash drive/keychain or branded UBS-bracelet.MedeFile iPHRMedeFile is a business-to-business and a business-to-consumer subscription service. MedeFile creates a cradle to grave longitudinal record for each of its members by retrieving and consolidating copies of their medical records. When the records are received, the MedeFile system consolidates them into a single medically correct format. The records are then stored in MedeFile's MedeVault, a secure repository that can be accessed by MedeFile members around the clock. MedeFile iPHR consists of copies of the member's actual medical records, as well as a DHP, which is an overview of the patient's and the family's medical history. In addition, Premium MedeFile and MedeOne members are offered a MedeDrive, an external universal serial bus (USB) drive, which stores the patient's EMI, as well as a copy of the member's MedeFile.MedeFile's Emergency Medical Information CardThe Company provides its members MedeFile's EMI Card. The EMI Card, which is offered to the member contains instructions on how to contact MedeFile in order to retrieve the member's medical records.The Digital Health ProfileThe Company offers its members DHP as part of the MedeFile system. DHP form is completed by the patient in order to provide a summary of the patient's healthcare history, which assists healthcare providers in understanding the patient's course of medical treatment. This document, along with Directives and medical record copies, complete the documents contained in the patient's MedeFile.MedeDriveThe MedeDrive is an external USB drive, which stores the patient's EMI and their MedeFile, which can be viewed on a personal computer (PC). MedeDrive self-loads its own viewer, so no special program or software is required. The MedeDrive plugs into any PC USB port on Windows-based computers.MedeVaultThe MedeVault serves as an electronic data and document repository that incorporates security features in order to prevent unauthorized access to a patient's records. Access to the MedeVault is provided through an encrypted connection to a Web service run by MedeFile. This connection is provided by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.MedeMinderMedeMinder is MedeFile's reminder service. The Company automatically contacts the member day or night with an appropriate reminder, spoken by real people. The members can even choose the voice they want to hear. MedeMinder helps insure the member's appointment or to take their medication.SecurMedThe Company also offers SecurMed. SecurMed serves as an authentication process that protects against information being viewed by unauthorized persons.Quality of Care ProgramMedeFile's Quality of Care Program is a marketing initiative providing for MedeFile to partner on a revenue-sharing basis with medical practitioners, physician groups and hospitals to educate patients on the benefits and advantages of adopting the MedeFile system as their Personal Health Record solution. MedeFile's iPHR platform can serve as a patient portal and practice integration tool that addresses the need for practitioners to meet-stage two meaningful use standards required for qualifying for federal incentive payments pursuant to the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) Act. With the Quality of Care Program, healthcare providers can establish an elevated patient-centric standard of care and government meaningful use incentives and their financial stake in the marketing of MedeFile's iPHR solution to the patient populations.MedeProThe Company provides MedePro, which is a medical record retrieval and document management solution created by MedeFile for legal and insurance professionals. Medical record retrieval and document management is offered to help plaintiff or defense counsels build, support and win their cases, be them mass tort, malpractice, personal injury, product liability, workers' compensation or other types of health- or medical-related litigation. MedePro customer service agents and its electronic retrieval system go to work contacting case-related healthcare providers around the country to collect copies of actual medical records and files, including actual notes, electrocardiogram (EKG), X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and labs. Then, using a secure, double encrypted process, MedeFile consolidates, digitizes, indexes, paginates, Bates stamps, stores and protects the records in the MedeVault, MedeFile's secure, redundant electronic depository, which can only be accessed by authorized individuals. Retrieved medical records can be searched and viewed online through MedeFile's secure online portal using an Internet-enabled desktop computer or mobile computing device. In addition, individual and/or collective documents can also be downloaded, shared with co-counsels (essential for large mass tort cases), and copied to a MedeDrive, a USB thumb drive. The MedePro solution can also be integrated into a law firm's case management system to facilitate real-time, one-click status checks of requested records, helping to expedite case discovery and complex trial preparation.In collaboration with medical insurance providers and with authorization, MedePro enables the expeditious, secure retrieval and management of actual medical records and files from a patient's current and former care providers. Records received are digitized, indexed, coded and stored in the MedeVault, from which case managers can access, view, share and download a patient's longitudinal personal health record from any Web-enabled device. Further, MedePro's online record order tracking system allows case managers to view real-time status reports on an around the clock basis. Insurance professionals can also tap the power and convenience of MedePRO for the purpose of analyzing medical claims or investigating and adjudicating medical identity theft and fraud.The Company competes with GE Healthcare, Bio-Imaging Technologies and Cyber Records.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
