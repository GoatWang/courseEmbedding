Jaw crusher toggle beam hydraulic relief and clearing



Patent number:  6375105
                                            

Abstract:  A jaw crusher having a stationary jaw and a movable jaw which define a variable crushing gap (or closed side setting), a toggle beam, and a toggle between the toggle beam and the movable jaw, and a toggle seat between the toggle and each of the beam and movable jaw for seating the toggle against the beam and movable jaw. A double-acting hydraulic ram having a connection with the toggle beam for shifting the toggle beam toward and away from the fixed jaw. An abutment is supported by the housing and engageable by the toggle beam for defining an adjustably variable limit of shifting thereof. End caps provide a rigidly guided sliding toggle beam having a plurality of alternatively selectable positions of adjustment.

Anti-spin mechanism for gyratory crusher



Patent number:  5931394
                                            

Abstract:  A gyratory crusher includes an anti-spin mechanism which is coupled to a lower end of a main shaft of the crusher and which prevents the main shaft and associated crushing head from spinning when the crusher is not subject to a crushing load. The anti-spin mechanism includes 1) a hydraulic brake, and 2) a gear train which couples the main shaft to the hydraulic brake so as to drive the hydraulic brake to rotate faster than the main shaft while at the same time permitting relative sliding motion between the main shaft and the hydraulic brake without unduly increasing the complexity or height of the crusher. The hydraulic brake is supercharged so as to respond immediately to a tendency of the main shaft to spin. As a result, only relatively low braking forces are required to prevent spinning.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed: 
                        March 30, 1998
                    

Date of Patent: 
                                                        August 3, 1999
                        

Assignee: 
                                                                        Astec Industries, Inc.
                                

Inventors: 
                                                                
                                Matthew B. Haven, James C. Bremer
                            





Paving machine having transversely and longitudinally adjustable grade sensors



Patent number:  4948292
                                            

Abstract:  A paver of the floating screed type which is capable of operating with screed extensions for laying down pavement at various widths includes a self-contained, stowable and extensible grade reference system with a wide, planar adjustment range. The grade reference system provides an adjustment range for positioning a grade sensing device on either or both sides of the paver both forward and transversely outward from a selected support point on the paver. The grade reference system has a pivotally outer support member which permits the sensing device to become positioned at any selected setting of an arcuate path forward of a rearward position in substantial alignment with the leading edge of the screed to a forward position determined by the length of the member.

                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed: 
                        July 24, 1989
                    

Date of Patent: 
                                                        August 14, 1990
                        

Assignee: 
                                                                        Cedarapids, Inc.
                                

Inventors:
