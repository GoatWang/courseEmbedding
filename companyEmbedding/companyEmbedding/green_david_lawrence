1805 25c PCGS/CAC MS63 ex: Col. E.H.R. Green/Newman
DLRC #: 1268534 // PCGS #: 5313
Beautiful green, lavender, and orange tones around the rim of the obverse carry over to the reverse with even more vibrancy. A gorgeous example with amazing luster. As is typical, the details are slightly weaker on the hair above the forehead and in the clouds of the reverse, but overall a gorgeous appearance. Previously sold for $41,125 in a NGC/CAC holder and has since crossed into this PCGS display. CAC approved for quality.
