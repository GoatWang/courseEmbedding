On days I know I won't be in the sun I skip my ss and just use this loose mineral foundation and get a bit of protection while having a nice even color to my skin. I purchased the medium and it is a really good match for me (I border on light/medium and since it's summer I lean to medium). This is a lovely product, doesn't sink in lines or dry my skin at all as some mineral powders have done in the past. My skin is dry so my routine is to use Replenix CF serum then a light moisturizer followed by the mineral powder. I also use it over the Suntegrity  5 in 1 when more protection is required and it works well. I like the coverage that this provides, not heavy, just a lovely even skin tone. I use a brush that I purchased years ago for loose powder application and it works well.		     Report Abuse  3 of 3 people found this helpful.
