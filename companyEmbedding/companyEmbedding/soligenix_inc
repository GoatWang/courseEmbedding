	Vaccines & BioDefense products to combat biological warfare or bioterrorism

Vaccines/BioDefense
You are here:
Pipeline > Vaccines/BioDefense  







00000Since 2001, a new sense of vulnerability to radiation, infectious diseases, toxins and chemical agents has generated significant research and development efforts to identify and produce innovative therapies and means to protect against threats that could be used as biological weapons. There is a growing need for products that protect the population against such agents of bioterrorism, as well as against emerging infectious diseases that could arise through natural epidemics. With very few exceptions, such products do not exist, and those that are available for current deployment are based on outdated and sometimes ineffective technologies. Many of these products will only be used in the event of an emergency.
Products to combat biological warfare or bioterrorism will be supplied to the population from medicines stored in the US Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). The federal government has previously established a special fund to acquire biological warfare countermeasures (termed Project Bioshield), which allocated $5.6 billion over a 10-year period to acquire products for the SNS. Realizing that many of these countermeasures do not yet exist, the US government has established the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). The existence of BARDA creates a situation in which products arising from research, primarily sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Defense (DoD), can be prioritized and then developed for large-scale manufacturing and clinical evaluation, and ultimately acquisition of the product for the SNS.
Soligenix, Inc. is addressing the development of products and technologies that can be used to protect against several biological threats considered agents of bioterrorism, consistent with biological warfare threats and emerging diseases that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a division of the NIH, has identified as high priorities. Soligenix is developing several potential products to prevent morbidity and mortality due to the threat of biological toxins, infectious agents or radiation insult.  In the area of biological toxins, Soligenix is focusing on preventive vaccination as the most feasible means to protect a susceptible population because toxin exposure is mediated through antibodies in the serum or present on mucosal surfaces that can be elicited by vaccination with subunit antigens. Soligenix is also developing therapeutic agents for infectious agents which are known to be incompatible with vaccination approaches and for treatment of the sequelae to radiation exposure.
Soligenix’s process for product development of biodefense products is highly cooperative with government funding, since the government itself will be the final customer for the products.
Currently, Soligenix has government funded programs in all 3 areas:

Vaccine for Ricin Toxin: Soligenix is currently operating under an up to $24.7 million contract award from NIAID, which is funding nonclinical and clinical development of RiVax® (ricin toxin vaccine), that is stable at elevated temperatures and does not require cold chain storage or distribution channels.
Therapeutic for Infectious Disease: Soligenix is expanding the applicability of its SGX94 technology platform, assessing its applicability for the treatment of melioidosis, a top 5 tier Biothreat and other emerging and antibiotic resistant infectious diseases.  This program was funded under a $300,000 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant from NIAID.
Therapeutic for Radiation Injury: Soligenix is expanding the range of applicability of its lead product, oral beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), referred to as OrbeShield®, for gastrointestinal Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) under contracts awarded by BARDA and NIAID totaling $18 million.

About Us  







00000Corporate Profile
Soligenix, Inc. is a late stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing products that address unmet medical needs in the areas of inflammation, oncology and biodefense. Soligenix has two areas of focus: 1) a therapeutics segment dedicated to the development of products for orphan diseases and areas of unmet medical need such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, oral mucositis, pediatric Crohn’s disease, acute radiation enteritis, and 2) a vaccines/biodefense segment to develop vaccines and therapeutics for military and civilian applications in the areas of ricin exposure, gastrointestinal acute radiation syndrome, and melioidosis.
BioTherapeutics
Soligenix is developing SGX301 as a first-in-class photo-dynamic therapy utilizing safe visible light for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, proprietary formulations of oral beclomethasone 17,21-dipropionate (BDP) for the prevention/treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders characterized by severe inflammation including pediatric Crohn’s disease (SGX203) and acute radiation enteritis (SGX201), and its novel innate defense regulator technology (SGX942) for the treatment of oral mucositis.
BioDefense and Emerging Diseases
Soligenix BioDefense business segment includes active development programs for RiVax®, its ricin toxin vaccine candidate, OrbeShield®, its GI acute radiation syndrome therapeutic candidate and SGX101 and SGX943, its melioidosis therapeutic candidates. The development of the vaccine programs incorporates the use of a proprietary heat stabilization platform technology, known as ThermoVax®.  Currently, this business segment is supported with up to $57 million in government grant and contract funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).

00000SGX301
SGX301 (synthetic hypericin) is a first-in-class potent photosensitizer which utilizes safe visible light for activation. Hypericin is also found in several species of Hypericum plants, although the drug used in SGX301 is chemically synthesized by a proprietary manufacturing process and not extracted from plants. Importantly, hypericin is optimally activated by visible light, avoiding the negative consequences of ultraviolet light used by other photodynamic therapies.
Soligenix is advancing the development of SGX301 for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) with the objective of initiating a Phase 3 clinical study in 2015. 
SGX94
SGX94 (susquetide) is a first-in-class proprietary drug with a novel mechanism of action. SGX94 is an innate defense regulator (IDR) which can be used to offset dysfunctional innate immune responses, such as those that occur in oral mucositis, and aid in the resolution of infection. Susquetide is a fully synthetic, 5-amino acid peptide with high aqueous solubility and stability. Soligenix has a strong intellectual property portfolio around SGX94 and related analogs, including composition of matter and therapeutic use.
Soligenix is currently developing SGX942 for oral mucositis in head and neck cancer and SGX943 in Melioidosis.
Oral BDP
Beclomethasone 17,21-dipropionate (BDP) is a highly potent, topically active corticosteroid with a local effect on inflamed tissue. BDP has been marketed in the U.S. and worldwide since the early 1970s as the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a nasal spray and in a metered-dose inhaler for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma in both adults and children. The rationale for its administration is that it provides a potent topical anti-inflammatory effect with less systemic toxicity than a comparably effective systemic corticosteroid.
Soligenix has several proprietary products designed to take advantage of the topical activity of BDP for the treatment of gastrointestinal inflammation: SGX201, and SGX203.
