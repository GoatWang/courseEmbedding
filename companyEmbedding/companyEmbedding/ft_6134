LED Mini Lights
LED Christmas lights are the top choice for decorating indoor and outdoor spaces this holiday season. With colors ranging from warm white, orange, green, and many more, you can choose string lights in your favorite color or to match your holiday theme. Our deluxe warm white light strings are a very warm, almost champagne, color. Please note that our purple lights tend to appear closer to red than blue on the purple scale. Multi-colored lights are also available if you can't decide which color you'd prefer. Most string lights are available in three different wire colors: green, white, and brown.


Brighter than traditional incandescent stringers, LEDs come in several shapes to match your style or replicate tradition stringers.

Wide Angle – These lights are 5 millimeters wide and are often called "wide angle” mini lights. The normal rounded tip has been drilled in to create a concave shape which allows the light to be dispersed in a 180-degree beam angle.

Shimmering Spot – As the original LED mini light design, this shape focuses the light straight out of the rounded tip while also releasing some light in a 180-degree angle. This shape and its concentrated light also helps create a unique "twinkling” effect when the lights sway gently and are viewed from afar. The effect is compared to dozens of tiny flashlights, blinking on and off.

Traditional Shape – Traditional shaped LEDs bring you the energy savings of LED while maintain the classic look of incandescent mini lights.

Faceted Traditional – Faceted means the colored cap is cut in a prismatic or crystal-like pattern. The faceted cap simply softens the light. You get less sharpness but maintain the rich color which LEDs provide.


All of our LED string light are single piece molded construction, meaning the bulbs cannot be replaced. This protects from water invading the sockets, making them safe for outdoor use.


From 17 to 25.5 feet in length, these LED string lights have either 50 or 70 bulbs per string. Using 3.5 to 4.8 watts, Christmas string lights are an easy way to add color and shine to the interior or exterior of your residential or commercial space. Decorate your tree with LED Christmas light strings from 1000Bulbs.com to make your holiday season sparkle.

        So far, so good
I bought about 5 strings and so far, so good.  I'm slowly phasing out my old-school lights and really can't see a different between the two, but it's comforting knowing how little energy it's using.

        LED Christmas lights
These are very high quality lights. Clear, sharp colors and very low current draw.
The purchase experience was straight forward and done quickly. Delivery was right on time and they were well packaged.

I am very happy with 1000 Bulbs!!

        Close to perfect
We searched for multi color lights that didn't have an overall blue tint like most multi colored lights have. I've got these on my deck still because they look so nice. I actually wanted 4" spacing, but with 6" spacing, the lights look more defined to see individual colors and covers more ground(literally) for a 300' fence around our yard. With LED, I can hook as many stands as I want using fewer extension cords. Caught them on sale after Christmas and bingo, done deal!

        Its all good here
Love all 7 colors. Perfect intensity and the wide angle claim is more than just a marketing gimmick. My lights are on a timer and burn @ 9 hours per night. After @ 6 months one light in the center of the string faded and eventually went dark. Its not noticeable due to the way I've wrapped the lights around a joist but could be a bummer if you stretch out the sting to the 25' length.
