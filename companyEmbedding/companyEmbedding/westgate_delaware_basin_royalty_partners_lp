Kimbell Royalty closes Anadarko Basin acquisition 








April 24, 2017



































Kimbell Royalty Partners LP (NYSE: KRP), an owner of oil and natural gas mineral and royalty interests across twenty states, has closed on the acquisition of 1.1 million gross acres (6,700 net royalty acres) of overriding royalty interests in the Anadarko Basin from Maxus Energy Corp. for $15.9 million. This acquisition primarily includes assets located in the panhandle of Texas and Northwest portion of Oklahoma.
This package, which is substantially all held by production, includes production from multiple stacked pay zones in over 2,600 producing wells located across 32 counties in five states throughout the Mid-Continent, including Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Wyoming and New Mexico. A total of 145 wells have been drilled on the acquired interest since 2014. Management has estimated the average daily production is approximately 272 net Boe/d (6:1) for the first quarter of 2017 and total proved reserves are 1,873 MBoe (6:1) as of April 1, 2017, which consists of 74% natural gas, 16% natural gas liquids and 10% oil. The transaction was funded through the partnership's credit facility.
