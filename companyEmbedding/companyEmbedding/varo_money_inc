 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you. Lenders may perform a soft pull of your credit during the free rate quote process. Soft credit pulls have no impact to your credit scores or rating. You must select a rate quote and then finalize your loan directly with the lender with which you have selected. Any credit product for which you apply is solely the product of the lender. Most lenders will perform a hard credit check under the Fair Credit Reporting Act in order to evaluate your request promptly and adequately. Your permission will be asked for prior to any hard credit inquiry being performed. Final rates, terms and fees will be based on your individual credit history and underwritten by the lender NOT 24/7 Lending Group. 24/7 Lending Group cannot guarantee final terms, rates or repayments as they vary by lender. Providing your information on this Website does not guarantee approval for a product offering.  There is no charge to use 24/7 Lending Group service. 24/7 Lending Group may receive compensation from a lender in certain circumstances.
  Rate quotes provided to customers will be no greater than 35.99% APR (APRs include 0-5% origination fees), with terms from 12 to 72 months and available borrowing amounts of $1,000 to $35,000. Representative Personal Loan Example: For a $5,000 36-month loan at an interest rate of 6.03% with a 1.11% origination fee of $55.50, you will receive a loan amount of $4,944.50 and will make 36 monthly payments of about $152.18 at a 6.78% APR. Total loan cost would be $5,478.48.

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you. Lenders may perform a soft pull of your credit during the free rate quote process. Soft credit pulls have no impact to your credit scores or rating. You must select a rate quote and then finalize your loan directly with the lender with which you have selected. Any credit product for which you apply is solely the product of the lender. Most lenders will perform a hard credit check under the Fair Credit Reporting Act in order to evaluate your request promptly and adequately. Your permission will be asked for prior to any hard credit inquiry being performed. Final rates, terms and fees will be based on your individual credit history and underwritten by the lender NOT 24/7 Lending Group. 24/7 Lending Group cannot guarantee final terms, rates or repayments as they vary by lender. Providing your information on this Website does not guarantee approval for a product offering.  There is no charge to use 24/7 Lending Group service. 24/7 Lending Group may receive compensation from a lender in certain circumstances.
  Rate quotes provided to customers will be no greater than 35.99% APR (APRs include 0-5% origination fees), with terms from 12 to 72 months and available borrowing amounts of $1,000 to $35,000. Representative Personal Loan Example: For a $5,000 36-month loan at an interest rate of 6.03% with a 1.11% origination fee of $55.50, you will receive a loan amount of $4,944.50 and will make 36 monthly payments of about $152.18 at a 6.78% APR. Total loan cost would be $5,478.48.

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.

The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you.

                   SAN FRANCISCO, Varo Money, Inc. (“Varo”), a mobile-only banking start-up that will help consumers gain greater control of their financial lives, today announced the launch of consumer lending via its mobile app. Varo will be issuing credit products in several states through its own lending licenses. With this move, Varo has created a more holistic offering to address its customers’ financial needs. Varo has recently solidified key strategic partnerships to support this launch including a banking and credit relationship with Silicon Valley Bank and Cloud Lending Solutions as system of record.

“We are very excited about the suite of lending products we are building and the partnerships we have formed to support Varo’s lending capabilities,” said Jaime Jerusalmi, Varo’s Head of Lending Products. “In addition to cutting-edge functionality, we plan to raise the bar in terms of helping customers borrow responsibly. Our Varo Flexible Credit product will be a great alternative for people who don’t want to use their credit card to finance large purchases, to accommodate an unexpected expense or that want to build their credit”.

Colin Walsh, Varo’s CEO, added, “Almost half of Americans cannot face a $400 unexpected financial emergency. Our mission is to help people be better prepared for these situations. This is a very important milestone for Varo as we begin providing lending and another clear step toward allowing consumers to take control of all their finances in one intuitive app.”

The Varo Money app is currently in beta and is expected to launch in the coming months. Varo recently partnered with Kasisto to introduce “Val,” a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) bot, designed to assist customers with banking, financial insights, real-time goals, and plans to cover unexpected emergency expenses. In 2016, Varo partnered with The Bancorp Bank to provide private label banking services to support Varo mobile banking products. Varo has also partnered with Galileo Processing, Inc. to provide payment and transaction processing services.

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Varo Money, Inc. ("Varo"), a mobile-only banking start-up that will help consumers gain greater control of their financial lives, today announced the launch of consumer lending via its mobile app.  Varo will be issuing credit products in several states through its own lending licenses. With this move, Varo has created a more holistic offering to address its customers' financial needs. Varo has recently solidified key strategic partnerships to support this launch including a banking and credit relationship with Silicon Valley Bank and Cloud Lending Solutions as system of record. 








"We are very excited about the suite of lending products we are building and the partnerships we have formed to support Varo's lending capabilities," said Jaime Jerusalmi, Varo's Head of Lending Products.  "In addition to cutting-edge functionality, we plan to raise the bar in terms of helping customers borrow responsibly.  Our Varo Flexible Credit product will be a great alternative for people who don't want to use their credit card to finance large purchases, to accommodate an unexpected expense or that want to build their credit".
Colin Walsh, Varo's CEO, added, "Almost half of Americans cannot face a $400 unexpected financial emergency.  Our mission is to help people be better prepared for these situations. This is a very important milestone for Varo as we begin providing lending and another clear step toward allowing consumers to take control of all their finances in one intuitive app." 
The Varo Money app is currently in beta and is expected to launch in the coming months.  Varo recently partnered with Kasisto to introduce "Val," a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) bot, designed to assist customers with banking, financial insights, real-time goals, and plans to cover unexpected emergency expenses.  In 2016, Varo partnered with The Bancorp Bank to provide private label banking services to support Varo mobile banking products.  Varo has also partnered with Galileo Processing, Inc. to provide payment and transaction processing services.
About VaroVaro Money, Inc. is a financial technology company based in San Francisco, California. Varo was founded on the belief that there is a better way to bank that will help improve the financial outcomes of a generation of consumers. In May 2016, Varo announced a $27 million funding round led by Warburg Pincus.  Varo is working with several partners and a panel of millennial advisors to develop and deliver an innovative banking experience in the U.S. Banking accounts provided by The Bancorp Bank, Member FDIC.  For more information please visit www.varomoney.com and follow us on Twitter @varomoney
