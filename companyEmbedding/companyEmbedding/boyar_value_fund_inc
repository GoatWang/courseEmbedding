Welcome To The Boyar Value Group


The Boyar Value Groups’ mission is to search for value on behalf of our clients.
Since 1975 the Boyar family of companies has focused on creating value for our clients — by seeking out and investing in companies whose intrinsic value significantly exceeds that of its current market price. We are committed to the idea that through hard work, patience and dedication to the core tenets of value investing, it is possible to buy a dollar for fifty cents. While many fads and gimmicks have come and gone since we started in the investment business, we’ve remained steadfast in our belief that value investing is the best way to preserve and create wealth in the long term.
These core values not only form our philosophy, but lie at the heart of what we do both in our money management and institutional research divisions. We look forward to putting our knowledge and expertise to work for you.  



Boyar Asset Management


Boyar Research




We have been managing money since 1983 utilizing our proprietary in-house value oriented equity strategy. We manage money for high net worth individuals and institutions via separately managed accounts. In addition, since 1998 we have managed the Boyar Value Fund to serve individuals who cannot meet our minimum investment criteria for separately managed accounts.

Since 1975 we have been producing independent research on intrinsically undervalued companies across the market capitalization spectrum and in a wide variety of industries using a business person’s approach to stock market investing. It is interesting to note that since 1975, approximately 40% of all the companies that have appeared in our flagship publication Asset Analysis Focus have been take over or profitably liquidated*.

Mark Boyar



Mark Boyar
President of Boyar Asset Management
P. 212.995.8300
F. 212.995.5636
Mark A. Boyar, President of Boyar Asset Management, Inc. a Registered Investment Adviser has worked as a securities analyst since 1968. He began actively managing money in 1975 and formed Boyar Asset Management in 1983. In October 1987 a group headed by Mark A. Boyar acquired control of American Corporate Ltd., a closed end fund listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange, which was trading at a deep discount to its net asset value. Five years later he liquidated the fund at a premium to net asset value. In May 1998, Mr. Boyar launched his first mutual fund, The Boyar Value Fund (BOYAX). In addition, Mr. Boyar has published a monthly research report since 1975 entitled Asset Analysis Focus (AAF). This publication (which is currently published by Boyar’s Intrinsic Value Research LLC.) identifies and evaluates companies Mr. Boyar feels are intrinsically undervalued.
As a successful money manager and the publisher of AAF, Mr. Boyar is interviewed and quoted regularly in such publications as Barron’s, Business Week, Financial World, Forbes, Money Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, The International Herald Tribune, and The New York Times. He has also appeared numerous times on the CNBC television network, and was a guest on Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser.
Mr. Boyar speaks frequently on the valuation of corporate assets as well as on stock selection. He has spoken at the Cleveland and Milwaukee Societies of Security Analysts, the Chase Exchange, the SIRE Club, the Ceil Walzer Memorial Lecture Series at The New School for Social Research, The Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, Inc., Annual Investment Conference, and The New York Bankers Association among others. He also taught a course on mergers and acquisitions at The New School for Social Research.
Before coming to Wall Street, Mr. Boyar was employed on the audit staff of Price-Waterhouse. He earned a B.S. degree from C.W. Post College of Long Island University in June 1968, and attended Suffolk University Law School in Boston, Massachusetts. Since 1970, he has been a member of the New York Society of Security Analysts and the Federation of Financial Analysts.
Mark Boyar is a Trustee of Long Island University, was formerly Chairman of its Investment Committee and currently sits on that Committee, which has sole responsibility for selecting investment advisors that manage the University’s Endowment.

Dear Boyar Value Fund Shareholder:

Performance Results

Following a year of broad based upside across all ten sectors of the S&P 500, 2007’s leadership again returned to a narrow few with Energy (+32.4%), Basic Materials (+19.98%), Utilities (+15.8%) and Information Technology (+15.5%) providing the vast majority of the gains.  If one eliminated the contribution from just Energy and Materials the index would have declined by –0.22%.  If you eliminated all four sectors cited above the S&P 500 would have declined by –4.49%.  The Boyar Value Fund’s negative relative and absolute performance (-4.7%) partially stems from very limited exposure to those sectors.

The best performing index in the United States in 2007 had the worst record in 2006.  The NASDAQ posted a 9.8% advance however, just 3 stocks - Apple, Google and Research in Motion were responsible for the vast majority of the gain.  The Russell 2000, an index consisting of only small companies lost 1.6% for the year.

As we came into 2007 we had modest expectations for the year and felt that some portion of the Fund’s +19.27% outsized gains could detract from 2007’s results.

While we were fully cognizant of the festering housing problems, we underestimated the negative reverberations the meltdown would cause the financial sector.  Financial service stocks led the market lower and finished the year as the worst performing group declining by 20.8%.  Two of the Fund’s financial holdings performed dismally Citigroup (-46.0%) and Merrill Lynch (-42.3%) and in the aggregate were responsible for a significant portion of the fund’s decline.

Also negatively impacting the portfolio’s 2007 performance were media stocks, which provided superior performance during the prior year.  The rise in oil prices and recession fears adversely affected some of our retail holdings such as The Limited and The Home Depot.

On the positive side three companies that The Boyar Value Fund owned were acquired.  Dow Jones advanced 41% during 2007 and Hilton Hotels gained 29.8%, while Alltel rose 13.0%.  Our best performer was the NASDAQ, a relatively new holding which advanced by 67.5%, followed by PepsiAmericas +57.9%, a company we have held for a number of years.
 

Bill Miller, Legg Mason Value Trust’s chief portfolio manager quite aptly described last year’s stock market “as being remarkable serially correlated - what has gone up keeps going up, and what has not does not.  Valuation has not mattered at all, what has mattered is price momentum.  This is very similar to what we saw with Tech, Telecom and Internet names in 1999”.  Today’s valuations are not nearly as stretched as they were during the dot.com bubbles, but they are fast approaching those levels.  Google, Apple and Research in Motion might be wonderful businesses, but are they great stocks?

Purchasing a great company at a grossly inflated valuation can empty your wallet, especially if you repeat the process enough times.  Remember, successful investing entails two equally important decisions: 1) Stocks selection, and 2) Valuation.
 
 

Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 



*Calculated without the maximum sales charge of 5.00%.

A Look Ahead

Stock market leadership normally shifts quite dramatically in the year following large spikes in volatility such as we witnessed last year.  

So where will the new leadership come from?  The same place it usually does:  The old laggards.  It is quite possible the New Leadership will be U.S. Large Cap Dollar Based and grow to encompass what no one wants to own today, especially Financials, Housing, Media, and Consumer Discretionary names.

With the benefit of hindsight the right investment decision in 2002 was to purchase what investors despised the most.  In all likelihood the greatest gains during the next five years will be made in those securities people are most panicked about today.

At this moment, fear dominates the pricing of housing stocks, of mortgage related securities, of financials and of many consumer stocks, as well as housing related issues.  Confidence and optimism are elevated when it comes to energy, material, industrials and non-U.S. stocks, especially those of Emerging Markets and China in particular.

The leading indices are not indicative of the carnage that has occurred in particular sectors.  There are a large number of good businesses that have declined by 50% or more during the past year.  

Every decade or so, rare investment opportunities emerge because of panic and fear…We believe this could prove to be such a period.

In February 1991 Prince Alwaleed announced his $590 million Citigroup investment.  By year-end 1991 Citigroup’s shares and Alwaleed’s investment declined more than 40% from their February highs.  Any investor who followed Alwaleed and remained patient was richly rewarded, however, as Citi’s shares peaked at $178 per share in July 1998 prior to Citi’s merger with Travelers Group in October of that year, a gain of more than 10 times on the original investment.

While it is foolhardy to predict where the leading stock market indices will be during the short-term, our work indicates that an unusually wide disparity currently exists between the current market value and the intrinsic or private market value in a large number of businesses we follow…
Some Additional Thoughts About 2008 
A) The great recession obsession – Can it happen?
It is certainly a possibility. Since World War II, there have been 10 of them, or one every six years. On average they have lasted 10 months. Recessions also have often-overlooked benefits – they dampen inflation. In weak markets, companies cannot easily raise prices or workers’ wages. Similarly, recessions punish reckless financial speculation and poor corporate investments. Today a U.S. recession might also reverse the upward spiral of oil prices and trigger a faster and healthier drop in home prices. … It is quite clear that the slow decline in prices prolongs the housing slump because it induces would-be buyers to wait for more attractive deals. By making homes more affordable, a quick and sharp price drop might revive housing more rapidly.
B) Oil has been a great trade for the last five years …
Energy stocks have been market leaders for four out of the last five years, and during that time the price of crude oil has advanced materially without any meaningful correction. How long this can go on is anybody’s guess, but of late there has been an increasing amount of chatter about how much crude is in the hands of speculators, particularly hedge funds. 
As one alternative play after another went sour during the summer and fall, a huge amount of money has flowed into the oil futures and options markets. (The same traders are most certainly also shorting the dollar.) Recent figures tallied by International Strategy and Investment Group show the average daily trading volume of crude oil and products futures at more than 1 billion barrels – compared to world demand of 86 million barrels a day. This is unprecedented. 
Without this unusual amount of speculation, and innumerable articles about the vanishing supplies of oil and the upsurge of consumption in China and India, oil would most probably be selling at a significantly lower valuation.
C) A dollar rally? 
Purely on a purchasing power parity basis the dollar is vastly undervalued … the U.S. is on sale. Private equity funds are being replaced by sovereign funds, and foreigners are becoming the primary acquirers of U.S. businesses. With their currencies advancing by as much as 40% in 2007 versus the dollar, and a good number of U.S. listed businesses declining by a like amount, merger & acquisition activity driven by these foreign entities could accelerate in 2008 if the dollar remains depressed.
D) Housing market improvement?
The U.S. housing market could get somewhat better towards the end of 2008, as home prices continue their decline and begin to reflect realistic valuations. As we have been saying for more than two years, the housing glut is a valuation problem, similar to the dot.com dilemma, and won’t get better until valuations recede materially.
The tortoise – not the hare – is invariably the winner 
For value investors, short-term performance can be quite deceiving.  Those who placed $10,000 with the fund manager Sir John Templeton in 1954 saw their money grow to $632,000 by 1985.  But during those 31 years, Templeton failed to outperform the Standard & Poor’s Index approximately 40% of the time. Charles Munger, Vice Chairman of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, at one point in his money management career, trailed the market for four out of five years.  Over a 13-year period, however, he attained a compound annual rate of return of 19.8% versus only 5% for the S&P Index.

It is not unusual for the accounts managed by Boyar Asset Management to under perform the leading indices for multiple years.  For example, during the technology craze of the late 1990’s we significantly underperformed the market because we had zero exposure to that sector, and felt a collapse was inevitable. During the following five years, however, Boyar materially outdistanced the S&P 500 and more than made up for its previous lackluster performance.
Our performance during the recent past has not measured up to the S&P 500.  The majority of the underperformance can be attributable to the lack of exposure to cyclical stocks, particularly energy and basic materials.  We have rarely bought a stock whose business is commodity based.  We believe it is very difficult for an investor to consistently make money in this sector over a prolonged time frame.
Our mission is to make money for our clients over extended time frames.  Under no circumstance will we chase short term performance and invest in the fad of the moment!
As Warren Buffett so aptly put it, “we can’t promise you investment results, but you have our word we will not deviate from an investment style that has worked so well for years.”

The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results, and except where noted as after taxes, does not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. Consequently, an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. To obtain performance information current to the most recent month end, please call 1-800-266-5566.

The Boyar Value Fund has a maximum sales charge of 5.00%. After-tax returns are calculated using the highest historical individual Federal income tax rate and do not reflect the additional impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant for shareholders who hold Fund shares in tax-deferred accounts or to shares held by non-taxable entities. The Fund may invest in stocks of several different capitalization levels and it is important to note that historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have experienced greater volatility than stocks of larger, more established companies. Additionally, value-based investments are subject to the risk that the broad market may not recognize their intrinsic value.

The S&P 500 Index (“S&P 500”) is an unmanaged capitalization weighted index of 500 stocks designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of the 500 stocks representing all major industries.

The Russell 2000 Index (“Russell 2000”) measures the performance of the 2,000 smallest companies in the Russell 3000 Index, which represents approximately 8% of the total market capitalization of the Russell 3000 Index.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (“Dow Jones”) is a price-weighted average based on the price-only performance of 30 blue chip stocks (the average is computed by adding the prices of the 30 stocks and dividing by a denominator, which has been adjusted over the years for stock splits, stock dividends and substitutions of stocks). 

The NASDAQ Composite Index (“NASDAQ”) is a market price only index that tracks the performance of domestic common stocks traded on the regular NASDAQ market as well as National Markets System traded foreign common stocks and American Depositary Receipts.

The performance of the indices includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, however, it does not include any expenses or a deduction for Federal income taxes. A shareholder cannot invest in an index.     

The total annual operating expense ratio for the Boyar Value Fund (before fee waivers/expense reimbursements) as stated in the fee table in the Fund’s prospectus dated May 1, 2007 was 2.17%.  The net annual operating expense ratio (after fee waivers/expense reimbursement) was 1.76% for the same period.  [An updated total annual operating expenses figure will appear in the Fund’s next prospectus update.  This figure will be derived from financial highlight table presented in this report.]  


Comparison of the Change in Value of a $10,000 Investment



The Chart above represents historical performance of a hypothetical investment of $10,000 in the Boyar Value Fund from inception.   The performance of the Fund includes the reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains and has been adjusted for the maximum applicable sales charge of 5.00%.   The performance of the chart does not reflect the deduction of taxes.

Portfolio Diversification By Sector (as of December 31, 2007)
(as a percentage of total net assets)
(Unaudited)



The composition of the Fund’s portfolio is subject to change.
            
It’s not what you make; it’s what you keep – Taxes are potentially the biggest expense an individual mutual fund investor will experience.

§
By holding stocks for long periods of time, you postpone paying taxes, which positively impacts long-term returns.
§
Buying and holding stocks for long periods may sound stodgy, but it postpones the payment of capital gains taxes with the added positive effects on the compounding rate. Since profit taking involves transactions, it obliges you to take the IRS in as a partner. With profits not taken, there is a future tax liability, but all the money is still working for its owner. No transactions, no tax.
§
The Boyar Value Fund believes that holding stocks for long periods of time is the best way for an individual investor to create wealth.
As you can see from the chart below, our buy and hold philosophy has enabled the fund to produce after tax returns that pretty much mirror our pre-tax returns. The returns used in the illustration exclude loads, but are inclusive of all fees, and assumes the highest rates when calculating after tax returns.

Boyar Value Fund Philosophy Goals

§
The Boyar Value Fund tends to buy the common shares of publicly traded businesses that are selling in the market place at significant discounts to our estimate of their intrinsic or private market value. We will not, and never have, invested in fads or gimmicks such as the Internet.
§
Furthermore, quite a few of the businesses that we invest in are either not widely followed by the majority of Wall Street brokerage houses or may have plummeted in value because they failed to meet analysts’ earnings expectations.
§
Purchasing out of favor companies may inhibit short-term performance, since it may take some time for these companies to right themselves. On the other hand, we believe that it does create a “margin of safety,” since most of these businesses have plunged in value by such a margin that most of the downside risk has been significantly reduced.
§
Over an investment time horizon of three to five years, it is our hope that these undervalued corporations will be re-evaluated upward by the stock market or the assets of the businesses may be acquired by a third party.
§
A long-term orientation may sound stodgy, but it is as important to investment success as picking the right stocks and buying them at the right price and at the right time. Holding the equity of good companies purchased at bargain prices allows compounding to work its magic without the return-eroding effects of commissions and capital gains taxes.
We thank you for your support and wish you a happy, healthy, prosperous and peaceful New Year.
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call (212) 995-8300.

                                                        Very truly yours,

BOYAR VALUE FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2007
1.
ORGANIZATION

Boyar Value Fund, Inc. (the “Fund”) was incorporated on February 28, 1997 under the laws of the State of Maryland and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as an open-end, diversified management investment company.   The Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation, which it pursues by investing primarily in equity securities of companies that are believed by the Fund’s Investment Advisor to be intrinsically undervalued.

Under the Fund’s organizational documents, its officers and directors are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the Fund. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts with its vendors and others that provide for general indemnifications. The Fund’s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund. However, based on experience, the Fund expects that risk of loss to be remote.

2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Fund in preparation of its financial statements.  The policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.A. (“GAAP”). 

Securities valuation – Securities listed on an exchange are valued at the last reported sale price at the close of the regular trading session of the exchange on the business day as of which such value is being determined and securities listed on NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price (“NOCP”).  If there has been no sale on such day, the security is valued at the mean of the last quoted bid and asked prices.  If no bid or asked prices are quoted or if the Advisor believes the market quotations are not reflective of market value, then the security is valued at a fair value determined in accordance with the Pricing and Valuation Guidelines approved by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). Short-term debt obligations having 60 days or less remaining until maturity, at time of purchase, are valued at amortized cost. Investments in open-end investment companies are valued at net asset value.

In September of 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurement” (“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Fund believes the adoption of SFAS 157 will have no material impact on its financial statements.   However, additional disclosures may be required about the inputs used to develop the measurements and the effect of certain of the measurements reported on the statement of changes in net assets for a fiscal period.

BOYAR VALUE FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
December 31, 2007

Security transactions and related income – Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis.  Discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized on securities purchased over the lives of the respective securities. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Realized gains or losses from sales of securities are determined by comparing the identified cost of the security lot sold with the net sales proceeds. 

Dividends and distributions to shareholders – Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid annually. Distributable net realized capital gains, if any, are declared and distributed annually.

Dividends from net investment income and distributions from net realized gains are determined in accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP. These “book/tax” differences are considered either temporary (i.e., deferred losses, capital loss carry forwards) or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the composition of net assets based on their federal tax-basis treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification.

Federal income tax – It is the Fund’s policy to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by complying with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income and net realized gains to shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.

On July 13, 2006, FASB released FASB Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes’ (“FIN 48”).  FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements.  FIN 48 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Fund’s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained by the applicable tax authority.  Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year.  The adoption of FIN 48 had no impact on the Fund’s net assets or results of operations. 

Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

The business activities of the Fund are supervised by the Board, which is responsible for the overall management of the Fund. Ladenburg Thalmann Fund Management LLC serves as the Fund’s manager (the “Manager”). Boyar Asset Management, Inc. (the “Advisor”) provides continuous advisory services to the Fund, and Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (the “Distributor”) acts as distributor of the Fund’s shares. The Fund has employed Gemini Fund Services, LLC (“GFS”) to provide administration, fund accounting, and transfer agent services. Certain Directors and officers of the Fund are also officers of the Manager, Advisor or GFS, and are not paid any fees directly by the Fund for serving in such capacities.

Pursuant to a Management Agreement with the Fund, the Manager, under the supervision of the Board, oversees the daily operations of the Fund and supervises the performance of administrative and professional services provided by others, including the Advisor.  As compensation for its services and the related expenses borne by the Manager, the Fund pays the Manager a management fee, computed and accrued daily and paid monthly, at an annual rate of 0.50% of the Fund’s average daily net assets.

Pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement among the Manager, the Advisor and the Fund, the Advisor agrees to furnish continuous investment advisory services to the Fund.  For these services, the Fund pays the Advisor an investment advisory fee, which is computed and accrued daily and paid monthly, at an annual rate of 0.50% of the Fund’s average daily net assets.

Pursuant to a written contract, the Manager, the Advisor and the Distributor have agreed, until April 30, 2008, to waive a portion of their respective management fee, advisory fee and amounts, if any, payable to the Distributor pursuant to the Fund’s 12b-1 Plan (see below), and the Manager has agreed to reimburse the Fund for other expenses to the extent necessary so that the total expenses incurred by the Fund (excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, other expenditures which are capitalized in accordance with GAAP, and other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the Fund’s business) do not exceed 1.75% per annum of the Fund’s average daily net assets.  During the term of this Agreement, to the extent that Operating Expenses incurred by the Fund in any fiscal year after waiver of advisory fees of the Advisor, management fees of the Manager and fees payable to the Distributor ("Rule 12b-1 fees") exceed 1.75% per annum of the Fund's average daily net assets, such excess amount shall be the liability of the Manager. To the extent Operating Expenses in any fiscal year do not exceed 1.75% per annum of the Fund's average daily net assets, the management fee, advisory fee and Rule 12b-1 fees shall be payable by the Fund in the following order: 

BOYAR VALUE FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
December 31, 2007

o
first, the Distributor shall be entitled to receive the Rule 12b-1 fees up to the amount payable under the Fund's 12b-1 Plan; and 

o
thereafter, the Manager and the Advisor shall each be entitled to receive a proportionate amount of their respective management fee and advisory fee up to the amounts payable under the Management Agreement or the Advisory Agreement, as applicable. 

If the Manager, the Advisor or the Distributor waives any fee or reimburses any expense pursuant to this Agreement, and the Fund's Operating Expenses are subsequently less than 1.75% of average daily net assets, the Manager, the Advisor and the Distributor shall be entitled to reimbursement by the Fund for such waived fees or reimbursed expenses provided that such reimbursement does not cause the Fund's expenses to exceed 1.75% of average daily net assets. If Fund Operating Expenses subsequently exceed 1.75% per annum of the Fund's average daily net assets, the reimbursements shall be suspended. The Advisor, the Manager and the Distributor may each seek reimbursement only for expenses waived or paid by it during the two fiscal years prior to such reimbursement; provided, however, that such expenses may only be reimbursed hereunder to the extent they were waived or paid after the date of this Agreement (or any similar agreement). This Agreement may be continued from year to year thereafter provided each such continuance is specifically approved by the Fund, the Advisor, the Manager and the Distributor, including with respect to the Fund a majority of the non-interested Directors of the Fund; provided, however, that no party shall be obligated to extend the term of this Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate automatically with respect to the Fund and to the Advisor, the Manager or the Distributor upon the termination of the Advisory Agreement, the Management Agreement or the 12b-1 Plan, respectively. 

As of December 31, 2007, the Manager, the Advisor, and the Distributor have the following amounts of waived/reimbursed expenses that may be recovered:

Amount

6.   DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS AND TAX COMPONENTS OF CAPITAL

The tax character of fund distributions for the following periods was as follows:
 

 
The difference between book basis and tax basis character of distributions as of December 31, 2007 is attributable to the reclass of short-term capital gains to ordinary income.

As of December 31, 2007, the components of accumulated earnings/(deficit) on a tax basis were as follows:
 
                
 
The difference between book basis and tax basis unrealized appreciation is attributable to the tax deferral of losses on wash sales.

Capital losses incurred after October 31 within the Fund’s fiscal year are deemed to arise on the first business day of the following fiscal year for tax purposes.   The Fund incurred and elected to defer $239,685 of such capital losses.

Permanent book and tax differences resulted in reclassification for the period ended December 31, 2007 as follows: a decrease in paid-in capital of $14,422, an increase in undistributed net investment income/(loss) of $8,461 and an increase in accumulated net realized gain/(loss) from security transactions of $5,961.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors of 
Boyar Value Fund, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of the Boyar Value Fund, Inc., including the portfolio of investments, as of December 31, 2007, and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statement of changes in net assets for each of the years in the two year period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the years in the three year period then ended.  These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.  The financial highlights for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2004 were audited by other auditors whose report dated February 2, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on such financial highlights.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2007 by correspondence with the custodian.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Boyar Value Fund, Inc. as of December 31, 2007, the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the years in the two year period then ended and its financial highlights for each of the years in the three year period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

BOYAR VALUE FUND, INC.
EXPENSE EXAMPLES
December 31, 2007
 (Unaudited)



As a shareholder of the Boyar Value Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction costs, including sales charges (loads) on purchases; and redemption fees; (2) ongoing costs, including management fees and distribution fees; and other Fund expenses.  This example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Boyar Value Fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.

The example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period from July 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007.

Actual Expenses

The “Actual Expenses” line in the table below provides information about actual account values and actual expenses.  You may use the information below, together with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the table under the heading entitled “Expenses Paid During Period” to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period.

Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes

The “Hypothetical” line in the table below provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Boyar Value Fund’s actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Fund’s actual return.  The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balances or expenses you paid for the period. You may use this information to compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of other funds.

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales charges (loads), or redemption fees.  Therefore, the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds.  In addition, if these transactional costs were included, your costs would have been higher.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 
December 31, 2007 (Unaudited)



FACTORS CONSIDERED BY THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS IN APPROVING THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND THE ADVISORY AGREEMENT

The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) requires the Fund’s Board of Directors, including a majority of Directors who are not interested persons of the Fund, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act (the “Independent Directors”), annually to consider the Investment Advisory Agreement between the Fund and the Adviser and the Management Agreement between the Fund and the Manager.  As required by the 1940 Act, the Board requested and each of the Adviser and the Manager provided such information as the Board deemed to be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the Agreements.  At meetings held throughout the year, including the meeting specifically focused upon the review of the Agreements held on November 13, 2007, the Independent Directors met in executive sessions separately from the non-Independent Director of the Fund and any officers of the Adviser and the Manager.  In selecting the Adviser and the Manager and approving the continuance of the Agreements, the Independent Directors were informed that they are authorized to engage such experts as they consider appropriate, including counsel to the Independent Directors.  In this respect, the Independent Directors relied upon comparative fee and expense information produced by Lipper Inc., an independent evaluation service (“Lipper”). 

Both in the meeting that specifically addressed the approval of the Agreements and at other meetings held during the course of the year, the Board, including the Independent Directors, received materials relating to the Adviser’s investment services under the Investment Advisory Agreement.  These materials included information on (i) the investment performance of the Fund over various periods of time compared to the performance of a peer group of funds consisting of the Fund and other multi-cap value funds (“Performance Universe”), as classified by Lipper, and to the Fund’s benchmark index; (ii) sales and redemption data with respect to the Fund; (iii) the general investment outlook in the markets in which the Fund invests; (iv) arrangements with respect to the distribution of the Fund’s shares; (v) the allocation of the Fund’s brokerage to Mark Boyar & Company, Inc., an affiliate of the Adviser; and (vi) the overall nature, quality and extent of services provided by the Adviser and the Manager.

As part of the review of the continuance of the Agreements, the Board requested, and the Adviser and Manager each provided, additional information in order to evaluate the quality of their services and the reasonableness of their fees under the Agreements.  In a separate executive session, the Independent Directors engaged in an extensive review of information, which included data comparing: (i) the Fund’s advisory and management fees, 12b-1 fees, and other non-management fees, to those incurred by the Performance Universe; (ii) the Fund’s average expense ratio to those of its Performance Universe (both before and after waivers); (iii) the Fund’s investment performance over various time periods to the average performance of the Performance Universe and the Fund’s benchmark index; (iv) the Adviser’s financial results and condition, including an oral discussion of the Adviser’s and the Manager’s and their respective affiliates’ profitability from the services that have been performed for the Fund; (v) the Fund’s current investment management staffing; and (vi) the Fund’s potential for achieving economies of scale.  In support of its review of the statistical information, the Board was provided with a description of the methodology used by Lipper to determine the Performance Universe to prepare its information.

The following summarizes matters considered by the Board in connection with its renewal of the Agreement.  However, the Board did not identify any single factor as all-important or controlling, and the summary does not detail all the matters that were considered. 

Investment Performance.  The Board reviewed the Fund’s overall investment performance and compared it to its Performance Universe and the Fund’s benchmark index.  The Board noted that the Fund’s performance for the one-year, three-year, five-year and ten-year periods ended September 30, 2007 was below the performance of the Performance Universe average and, while it was below its benchmark index for the shorter time periods, the Fund’s performance was above the performance of its benchmark index for the longer time periods.  The Independent Directors expressed their desire that Mr. Boyar continue to manage the Fund using the same value style that he has consistently applied during his career.
Personnel and Methods.  The Board reviewed the background of Mr. Boyar, the portfolio manager responsible for the daily management of the Fund’s portfolio since the Fund’s inception, achieving the Fund’s investment objective and adhering to the Fund’s investment strategy.  The Independent Directors also engaged in discussions with Mr. Boyar and his staff who are responsible for assisting Mr. Boyar in the overall functioning of the Adviser, and Ladenburg and members of its staff who are responsible for the overall functioning of the Fund’s Manager.  Based on this review, the Board concluded that the Fund’s management team and the Adviser’s and the Manager’s overall resources were well developed and that the Adviser in particular had investment management capabilities and personnel essential to performing its duties under the Investment Advisory Agreement.  The Board noted the favorable history, reputation, qualifications and background of the Adviser, as well as the qualifications of its personnel.  
Fees and Expenses. The Board considered the Adviser’s and the Manager’s fees under the Agreements relative to the management fees charged by the Fund’s Performance Universe averages.  The Board noted that the Fund has a higher overall expense ratio than its peers, and relatively high combined management/advisory fee rates, but stated that many of the peer funds were part of significantly larger fund complexes that could spread fixed costs over a larger asset base.  The Board also noted that the Adviser typically charges its other clients an advisory fee at a rate higher than the Fund’s gross advisory fee rate and significantly higher than the net advisory fee rate that the Adviser receives from the Fund after giving affect to the fee waiver.   The Board noted that the Fund’s overall expense ratio (before giving effect to the expense limitation) had declined since the prior year.  With respect to profitability, the Board viewed favorably that the Adviser, the Manager and the Fund’s distributor have since the Fund’s inception voluntarily agreed to waive their fees and to reimburse the Fund’s expenses in order to keep the Fund’s net total operating expenses (excluding extraordinary expenses and taxes) at 1.75% of the Fund’s average daily net assets.  The Board noted that this voluntary fee waiver is currently in place, although it can be discontinued at any time.  The Board understood that, after giving affect to the fee waiver, the Adviser and the Manager were able to receive a portion of their respective advisory/management fees from the Fund.  Based on these factors, the Board determined that the Fund’s advisory and management fee rates under the Agreements do not constitute fees that are so disproportionately large as to bear no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and that could not have been the product of arm’s-length bargaining, and concluded that the advisory and management fee rates under the Agreement are fair and reasonable.
Nature and Quality of Other Services.  The Board considered the nature, quality, cost and extent of other services provided by the Adviser, the Manager and their respective affiliates, including Mark Boyar & Company for executing securities transactions and Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. as the Fund’s principal underwriter.  At meetings held throughout the year, the Board reviewed the effectiveness of the Adviser’s and the Fund’s overall compliance programs.  The Board also reviewed the services provided by the Adviser and the Manager in supervising the Fund’s third party service providers.  Based on this review, the Board concluded that the nature, quality, cost and extent of such other services provided by the Adviser and the Manager and their respective affiliate were satisfactory, reliable and beneficial to the Fund’s shareholders.
Other Benefits.  The Board also considered the character and amount of other direct and incidental benefits received by the Adviser, the Manager and their respective affiliates from their association with the Fund.  The Board concluded that potential “fall-out” benefits that they may receive, such as greater name recognition and the small amount of brokerage fees, appear to be reasonable, and may in some cases benefit the Fund.
Economies of Scale.  The Board noted that, given the current and anticipated size of the Fund, any perceived and potential economies of scale were not yet a relevant consideration for the Fund and the addition of break points was determined not to be necessary at this time.
Conclusion.  Based on the Board’s deliberations and its evaluation of the information described above, the Board, including the Independent Directors, concluded that:  (a) it was appropriate to continue to retain the Adviser and the Manager; (b) the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Management Agreement (including the fees thereunder) are fair and reasonable; and (c) the Fund’s Investment Advisory Agreement and Management Agreement each should continue for a one-year period.

The Morningstar Category is shown next to the Morningstar Style Box which identifies a fund's investment focus, based on the underlying securities in the fund.Morningstar CategoryWhile the investment objective stated in a fund's prospectus may or may not reflect how the fund actually invests, the Morningstar category is assigned based on the underlying securities in each portfolio. Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk, and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. If the fund is new and has no portfolio history, we estimate where it will fall before giving it a more permanent category assignment.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

2 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 2 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1223 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund's expenses are rated as High because they are above the 80th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks long-term capital appreciation.




Strategy



Under normal market conditions, the fund invests primarily in equity securities that are believed by the Adviser to be intrinsically undervalued. Intrinsic value, as the Adviser defines it, is the estimated current worth that would accrue to the stockholders of a company, either through liquidation of corporate assets upon termination of operations, or through the sale or merger of the entire enterprise as a continuing business.


Risk



Value and growth stocks can perform differently from other types of stocks. Growth stocks can be more volatile. Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average

This fund scores Below Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
10. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 4/30/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.

Five years later he liquidated the fund at a premium to net asset value. In May 1998, Mr. Boyar launched his first mutual fund, The Boyar Value Fund (BOYAX). In addition, Mr. Boyar has published a monthly research report since 1975 entitled Asset Analysis Focus (AAF).

Mr. Boyar speaks frequently on the valuation of corporate assets as well as on stock selection. He has spoken at the Cleveland and Milwaukee Societies of Security Analysts, the Chase Exchange, the SIRE Club, the Ceil Walzer Memorial Lecture Series at The New School for Social Research, The Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, Inc., Annual Investment Conference, and The New York Bankers Association among others. He also taught a course on mergers and acquisitions at The New School for Social Research.
Before coming to Wall Street, Mr. Boyar was employed on the audit staff of Price-Waterhouse. He earned a B.S. degree from C.W. Post College of Long Island University in June 1968, and attended Suffolk University Law School in Boston, Massachusetts.
