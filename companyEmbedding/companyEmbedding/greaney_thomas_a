Synopsis




This abridged edition continues to use the broad organization that health law teachers and students found so helpful in the last six editions. Notes material has been trimmed substantially and some cases and sections of the primary casebook have been deleted. The authors’ goal was to create a book better suited for schools that have curricular space for only one course, including medical schools and schools of public health.
"synopsis" may belong to another edition of this title.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREHealth Lawby Furrow, Barry/ Johnson, Sandra/ Jost, Timothy/ Greaney, ThomasExpert authors present an up-to-date overview of health law as it affects the professionals, institutions, and entities that deliver and finance health care in the United States. Considers the law's response to quality and error through institutional and professional regulation, and malpractice litigation against professionals, hospitals, and managed care organizations. Surveys tax, corporate, and organizational issues. Explores the government's efforts to control costs and expand access through Medicare and Medicaid. Examines government attempts to police anticompetitive activities, fraud, and abuse. And considers the legal and ethical issues involving death, human reproduction, medical treatment decision making, and medical research. TheAffordable Care Act, HIPAA, HITECH, and other new statutory and regulatory changes of the past few years are thoroughly incorporated in all aspects of the legal discussion.HealthCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
