A $45 Million Company Worth $0: Endeavor IP, Inc. - Endeavor IP, Inc. (OTCMKTS:ENIP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»A $45 Million Company Worth $0: Endeavor IP, Inc.Nov.13.13 | About: Endeavor IP, (ENIP) Penny Stock Realist Short onlyPenny Stock RealistEndeavor IP, Inc. (OTCQB:ENIP) is a name that I believe is currently the target of a penny-stock promotion scheme. It is my view that the stock's intrinsic value is somewhere near $0, and it is with conviction that I recommend that any investors currently in the name sell the entirety of their stakes immediately. I also believe that Endeavor IP, Inc. is a stock definitely worth shorting. My track record of identifying and publicly exposing such highly overvalued equities is excellent:

Company Background
Endeavor IP, Inc. is an intellectual property services and patent licensing company that is engaged in the acquisition and licensing of intellectual property. Endeavor is based in Half Moon Bay, CA.http://www.enip.com.
Little Revenue. Debts. Bright Future?
As is usually the case with these types of hyped up scams, it takes only one quick glance at the balance sheet to realize that the $45M+ market capitalization that this equity commands is beyond ludicrous. With 100k in unaudited revenues in the most recent quarter and $450,000 in cash on hand. Net loss of $262,292 in recent quarter is clear they are not going in the right direction. They really can't keep operating like they are and it is my suspicion that the purpose of this company is not to succeed but to sell stock. The recent volume is due to overly bullish promotional mailers being delivered to people's homes.
Endeavor IP, Inc. follows the typical pattern most shells do that end up getting promoted.
#1) Business taken public with no revenues.
#2) Seed shareholders given shares for next to nothing
#3) Change in control
#4) Name and symbol change
#5) Forward split while all the shares were insider owned
Let's focus on what's important if you go through it all you come to a final share count reads as follows.

Authorized 200,000,000 shares
Outstanding 42,800,002 shares
Cameron Gray 133,334 shares
Solud Solar Energy Inc. 666,666 shares
Seed Shareholders 42,000,000 free trading shares at $.0007 per share
The most important thing are those nearly 42 million free trading shares. Most companies that end up being promoted usually tend to have little to no trading history. Endeavor IP, Inc. is the same. Those seed shareholders cannot turn their shares into cash unless there are buyers. This is where they turn to stock promoters. Stock promoters get paid to send out overly bullish professional type mailers/emails to retail investors to lure them in. Let me show you what I mean:
Picture of ENIP chart
You can see that trading in Endeavor IP, Inc. really started on October 16, 2013. Michael Goode blogged about a Endeavor IP, Inc. landing page that went up on the same exact date. Coincidence? Absolutely not.


"Compensation: A one million dollar investor relations budget is being managed by C America Marketing."
You can see obviously someone is interested in increasing public awareness for Endeavor IP, Inc. Most likely those seed shareholders with about 42 million free trading shares (who knows who owns what). Why else would someone spend $1,000,000 to increase public awareness? It is worth it to them because if they can bring in buyers and liquidate their shares around these prices that can mean about $40 million in profits! Running pump and dump schemes is a lucrative business and that is why we see it way to often. My job is to wake you up! This is not the first Financier Times first promotion either!

Email Promotions
If you sign up to BillionaireStocks you will notice they promote the same stocks as the financier times. I believe its the same people. I have not received ENIP emails from them yet but they tend to start sending emails mid way through the promotion so be on the look out for that.
You can see the emails I have received from them below.

SANB email disclaimer
NHUR email disclaimer


I believe they will promote Endeavor IP, Inc. next.
My Recommendation
I believe Endeavor IP, Inc will act like the past two Financier Times stock promotions. If you own shares of this company, GET OUT NOW. Do not hope that you can hang on to sell them to a greater fool. These shares are worthless. I have showed you that the reason for the promotional mailers indicates that the individuals behind this stock scam are trying desperately to unload their worthless shares onto the unsuspecting public and book a huge profit before the inevitable collapse. If you are a more sophisticated investor and can get a borrow on these shares, then I believe that shorting this name will be highly lucrative for you.
Remember I warned you. Good Luck.
I contacted them through their contact page. I have yet to receive a response regarding my concerns that Endeavor IP, Inc may have been set up purporsely to sell stock to enrich a few people.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree
