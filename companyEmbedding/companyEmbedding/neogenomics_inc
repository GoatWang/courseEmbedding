        CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREA growing Fort Myers-based medical services business will release its second-quarter earnings results Tuesday — and the results could be interesting.Much has happened since NeoGenomics’ last earnings release in April. The provider of cancer-focused genetic testing services landed a nice government contract and expanded its testing menu.The company’s stock (NEO) was trading about $9.24 early last week, near its 52-week high of $9.88. It closed Friday at $9.11, down 4 cents.NeoGenomics earlier this month garnered a $1.67 million federal contract from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for medical services.It announced in June an expansion of its immune-oncology profiling test menu. The move reflects recent advances in immunotherapy — the prevention or treatment of disease with substances that stimulate the immune response.Immunotherapy has changed cancer treatment, providing benefits across a range of diseases once considered untreatable and extending the lives of patients.NeoGenomics also expanded its cancer profiles to include tumor mutation burden, a new genomic biomarker. It also added microsatellite instability testing in response to the FDA’s announcement in May that Merck’s Keytruda drug was approved for the treatment of patients with certain metastatic solid tumors.Keytruda is a cancer medicine that interferes with the growth and spread of cancer cells in the body.“Despite the significant success of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, not all patients respond to therapy and there is a need to identify the subset of patients that are more likely to respond,” said Dr. Maher Albitar, senior vice president, chief medical officer and director of research and development, in a release.Melina Gomez, an employee of NeoGenomics, signs in specimens. (Photo: The News-Press file photo)An important part of the immune system, according to the American Cancer Society, is its ability to tell between normal cells in the body and those it sees as “foreign.” This lets the immune system attack the foreign cells while leaving the normal cells alone. To do this, it uses “checkpoints” — molecules on certain immune cells that need to be activated (or inactivated) to start an immune response.Cancer cells sometimes find ways to use these checkpoints to avoid being attacked by the immune system. But drugs that target these checkpoints hold a lot of promise as cancer treatments.“NeoGenomics provides a broad range of cancer immuno-profiling tests … to more precisely determine which patients are good candidates for immunotherapy,” Albitar said.Adding tests as new drugs and advances come to the market allows NeoGenomics to stay on the cutting edge of testing services.“This timely expansion of our state-of-the-art testing services will help physicians better identify which patients will respond to new advanced immunotherapies,” said Douglas VanOort, NeoGenomics' chairman and CEO, in a release.VanOort called the FDA announcement “a major development in the fight against cancer.”“And it aligns well with our extensive menu of tests that examine cancer biomarkers,” he said. NeoGenomics in May announced the presentation of results of a new clinical trial demonstrating that the sensitivity of its liquid biopsy prostate test was 97 percent in predicting the presence of high grade prostate cancer, while the sensitivity of conventional biopsies in the study was 78 percent.The data, presented at the American Urological Association annual meeting, indicates that the NeoGenomics prostate test can be useful in determining which patients should enter into active surveillance programs.The concept of active surveillance, according to the Prostate Cancer Foundation, has increasingly emerged as a viable option for men who decide not to undergo immediate radical treatment.According to the American Cancer Society's “Cancer Facts and Figures 2017,” about 161,000 new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed annually, with about 27,000 deaths from prostate cancer occurring each year.Prostate biopsy testing is commonly used to determine the presence or absence of aggressive prostate cancer. However, it is well documented that conventional prostate biopsy testing is frequently inaccurate and not representative due to sampling errors.Looking ahead, NeoGenomics has its sights set on Europe.“We expect to open our new Geneva, Switzerland, lab facility by the end of Quarter 3, and we are starting to receive client interest for that facility to support European clinical trials,” VanOort said.NeoGenomics' pharma services division serves pharmaceutical clients in clinical trials and drug development. It operates labs in Fort Myers; Tampa; California; Texas; and Tennessee.Connect with this reporter: email clogan@news-press.com and follow on Twitter @caseyloAbout the companyName: NeoGenomics Inc.Based: Fort MyersTrades: On the Nasdaq as NEOFriday's close: $9.11, down 4 cents52-week range: $6.90 - $9.88 Valued at: Market capitalization of $719 million NeoGenomics up on mixed resultsNeoGenomics takes hit, but future brighter

Anatomic pathology testing is a superspeciality test. To perform this type of test, a person should have a qualified certification from a recognized body such as the American Board of Pathology or the American Osteopathic Board of Pathology.

Like clinical pathology reports, anatomic pathology reports also contain essential elements such as name, number, sample type, and source. Many anatomic pathology departments operate according to the specific need of a patient.
