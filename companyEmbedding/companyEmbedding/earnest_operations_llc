BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Earnest has received 4.34 out of 5 stars based on 4 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Benefits are very fair. For the most part everyone there's a good person.ConsAgree with most of the above negative comments. Probably an ok place to start right out of college, but past a certain point you're going to have to leave if you want any kind of career development. Poor management of expectations sometimes masquerades as "entrepreneurial," so you'd better be sure you have a realistic idea what you're going to achieve. Flat structure often confuses who is responsible when something goes wrong, which happens far too often given the firm's AUM. I was always amazed how out of touch managers, directors, and partners could be, especially since they normally sit a cubicle or two away.Advice to ManagementInvest in employees, we can't all be temp-to-perm.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) EARNEST Partners Response seconds agoEdit • Delete EARNEST Partners 2014-12-16 17:52 PST Dec 27, 2014 Helpful (5)"Never so glad to leave a job..."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookNo opinion of CEOProsSome of the people were nice. Beyond that, I have no positive experiences from working here.ConsDespite what one or two other reviews say, neither the pay nor the work/life balance were great, particularly given the level of work. I have never felt quite so undervalued in a job, particularly where I was working 12+ hour days.Levels of management vary from group-to-group - some groups had very little guidance from their manager (as another review says, this is labelled at the firm as "entrepreneurial", while others were micro-managed to the most ridiculous extent.Management protected certain employees for reasons little more than nepotism, and allowed them to get away with just about anything, while other employees were treated very poorly by those who were protected.Another former employee I still talk to recently described the atmosphere as "brutal". I don't disagree with that - expectations are unrealistically high of some people.Advice to ManagementInvest in your junior employees, and develop their skills. Don't practice nepotism in the workplace. More PTO would be nice, too.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (5) EARNEST Partners Response seconds agoEdit • Delete EARNEST Partners 2014-12-27 23:54 PST Oct 18, 2013"If you are willing to learn and go above and beyond, which we all should ....game on"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at EARNEST Partners full-time (More than 8 years)ProsCo. is small, entrepreneurial and dynamic.

Working hard doesn't get you rewards.Cons- Low Pay- Low Motivation- Very few advancement opportunities. Most people just come in for a year or two, or until they find another job. Only few departments, which all consist of "directors" are worth being in.. but most likely, you are better off working at a larger firm in Atlanta.- Company peddling same products. Even the investment/trading team has been turned into marketing (apologies... "product development") team. 100s of stocks, and only 10 people to keep track of all of them (actually, some "employees" are just listed on the website, very few people have actually seen them)? The company doesn't foresee what is going to happen to your investments in the future, it 'acts' after your investment have dropped. Which doesn't help customers.Advice to ManagementExpand! Offering same products for ever, while trying to cut costs, rarely helps companies grow. At some point, your clients will catch on that you're charging them the yearly .75% for stocks you've held for 10 years...Treat your employees right. The firm is small enough to be able to do 'team building' activities more often than once a year.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (4) EARNEST Partners Response seconds agoEdit • Delete EARNEST Partners 2013-02-07 08:55 PST Sep 27, 2010"cons and pros"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - AnalystFormer Employee - AnalystRecommendsProsgood environment to learn, good for entry levelConsco-workers are cold, do not communictae muchAdvice to Managementbe closer to your employees.

Disclaimers




The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.
Here’s what our math includes:

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

Earnest



















            About Us          




We believe many financially responsible people aren’t getting the credit they deserve. That’s why we strive to look more comprehensively at your financial profile, and offer the low rates and high quality service you’ve earned.


WHY WE STARTED EARNEST


We believe the fundamental role of banks and lenders is to help people realize their hopes and dreams. But we realized the financial system had forgotten this primary purpose, instead serving to enrich a privileged few. So we started Earnest to restore the trust that is sorely missing from the current system, and to build a modern financial institution that actually delivers on making clients’ lives better.


Whatever your ambition, we help get you there. We do low-cost lending to financially responsible people, and allow them to customize their repayment plan to fit their needs. We want to help our clients take control of their finances and realize their dreams—and in doing so create a relationship with them that lasts a lifetime.


WHO WE ARE
We are a skilled team of design, math, finance, and technology geeks who noticed a lack of trust in the financial system and decided to do something about it. We created a company that combines data science, streamlined design, and exceptional service to bring people a fast, low-cost, and hyper-personalized financial experience. Our mission is to make credit more accessible by reducing the costs and barriers faced by millions of financially responsible people.

OUR INVESTORS
We are lucky enough to have the confidence of some of the best investors in the world including industry leading venture capital firms and a small group of visionary angels.
























































Explore Earnest products





Personal Loans
Low-cost loans for qualified borrowers up to $50,000. Fixed rates from 5.25% APR with autopay.





Refinance Student Loans
Clients who consolidate & refi save $21,810 on average. Variable rates start at 2.79% APR with autopay.





Parent PLUS Refinancing
Personalized payment plans for extra savings. Variable rates start at 2.79% APR with autopay.



















Disclaimers




The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.
Here’s what our math includes:

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

            Referral Terms of Service          


Last Updated: 01/23/15
Earnest Student Loan Referral Terms and Conditions

Earnest, Inc., its subsidiary Earnest Operations LLC, and other affiliates (collectively, “we”, “Earnest” or “Company”) may, from time to time, offer the opportunity to refer friends and family to apply for an Earnest loan (“Earnest Referral Program” or “Program”). We reserve the right to terminate the Program at any time for any reason.
Users (defined below) are bound by these Terms and Conditions by participating in the Program. By participating in the Program, Users agree to use the Program in the manner specified in these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to these Terms and Conditions in their entirety you are not authorized to register as a Referrer (defined below) or participate in the Program in any manner. Users may not participate in the Program where doing so would be prohibited by any applicable law or regulations.
We reserve the right to modify or amend at any time these Terms and Conditions and the methods through which Rewards are earned. We reserve the right to disqualify any User (defined below) at any time from participation in the Program if he/she does not comply with any of these Terms and Conditions.
Children. No part of the Program is directed to persons under the age of 18. IF YOU ARE UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE PROGRAM AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.


Privacy
Individuals may participate in the Program to recommend services or content made available by Company to their friends, family or colleagues (“Users”). To do this, Users must necessarily submit personal information about themselves and their friends, family members or colleagues, such as name and e-mail address information, so that the Company can send these recommendations on their behalf. The personal information will be collected, processed and used in accordance with Company’s Security and Privacy Statement, which can be found at https://www.earnest.com/privacy. In addition, personal information may be used by Company to contact Users with regards to their participation in the Program and to receive communications from Company. Where a User provides personal information about its friends, family members or colleagues to receive communications via the Program, the provided personal information will be used by the Company for sending these communications on behalf of the User and User understands that Company may send out additional follow-up communications on behalf of the User to encourage or remind the friends, family members or colleagues to complete the purchase or registration process.


How the Program Works
Program Participation, Generally
Active Earnest clients will be given a unique referral URL to to refer friends, family members or colleagues in their Client Dashboard.  Users who refer are called “Referrers.” Individuals who receive a referral link are called “Referred Clients.” An “eligible” Referrer who is fully compliant with these Terms and Conditions may receive “Reward(s)” for every “Qualified Referral.”
Eligible Referrer
To be “eligible,” a Referrer must:

be a legal resident of the United States of America; and
be at least 18 years old.

Employees of the Company or any of its or their subsidiaries, affiliates or promotional agencies, including immediate family and household members, are not eligible.
Making A Referral
An individual must set up an Earnest account to make a referral, but no purchase is required. Once an individual refers a friend, family member or colleague, he/she becomes a Referrer and will be provided with a unique referral link (“Personal Link”) that allows the Referrer to receive credit for Qualified Referrals (“Credit”). Personal Links will be issued only to individuals. Non-client refers may email hello@earnest.com to request a Personal Link.
Referrers must respect the spirit of the Program by only referring real individuals who meet the requirements of these Terms and Conditions. Referrers cannot refer themselves. For example, a Referrer may not create multiple or fake accounts with Earnest or participate in the Program using multiple or fake email addresses or identities.
Referrers agree not to solicit applications for Earnest’s student loan refinancing product. Referrers also agree not to compensate, or accept any compensation from, Referred Customers in connection with such referrals. Referrers further agree that their activities will be limited to informing Referred Customers about Earnest’s student loan refinancing product so that they may independently decide whether or not to apply for such product. Referrers may not collect information from Referred Customers for the sole purpose of completing a loan application for or assisting with filling out a loan application for the student loan refinancing product.
Qualified Referrals
A Qualified Referral means that all the following conditions are met:

The Referred Customer completed the application process with the Service using the Referrer’s “Personal Link.” If a Referred Customer purchases or registers with the Service using any other link or method, the registration will not count as a Qualified
Referral and the Referrer will not earn Credit;
The Referred Customer was not previously registered with the Service under any email address or alias;
The Referred Customer is a) a legal resident of the United States of America and b) at least 18 years old.

Credit For Qualified Referrals
Credit can only be awarded for Qualified Referrals.
Earning Rewards
Referred Customers that have signed up using a valid referral link will receive a cash bonus. Varying referral amounts and additional terms will be shown in the referral invitation or accompanying promotional materials. Payment shall be provided to the Referrer’s account via ACH, unless otherwise communicated.
Verified Qualified Referrals
Rewards are subject to verification. The Company may delay a Reward for the purposes of investigation. They may also refuse to verify and process any transaction Company deems, in its sole discretion, to be fraudulent, suspicious, in violation of these Terms and Conditions, or believes will impose potential liability on Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents.
All of the Company’s decisions are final and binding, including decisions as to whether a Qualified Referral, Credit or Reward is verified.
Transfer And Value Of Credit And Rewards
Credit and Rewards are not transferable and may not be auctioned, traded, bartered or sold. Upon termination of the Program or any portion thereof for any reason, or upon cancellation of a Referrer’s Earnest account for any reason, any unredeemed Credit and Rewards accumulated by the Referrer are forfeited.


Content Ownership and Use
The online platform and the Program contain contents that include: designs, text, graphics, images, video, information, logos, button icons, software, audio files, computer code, and other content (collectively, “Content”). As between the User and the Company, all Content is the property of the Company or its licensors and is protected under copyright, trademark, and other laws. The compilation (meaning the collection, arrangement, and assembly) of all Content on the online platform or Program is the exclusive property of the Company and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws.
Independent Contractors
User participation in the Program is solely as an independent contractor. Neither Users nor Earnest intends to establish an employment relationship and Users are not entitled to any benefits. If the cumulative welcome and bonus rewards paid to an individual in a one calendar year exceed $599 USD, then form W-9 may be required to be completed prior to funds disbursement. Any payments that are not claimed within 180 days of the date the funds have been made available because direct deposit bank account or required tax information have not been provided are subject to forfeit. Earnest reserves the right to change or eliminate the Program at any time.
License To You
The Company authorizes you, subject to these Terms, to access and use the online platform, Program, and the Content solely for your personal, non-commercial use. This license is revocable at any time without notice and with or without cause. Unauthorized use of the Content may violate copyright, trademark, and applicable communications regulations and statutes and is strictly prohibited. You must preserve all copyright, trademarks, service marks, and other proprietary notices contained in the original Content on any copy you make of it.
Trademarks
The registered or unregistered logos, product and service names are or may be trademarks of the Company or its licensors (the “Marks”). Without the Company’s prior written permission, and except as solely enabled by any link as provided by the Company,


Liability
By participating in the Program, Users agree to:

be bound by these Terms and Conditions, the decisions of the Company and their designees (including the Service Provider), and the Privacy Policy of the Company;
defend, indemnify, release and hold harmless the Company, its Service Provider and its or their respective parent companies, affiliates and subsidiaries, together with their respective employees, directors, officers, licensees, licensors, shareholders, attorneys and agents including, without limitation, their respective advertising and promotion entities and any person or entity associated with the production, operation or administration of the Program (collectively, the “Released Parties”), from any and all claims, actions, demands, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses caused by, arising out of, in connection with, or related to their participation in the Program (including, without limitation, any property loss, damage, personal injury or death caused to any person(s) and/or the awarding, receipt and/or use or misuse of the Program or any Reward); and

any injuries, losses or damages of any kind resulting from acceptance, possession or use of a Reward, or from participation in the Program, that were not reasonably foreseeable to the Company at the relevant time;
any printing, typographical, administrative or technological errors in any websites or materials associated with the Program; or
claims, demands, and damages in disputes among Users of the Program.

The Company disclaims any liability for damage to any computer system resulting from participating in, or accessing or downloading information in connection with the Program, and reserve the right, in their sole discretion, to cancel, modify or suspend the Program should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention or other causes beyond the Company’s control, corrupt the administration, security or proper play of the Program.
The Company shall not be liable to any Users for failure to supply any Reward or any part thereof, by reason of any acts of God, any action(s), regulation(s), order(s) or request(s) by any governmental or quasi-governmental entity (whether or not the action(s), regulations(s), order(s) or request(s) prove(s) to be invalid), equipment failure, threatened terrorist acts, terrorist acts, air raid, blackout, act of public enemy, earthquake, tornado, tsunami, war (declared or undeclared), fire, flood, epidemic, explosion, unusually severe weather, hurricane, embargo, labor dispute or strike (whether legal or illegal), labor or material shortage, transportation interruption of any kind, work slow-down, civil disturbance, insurrection, riot, or any other similar or dissimilar cause beyond any of the Released Parties’ control.
The Company reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Program should it determine, in its sole discretion, that the administration, security or fairness of the Program has been compromised in any way.
Disclaimer Of Warranties
Users expressly understand and agree that: (a) your use of the program is at your sole risk, the program is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis and the company expressly disclaims all warranties, conditions and terms (collectively, “Promises”) of any kind, whether express or implied by statute, common law or custom, including, but not limited to, warranties as to products or services offered through the use of the program, implied warranties of merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement; (b) the company makes and gives no warranty that (I) the program will meet your requirements, (ii) be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, (iii) the results obtained from the use of the program will be accurate or reliable, (iv) the quality of any products, services, information, or other material obtained by you through the program will meet your expectations, and (v) any errors in the service will be corrected; and (c) any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the program is accessed at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or mobile device or loss of data that results from the download or use of any such material.
Limitation Of Liability And Indemnification
You expressly understand and agree that the company, including any vendors and service providers associated with or assisting in providing the program, shall not be liable to you for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the company was advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (I) the use or the inability to use the program; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through, from, or as a result of the program; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on or through the program; or (v) any other matter relating to the program. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations in this paragraph may not apply to you.
To the fullest extent possible by law, the company’s, including any vendors and service providers, maximum liability arising out of or in connection with the program, regardless of the cause of action (whether in contract, tort, breach of warranty, or otherwise), will not exceed $200.
Users should use the Program at their own risk.


Conduct
If a solution cannot be found to restore the integrity of the Program after the occurrence of prohibited conduct, we reserve the right to cancel, change, or suspend the Program.
Prohibited Conduct, Generally
Users agree not to use the Program to:

Violate applicable law;
Infringe the intellectual property rights of the Company, its Service Provider or any third parties;
Stalk, harass, or harm another individual;
Collect or store personal data about other Users;
Impersonate any person or otherwise misrepresent User’s identity;
Interfere with, disrupt or violate the Terms and Conditions or servers or networks connected to the Program; or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies, or regulations of such networks;
Interfere with another User’s use of the Program;
Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Program, other accounts, computer systems, or networks connected to the Program;

Conduct any illegal activity or solicit the performance of any illegal activity or other activity that infringes the rights of others;
Resell, barter, trade, auction or otherwise generate income by providing access to the Program to others

Bulk Distribution (“spam”)
If a Referrer provides a Personal Link to a Referred Customer by email, the email must be created and distributed in a personal manner that is appropriate and customary for communications with friends, colleagues and family members. By submitting the email addresses, the Referrer represents that he/she has their prior consent.
Bulk email distribution, distribution to strangers, or any other promotion of a Personal Link in a manner that would constitute or appear to constitute unsolicited commercial email or “spam” in the Company’s sole discretion is expressly prohibited and may be grounds for immediate termination of the Referrer’s account and deactivation of the Personal Link. We have a no tolerance spam policy.
The Company has no obligation to monitor the content provided by Users; however, the Company may choose to do so and block any email messages, remove any such content, or prohibit any use of the Program.
Each Referrer is the actual sender of the emails and must comply with applicable law. Referrers who do not comply with the law, including anti-spam laws, are obligated to indemnify the Program Entities against any liabilities, costs and expenses it incurs as a results of such spam.
Fraudulent And Suspicious Behavior
The Company may prohibit a User from participating in the Program or receiving a Credit or Reward, in their sole discretion, if they determine such User is attempting to undermine the fairness, integrity or legitimate operation of the Program in any way by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices of intending to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other users or representatives of the Company.
Use of any automated system, script, or macro to participate is strictly prohibited and will result in disqualification.
Users may not enter with multiple or fake emails addresses or accounts, use fictitious identities or use any system, bot or other device or artifice to participate in the Program or receive a Reward.
The Company reserves the right to disqualify any User and/or cancel any Reward(s) if they find a User to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Program or violating these Terms and Conditions.
Caution: any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the program may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation in the program. Should such an attempt be made, the company reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorney fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution.


Suggestions and Submissions
The Company appreciates hearing from Users and welcomes your comments regarding the Program. Please be advised, however, that the Company does not accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions, inventions, or materials (“creative ideas”) other than those which we have specifically requested. While the Company values your feedback on the Program, please be specific in your comments and do not submit creative ideas. If, despite this request, you send the Company creative ideas, they:

Shall own, exclusively, all now known or later discovered rights to the creative ideas;
Shall not be subject to any obligation of confidentiality and shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any creative ideas; and
Shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the creative ideas for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to you or any other person.



Sign-In Credentials
To see the personal Company “Refer-a-Friend” page or account or to use the Program, Users will need to sign in with their credentials and access their Client Dashboard. Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentially of their sign-in credentials and are fully responsible for all activities that occur through the use of them. Users agree to notify the Company immediately if they believe the confidentiality of their sign-in credentials has been compromised or if they suspect unauthorized use of their account. Users agree that the Company will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of their credentials.


Applicable Law; Arbitration; Class Waiver; and Waiver of Jury Trial
Any and all disputes, claims and causes of action arising out of or related to the Program or any prize awarded shall be resolved under California law (without reference to its conflicts of laws principles), and participants in the Program agree to submit any dispute to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California.
Participants and the Program Entities agree to submit to the personal and exclusive arbitration of any disputes relating to your use of the online platform or Program under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any such arbitration, to the extent necessary, shall be conducted within San Francisco County in the state of California. Participants covenant not to sue the Program Entities in any other forum.
Participants also acknowledge and understand that, with respect to any dispute with the Released Parties arising out of or relating to Participants’ use of the Service or this Agreement:

Participants ARE GIVING UP THEIR RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY; and
Participants ARE GIVING UP THEIR RIGHT TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, IN ANY LAWSUIT INVOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTE.



General Terms
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between Users and the Company concerning Users’ use of the Program. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. A person who is not a party to these Terms shall have no right to enforce or receive the benefit of any of these Terms.

The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.
Here’s what our math includes:

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.
