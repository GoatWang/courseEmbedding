Overview



My name is Leroy Wright Jr. I was born in Pineville Louisiana. I have two brothers and three sisters. There is nothing special about my family that GOD would over look our sins just because we were taught to love instead of hate. Some may think just because we were raised in the country and they were raised in the city, that a different GOD will judge us. HELLO, the same GOD will judge will judge us all. He will not allow the things that I do wrong go unpunished, nor the things you do. So let's all get it right and serve GOD in spirit and in truth. Remember that he is watching the things we do good or bad, and all is being kept on record. On judgment day there will be no excuses or exception. On the day of his return all will bow and confess that JESUS CHRIST is LORD. May GOD Bless and keep us all is my prayer.

Leroy Barnes Jr., 38

Posted Feb. 19, 2009, 4:33 p.m.


Leroy Barnes Jr., a 38-year-old black man, was shot by police officers 11 times during a traffic stop on Thursday, Feb. 19, 2009, at Mentone Street and Washington Boulevard in Pasadena, officials said.Pasadena Police Department officials said two officers fired at Barnes, of Pasadena, after he pulled a .32-caliber Colt handgun from a backpack and pointed it at them. The department had originally said the shooting took place outside the car, but after conducting more interviews and gathering additional evidence, officials determined the shooting took place in the car during a struggle over the gun, said Janet Pope-Givens, a department spokeswoman.The American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California called for an independent investigation into the shooting, saying shifting accounts provided by police raised "troubling questions about whether the officers involved in the incident purposely provided false information."According to police, Barnes was an admitted gang member with a criminal history that dated back to 1989. Barnes had 13 convictions -- six misdemeanors and seven felonies, including assault, robbery, spousal abuse and discharge of a firearm in public, Pope-Givens said.In a 1993 incident, Barnes fired at police officers in a park in broad daylight, Pope-Givens said. He was convicted and spent seven years in state prison for that offense. He was on active parole at the time of his death, having been released in April 2008 after serving four years behind bars for another conviction.-- Andrew Blankstein
