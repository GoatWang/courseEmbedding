Greenview Windows                                     





The problems with wood window framesRotten wood, mold, ants, termites, etc.Peeling paint, loose or missing putty.Swell and become difficult to open in heat and humidityShrink and become drafty in cold dry weatherOur windows "can't" do thatOur solid-core frame material is a blend of acrylic-based polymers and other resins that can't absorb moisture, so rot, mold and insects and peeling paint are not an issue. Our frame does not expand with heat and humidity.Our frame does not shrink with cold dry weather. The problems with vinyl widow framesThe fastest growing market in the window replacement industry is replacing vinyl windows that are less than 10 years old!Vinyl widow frames are hollow. They do not hold screws well. Internal parts that allow for tilt in cleaning come loose.Sash locks can come off by simply pushing hard with your hands or using a small pry bar, creating lack of security. Criminals know this!Balances that hold the windows open and keep them from slamming shut come loose. This can create dangerous situations were glass is involved.Vinyl becomes brittle when below freezing.Vinyl expands and becomes soft when in direct sun light in summer.This thermal expansion and contraction causes material fatigue over time making the frames loose and flimsy causing drafts and even rain and snow blowing into your house during windy storms.Vinyl windows will loose the warrantee if painted.Dark colors are expensive or not available in vinyl, dark colors retain heat and can cause the vinyl to deform.This is how we engineered vinyl problems out of our windowsOur solid-core frame material is a blend of acrylic-based polymers that have a screw retention similar to wood. Important moving parts don't simply pull out over time.Our frame does not expand with heat. Our frame does not shrink with cold weather. It is by far the most stable widow frame material there is.  As a result our windows fit as good as the day they were installed year after year and our lifetime warrantee does not "exclude" material fatigue, IE, becoming drafty, or flimsy.Our window frames don't need to be painted, However; if you do paint them it has no effect on the warrantee. Dark colors are no problem whether ordered from the factory or painted on afterwards inside or out. Paint will actually last longer on our frames than wood because they don't expand and contract.The problems with aluminum frame windowsAluminum window frames are usually held together at the corners by internal plastic connectors or soft metal connectors. They become brittle over time and cause the frames to come apart. Aluminum framed windows conduct heat more than any other window frame. They also corrode and pit. They also become discolored over time.Our windows are engineered for performanceOur solid-core frame material is heat fusion welded so the frame is essentially one solid peace. Our window frames have the lowest heat conduction (K-value) of any window frame, over 1400% lower than aluminium, 83% lower than fiberglass 63% lower than pine 69% lower than vinyl.The problems with fiberglass frame windowsFiberglass frames are usually held together at the corners by internal plastic connectors. They become brittle over time and cause the frames to come apart. Fiberglass widow frames are hollow. They do not hold screws well. Internal parts that allow for tilt in cleaning come loose.Sash locks can come off by simply pushing hard with your hands or using a small pry bar, creating lack of security. Criminals know this!Balances that hold the windows open and keep them from slamming shut, come loose. This can create dangerous situations were glass is involved. Fiberglass requires painting or a factory applied coating. Fiber glass degrades if left exposed to the elements. Our windows are built to lastOur solid-core frame material is heat fusion welded so the frame is essentially one solid peace.Our solid-core frame material is a blend of acrylic-based polymers that have a screw retention similar to wood. Important moving parts don't simply pull out over time.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.
