Andrea O'Donnell has been creating beauty in various forms for over 23 years.  Growing up working in her mother's salon, and earning her cosmetology license at 18, she quickly discovered that makeup was her passion and immediately embarked  upon a successful  freelance makeup career that holds steady and strong to this day.  In 2004, Andrea combined her love of paint & color with her knowledge of makeup, and began face & body painting, focusing on creative, intensely colorful makeup for editorial shoots, studio and live events.  Andrea’s career has taken her all over the world, and she has won multiple awards including First Place 2009 FABAIC Semi-Pro Body Paint, First Place 2011 FABAIC  Pro Body Paint and 2011 FABAIC People’s Choice Award.
In 2010 Andrea launched BAD ASS STENCILS, a line of multi-tasking tools created specifically for makeup artists and face/body painters, and a year later she expanded the line to include BAMS! (Bad Ass Minis) which have quickly become one of the most popular products on the market with distributors all over the globe.  Andrea’s latest venture, SKINCOGNITO MAKEUP ART STUDIO in Michigan marks the beginning of a new and exciting chapter in her career.  The 130 year old brick building contains a unique studio/gallery that reflects Andrea's knack of blending the traditional, with the not-so-traditional in the world of makeup, combining various forms of cosmetic application with body art, photography, education, and retail makeup tools & supplies.  Andrea’s goals are to help other artists learn to “Work Smarter, Not Harder” and always “DO WHAT YOU LOVE & LOVE WHAT YOU DO!”

Bonmarché like-for-like sales improve 4.2 percent




Prachi Singh |



Thursday, July 27 2017 


Total sales at Bonmarché for the 13 weeks ended July 1, 2017 increased
by 7.6 percent against the corresponding period in FY17. The company’s
store like-for-like sales improved 4.2 percent and online sales increased
by 39 percent during the period under review.
Commenting on the update, Helen Connolly, Chief Executive Officer of
Bonmarché said in a media statement: "I am pleased with the improvement in
trading and in particular the further progress in online sales. The
improved sales performance during the first quarter, achieved in a clothing
market which remains challenging, underpins our confidence in the strategy,
and our expectations for the full year remain unchanged."
The company added that trading during the first quarter of the new
financial year has been in line with the board's expectations, which are
therefore unchanged in relation to the full year's result. At July 1, 2017,
Bonmarché traded from 322 stores and online platform.

international retailer.

Benneton Group doubles annual losses to 81 mn euros




Prachi Singh |



Wednesday, July 26 2017 


Benetton Group has not been able to recover from losses since last two
years and the trend continued in 2016 as well. The Italian group reported a
loss of 81 million euros (94 million dollars) against 46 million euros (53
million dollars), the company posted last year, says a Modaes report.
The company's sales declined 8 percent to 1.38 billion euros (1.60
billion dollars), which Benetton attributed to continued economic
stagnation in Europe and decline in sales of indirect sales channels as
well as poor performance of stores in Italy, France, Germany, Poland and
Turkey. However, the company believes that its ongoing transformation plan
will make a partial impact in 2017 but will manifest fully from the
spring-summer 2018, the report adds quoting a accounts filed by Edizione, which
controls 100 percent of Benetton Group.
As a part of its reorganization efforts, Benetton hired Marco
Airoldi as the new CEO in April 2014. It also closed over 300 stores and
currently operates around 5,000 stores. The company has also focussed its
energies on its two core brands - United Colors of Benetton and Sisley to
bring the company back into the black.

VF Corp invests 40 million USD to accelerate business growth




Vivian Hendriksz |



Tuesday, July 25 2017 



London - US retail group VF Corporation remans confident about its future -
so confident that it is set to invest an additional 40 million USD in its
business to fuel and accelerate its growth for 2018.


The announcement comes after VF Corp published strong results for its
second quarter, which surpassed analyst expectations. “We have really good
momentum as we move into the second half of 2017 and are confident in our
growth engines, as evidenced by an increase in our full year outlook and
our plan to increase our cash returns to shareholders,” said Steve Rendle,
President and Chief Executive Officer of VF Corp in a statement.


“Based on the strength of the first half of 2017 and our expectations for
the second half of the year, we are making
growth-focused investments in our largest brands and platforms to generate
additional value for our shareholders both in the near and long term.” VF
Corp aims to continue investigating what its largest growth opportunities
will be to create more momentum within its businesses. At the moment VF
Corp is currently focusing on streamlining its store portfolio by closing
stores which do not achieve full profitability, according to an interview
with WWD.


However, VF Corp is also set to open another 50 stores for the company’s
three biggest brands, Vans, Timberland and The North Face, as part of the
company’s five-year strategic plan, previously unveiled this March.
Improving VF Corp portfolio remains a key part of the company’s five-year
plan. “We think there are plenty of opportunities in the marketplace. We
are very active in that process,” said Rendle.

Burberry’s stock up on Belgium’s richest man’s renowned investment




Angela Gonzalez-Rodriguez |



Tuesday, July 25 2017 


Burberry shares spiked on Monday afternoon after billionaire Albert
Frère lifted his stake in the high-end fashion retailer to 4 percent from 3
percent.
The shares moved to second on the top 10 risers for the day, up almost 2
percent. They had initially jumped 6 percent on news of the Belgian
tycoon's purchase. Frère is thought to be Belgium’s richest man thanks to
its steel emporium and diversified portfolio of unrelated investments such
as Burberry’s.
This is the second time that Frère manages to boost the high-end British
label’s stock; when he revealed a 3 percent stake in the group in February,
shares went up almost 6 percent, recalls the ‘Financial Times’. The
company’s shares advanced 2 percent on Monday following news of his
increased stake, turning Burberry into the second-biggest gainer on the
FTSE 100 Tuesday. 
In contrast, shares in Burberry suffered their sharpest one-day fall in
six months back to April, when the quintessentially British luxury fashion
company reported a slowdown in global sales growth.











AO Capital rescues bankrupted Rhodes & Beckett and Herringbone




Angela Gonzalez-Rodriguez |



Tuesday, July 25 2017 


The Australian fashion chains Rhodes & Beckett and Herringbone have been
sold as part of a management buyout backed by Hong Kong-based private
equity firm AO Capital, taking the struggling fashion businesses out of
bankruptcy. 
Cor Cordis, the administrators of Rhodes & Beckett, announced Tuesday
that the ailing retailer has been sold by means of a management buyout. The
purchaser, Black Bear Holdings, is led by current brand director Michel
Boutin and supported by Hong Kong-based private equity firm AO Capital. 
It’s worth remembering that negotiations are still underway between the
landlords of the 15 remaining Rhodes & Beckett and Herringbone stores,
which will ultimately determine the new business’ store footprint, reported
local media. 
The new owners of Rhodes & Beckett advanced that the chain will undergo
a relaunch later this year, with the brand set to redevelop its premium
brand both in Australia and internationally. 
Since the appointment of Cor Cordis as Administrators in February 2017,
Herringbone and Rhodes & Beckett stores have continued to trade while
discussions progressed. 
Cor Cordis partner Luke Targett said in a statement that “The Rhodes &
Beckett and Herringbone brands will survive and jobs have been saved. We
feel that our previously announced two stage strategy has paid off. 
"We appointed Gordon Brothers to complete an inventory clearance
program, which then enabled us to successfully negotiate with interested
parties to purchase the business with a fresh start and a new product range
and offering,” added Targett. 











Hibbett Sports’ stock slumps 32 percent on “very challenging” sales trends warning




Angela Gonzalez-Rodriguez |



Tuesday, July 25 2017 


The U.S. based sports apparel retailer Hibbett Sports Inc (HIBB.O) saw
its shares dropped 32 percent on Monday after warning about how "very
challenging" sales trends would affect its results. 
The retailer estimated an increase of pressure on its gross margins
based on a decline of about 10 percent in its comparable-store sales for
the second quarter, ending on July, 29. "Despite the difficult retail
environment, the company remains focused on improving its business for the
long term," Hibbett Sports Chief Executive Jeff Rosenthal said in a
statement. 
As reported by Reuters, shares of the athletic apparel brand fell 6.37
dollars to 13.32 dollars right before the market close. Data gathered by
Reuters reveal the stock has jumped about 64 percent so far this year. 
Hibbett Sports wasn’t the only stock in this market feeling the hit as
shares of rivals Foot Locker Inc (FL.N), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS.N),
Finish Line Inc (FINL.O) and Genesco Inc (GCO.N) all fell more than 4
percent. "The fashion has changed, the consumer is less interested, judging
based on the results of these companies," said Quo Vadis Capital analyst
John Zolidis commenting this news. 
Hibbett Sports operates about 1,000 stores in the U.S. South, Southwest,
Mid-Atlantic and Midwest.











JCPenney names Jeffrey Davis as Chief Financial Officer




Prachi Singh |



Tuesday, July 25 2017 


J. C. Penney Company has announced the appointment of Jeffrey Davis as
the company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The
company said, he will succeed Andrew Drexler, who has been serving as
interim chief financial officer while the company completed its search.
Davis will report to Marvin R. Ellison, Chairman and CEO of JCPenney.
"On behalf of the board of directors and executive leadership, I'm
pleased to welcome Jeff to JCPenney. He brings decades of finance, treasury
and strategy experience from a host of leading companies, and will make an
outstanding addition to our team," said Ellison in a statement, adding,
"Jeff's expertise will also be a tremendous asset to JCPenney as we
continue to differentiate our business in a competitive retail climate and
further strengthen our balance sheet moving forward."
Jeffrey Davis appointed CFO of JCPenney
In his role, JCPenney said Davis will be responsible for all financial
operations of the company, including the oversight of finance teams at the
JCPenney home office and shared services center in Salt Lake City. Among
his primary objectives will be to continue the company's progress in
identifying earnings growth opportunities, optimizing pricing, exercising
SG&A discipline, managing inventory levels and deleveraging debt.
"JCPenney is a mainstay in American retailing, and I'm proud to have the
opportunity to sustain its rich legacy alongside a group of dedicated
associates committed to differentiating the company from its traditional
competitors," added Davis.
Davis most recently served as chief financial officer at Darden
Restaurants, overseeing finance and accounting, corporate reporting, tax,
internal audit, treasury and investor relations. He also maintained
oversight of Darden's real estate acquisitions, as well as the company's
restaurant development.
Prior to Darden, Davis served as executive vice president and chief
financial officer for Walmart US stores. Upon joining Walmart in 2006, he
served as vice president of finance for its US specialty division before
assuming positions of increasing responsibility, including senior vice
president of finance and strategy, followed by a promotion to senior vice
president and treasurer. Before Walmart, Davis held multiple
finance-related positions with Lakeland Tours, McKesson Corporation and The
Hillman Company.

Shop Direct’s ecommerce director Jonathan Wall resigns




Prachi Singh |



Monday, July 24 2017 


After seven years at Shop Direct, ecommerce director Jonathan Wall has
decided to leave the business in mid-August, said a statement by the
company. The company added that during his time at the Shop Direct, Wall
built a multi-award winning ecommerce team, overseen the creation and
development of Shop Direct’s five star-rated apps, led retail firsts
including Very.co.uk’s soon-to-be AI-enabled chatbot, and played a large
part in placing mobile at the heart of the customer journey.
Commenting on his departure from the company, Wall said: “When I arrived
at Shop Direct, we were still very much a catalogue-focused business. Our
ambition was to grow online to 70percent of total sales by the end of 2010
– a target that we smashed thanks to the relentless drive of the
outstanding ecommerce team we have here.”
Jonathan Wall leaves Shop Direct
Sales via mobile devices represented 68 percent of Shop Direct’s online
sales over Christmas 2016, and the business was named Retail Week’s etailer
of the year for the last three years in a row. 
“To look at everything the business has achieved since then – in
particular making the bold decision to cut the catalogue last year to
become 100 percent online, while continuing to hit record sales and profits
– makes me extremely proud. Shop Direct has huge ambitions for the future
and, while the time is right for me to go after something new, I have no
doubt that the team here will continue to succeed,” Wall added.
Jon Rudoe, group retail and technology director at Shop Direct, said:
“On behalf of the whole board, I want to thank Jonathan for everything he’s
achieved during his time at Shop Direct. His leadership, innovation,
commitment and customer focus have moved us much closer to our ambition of
becoming a world-class digital retailer. He’ll leave a real legacy here,
and we’re very grateful for that.”
