Industry establishments face both internal and external competition. Because the
industry is fairly fragmented with a large number of owner operators, 
competition occurs mainly at a regional level. 

. Internal competition is denoted by businesses within the industry that compete
  on the basis of quality, reputation, industry-specific knowledge, price,      
  flexibility and marketing ability. Because most clients of this industry are 
  in higher-level positions in their organizations, they are typically seeking a
  high-quality educational service with a short duration. This fact is
  influenced not only by the standard of course content, but also by the quality
  of trainers. Trainers need to be highly knowledgeable and respected in their  
  teaching fields. Reputation is an important factor and can include both the   
  reputation of the training provider and of the content of the course. Specific
  industry knowledge creates another basis of competition between providers. For
  instance, a good understanding of a client’s particular industry may give an  
  education provider a competitive advantage over others. 

Establishments within this industry also compete on the basis of price. Although
prices may be difficult to compare because of the range of different courses
offered in terms of the topics covered, the length of the training course and
the level of course support before and after training.

Effective marketing strategies can be a point of competition; therefore,
businesses undertake a range of marketing and advertising activities to attract
both corporate and individual clients.

Flexibility in terms of course design and scheduling will give establishments
within this industry a competitive advantage. Industry operators provide set
courses, and customize their training to suit the needs of the client.

Flexibility in the scheduling of courses is important because the vast majority
of participants in training offered by this industry are full-time employees,
often in senior-level positions. As a result, a number of establishments in this
industry offer self-paced programs or online courses.

. External competition within the industry is denoted by participants that are
  facing increasing external competition from other education operators involved
  in the Colleges and Universities industry and the For-Profit University 
  industry. This competition is evident in the large increases in Masters of
  Business Administration degrees, which involve similar content to some of the
  courses delivered through the Business Coaching industry. Industry operators
  also face competition from internal training and development departments of
  larger corporations. Internal training providers benefit from higher knowledge
  of the workings of the company.

DOERS anticipates competition from the local incubators and accelerators in the
local ASEAN countries. Nonetheless, the existing providers have a sole focus on
providing networking events and workspace sharing and offer very limited
training program. Dr. Willson has seen a tremendous opportunity in the ASEAN
market due to the nascent development of startups in these countries and the
wide education gap between the existing workforce and required qualifications by
companies. DOERS will thus offer its high-quality business education and
training program at the new incubators along with the workspaces, networking
events and other services.


Company Description
Doers Education ASEAN Ltd. ("DOERS"), is a Hong Kong-based startup incubator
that offers shared workspace, networking events as well as training 
education programs. DOERS offers daily and weekly seminars on personal finances
for individuals and tailored corporate training curriculum depending


 on
corporate development needs. DOERS has been offering its flagships programs
which includes Money and YOU, DBS entrepreneurship Institute and US BSE 
Entrepreneur Business School since 1999. Founder and President, Lin Wei-Hsien is
a renowned corporate trainer in Asia who has logged in innumerable speaking
engagements in the region. The Company is now leveraging its highly successful
program and initiating an expansion program to launch its startup incubators in
emerging and high-growth Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and
countries. 

The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in April, 2016, and was
formerly known as Collins Island Acquisition Corporation.  
---

The Company's primary objective is to capitalize on what DOERS believes to be an
increase in demand for technical and corporate education in ASEAN countries by
offering specially tailored training and education programs as well as shared
office space and workspace for students, entrepreneurs and corporations in the
region. 

The Company believes, based on the most recent study on ASEAN corporations
conducted by the International Labour Organization (www.ilo.org), that a number
of corporations in ASEAN countries have experienced shortage of qualified
high-school and university graduates despite growth of the region since 1967.
The Company believes, as startup communities continue to grow in the region,
that there is a growing need for training and education programs that prepare
the workforce to be high-value employees equipped not only with technical skills
but also equally important leadership, business management and other soft skills
that DOERS offers.

NOTE 1 -
NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

 

NATURE OF
OPERATIONS

 

Doers
Education Asean Ltd. (formerly Collins Island Acquisition
Corporation) (the “Company”) was incorporated on April
4, 2016 under the laws of the state of Delaware to engage in any
lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to,
selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company has been in the
developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have
been limited to issuing shares to its original shareholders. The
Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity
for the combination of that target company with the Company. The
combination will normally take the form of a merger,
stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most
instances the target company will wish to structure the business
combination to be within the definition of a tax-free
reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No assurances can be given that
the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any
target company. The Company has been formed to provide a method for
a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company
with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.

 

BASIS OF
PRESENTATION

 

The
summary of significant accounting policies presented below is
designed to assist in understanding the Company’s unaudited
condensed financial statements. Such unaudited condensed financial
statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the
Company’s management, who are responsible for their integrity
and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“GAAP”) in all material respects, and have been
consistently applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited
condensed financial statements. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally present in annual financial statements
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”)
were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The results
for the period from April 4, 2016 (Inception) to September 30,
2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the year ending December 31, 2016.

 

USE OF
ESTIMATES

 

The
preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the condensed financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CASH AND
CASH EQUIVALENTS

 

 

Cash and
cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking
institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments
with original maturities of 90 days or less. Cash and cash
equivalents amounted to $64 as of September 30, 2016.

 

 

CONCENTRATION
OF RISK

 

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its
cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did not
have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit as of September 30, 2016.

 

INCOME
TAXES

 

Under ASC
740, “Income Taxes,” deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to temporary differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are
established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2016
there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the
realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to
expiration.

 

LOSS PER
COMMON SHARE

 

Basic loss
per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net
loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into
common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then
shared in the loss of the entity. As of September 30, 2016, there
are no outstanding dilutive securities.

 

FAIR VALUE
OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

 

The
Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements
of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value
measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed
at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis.
Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for fair value
measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
nonrecurring basis. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
fair value.

The
hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving
significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three
levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

 

Level 1
inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to
access at the measurement date.

 

 

 




 



5



 




  

 

Level 2
inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly.

 

Level 3
inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The
carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their
fair values because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

 

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

 

On
November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17-Income Taxes. The Board
is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce
complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative).
The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify,
evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced
while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information
provided to users of financial statements. Current GAAP requires an
entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into
current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of
financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income
taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax
liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified
statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update
apply to all entities that present a classified statement of
financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax
liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be
offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the
amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the
amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is
permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or
annual reporting period. The Company is still in the process of
evaluating future impact of adopting this standard. Management
believes that the impact of this ASU to the Company’s
financial statements would be insignificant.

 

In August
2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash
Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments, to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and
cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash
flows”. The amendments provide guidance on the following
eight specific cash flow issues: (1) Debt Prepayment or Debt
Extinguishment Costs; (2) Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt
Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates
That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate
of the Borrowing; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after
a Business Combination; (4)Proceeds from the Settlement of
Insurance Claims; (5) Proceeds from the Settlement of
Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned; (6)
Life Insurance Policies; (7) Distributions Received from Equity
Method Investees; (8) Beneficial Interests in Securitization
Transactions; and Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and
Application of the Predominance Principle. The amendments are
effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. Early adoption is permitted, including ado

	The
	information contained in this prospectus is not complete and may be changed. A registration statement relating to these securities
	has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and these securities may not be sold until that registration statement

	to Completion, Dated ________







	 






	DOERS
	EDUCATION ASEAN LIMITED






	1,640,000
	shares of common stock offered by selling shareholders at $0.10 per share






	 





	This
	prospectus relates to the offer and sale of 1,640,000 shares of common stock (the “Shares”) of Doers Education ASEAN
	Limited ("DOERS" or the “Company”), $.0001 par value per share, by the holders thereof who are deemed to
	be statutory underwriters. The shares offered by the selling shareholders (the "Shares") will be offered at a price
	of $0.10 until the Company’s common stock is listed on a national securities exchange or is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board
	(or a successor); after which, the selling shareholders may sell their shares at prevailing market or privately negotiated pries,
	including (without limitation) in one or more transactions that may take place by ordinary broker’s transactions, privately-negotiated
	transactions or through sales to one or more dealers for resale.




	 




	The
	maximum number of Shares that can be sold pursuant to the terms of this offering by the selling shareholders is (in aggregate)
	1,640,000 Shares. Funds received by the selling shareholders will be immediately available to such selling shareholders for use
	by them. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Selling Shareholder Shares. All costs incurred in the
	registration of the Shares and the Selling Shareholder Shares are being borne by the Company.




	 




	The
	offering will terminate twenty-four (24) months from the date that the registration statement relating to the Shares is declared
	effective, unless earlier fully subscribed or terminated by the Company. The Company intends to maintain the current status and
	accuracy of this prospectus and to allow selling shareholders to offer and sell the Shares for a period of up to two (2) years,
	unless earlier completely sold, pursuant to Rule 415 of the General Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.




	 




	Prior
	to this offering, there has been no public market for the Company’s common stock. No assurances can be given that a public
	market will develop following completion of this offering or that, if a market does develop, it will be sustained. The offering
	price for the Shares has been arbitrarily determined by the Company and does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the
	assets, operations, book or other established criteria of value of the Company. The Shares will become tradable on the effective
	date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.




	 




	Neither
	the Company nor any selling shareholders has any current arrangements nor entered into any agreements with any underwriters, broker-dealers
	or selling agents for the sale of the Shares. If the Company or selling shareholders can locate and enter into any such arrangement(s),
	the Shares will be sold through such licensed underwriter(s), broker-dealer(s) and/or selling agent(s).

	PROSPECTUS
	SUMMARY





	 





	This
	summary highlights some information from this prospectus, and it may not contain all the information important to making an investment
	decision. A potential investor should read the following summary together with the more detailed information regarding the Company
	and the common stock being sold in this offering, including “Risk Factors” and the financial statements and related
	notes, included elsewhere in this prospectus.




	 




	The
	Company




	 




	History





	 



	Doers Education ASEAN Ltd. (the "Company"
	or "DOERS"), is a Hong Kong-based startup incubator that offers shared workspace, networking events as well as training
	and education programs. DOERS offers daily and weekly seminars on personal finances for individuals and tailored corporate training
	curriculum depending on corporate development needs. DOERS has been offering its flagships programs which includes Money and YOU,
	DBS entrepreneurship Institute and US BSE Entrepreneur Business School since 1999. Founder and President, Lin Wei-Hsien is a renowned
	corporate trainer in Asia who has logged in innumerable speaking engagements in the region. The Company is now leveraging its
	highly successful program and initiating an expansion program to launch its startup incubators in emerging and high-growth Association
	of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and countries.



	 




	The
	Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in April, 2016, and was formerly known as Collins Island Acquisition Corporation.
	In May, 2016, Collins Island Acquisition Corporation filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
	on Form 10 by which it became a public reporting company.




	 




	In
	July, 2016, the Company implemented a change of control by redeeming shares of existing shareholders, issuing shares to new shareholders,
	electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors. In connection
	with the change of control, the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the
	Company’s name from Collins Island Acquisition Corporation to Doers Education ASEAN Ltd.





	 







	Business





	 




	The
	Company's primary objective is to capitalize on what DOERS believes to be an increase in demand for technical and corporate education
	in ASEAN countries by offering specially tailored training and education programs as well as shared office space and workspace
	for students, entrepreneurs and corporations in the region.




	 




	The
	Company believes, based on the most recent study on ASEAN corporations conducted by the International Labour Organization (www.ilo.org),
	that a number of corporations in ASEAN countries have experienced shortage of qualified high-school and university graduates despite
	growth of the region since 1967. The Company believes, as startup communities continue to grow in the region, that there is a
	growing need for training and education programs that prepare the workforce to be high-value employees equipped not only with
	technical skills but also equally important leadership, business management and other soft skills that DOERS offers.




	 





	Risks
	and Uncertainties facing the Company





	 




	As
	a development stage company, the Company has no operating history and has continuously experienced losses since its inception.
	The Company’s independent auditors have issued a report questioning the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
	That is, the Company needs to create a source of revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental
	plans. As a development stage company, management of the Company has no prior experience in building and selling projects similar
	to that planned by the Company and in marketing and distributing such projects on a broad scale.




	 




	One
	of the biggest challenges facing the Company is the ability to raise adequate capital to hire and train the requisite employment
	base and lease necessary space for implementation of training and education programs and provision of shared workspace in target
	communities throughout ASEAN.




	 




	Due
	to financial constraints, the Company has to date conducted limited operations. If the Company were unable to develop strong and
	reliable sources of funding for staffing and leasing, it is unlikely that the Company could develop its operations to return revenue
	sufficient to further develop its business plan. Moreover, the above assumes that the Company’s efforts are met with customer
	satisfaction in the marketplace and exhibit steady adoption of its solutions amongst the potential base of customers, neither
	of which are currently known or guaranteed.



	 


	Due to these and other factors, the Company’s
	need for additional capital, the Company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt of the Company’s
	ability to continue as a going concern.



	 





	Trading
	Market





	 




	Currently,
	there is no trading market for the securities of the Company. The Company intends to initially apply for admission to quotation
	of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board as soon as possible which may be while this offering is still in process. There can
	be no assurance that the Company will qualify for quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board.

	The
	Offering





	 




	The
	maximum number of Shares that can be sold pursuant to the terms of this offering is 1,640,000. The offering will terminate twenty-four
	(24) months from the date of this prospectus unless earlier terminated by the Company.




	 




	This
	prospectus relates to the offer and sale of 1,640,000 shares of common stock of Doers Education ASEAN Ltd. offered by the holders
	thereof who are deemed to be statutory underwriters. The selling shareholders will offer their shares at a price of $0.10 until
	such time as the Shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and only thereafter at prevailing market or privately negotiated
	prices in one or more transactions that may take place by ordinary broker's transactions, privately-negotiated transactions or
	through sales to one or more dealers for resale or at prevailing market if a market should develop.

	RISK
	FACTORS





	 




	A
	purchase of any Shares is an investment in the Company's common stock and involves a high degree of risk. Investors should consider
	carefully the following information about these risks, together with the other information contained in the registration statement
	of which this prospectus is a part, before the purchase of any Shares. If any of the following risks actually occur, the business,
	financial condition or results of operations of the Company would likely suffer, the market price of the common stock would likely
	decline, and investors could lose all or a portion of their investment. The Company has listed the following risk factors which
	it believes to be that material to an investment decision in this offering.




	 





	The
	Company has no independent operating history and as such an investor cannot assess its profitability or performance but must rely
	on the experience of its president and other officers.





	 



	The Company is a development stage company
	and has no operating history and it is therefore not possible for an investor to assess prior performance or determine whether
	it will likely meet its projected business plan. Such lack of experience may result in the Company experiencing difficulty in
	adequately designing or building any project, thereby causing the project to function improperly or provide inadequate utility
	for which it is intended. If the Company’s projects cannot be completed or consistently function improperly or perform below
	expectations, the Company will likely be unable to market and sell many of its projects or products. An investor will be required
	to make an investment decision based solely on the management’s history and its projected operations in light of the risks,
	expenses and uncertainties that may be encountered by operating incubators and offering educational products in ASEAN communities.



	 





	The
	Company’s independent auditors have issued a report questioning the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.





	 




	The
	report of the Company's independent auditors contained in the Company's financial statements as of September 30, 2016 includes
	a paragraph that explains that the Company has experienced recurring losses and has an accumulated deficit during the development
	stage of $ 6,356. These matters raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern without
	the influx of capital through the sale of its securities or through development of its operations.





	 






	The
	Company has accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2016 of $ 6,356.





	 




	As
	of September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $6,356. This deficit may impact on the Company in various ways
	including, but not limited to, making it more difficult to borrow money, sell stock or to maintain a good market price.




	 





	The
	offering price of the Shares has been arbitrarily determined and such price should not be used by an investor as an indicator
	of the fair market value of the Shares.





	 




	Currently
	there is no public market for the Company's common stock. The offering price for the Shares has been arbitrarily determined and
	does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the assets, operations, book or other established criteria of value of the
	Company. Thus an investor should be aware that the offering price does not reflect the fair market price of the Shares.





	 







	Reliance
	on Management





	 




	Management
	will participate in all decisions with respect to the management of the Company, including (without limitation) determining business
	strategy, operations, and development. In the event of the dissolution, death, retirement or other incapacity of the Management,
	the business and operations of the Company may be adversely affected.




	 





	The
	Company’s CEO controls a majority of the outstanding stock.





	 




	The
	CEO of the Company currently beneficially owns more than a majority of the Company’s outstanding common stock. As such,
	he controls most matters requiring approval by stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate
	transactions. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control, which in
	turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s common stock or prevent stockholders from
	realizing a premium over the market price for their Shares. Mr. Wei-Hsien will retain substantial control over matters requiring
	approval, such as (without limitation) the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration
	of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.

	Table of Contents

	 





	 





	The
	Company’s business depends on the market recognition of its “Doers Education ASEAN Ltd.” brand, and if the Company
	is not able to maintain or enhance its brand recognition, the business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially
	and adversely affected.






	 





	DOERS
	believes that the market recognition of its “Doers Education ASEAN Ltd.” brand will significantly contribute to the
	success of its business and the Company believes that maintaining and enhancing recognition of this brand is critical to developing
	and maintaining a competitive advantage. DOERS’ ability to maintain brand recognition depends on a number of factors, some
	of which are beyond the Company’s control. While the Company shall feature system-wide standardized curricula and operation
	procedures, as DOERS continues to grow, it may not be able to maintain the quality and consistency of its educational services
	and programs, particularly for programs developed in foreign territories where management may lack sufficient experience or expertise
	or where recruitment of necessary educators and other key personnel proves challenging. In addition, DOERS may not be successful
	in further promoting its brand to remain competitive. If the Company is unable to develop and enhance its brand recognition and
	increase awareness of the Company’s programs, or if the Company incurs excessive marketing and promotion expenses, results
	of operations may be materially and adversely affected. If the Company is unable to sustain its brand image, it may also be unable
	to maintain premium pricing over its competitors, which may further exacerbate the extent of any adverse effect on results of
	operations.




	 





	If
	the Company fails to successfully execute its growth strategies, it may not be able to attract students or corporations to enroll
	in DOERS programs and obtain significant market share.





	 




	The
	success of the Company’s business depends primarily on student, entrepreneur and corporate (collectively “trainees”)
	enrollment in DOERS training programs, and the amount of fees that the Company’s trainees are willing to pay. Therefore,
	the Company’s ability to attract trainees to enroll in its programs and utilize shared workspace and office space and the
	unit prices the Company charges per course or per program is critical to the success and growth of the Company. These in turn
	will depend on several factors, including DOERS’ ability to successfully execute its growth strategies to develop new programs
	and enhance existing programs to respond to developments in ASEAN markets and student and employer demands, expand DOERS capacity
	and geographic reach, manage its growth while maintaining the high quality and consistency of its programs and seminars, and effectively
	marketing the Company’s programs to a broader base of prospective trainees and respond to competitive pressures. While the
	Company’s founder Dr. Willson is a renowned corporate trainer in Asia who has logged in innumerable speaking engagements
	in the region, there is no assurance that this experience will translate to the Company’s brand or that the Company will
	be able to maintain or increase demand based on its founder’s prior successes and acclaim. If the Company fails to successfully
	execute its growth strategies, it may not be able to sufficiently attract trainees to enroll in its programs and may have to significantly
	decrease fees, and revenues, profitability and business prospects may be materially and adversely affected.



	 




	No
	assurance of commercial feasibility.





	 




	Even
	if the Company’s plans and projects are successfully initiated, there can be no assurance that such plans and projects will
	have any commercial success or advantage. Also, there is no assurance that the Company’s incubators will perform as intended
	in the marketplace.




	 





	Investors
	in the offering may experience immediate dilution of the value of their shares.





	 




	Purchasers
	of the Shares may experience immediate dilution in the value of their Shares. Dilution represents the difference between the price
	per share paid by investors ($0.10) and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of the Offering. Net
	tangible book value per share is the net tangible assets of the Company (total assets less total liabilities less intangible assets),
	divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding. Thus if at some other time, shares had been sold by the Company at
	a price less than the $0.10 paid by purchasers of the Shares or had been issued by the Company for services or as other non-cash
	consideration, then the value of such investor Shares immediately after purchase would be less than the $0.10 purchase price.




	 





	There
	has been no prior public market for the Company’s common stock and the lack of such a market may make resale of the Shares
	difficult.





	 




	No
	prior public market has existed for the Company's securities and the Company cannot assure any purchaser that a market will develop
	subsequent to this offering. The Company intends to apply for quotation of its common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board. However,
	the Company does not know if it will be successful in such application, how long such application will take, or, if successful,
	that a market for the common stock will ever develop or continue on that or any other trading market. If for any reason a trading
	market for the Shares does not develop, investors may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so.




	 





	The
	Company's election not to opt out of JOBS Act extended accounting transition period may not make its financial statements easily
	comparable to other companies.





	 




	Pursuant
	to the JOBS Act of 2012, as an emerging growth company the Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for
	any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the PCAOB or the SEC. The Company has elected not to opt out of
	such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for
	public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the standard for the private company. This
	may make comparison of the Company's financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth
	company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as
	possible different or revised standards may be used.

	The
	Company’s stock may be considered a penny stock and any investment in the Company’s stock will be considered a high-risk
	investment and subject to restrictions on marketability.





	 




	If
	the Shares commence trading, the trading price of the Company's common stock may be below $5.00 per Share. If the price of the
	common stock is below such level, trading in its common stock would be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated
	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These rules require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection
	with any trades generally involving any non-NASDAQ equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per Share, subject
	to certain exceptions. Such rules require the delivery, before any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining
	the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith, and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who
	sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions). For these types
	of transactions, the broker-dealer must determine the suitability of the penny stock for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s
	written consent to the transactions before sale. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage
	broker-dealers from effecting transactions in the Company’s common stock which could impact the liquidity of the Company’s
	common stock.




	 





	Little
	Experience in Being a Public Company





	 




	The
	Company is an early-stage company and as such has little experience in managing a public company. Such lack of experience may
	result in the Company experiencing difficulty in adequately operating and growing its business. Further, the Company may be hampered
	by lack of experience in addressing the issues and considerations which are common to growing companies. If the Company’s
	operating or management abilities consistently perform below expectations, the Company’s business is unlikely to thrive.




	 




	The
	Company is an early-stage company with no developed finance and accounting organization and the rigorous demands of being a
	public company require a structured and developed finance and accounting group. As a reporting company, the Company is
	already subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. However, the requirements of these laws
	and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder entail significant accounting, legal and financial compliance costs
	which may be prohibitive to the Company as it develops its business plan, services and scope. These costs have made, and will
	continue to make, some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly and may place significant strain on its personnel,
	systems and resources.




	 




	The
	Securities Exchange Act requires, among other things, that companies maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and
	internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal
	control over financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight are required. As a result, management’s
	attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on the development of the Company's
	business, financial condition and results of operations.




	 




	These
	rules and regulations may also make it difficult and expensive for the Company to obtain director and officer liability insurance.
	If the Company is unable to obtain adequate director and officer insurance, its ability to recruit and retain qualified officers
	and directors, especially those directors who may be deemed independent, will be significantly curtailed.




	 





	The
	Board of Directors could use the issuance or designation of preferred stock to impede or discourage an acquisition of the Company
	that may otherwise be beneficial to some shareholders.





	 




	The
	Company is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance
	of rights to purchase such shares, could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For instance, the issuance
	of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder
	to block such a transaction, or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage
	vote of the stockholders. In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the
	voting power of the holders of the common stock. Although the Company’s board of directors is required to make any determination
	to issue such preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of the stockholders of the Company, the board of
	directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of
	the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock
	over the then market price of such stock. The board of directors does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance
	of currently authorized stock, unless otherwise required by law or otherwise.




	 





	Failure
	to effectively and efficiently manage the establishment of the Company’s incubators across numerous sectors within the ASEAN
	communities may negatively affect its business and business prospects.





	 




	The
	Company intends to establish its incubators in large urban ASEAN cities including major cities in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines,
	Singapore, Thailand, Brunei Darussalam, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia. While the Company intends to develop its incubator
	to meet projected market demand in each of these sectors, DOERS may not be able to effectively and efficiently establish, and/or
	subsequently manage such growth. The Company may be unable to identify geographic locations with sufficient growth potential to
	expand its market reach, and the Company may fail to attract trainees and increase trainee enrollment. Newly established incubators
	may compete with existing incubators for trainee enrollment. Moreover, rapid expansion may result in substantial demands on the
	Company’s management, instructors, operational, technological and other resources. The Company’s planned expansion
	will also place significant demands on the Company to maintain the high quality of the educational services that it shall offer.
	DOERS cannot assure that it will be able to effectively and efficiently manage the establishment and/or subsequent growth of its
	operations, recruit and retain qualified instructors and management personnel, or obtain requisite space at cost-effective rates
	in certain regions.



	 



	If
	the Company fails to effectively and efficiently manage the establishment and expansion of its incubators its business and business
	prospects may suffer.

	If
	we are not able to continually tailor the Company’s curricula and training materials to market demand and to enhance DOERS
	programs to adequately and promptly respond to developments in the ASEAN job market, the Company’s programs may become less
	attractive to trainees.




	 



	New
	trends in the global economy and rapid developments in the ASEAN community and corresponding job markets may change the type of
	skills required for ASEAN workers in the marketplace. This requires DOERS to continually develop, update and enhance its training
	programs and course materials and to adapt them to the needs and demands of the respective job markets. The Company may be unable
	to update the Company’s programs or develop new programs on a cost-effective basis and in a timely manner, or at all, to
	keep pace with changes in market requirements. Any inability to track and respond to these changes in a cost-effective and timely
	manner or to tailor its programs to the ASEAN community’s respective job markets would render DOERS’ training programs
	& incubators less attractive to students and other potential trainees, which may materially and adversely affect the Company’s
	reputation and ability to continue to attract students and cause DOERS to lose market share.




	 





	The
	Company may not be able to successfully execute its strategy of establishing incubators in certain ASEAN geographical markets,
	which may have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and prospects.





	 



	While the Company through its founder &
	CEO Lin Wei-Hsien has an established reputation as a corporate trainer in Asia and while the Company’s leaders possess key
	market intelligence in the Asian corporate education, incubator and accelerator market, DOERS as a company does not currently
	provide any management, consulting, educational services nor otherwise to the ASEAN geographic region. Expanding into new geographical
	markets imposes additional burdens on research, systems development, sales, marketing and general managerial resources. As the
	ASEAN market is large and diverse, client trends and demands may vary significantly by region and the Company’s experience
	in certain markets may not be applicable in other areas & regions. As a result, DOERS may not be able to leverage its experience
	to expand into certain target regions in which it intends to conduct business. If the Company is unable to manage its expansion
	efforts effectively, if DOERS expansion efforts take longer than planned or if the costs for these efforts exceed expectations,
	the results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.


	 




	Fluctuation
	in the value of the Renminbi or other ASEAN foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on an investor’s investment.





	 




	The
	change in value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar is affected by, among other things, changes in PRC’s political and
	economic conditions. From 1995 until July 2005, the People’s Bank of China intervened in the foreign exchange market to
	maintain an exchange rate of approximately RMB 8.3 per U.S. dollar. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed this policy
	and began allowing modest appreciation of the Renminbi versus the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the Renminbi was permitted
	to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy caused the
	Renminbi to appreciate approximately 21.5% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. Since reaching a high against
	the U.S. dollar in July 2008, however, the Renminbi has traded within a narrow band against the U.S. dollar, remaining within
	1% of its July 2008 high but never exceeding it. As a consequence, the Renminbi has fluctuated sharply since July 2008 against
	other freely traded currencies, in tandem with the U.S. dollar. For example, the Renminbi appreciated approximately 27% against
	the Euro between July 2008 and November 2008. It is difficult to predict how long the current situation may last and when and
	how it may change again. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a substantial liberalization
	of its currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation in the value of the Renminbi against
	the U.S. dollar.




	 




	Significant
	revaluation of the Renminbi or other currencies in ASEAN may have a material adverse effect on your investment. For example, to
	the extent that the Company needs to convert U.S. dollars it receives into Renminbi for its operations, appreciation of the Renminbi
	against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount the Company would receive from the conversion. Conversely,
	if DOERS decides to convert its Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on its ordinary shares
	or shares for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the
	U.S. dollar amount available to the Company.

	The
	Company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which may cause its operating results to fluctuate from quarter
	to quarter. This may result in volatility in and adversely affect the price of DOERS’ training programs and other products
	& services offered.





	 




	The
	Company expects to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and results of operations, primarily due to seasonal changes
	in student enrollment. Historically, educational courses tend to have the largest student enrollment, cash collection and revenues
	in the third quarter. The Company’s expenses, however, vary significantly and do not necessarily correspond to changes in
	student enrollment and revenues. The Company shall make investments in marketing and promotion, teacher recruitment and training,
	and program development throughout the year. DOERS expects quarterly fluctuations in its revenues and results of operations and
	as such these fluctuations could result in volatility and adversely affect the price of the Company’s training programs,
	products & services offered. As the Company’s revenues grows, these seasonal fluctuations may become more pronounced.




	 





	The
	Company faces significant competition in each program it offers and in many geographic markets in which it intends to operate,
	and if DOERS fails to compete effectively, it may not obtain market share and its business, financial condition and results of
	operations may be materially and adversely affected.






	 





	The
	incubator/accelerator business education market in ASEAN is rapidly evolving and increasingly competitive, and the Company expects
	competition in this sector to persist and intensify. DOERS incubator shall face competition in many of the geographic markets
	in which it intends to operate. For example, WeWork already operates globally, offering independent office space and events in
	the form of stand-alone seminars, in regions including the United States, Israel, UK, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Canada, Mexico,
	Netherlands, South Korea, China, India and Australia. Although the Company intends to offer more curriculum-based training and
	in some distinct markets in contrast to WeWork, WeWork may develop a similar curriculum-based model or expand into DOERS’
	target markets, which could detract from the Company’s potential trainee enrollment and revenue.




	 




	The
	Company also shall compete with other national and regional vocational IT education service providers and incubators including
	Founder Institute, which offers training programs tailored towards entrepreneurs. Founder Institute has already obtained market
	presence in the United States, Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, China and many more. ASEAN countries presence
	in Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. DOERS will have to compete on brand, reputation, price and quality
	of training but if unable to adequately compete in these facets, the business and revenue may be adversely affected.



	 




	The
	Company may not be able to obtain leases at premium locations for new training centers or shared workspace at reasonable prices.






	 





	All
	of the Company’s training centers and shared workspace shall be located on leased premises. The Company competes with
	numerous other retailers and training centers for sites in the highly competitive market for retail real estate and some
	landlords and developers may exclusively grant locations to the Company’s competitors. As a result, DOERS may not be
	able to obtain leases on acceptable terms or at all, which could adversely affect its business.



	 




	The
	Company may not be able to obtain additional funds to finance its operations on terms acceptable or at all, and if DOERS does
	raise funds, the value of investment in the Company may be negatively impacted.





	 




	DOERS’
	business operations may require expenditures that exceed its available capital resources. Although the Company currently does
	not expect that it will incur substantial debt to finance its future growth, to the extent that its funding requirements exceeds
	its financial resources, DOERS will be required to seek additional financing or to defer planned expenditures. There is no assurance
	that the Company can obtain additional funds on terms acceptable or at all.




	 




	In
	addition, if the Company raises additional funds by equity financing, investors’ equity interest in the Company may be diluted.
	If DOERS raises additional funds by incurring debt obligations, it may be subject to various covenants under the relevant debt
	instruments that may, among other things, restrict its ability to pay dividends. Servicing such debt obligations could also be
	burdensome to its operations. If the Company fails to service the debt obligations or is unable to comply with the covenants,
	it could be in default under the debt obligations and its liquidity and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.



	 




	Adverse
	changes in political and economic policies of ASEAN governments could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth
	of such regions, which could reduce the demand for the Company’s products and services and materially and adversely affect
	its competitive position.





	 




	All
	of the Company’s business operations are anticipated to be conducted in ASEAN and all of the Company’s sales shall
	be made in said regions. Accordingly, DOERS’ business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected
	significantly by economic, political and legal developments in the ASEAN markets. The economy in these developing regions differs
	from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including: degree of government involvement; level of development;
	rate of economic growth; control of foreign exchange rates and currency conversion; access to financing; and allocation of
	resources.

	For
	instance, the economies in Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and other ASEAN countries have been transitioning from planned economies
	to more market-oriented economies. Although these and other target markets have grown significantly in the past 30 years, the
	growth has been uneven geographically among various sectors of the economy, and during different periods. DOERS cannot assure
	investors that these economies will continue to grow, or that if there is growth, such growth will be steady and uniform, or that
	if there is a slowdown, such slowdown will not have a negative effect on business. For example, the Chinese economy, which largely
	impacts the neighboring economies, experienced high inflation in the second half of 2007 and the first half of 2008. China’s
	consumer price index soared 7.9% during the six months ended June 30, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007. To combat inflation
	and prevent the economy from overheating, the PRC government adopted a number of tightening macroeconomic measures and monetary
	policies, including increasing interest rates, raising statutory reserve rates for banks and controlling bank lending to certain
	industries or economic sectors. However, due in part to the impact of the global crisis in financial services and credit markets
	and other factors, China’s year-on-year real GDP growth rate decreased to 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2008, down from
	the figure of 11.9% reached in the second quarter of 2007. As a result, beginning in September 2008, among other measures, the
	PRC government began to loosen macroeconomic measures and monetary policies by reducing interest rates and decreasing the statutory
	reserve rates for banks. In addition, in November 2008, the PRC government announced an economic stimulus package in the amount
	of RMB4.0 trillion. In the first half of 2009, total bank loans in China reached RMB7.4 trillion, compared to RMB2.5 trillion
	for the first half of 2008 and RMB4.9 trillion for the full year 2008. China’s year-on-year real GDP growth rate fell further
	to 6.1% in the first quarter of 2009 before rebounding to 7.9% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the consumer price index in June
	2009 had fallen 1.7% compared to June 2008.



	 



	The
	Company cannot assure investors that the various macroeconomic measures, monetary policies and economic stimulus packages adopted
	by the respective ASEAN countries, eg China, to guide economic growth and the allocation of resources will be effective in sustaining
	the fast growth rate of the Chinese economy, and in turn neighboring economies that may rely on the Chinese economy for their
	respective growth. In addition, such measures, even if they benefit the overall ASEAN economy in the long-term, may adversely
	affect the Company if they reduce the disposable income of DOERS’ trainees or trainee candidates or dampen their willingness
	to enroll in the Company’s programs.




	 





	Intellectual
	Property





	 




	The
	Company has not applied for intellectual property or trade secret protection on any aspects of its business. The Company has no
	current plans on attempting to obtain patents, copyright, trademarks and/or service marks on any of its solutions and services.
	There can be no assurance that the Company can obtain effective protection against unauthorized duplication or the introduction
	of substantially similar solutions and services.




	 





	Litigation
	Risk






	 





	The
	Company does not have any business liability, disruption or litigation insurance, and any business disruption or litigation the
	Company experiences might result in it incurring substantial costs and diversion of resources.





	 




	Governmental
	control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment.





	 




	The
	PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance
	of currency out of China. Under our current corporate structure, our income will be primarily derived from a share of the earnings
	from our PRC subsidiaries. Revenues of our PRC subsidiaries are all denominated in Renminbi. Shortages in the availability of
	foreign currency may restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other
	payments to us, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency-denominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations,
	payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade related transactions,
	can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However,
	approval from SAFE or its local branch is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of
	China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at
	its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control
	system prevents DOERS from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy its currency demands, the Company may not be able
	to pay dividends in foreign currencies to its shareholders.




	 





	Broad
	Indemnification Provided to Management





	 




	The
	governing documents of the Company limit the liability of, and provide indemnification for, the Management and the respective
	directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and the Management. The indemnification provided is to the full extent
	permitted under applicable Delaware law. Those provisions may limit certain rights of the shareholders against such parties, and
	moreover, an indemnification by the Company of the Management or any indemnified individual may result in substantial out-of-pocket
	costs and expenses payable by the Company. If the Company is forced to provide indemnification for any of these indemnified parties,
	it is possible that the assets of the Company could become depleted or the Company may otherwise suffer a material adverse financial
	consequence as a result of its indemnity obligations. As of the date of this Memorandum, to the knowledge of the Company, there
	is no pending litigation or proceeding that exists involving a director, officer, employee or agent of the Management or the Company
	where indemnification will be required or permitted.




	 





	Limited
	Transferability of Shares





	 




	There
	is no public market for the Shares. While the Company intends to develop a public market in the future, there can be no assurance
	if or when such a market would be expected to develop in the future. Even if a potential buyer could be found, the transferability
	of these Shares is also restricted by the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 144 promulgated thereunder.
	Unless an exemption is available, these Shares may not be sold or transferred without registration under the Securities Act of
	1933, as amended.




	 




	Investors
	must be capable of bearing the economic risks of this investment with the understanding that these Shares may not be liquidated
	by resale or redemption and should expect to hold their Shares as a long-term investment (especially if no public trading market
	develops).

	Speculative
	Nature of Investment





	 




	Investment
	in these Shares is speculative and, by investing, each investor assumes the risk of losing the entire investment. The Company
	has limited operations as of the date of this Private Placement Memorandum and will be solely dependent upon the Company and the
	Company's portfolio of assets, both of which are subject to the risks described herein. Accordingly, only investors who are able
	to bear the loss of their entire investment and who otherwise meet the investor suitability standards should consider purchasing
	these Shares.




	 




	Each
	prospective investor who invests in the Company must understand that investment in the Shares is speculative. By investing, potential
	investors understand that they may lose their entire investment in investing with the Company.




	 





	No
	Expectation to Pay Dividends





	 




	The
	Company has not paid any dividends with respect to its outstanding Shares and cannot predict when, or if, dividends will be paid.
	The Company does not currently anticipate paying any dividends on the Shares until a product is successfully commercialized and
	liquidity is realized. There is no guarantee the Company will ever receive any profit from its operations so as to be able to
	declare and pay dividends. There can be no assurance with respect to the amount and timing of any dividends other than to the
	shareholders, or that they will ever be made. Future dividends will be determined by the Management of the Company in light of
	prevailing financial conditions, earnings, if any, as well as other relevant factors.




	 





	Unforeseen
	Changes





	 




	While
	the Company has enumerated certain material risk factors herein, it is impossible to know all risks which may arise in the future.
	In particular, shareholders may be negatively affected by changes in any of the following: (i) laws, rules and regulations; (ii)
	regional, national and/or global economic factors; (iii) the capacity, circumstances and relationships of partners of the Company
	or the Management; or (iv) general changes in financial or capital markets.




	 




	The
	Company continuously encounters changes in its operating environment, and the Company may have fewer resources than many of
	its competitors to continue to adjust to those changes. The operating environment of the Company is undergoing rapid changes,
	with frequent introductions of laws, regulations, competitors, market approaches, and economic impacts. Future success will
	depend, in part, upon the ability of the Company to adapt to those changes and providing products and services that will
	satisfy the demands of their respective businesses and projects. Many of the competitors have substantially greater resources
	to adapt to those changes. The Company may not effectively react to all of the changes in its operating environment or be
	successful in adapting its products and approach.




	 





	Arbitration






	 





	By
	execution of the subscription agreement for purchase of the Shares, investors in this offering agree to submit to arbitration
	all claims arising from their investment. Arbitration may not afford investors all the relief they might obtain outside arbitration.
	Arbitration narrows procedural and other steps available to claimants (such as discovery, broad choice of venue and scope of appellate
	review) and is, in general, a more informal process than court action. On the other hand, arbitration is normally a less expensive
	process for a claimant than court action and normally results in a quicker final decision. However, investors may find that as
	a result of arbitration they are more restricted in the resolution of claims, if any, arising from this investment.






	 










	FORWARD-LOOKING

	This
	prospectus contains, in addition to historical information, certain information, assumptions and discussions that may constitute
	forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to

	DESCRIPTION
	OF SECURITIES






	 







	Capitalization





	 




	Pursuant
	to the Company's certificate of incorporation and amendments thereto, the Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of
	common stock, par value $0.0001, of which 20,640,000 shares were issued and outstanding as of the date of the registration statement,
	of which this prospectus is a part. The Company is also authorized to issue 20,000,000 share of preferred stock, par value $0.0001,
	of which no shares are designated or outstanding.




	 





	Common
	Stock





	 




	The
	Company is registering 1,640,000 shares of common stock offered for sale to the public by the holders thereof (selling shareholders)
	at an offering price of $0.10 per share. The selling shareholders will offer the Shares at $0.10 until such time as the Shares
	are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and offered thereafter by the selling shareholders at prevailing market or privately negotiated
	prices including (without limitation) in one or more transactions that may take place by ordinary broker's transactions, privately-negotiated
	transactions or through sales to one or more dealers for resale or at prevailing market prices if a market should develop.




	 




	Holders
	of shares of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders. Holders of
	common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. In addition to any vote required by law, the consent of at least a majority
	of the holders of the then-outstanding shares of common stock is required to (i) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any share
	of common stock, (ii) increase or decrease (other than by redemption or conversion) the total number of authorized shares of common
	stock; or (iii) amend the Articles of Incorporation of the Company if such amendment would change any of the rights, preferences
	or privileges of the common stock.




	 




	Subject
	to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding shares of preferred stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to
	share ratably in dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors in its discretion from funds
	legally available therefore. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, subject to the rights of the shares of
	preferred stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to share pro rata all assets remaining after payment in full of all
	liabilities.




	 




	Holders
	of common stock have no preemptive rights to purchase the Company’s common stock. There are no conversion or redemption
	rights or sinking fund provisions with respect to the common stock. The Company may issue additional shares of common stock which
	could dilute its current shareholder's share value.




	 





	Preferred
	Stock





	 




	Shares
	of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series as may be determined by the board of directors. The board
	of directors may fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications,
	limitations or restrictions thereof without any further vote or action by the stockholders of the Company, except that no holder
	of preferred stock shall have preemptive rights. Any shares of preferred stock so issued would typically have priority over the
	common stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights. Any future issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying,
	deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect
	the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock.




	 




	At
	present, the Company has no plans to issue any preferred stock or adopt any series, preferences or other classification of preferred
	stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares, could be used to discourage
	an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For instance, the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination
	by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction, or facilitate a business combination
	by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders. In addition, under certain circumstances,
	the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock.




	 




	Although
	the Company’s board of directors is required to make any determination to issue such preferred stock based on its judgment
	as to the best interests of the stockholders of the Company, the board of directors could act in a manner that would discourage
	an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests
	or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock. The board of directors
	does not at present intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock, unless otherwise
	required by law or otherwise.




	 





	Admission
	to Quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board





	 




	If
	and when the Company meets the qualifications, it intends to apply for quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board.
	There is no assurance that the Company will ever meet such qualifications. The OTC Bulletin Board differs from national and regional
	stock exchanges in that it (1) is not situated in a single location but operates through communication of bids, offers and confirmations
	between broker-dealers and (2) securities admitted to quotation are offered by one or more broker-dealers rather than the "specialist"
	common to stock exchanges. To qualify for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board, an equity security must have one registered broker-dealer,
	known as the market maker, willing to list bid or sale quotations and to sponsor the company listing.

	Penny
	Stock Regulation





	 




	Penny
	stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share other than securities registered on national
	securities exchanges or listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, provided that current price and volume information with respect to
	transactions in such securities are provided by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules impose additional sales practice
	requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally
	those with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions
	covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and
	have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving
	a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a disclosure schedule prescribed by
	the SEC relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer
	and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing
	recent price information on the limited market in penny stocks. Because of these penny stock rules, broker-dealers may be restricted
	in their ability to sell the Company’s common stock. The foregoing required penny stock restrictions will not apply to the
	Company’s common stock if such stock reaches and maintains a market price of $5.00 per share or greater.




	 





	Dividends





	 




	The
	Company has not paid any dividends to date. The Company intends to employ all available funds for the growth and development of
	its business, and accordingly, does not intend to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.




	 







	THE
	BUSINESS AND BUSINESS PLAN





	 





	Background





	 



	The Company is a
	development stage company and has limited operating history and is expected to experience losses in the near term. The
	Company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to
	continue as a going concern.


	 




	Summary





	 



	Doers Education ASEAN, Ltd.
	(the “Company” or “DOERS”), a Delaware Corporation, is a Hong Kong-based startup incubator that offers
	shared workspace, networking events as well as training and education programs. DOERS offers daily and weekly seminars on personal
	finances for individuals and tailored corporate training curriculum depending on corporate development needs. DOERS has been offering
	its flagships programs include Money and You, DBS Entrepreneurship Institute and US BSE Entrepreneur Business School since 1999.
	Founder and President, Lin Wei Hsien is a renowned corporate trainer in Asia who has logged in innumerable speaking engagements
	in the region. The Company is now leveraging its highly successful program and initiating an expansion program to launch its startup
	incubators in emerging and high-growth Association of Southeast Asian Nations and (ASEAN) countries.



	 





	Business
	Model






	 





	DOERS
	offers management and leadership training that addresses the training needs of individuals and corporations alike. As an incubator
	for startup companies, DOERS revenue streams are comprised of: 1) Admission fees for the seminars and tuition fees for the business
	school; 2) Rental income from incubator members and booking fees for seminar rooms.




	 




	Key
	success factors that the Company intends to employ to achieve its goals include the following:




	 








	●




	Ability
	to alter goods and services produced in favor of market conditions: Establishments in
	this industry must be able to change or adapt the courses offered to suit the needs of
	attendees. For instance, recently there has been increased demand for IT management training
	and quality assurance training.






	 








	●




	Provision
	of superior after sales service: Establishments that provide a higher level of after-sales
	service have a competitive advantage over those that do not in cementing client relationships.






	 








	●




	Developing
	a strong brand and reputation: The perceived value of a company is important for the
	recruitment of new clients for seminars and workshops.






	 








	●




	Being
	part of a franchising chain: New establishments in this industry can benefit from franchising.
	This reduces the costs associated with establishing new courses and maximizes economies
	of scale.






	 








	●




	Access
	to highly skilled workforce: Trainers in this industry must have an appropriately high
	level of skills and experience.

	The
	Market






	 





	The
	Business Coaching industry has a low level of globalization, with all of the larger enterprises being domestically owned. The
	international reach of these enterprises is growing; however, through the establishment of branches overseas, licensing programs
	to operators and increasing use of distance-education methods. Given the highly fragmented nature of this industry, with more
	than 85.0% of establishments being non-employers, the level of domestic ownership of establishments is likely to remain low.




	 




	Key
	external drivers that the Company believes will positively impact the market include the following:




	 








	●





	Corporate
	profit

	: A large proportion of the industry’s customers are corporations, so
	changes in business sentiment typically influence demand for the industry’s services.
	When corporate profit is low, companies are less likely to spend money on nonessential
	training for their staff. Corporate profit is expected to increase in 2017 representing
	a potential opportunity for the industry.






	 








	●





	Per
	capita disposable income

	: Disposable income levels influence individuals who take
	courses for self-fulfillment. Customers are sensitive to price, so an increase in disposable
	income often leads to increased spending on education and training courses. Per capita
	disposable income is expected to increase in 2017.






	 








	●





	Households
	earning more than $100,000

	: Demand for the educational services provided by this
	industry mainly comes from middle and senior managers. An increase in the number of people
	in these positions will increase demand for services. A proxy for the number of middle
	and senior managers is the number of households in high-income groups. Therefore, an
	increase in the number of wealthy households is expected to raise demand for industry
	services. The number of households earning more than $100,000 is expected to increase
	in 2017.






	 








	●





	nvestor
	uncertainty

	: Investor uncertainty, also known as the fear index, controls investor
	risk. Investor uncertainty rises during economic downturns with investors becoming risk
	averse. National debt and interest rate worries are continuing to increase uncertainty
	and reduce demand for industry services. Investor uncertainty is expected to increase
	in 2017, representing a potential threat to the industry.






	 








	●





	Number
	of employees

	: Any rise in the number of employees in the United States will expand
	the potential market base for the industry. Therefore, an increase in the number of employees
	typically boosts demand for industry services. The number of employees is expected to
	increase in 2017.





	 




	Startup
	Communities in ASEAN






	 





	According
	to the Asia-Pacific Forum Berlin (APFB)’s January 2016 report on start-up ecosystems in ASEAN member states, the start-up
	communities in ASEAN are still in a nascent stage which presents a unique opportunity for the Company. Potentially growing demand
	in various regions can be characterized as follows:




	 





	BRUNEI.

	Brunei has a small but continually growing startup community backed by government initiatives. Brunei Government places paramount
	importance in the education of its citizens by providing scholarships for studying at Ivy League Colleges in order to produce
	new breed of entrepreneurs. SocialMart.com is one of the most successful startups in Brunei. Investors such as MAD Incubator and
	Start UP Nation have shown interests in investing in Brunei. Brunei’s leading incubators include Tru Synergy, Founder Institute
	and Start-up Hub BIMP-EAGA (SUHBE Co).




	 





	CAMBODIA.

	Cambodia is a country which has strong self-employment tradition with around half of the population of 15 million under 25
	years of age. In addition, the mobile penetration is growing. All of these factors shape a robust startup ecosystem in Cambodia.
	Current Incubators include: Young Startups, EME Business Incubator, KOTRA Incubator and BDLink – The Business Incubator.




	 





	INDONESIA.

	Indonesia’s startup market is still at infancy. Nonetheless, Indonesia’s population is very technologically adept.
	Indonesia is one among the most active countries on social media. It has Facebook’s fourth largest number of users and fifth
	largest number of users of Twitter. The Internet users in Indonesia are projected to grow from 55 million (2014) to 125 million
	(2015). Nearly three-quarter (74%)of mobile users use social media apps and on an average a person spends 2 hours 54 minutes on
	social media each day. Apple, Facebook, Twitter and Uber have started their offices in the country. Incubators & Accelerators
	in the region include: IdeaBox, Kolaborasi, Kapital, FI Indonesia, Grupara Inc, ideosource and Batavia Incubator.




	 





	LAOS.

	Startup companies in Laos have a strong focus for rebuilding their country. At seven million strong, Laos hasover 50 per cent
	of population at 25 years or younger. Laos IT Business Incubation Center is a leading incubator in the country. Currently a business
	incubator of the National University of Laos offers entrepreneurship development, business consulting, business matching, technical
	support, access to funding and networking.




	 





	MALAYSIA.

	Malaysia’s
	leading accelerator, MAGIC Accelerator offers three programs - for startups looking to expand in ASEAN, for social
	enterprises, and for growth-stage companies. The latter encompasses 500 Startups and Tune Labs Accelerator, which offers a
	year-round program with in-house development support and the opportunity to test market fit with the AirAsia/Tune Group
	customer base.

	MYANMAR.

	Myanmar is ripe with opportunity as starting up in such a young ecosystem on the brink of technological change almost guarantees
	the first-mover advantage. Incubators & Accelerators in the region include: Ideabox and Project Hub, Yangon.




	 





	PHILIPPINES.

	The Philippines has an ambitious target for its startup ecosystem. By 2020, the country aims to have 500 startups that have
	raised total funding of US$200 million from investors and raked in a valuation of US$2 billion. Accelerators & Incubators
	in the region include: Kickstart Ventures, Launch garage and Ideaspace Foundation Inc.




	 





	SINGAPORE.

	Scott Anthony in his 2015 Harvard Business Review article attributed Singapore’s development as an entrepreneurial hub
	to three factors: A hospitable environment for startups, serious government skin in the game and the use of soft power to address
	hidden barriers to entrepreneurship. Accelerators & Incubators in the region include: Singapore Entrepreneurs Network Monthly
	Meetup, Founder Institute, JFDI Asia, iStartup Program and FinTech.




	 





	Digital
	Education Systems in ASEAN





	 




	High
	penetration of digital use in Southeast Asia is a positive indicator of the region’s readiness for accessing online training
	materials. As of 2015, out of the estimated 627.7 million ASEAN population, 252.4 million are active internet users, 232.9 million
	are active social media users, and 199.7 million are active mobile social media users. The Company believes the penetration of
	digital use in ASEAN creates opportunity and demand for digital education systems the Company intends to offer to the ASEAN community.




	 





	Education
	Systems in ASEAN






	 





	To
	promote human resource development, ASEAN countries have launched the Education Objective, which aims to: (i) achieve universal
	access to primary education; (ii) develop education networks at various levels within institutions; and (iii) establish research
	clusters to improve the quality of education throughout the region. ASEAN countries present very diverse levels of educational
	standard, institutional development, and education policy. Singapore, for example, presents a fully internationalized hub of higher
	education, while Cambodia’s system of higher education is only 30 years old.




	 




	Accreditation
	mechanisms are vital in establishing the basis for a regional labour mobility market. The Asia Pacific Accreditation and Certification
	Commission (APACC), one such mechanism, has begun harmonizing education and training systems, aiming to certify institutions to
	common shared standards of quality. Promoting the use of the English language is another key issue within the AEC. Language barriers
	within member countries, and the increasing internationalization of the job market even within each country, make English-language
	fluency ever more necessary.




	 





	SWOT
	Analysis






	 




	The Company's strengths are denoted by founder
	Lin Wei-Hsien's 30+ years of experience as an established network industry leader and successful entrepreneur with experience
	offering educational seminars throughout Asia. The Company also believes the company is strengthened by its recognition of locations
	in fast-growing startup communities in ASEAN.



	 




	The
	Company will have to overcome certain weaknesses, particularly with regards to DOERS' limited business management experience in
	the ASEAN region. The Company also currently has only a limited number of current staff to deploy and funds will be required to
	deploy a comprehensive international market expansion.




	 




	The
	opportunity for success is ripe as new emerging markets grow and as political stability in ASEAN communities increases. Perhaps
	more importantly, there are already several existing startup communities with no current training nor education system in place.




	 




	There
	is always the threat however that political stabilizing trends in ASEAN communities could reverse or worsen. In addition, competitors
	with similar training or educational programs may enter the region and compete with the Company.

	establishments face both internal and external competition. Because the industry is fairly fragmented with a large number of owner
	operators, competition occurs mainly at a regional level.




	 





	 



	●




	Internal competition is denoted by businesses within
	the industry that compete on the basis of quality, reputation, industry-specific knowledge, price, flexibility and marketing ability.
	Because most clients of this industry are in higher-level positions in their organizations, they are typically seeking a high-quality
	educational service with a short duration. This fact is influenced not only by the standard of course content, but also by the
	quality of trainers. Trainers need to be highly knowledgeable and respected in their teaching fields. Reputation is an important
	factor and can include both the reputation of the training provider and of the content of the course. Specific industry knowledge
	creates another basis of competition between providers. For instance, a good understanding of a client’s particular industry
	may give an education provider a competitive advantage over others.






	 




	Establishments
	within this industry also compete on the basis of price. Although prices may be difficult to compare because of the range of
	different courses offered in terms of the topics covered, the length of the training course and the level of course support
	before and after training.

	Effective
	marketing strategies can be a point of competition; therefore, businesses undertake a range of marketing and advertising activities
	to attract both corporate and individual clients.




	 




	Flexibility
	in terms of course design and scheduling will give establishments within this industry a competitive advantage. Industry operators
	provide set courses, and customize their training to suit the needs of the client.



	 



	Flexibility
	in the scheduling of courses is important because the vast majority of participants in training offered by this industry are full-time
	employees, often in senior-level positions. As a result, a number of establishments in this industry offer self-paced programs
	or online courses.




	 





	 



	●




	External competition within the industry is denoted
	by participants that are facing increasing external competition from other education operators involved in the Colleges and Universities
	industry and the For-Profit University industry. This competition is evident in the large increases in Masters of Business Administration
	degrees, which involve similar content to some of the courses delivered through the Business Coaching industry. Industry operators
	also face competition from internal training and development departments of larger corporations. Internal training providers benefit
	from higher knowledge of the workings of the company.






	 




	DOERS
	anticipates competition from the local incubators and accelerators in the local ASEAN countries. Nonetheless, the existing providers
	have a sole focus on providing networking events and workspace sharing and offer very limited training program. Dr. Willson has
	seen a tremendous opportunity in the ASEAN market due to the nascent development of startups in these countries and the wide education
	gap between the existing workforce and required qualifications by companies. DOERS will thus offer its high-quality business education
	and training program at the new incubators along with the workspaces, networking events and other services.

	Jumpstart
	Our Business Startups Act




	 



	In
	April, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ("JOBS Act") was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among
	other things: Exemptions for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to
	five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies; Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities
	laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting
	requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition
	for Rule 506 offerings; Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and
	Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules
	to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and such sales are exempt from state law registration,
	documentation or offering requirements. In general, under the JOBS Act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial
	public offering ("IPO") of common equity securities was affected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than
	$1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an emerging
	growth company after the earliest of




	 




	(i)   
	the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more,




	(ii)  
	the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company's IPO;




	(iii)  
	the company's issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period; or




	(iv) 
	the company becoming a "larger accelerated filer" as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.




	 




	The
	Company meets the definition of an emerging growth company will be affected by some of the changes provided in the JOBS Act and
	certain of the new exemptions. The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and
	for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company are discussed below.




	 





	Financial
	Disclosure.

	The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities
	Act of 1933 will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:




	 




	(i)   
	audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years;




	(ii)  
	selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited;




	(iii) 
	executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies. (A smaller
	reporting company is one with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second
	fiscal quarter)




	 




	However,
	the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already
	provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company.




	 




	Currently
	a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs
	audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.




	 




	The
	JOBS Act also exempts the Company's independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the
	Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") after the date of the JOBS Act's enactment, except as otherwise
	required by SEC rule.




	 




	The
	JOBS Act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Company's
	accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.




	 





	Internal
	Control Attestation.

	The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company's independent registered
	public accounting firm to file a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting, although management of the
	Company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.




	 




	Section
	102(a) of the JOBS Act goes on to exempt emerging growth companies from the requirements in 1934 Act § 14A(e) for companies
	with a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.





	 






	Other
	Items of the JOBS Act.

	The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors
	that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either
	prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The Act also permits research reports by a broker
	or dealer about an emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision.
	In addition the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers,
	dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth
	company IPO.




	 




	Section
	106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided
	that the registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show.
	This is intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that
	it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to
	conduct a road show.




	 





	Election
	to Opt Out of Transition Period.

	Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to
	comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act
	registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to
	comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard.

	Table of Contents

	 




	 



	The
	JOBS Act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply
	to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of
	the transition period.





	 







	Legal
	Proceedings





	 




	There
	are no pending, threatened or actual legal proceedings in which the Company is a party.




	 





	Agreement
	with Tiber Creek Corporation





	 




	The
	Company entered into an agreement with Tiber Creek Corporation (“Tiber Creek”) whereby Tiber Creek would provide assistance
	in effecting transactions for the Company to become a public company, including the preparation and filing a registration statement
	with the Securities and Exchange Commission, assistance with applicable state requirements, advise and assistance on listing its
	securities on a trading exchange, assistance in establishing and maintaining relationships with market makers and broker-dealer,
	and assistance in other transactions, marketing and corporate structure activities available at that time.

	The
	Company has no subsidiaries.







	 








	Reports
	to Security Holders





	 




	In
	May 2016 the Company (as Collins Island Acquisition Corporation) filed a Form 10-12G general registration of securities pursuant
	to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a reporting company pursuant such Act and files with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission quarterly and annual reports and management shareholding information. The Company intends to deliver a copy of its
	annual report to its security holders, and will voluntarily send a copy of the annual report, including audited financial statements,
	to any registered shareholder who requests the same.




	 




	The
	Company’s documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission may be inspected at the Commission’s principal

	MANAGEMENT’S
	DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS





	 



	The Company is a development stage company
	and was incorporated in the State of Delaware in April 2016. As of the periods from inception, through the date of this prospectus,
	the Company did not generate any revenue and incurred minimal expenses and operating losses, as part of its development stage
	activities. The Company has experienced a net loss of $6,356, an accumulated deficit of $6,356 and has $4,500 in total liabilities.
	The Company estimates it will need approximately $1,500,000 in additional funds to affect its business plan.



	 





	Going
	Concern





	 



	The Company has negative working
	capital, has incurred losses since inception, and has not yet received any revenue from sales of products or services. The
	ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company generating cash from the sale of its common
	stock and/or obtaining debt financing and attaining future profitable operations.



	 




	Management’s
	plans include selling its equity securities and obtaining debt or other financing to fund its capital requirement and on-going
	operations; however, there can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts. These factors create substantial
	doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustment
	that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.




	 





	Overview





	 



	The Company is an early-stage Hong Kong-based
	startup incubator that offers shared workspace, networking events as well as training and education programs. DOERS offers daily
	and weekly seminars on personal finances for individuals and tailored corporate training curriculum depending on corporate development
	needs. DOERS has been offering its flagships programs which includes Money and YOU, DBS entrepreneurship Institute and US BSE
	Entrepeneur Business School since 1999. Founder and President, Lin Wei-Hsien is a renowned corporate trainer in Asia who has logged
	in innumerable speaking engagements in the region. The Company is now leveraging its highly successful program and initiating
	an expansion program to launch its startup incubators in emerging and high-growth Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
	and countries.



	 




	As
	of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash balance of $64 and has earned no revenues nor realized any profits.




	 




	The
	Company intends to make an equity offering of its common stock for the acquisition and operation expenses. If it cannot raise
	the required cash, the Company will issue additional shares of common stock in lieu of cash.

	Potential
	Revenue

	 




	The
	Company intends to earn revenue from enrollment in its seminars and purchase of its training programs, through strategic partnerships
	with startup communities in ASEAN and through sale and rental of shared workspace and office space to prospective students, entrepreneurs
	and corporations. 




	The
	Company intends to offer its first training program in ASEAN in or around April 1, 2017. The revenue of this operation will include
	attendance fee and/or enrollment.

	 






	Alternative
	Financial Planning

	 




	Mr.
	Wei-Hsien, Lin – President of the Company will pay all operation expenses for the Company as Director’s loan with
	no interest calculated until the Company can raise sufficient funds for its operation and project development. 





	Equipment
	Financing

	 




	The
	Company has no existing equipment financing arrangements. 





	Critical
	Accounting Policies

	 




	The
	financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States. The preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
	of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are
	based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
	results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
	from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 





	Development
	Stage and Capital Resources

	 




	Since
	its inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning. Accordingly, the Company is considered
	to be in the development stage. The Company has not generated revenues from its operations, and there is no assurance of future
	revenues. 




	There
	is no assurance that the Company’s activities will result in any operations or that any operations, if begun, will generate
	revenues. The Company will need additional capital, but there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such capital
	on terms satisfactory to the Company. Accordingly, given the Company’s limited cash and cash equivalents on hand, the Company
	will be unable to implement its business plans and proposed operations unless it obtains additional financing or otherwise is
	able to generate revenues and profits. The Company may raise additional capital through sales of debt or equity, obtain loan financing
	or develop and consummate other alternative financial plans. 





	Discussion
	of Period from Inception to September 30, 2016

	 



	As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
	cash balance of $64. The Company‘s expenses are paid by a loan provided by the President of the Company, Lin Wei-Hsien.
	There is no interest or repayment term set on the loan but request for repayment cannot be earlier then Dec 31, 2016. Mr. Wei-Hsien
	has agreed to pay the operation expenses of the Company until the Company can raise sufficient funds for its operation and project
	development.

	 




	The
	Company hopes to raise an initial $1,500,000 which will allow it to fully staff for operations across ASEAN and hire key instructors
	and management to facilitate growth in respective startup communities in the region.  



	As of September 30, 2016, the Company has
	posted only operating losses since its inception on April 4, 2016. It has an accumulated deficit since inception and no material
	cash balance nor any material assets on hand as of September 30, 2016. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
	ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate
	sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations, which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and /or obtain
	additional financing from its stockholders and/or other third parties. 


	The Company does not anticipate that it will
	generate revenue sufficient to cover its planned operating expenses in the foreseeable future, and the Company must obtain additional
	financing in order to develop and implement its business plan and proposed operations. If the Company is not successful in generating
	sufficient revenues and/or obtaining additional funding to develop its business plan and proposed operations, this could have a
	material adverse effect on its business, results of operations liquidity and financial condition.

	preferred stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to share pro rata all assets remaining after payment in full of all
	liabilities.




	 




	Holders
	of common stock have no preemptive rights to purchase the Company’s common stock. There are no conversion or redemption
	rights or sinking fund provisions with respect to the common stock. The Company may issue additional shares of common stock which
	could dilute its current shareholder's share value.




	 





	Preferred
	Stock





	 




	The
	Company has 20,000,000 authorized undesignated shares of preferred stock. As of date hereof, no designation of any series of preferred
	stock has been created and no shares issued. The board of directors is has the authority to effect a series of preferred stock
	and designate the rights and preferences thereto.




	 





	Market
	Price






	 





	There
	is no public market for the Company’s common stock and there is no market price for the Company's common stock.




	 





	Admission
	to Quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board





	 




	If
	and when the Company meets the qualifications, it intends to apply for quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin
	Board. There is no assurance that the Company will ever meet such qualifications. The OTC Bulletin Board differs from
	national and regional stock exchanges in that it (1) is not situated in a single location but operates through communication
	of bids; offers and confirmations between broker-dealers and (2) securities admitted to quotation are offered by one or more
	broker-dealers rather than the "specialist" common to stock exchanges. To qualify for quotation on the OTC Bulletin
	Board, an equity security must have one registered broker-dealer, known as the market maker, willing to list bid or sale
	quotations and to sponsor the company listing. In addition, the Company must make available adequate current public
	information as required by applicable rules and regulations.




	 




	If
	the Company is not able to qualify for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board or for other reasons, the Company may elect to have
	its securities initially traded in the OTC Markets Group Inc. (formerly the Pink OTC Markets, aka the "Pink Sheets").
	The OTC Markets Group Inc. is the largest electronic marketplace for broker-dealers to trade unlisted stocks. In general there
	is greater liquidity for traded securities on the OTC Bulletin Board. It is not possible to predict where, if at all, the securities
	of the Company will be traded following the effectiveness of this registration statement.



	 




	Penny
	Stock Regulation





	 




	Penny
	stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share other than securities registered on national
	securities exchanges or listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, provided that current price and volume information with respect to
	transactions in such securities are provided by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules impose additional sales practice
	requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally
	those with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions
	covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and
	have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving
	a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a disclosure schedule prescribed by
	the SEC relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer
	and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing
	recent price information on the limited market in penny stocks. Because of these penny stock rules, broker-dealers may be restricted
	in their ability to sell the Company’s common stock. The foregoing required penny stock restrictions will not apply to the
	Company’s common stock if such stock reaches and maintains a market price of $5.00 per share or greater.

	DISCLOSURE
	OF COMMISSION POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES





	 




	The
	Company’s Certificate of Incorporation include an indemnification provision that provides that the Company shall indemnify
	directors against monetary damages to the Company or any of its shareholders by reason of a breach of the director’s fiduciary
	except (i) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the Company or its shareholders or (ii) for acts or omissions
	not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct of (iii) for unlawful payment of dividend or unlawful stock purchase
	or redemption or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.




	 




	The
	Bylaws of the Company provide that the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as amended from
	time to time, indemnify all directors of the Company, as well as any officers or employees of the Company to whom the Company
	has agreed to grant indemnification. Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DCL”) empowers a
	corporation to indemnify its directors and officers and to purchase insurance with respect to liability arising out of their
	capacity or status as directors and officers provided that this provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a
	director (i) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
	omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) arising under
	Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper
	personal benefit. The Delaware General Corporation Law provides further that the indemnification permitted thereunder shall
	not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the directors and officers may be entitled under the corporation’s
	by-laws, any agreement, vote of shareholders or otherwise.



	 







	The
	effect of the foregoing is to require the Company to indemnify the officers and directors of the Company for any claim arising
	against such persons in their official capacities if such person acted in good faith and in a manner that he reasonably believed
	to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
	no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.




	 




	The
	Certificate of Incorporation does not specifically indemnify the officers or directors or controlling persons against liability
	under the Securities Act.




	 




	The
	Securities and Exchange Commission’s position on indemnification of officers, directors and control persons under the Securities
	Act by the Company is as follows:




	 





	INSOFAR
	AS INDEMNIFICATION FOR LIABILITIES ARISING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 MAY BE PERMITTED TO DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND CONTROLLING
	PERSONS OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ISSUER PURSUANT TO THE RULES OF THE COMMISSION, OR OTHERWISE, THE SMALL BUSINESS ISSUER HAS BEEN
	ADVISED THAT IN THE OPINION OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION SUCH INDEMNIFICATION IS AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY AS EXPRESSED
	IN THE ACT AND IS, THEREFORE, UNENFORCEABLE.

	NOTE
	1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 




	NATURE
	OF OPERATIONS




	 




	Doers
	Education Asean Ltd. (formerly Collins Island Acquisition Corporation) (the “Company”) was incorporated on April 4,
	2016 under the laws of the state of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected
	mergers and acquisitions. The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have been
	limited to issuing shares to its original shareholders. The Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity
	for the combination of that target company with the Company. The combination will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock
	exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most instances the target company will wish to structure the business combination to
	be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
	amended. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. The
	Company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class
	of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.




	 




	BASIS
	OF PRESENTATION




	 




	The
	summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company’s unaudited
	condensed financial statements. Such unaudited condensed financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of
	the Company’s management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) in all material respects, and have
	been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements. Certain information and footnote
	disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The results for
	the period from April 4, 2016 (Inception) to September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
	for the year ending December 31, 2016.




	 




	USE
	OF ESTIMATES




	 




	The
	preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
	the condensed financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results
	could differ from those estimates.




	 






	F-5






	Table of Contents

	 



	 





	CASH
	AND CASH EQUIVALENTS




	 







	Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit
	at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. Cash
	and cash equivalents amounted to $64 as of September 30, 2016.



	 




	CONCENTRATION
	OF RISK




	 




	Financial
	instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places
	its cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did not have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
	Corporation limit as of September 30, 2016.




	 




	INCOME
	TAXES




	 




	Under
	ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
	to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
	tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
	years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when
	it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2016 there were
	no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration.




	 




	LOSS
	PER COMMON SHARE




	 




	Basic
	loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
	during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts
	to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared
	in the loss of the entity. As of September 30, 2016, there are no outstanding dilutive securities.




	 




	FAIR
	VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS




	 




	The
	Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair
	value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
	basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized
	and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy
	that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.




	 




	The
	hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level
	1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The
	three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:




	 




	Level
	1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability
	to access at the measurement date.

	Table of Contents

	 



	 





	Level
	2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
	or indirectly.




	 




	Level
	3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate
	their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.




	 




	RECENT
	ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS




	 




	On
	November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17-Income Taxes. The Board is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce
	complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative). The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify,
	evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while
	maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. Current GAAP requires an
	entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of
	financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred
	tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this
	Update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred
	tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by
	the amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements
	issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application
	is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is still in the process
	of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard. Management believes that the impact of this ASU to the Company’s
	financial statements would be insignificant.




	 




	In
	August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
	and Cash Payments, to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement
	of cash flows”. The amendments provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: (1) Debt Prepayment or
	Debt Extinguishment Costs; (2) Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates
	That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made
	after a Business Combination; (4)Proceeds from the Settlement of Insurance Claims; (5) Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned
	Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned; (6) Life Insurance Policies; (7) Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees;
	(8) Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions; and Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance
	Principle. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim
	periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The amendments should
	be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively
	for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The
	Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

	In
	October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other than Inventory”,
	which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when
	the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-06 will be effective for the Company in its first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently evaluating
	the impact of adopting ASU 2016-16 on its consolidated financial statements.




	 




	In
	October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, “Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under
	Common Control”. The amendments affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate
	a variable interest entity in certain situations involving entities under common control. Specifically, the amendments change
	the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by changing how a reporting
	entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect interests in the entity held through related
	parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The amendments are effective for public business entities for
	fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.
	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.




	 




	NOTE
	2 - GOING CONCERN




	 







	The Company has not yet generated any revenue
	since inception to date and has sustained operating loss of $6,356 during the period from April 4, 2016 (Inception) to September
	30, 2016. The Company had a working capital deficit of $1,936 and an accumulated deficit of $6,356 as of September 30, 2016. The
	Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet
	its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its members or other sources, as may be required.



	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the
	above condition raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any
	adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications
	of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.




	 




	In
	order to maintain its current level of operations, the Company will require additional working capital from either cash flow from
	operations or from the sale of its equity. However, the Company currently has no commitments from any third parties for the purchase
	of its equity. If the Company is unable to acquire additional working capital, it will be required to significantly reduce its
	current level of operations.

	NOTE
	5 - STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT




	 




	On
	April 4, 2016, the Company issued 20,000,000 founders common stock to two directors and officers. The Company is authorized to
	issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of September 30, 2016, 20,640,000 shares
	of common stock and no preferred stock were issued and outstanding.




	 




	On
	July 24, 2016, the Company redeemed an aggregate of 19,500,000 of the then 20,000,000 shares of outstanding stock at a redemption
	price of $.0001 per share.




	 




	On
	July 25, 2016, the Company issued 19,500,000 shares of its common stock pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933
	at par representing 97.5% of the total outstanding 19,000,000 shares of common stock to Wilson Lin Wei-Hsien and 500,000 shares
	to Daz Mc Securities. Daz Mc Securities works with Khoo Lay Wah together as shareholders and management of the Company.




	 




	On
	September 30, 2016, the Company issued 640,000 shares of its common stock to 38 shareholders for $64 at par value.




	 




	NOTE
	6 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT





	 







	Management
	has evaluated subsequent events through February 9, 2017, the date which the financial statements were available to be issued.
	All subsequent events requiring recognition as of September 30, 2016 have been incorporated into these financial statements and
	there are no subsequent events that require disclosure in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 855, “Subsequent Events.”

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	 




	To
	the Board of Directors




	Collins
	Island Acquisition Corporation




	  




	We
	have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Collins Island Acquisition Corporation (the "Company") as of April
	20, 2016, and the related statement of operations, changes in stockholders' deficit and cash flows for the Period from April
	4, 2016 (Inception) to April 20, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
	responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.




	 




	We
	conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
	standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
	are free of material misstatement. The Company was not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
	internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
	basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
	opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
	opinion. Our audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
	statements. Our audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
	well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
	our opinion.




	 




	In
	our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
	the Company as of April 20, 2016 and the results of its operations and its cash flows from April 4, 2016 (Inception) to April
	20, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
	in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has had no revenues and income since inception. These conditions, among
	others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans concerning
	these matters are also described in Note 2, which includes the raising of additional equity financing or merger with another
	entity. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from




	the
	outcome of this uncertainty.

	NOTE
	1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 




	NATURE
	OF OPERATIONS




	 




	Collins
	Island Acquisition Corporation ("Collins Island" or "the Company") was incorporated on April 4, 2016 under
	the laws of the state of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers
	and acquisitions. The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have been limited
	to issuing shares to its original shareholders. The Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the
	combination of that target company with Collins Island. The combination will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock
	exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most instances the target company will wish to structure the business combination to
	be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
	amended. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. The
	Company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class
	of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.




	 




	BASIS
	OF PRESENTATION




	 




	The
	summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company's financial statements.
	Such financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company's management, who are responsible for
	their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	of America ("GAAP") in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying financial
	statements. The Company has not earned any revenue from operations since inception. Accordingly, the Company's activities have
	been accounted for as those of a "Development Stage Enterprise" as set forth in ASC 915, "Development Stage Entities."
	Among the disclosures required by ASC 915, are that the Company's financial statements be identified as those of a development
	stage company, and that the statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows disclose activity since the date of
	the Company's inception. The Company chose December 31 as its fiscal year end.




	 




	USE
	OF ESTIMATES




	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
	statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
	estimates.




	 




	CASH
	AND CASH EQUIVALENTS




	 




	Cash
	and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments
	with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company did not have cash equivalents as of April 20, 2016.




	 




	CONCENTRATION
	OF RISK




	 




	Financial
	instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places
	its cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did not have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
	Corporation limit as of April 20,




	2016.

	INCOME
	TAXES




	 




	Under
	ASC 740, "Income Taxes," deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
	to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
	tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
	years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when
	it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of April 20, 2016 there were no
	deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration.




	 




	LOSS
	PER COMMON SHARE




	 




	Basic
	loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
	during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts
	to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared
	in the loss of the entity. As of April 20, 2016, there are no outstanding dilutive securities.




	 




	FAIR
	VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS




	 




	The
	Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair
	value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
	basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized
	and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy
	that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
	quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements
	involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as




	follows:




	 




	Level
	1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability
	to access at the




	measurement
	date.




	 




	Level
	2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
	or indirectly.




	 




	Level
	3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate
	their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.




	 




	NOTE
	2 - GOING CONCERN




	 




	The
	Company has not yet generated any revenue since inception to date and has sustained operating losses during the period ended April
	20, 2016. The Company had a working capital deficit of $1,000 and an accumulated deficit of $1,312 as of April 20, 2016. The Company's
	continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations
	and/or obtaining additional financing from its members or other sources, as may be required.

	Notes
	to Financial Statements





	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the
	above condition raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
	to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of
	liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.




	 




	In
	order to maintain its current level of operations, the Company will require additional working capital from either cash flow from
	operations or from the sale of its equity. However, the Company currently has no commitments from any third parties for the purchase
	of its equity. If the Company is unable to acquire additional working capital, it will be required to significantly reduce its
	current level of operations.




	 




	NOTE
	3 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS




	 




	Adopted




	 




	On
	June 10, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915). The amendments in this update remove the definition
	of a development stage entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting
	entities from U.S. GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present
	inception-to-date information on the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder's equity, (2) label the financial statements
	as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is
	engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it
	had been in the development stage. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted this accounting standard. The accounting
	pronouncement does not have a material effect on the financial statements.




	 




	Other
	recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force) and the United States Securities
	and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future
	financial statements.




	 




	NOTE
	4 - ACCRUED LIABILITIES




	 




	As
	of April 20, 2016, the Company had an accrued professional fee of $1,000.




	 




	NOTE
	5 - STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT




	 




	On
	April 4, 2016, the Company issued 20,000,000 founders common stock to two directors and officers. The Company is authorized to
	issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of April 20, 2016, 20,000,000 shares of
	common stock and no preferred stock were issued and outstanding.

	Item
	14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers





	 




	The
	Company's Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws and other contracts provide for indemnification of its officers, directors, agents,
	fiduciaries and employees. These provisions allow the Company to pay for the expenses of these persons in connection with legal
	proceedings brought because of the person's position with the Company, if the person is not ultimately adjudged liable to the
	Company for misconduct in the action. Generally, no indemnification may be made where the person has been determined to have intentionally,
	fraudulently or knowingly violated the law.




	 




	The
	Company does not believe that such indemnification affects the capacity of such person acting as officer, director or control
	person of the Company.





	 







	Item
	15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities





	 




	The
	Company has issued the following securities in the last three (3) years. Such securities were issued pursuant to exemptions from
	registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as transactions by an issuer not involving any public
	offering, as noted below. Each of these transactions was issued as part of a private placement of securities by the Company in
	which (i) no general advertising or solicitation was used, and (ii) the investors purchasing securities were acquiring the same
	for investment purposes only, without a view to resale.




	 




	Since
	inception, the Company has issued the following shares of common stock:




	 




	The
	Company issued 20,000,000 shares on its formation in April 2016 to each of James Cassidy and James McKillop of which all but 500,000
	shares were redeemed pro rata.




	 




	As
	part of a change in control of the Company, on July 25, 2016 the Company issued 19,500,000 shares of common stock to:

	Pursuant
	to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended and updated from time to time)




	 




	The
	undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:




	 




	(1)
	To file, during any period in which it offers or sales securities, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement;




	 




	i.
	To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;




	 




	ii.
	To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information
	in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the
	total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) any deviation from the low or high end of
	the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)
	if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price
	set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement; and




	 




	iii.
	To include any additional material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration
	statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement.




	 




	(2)
	That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post effective amendment shall
	be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of the securities at
	that time to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.




	 




	(3)
	To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment, any of the securities that remain unsold at the termination
	of the offering.




	 







	 


	II-

	3



	 








	Table of Contents

	 





	 




	(4)
	That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of
	securities:




	 




	Each
	prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to this offering, other than registration
	statements relying on Rule 403B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included
	in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in
	a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed
	incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to
	a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration
	statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date
	of first use.




	 




	(5)
	That for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of
	securities:




	 




	The
	undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration
	statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or
	sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser
	and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser.:




	 




	i.
	Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to this offering required to be filed pursuant
	to Rule 424;




	 




	ii.
	Any free writing prospectus relating to this offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred
	to by the undersigned registrant;




	 




	iii.
	The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned
	registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and




	 




	iv.
	Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.




	 




	Undertaking
	Request for acceleration of effective date or filing of registration statement becoming effective upon filing.




	 




	The
	undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:




	 




	Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons
	of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
	Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
	In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred
	or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding)
	is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant
	will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
	jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed
	by the final adjudication of such issue.

	            File No. 333-215367


	 


	Doers Education Asean Limited:


	 


	We act as counsel
	for Doers Education Asean Limited, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the preparation and filing
	by the Company of registration statement on Form S-1 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, relating to the offer and sale
	of up 1,640,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $0.10 per share.


	 


	We have examined
	the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws of the Company, the relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law,
	the relevant records of the State of Delaware and have made inquiries of the principals of the Company. As to various questions
	of fact material to such opinion, where relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied upon statements of officers
	of the Company or representations contained in the Registration Statement. We have assumed, without independent investigation or
	review, the accuracy and completeness of the facts and representations and warranties contained in the documents referenced above
	or otherwise made known to us.


	 


	Based upon and relying
	solely upon the foregoing, we advise you that in our opinion the shares being offered will, when sold, be legally issued, fully
	paid and non-assessable.


	 


	We assume no obligation
	to supplement this opinion if any applicable law changes after the date hereof or if we become aware of any fact that might change
	the opinion expressed herein after the date hereof.


	 


	This opinion letter
	is limited to the application of the laws of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States, and we express no
	opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdictions. Our opinions and statements expressed herein are limited to those matters expressly
	set forth herein, and no opinion may be implied or inferred beyond the matters expressly stated herein.


	 


	By this letter,
	we consent to the inclusion of our name under "Legal Matters" caption in the registration statement and amendments thereto
	filed on Form S-1 referenced above.


	 






	 


	 


	Sincerely,
