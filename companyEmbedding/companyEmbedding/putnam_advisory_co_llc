Fin. Guar. Ins. Co. v. Putnam Advisory Co., LLC, No. 14-1673 (2d Cir. 2015)

Annotate this Case





Justia Opinion Summary


				Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC) sued Putnam Advisory for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and negligence, claiming that Putnam misrepresented its management of a collateralized debt obligation called Pyxis to induce FGIC to provide financial guaranty insurance for Pyxis.  According to FGIC’s complaint, Putnam stated that it would select the collateral for Pyxis independently and in the interests of long investors (i.e., investors who profit when the investment succeeds), but in fact permitted the collateral selection and acquisition process to be controlled by a hedge fund that maintained significant short positions in Pyxis (i.e., investments that would pay off if Pyxis defaulted).  Essentially, FGIC alleged that Putnam misrepresented the independence of its management of a structured finance product, which, upon default, caused FGIC millions of dollars in losses.    The district court dismissed FGIC’s fraud claim on the ground that the complaint did not adequately plead loss causation and dismissed FGIC’s negligence claims on the ground that the complaint failed to allege a special or privity‐like relationship between FGIC and Putnam.  The Second Circuit vacated, holding that FGIC sufficiently alleged both its fraud and negligence‐based claims.

					14      1673      cv Fin. Guar. Ins. Co. v. Putnam Advisory Co., LLC In the United States Court of Appeals For the Second Circuit August Term, 2014 No. 14      1673      cv FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE COMPANY, Plaintiff      Appellant, v. THE PUTNAM ADVISORY COMPANY, LLC, Defendant      Appellee. Appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. No. 12      cv      7372        Robert W. Sweet, Judge. ARGUED: NOVEMBER 17, 2014 DECIDED: APRIL 15, 2015 Before: KEARSE, STRAUB and RAGGI, Circuit Judges. FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. Appeal from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Robert W. Sweet, Judge), granting defendant      appellee’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The District Court dismissed plaintiff      appellant’s fraud claim on the ground that the complaint did not adequately plead loss causation, and dismissed plaintiff      appellant’s negligence claims on the ground that the complaint did not allege facts sufficient to establish a special relationship between the parties. For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the District Court erred in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim. We therefore VACATE the judgment of the District Court and REMAND for further proceedings. SANFORD I. WEISBURST (Peter E. Calamari, Sean P. Baldwin, Paul P. Hughes, on the brief), Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, New York, New York, for Plaintiff      Appellant. THOMAS A. ARENA (Sean M. Murphy, Robert C. Hora, Ian E. Browning, on the brief), Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP, New York, New York, for Defendant      Appellee. STRAUB, Circuit Judge: Plaintiff      Appellant Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (“FGIC”) appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Robert W. Sweet,       2       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. Judge), dismissing its second amended complaint (“SAC”) for failure to state a claim. See FGIC v. Putnam Advisory Co., LLC, No. 12 CIV. 7372, 2014 WL 1678912 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2014). FGIC filed this action against Defendant      Appellee Putnam Advisory Company, LLC (“Putnam”) for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and negligence. FGIC contends that Putnam misrepresented its management of a collateralized debt obligation (“CDO”) called Pyxis ABS CDO 2006      1 (“Pyxis”) in order to induce FGIC to provide financial guaranty insurance for Pyxis. According to FGIC’s complaint, Putnam stated that it would select the collateral for Pyxis independently and in the interests of long investors (i.e., investors who profit when the investment succeeds), but in fact permitted the collateral selection and acquisition process to be controlled by a hedge fund, Magnetar Capital LLC (“Magnetar”), which maintained significant short positions in Pyxis (i.e., investments that would pay off if Pyxis defaulted). In sum, FGIC alleges that Putnam       3       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. misrepresented the independence of its management of a structured finance product, which, upon default, caused FGIC millions of dollars in losses. On April 28, 2014, the District Court dismissed FGIC’s fraud claim on the ground that the complaint did not adequately plead loss causation, and it dismissed FGIC’s negligence claims on the ground that the complaint failed to allege a special or privity      like relationship between FGIC and Putnam. For the reasons set forth below, we find that FGIC has sufficiently alleged both its fraud and negligence      based claims. Accordingly, we VACATE the judgment of dismissal and REMAND to the District Court for further proceedings. BACKGROUND The allegations contained in FGIC’s complaint have been comprehensively set forth in the District Court’s opinion below. See FGIC, 2014 WL 1678912, at *1      7. We nevertheless provide a brief recitation of the most pertinent factual allegations, which are       4       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. presumed to be true for purposes of considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. I. The Pyxis CDO This case arises out of Putnam’s role as collateral manager of the Pyxis CDO. A CDO is a special purpose vehicle that purchases, or assumes the risk of, a portfolio of assets. To buy their portfolio of assets, CDOs raise money from investors by issuing notes and equity interests. The assets that comprise the CDO generate cash, which is then paid out to the CDO’s investors. Investors in a CDO are not necessarily all subject to the same level of risk. Rather, CDO notes may be issued in “tranches” representing different levels of risk and potential reward. Generally, senior tranches carry the lowest risk, whereas investors in the equity tranche assume the greatest risk in the event of a default. Pyxis was a “hybrid” CDO, in that its $1.5 billion portfolio included both “cash” assets (i.e., assets that Pyxis actually purchased) and “synthetic” assets (i.e., assets created through       5       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. transactions that referenced securities not actually owned by Pyxis). About 23% of Pyxis’s assets were cash assets and 77% were synthetic assets created by credit default swaps that referenced other asset       backed securities. In these credit default swaps, Pyxis sold credit protection to counterparties in exchange for premium payments to Pyxis. If the assets referenced in the swaps performed well, Pyxis would enjoy the premium payments without having to make credit protection payments. If the assets performed poorly, however, Pyxis would have to make credit protection payments to the credit default swap counterparty, potentially up to the full notional amount of the referenced obligation. Calyon Corporate and Investment Bank (“Calyon”), the structuring bank1 for Pyxis, paid premiums to Pyxis under a credit A bank structuring a CDO transaction is responsible for financing and facilitating the purchase of the CDO’s assets, constructing the CDO, and interacting with rating agencies. See Loreley Fin. (Jersey) No. 7, Ltd. v. Credit Agricole Corporate and Inv. Bank, Index No. 650673/2010 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. June 9, 2011); J.A. 1151      61. 1       6       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. default swap in exchange for protection payments in the event that a portfolio asset experienced a “credit event,” such as a default or failure to pay a defined obligation. For most of the specified assets, Calyon acted only as an intermediary, meaning that the ultimate short positions were held by other market participants. II. Putnam’s Representations and the Pyxis Guaranty In July 2006, Calyon contacted FGIC to solicit credit protection for the Pyxis CDO. Under the deal that Calyon proposed to FGIC, FGIC was to insure all payments owed by its subsidiary FGIC Credit Products LLC under a credit default swap which would provide credit protection on the $900 million “super senior” Pyxis tranche (“the Pyxis Guaranty”). Without the Pyxis Guaranty, Pyxis would not have closed. Calyon represented that the CDO would be managed by Putnam, which would select the Pyxis asset portfolio independently, in good faith, and in the best interests of the investors.       7       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. FGIC alleges that it and investors were heavily dependent on Putnam’s experience, independence, and integrity as collateral manager. Putnam represented to FGIC, orally and in writing, that it was an experienced and reputable collateral manager and that it would select the assets for the Pyxis portfolio diligently and independently. Putnam provided documents, such as a 52      page marketing pitchbook and an offering memorandum, containing extensive representations about Putnam’s role as a “global leader in asset management” and the rigorous selection process by which it would select the assets for the Pyxis portfolio. SAC ¶¶ 69      71, 86      87; J.A. 210, 217. Putnam made similar representations to FGIC in the course of FGIC’s extensive due diligence for Pyxis, which included an on       site review of Putnam’s operations at Putnam’s Boston offices. During a face      to      face meeting of representatives from FGIC and Putnam, Putnam represented that it would select and manage the       8       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. assets in the Pyxis portfolio and described in detail its expertise and strategy for doing so. In a follow      up call, Putnam again made clear that it would select and manage the assets for Pyxis and that it had considerable experience in the residential mortgage      backed securities (“RMBS”) market, particularly in the market for subprime RMBS, of which the Pyxis portfolio would primarily be composed. Putnam represented that it performed extensive due diligence with respect to prospective RMBS investments, including conducting on       site visits to most of the servicers of the loans underlying these investments, and, more importantly, that it maintained ongoing interactions with all servicers to keep tabs on their servicing strategy and performance. [Id.] As a result of these representations, FGIC provided the Pyxis Guaranty. III. Magnetar’s Alleged Scheme FGIC contends that, contrary to its representations, Putnam abdicated control of the selection of Pyxis’s assets to Magnetar, a hedge fund that had a financial interest in Pyxis’s failure.       9       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. According to the SAC, in early 2006, the hedge fund Magnetar worked with collateral managers to launch a series of CDOs. By supplying the funds for the equity tranche, the riskiest stake, Magnetar made it possible to secure investors (and insurers like FGIC) willing to take long positions in those CDOs. But unlike an ordinary investor, Magnetar purchased the equity tranche of Pyxis and other similar CDOs not because it thought the CDO was a sound investment but because the investment permitted Magnetar to simultaneously bet against the more senior tranches in the same deal. These short positions were much greater (often six      to      one) than Magnetar’s long equity position. In other words, Magnetar stood to gain significantly more if the CDO failed than if it succeeded. As collateral manager of Pyxis, Putnam was responsible for selecting the assets for inclusion in the portfolio, monitoring the credit status of the underlying assets, reinvesting payment proceeds       10       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. from maturing assets, and making substitutions in the portfolio of assets. But, according to the SAC, Putnam was well aware of Magnetar’s “hedged equity” strategy of betting against the assets included or referenced in Pyxis, and Putnam allowed Magnetar to secretly control the composition of those assets. FGIC alleges that Magnetar made a “behind the scenes” arrangement with Calyon, of which Putnam was aware, requiring Calyon or Putnam to notify Magnetar of any proposed acquisition for the Pyxis portfolio and giving Magnetar veto rights over any such proposed acquisition. SAC ¶ 95; J.A. 221. Magnetar also designated which collateral it wanted to include in the Pyxis portfolio, which Putnam accommodated. For example, the SAC alleges that in July 2006, James Prusko of Magnetar emailed Carl Bell at Putnam to suggest that Putnam increase the synthetic portion of Pyxis by entering into more credit default swaps referencing low      rated RMBS, which would allow Magnetar to short more of the Pyxis assets. Prusko       11       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. explained that it was “very hard to get off sizable CDO CDS trades unless they’re done against a deal, and this is a natural delta hedge against our equity.” Bell wrote back: “Got it. So when we find a deal we want to buy, we shouldn’t put in an order with the syndicate desk but have Calyon broker a synthetic trade between you and [Pyxis] at an agreed upon level?” Prusko replied: “That would be preferable . . . .” SAC ¶ 98 (alteration in complaint); J.A. 223. FGIC alleges that Magnetar’s long position on Pyxis by the time Pyxis defaulted was approximately $21 million. Magnetar’s short position on the CDOs in which it invested averaged approximately 7% of the aggregate assets of those CDOs. If Pyxis were an average Magnetar CDO, therefore, Magnetar’s short position on Pyxis, a $1.5 billion CDO, would have totaled $105 million.       12       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. For its role in cooperating with Magnetar’s scheme, Putnam received a fixed fee of fifteen basis points (i.e., 0.15% of the outstanding principal of Pyxis each year) and an additional “incentive” fee of five basis points. Due to Pyxis’s size, this was a substantial sum; Putnam’s fixed fee was $2.25 million for the first year alone, and by 2012, Putnam had received cumulative total fees of $5,707,429. The SAC also alleges that Putnam saw Pyxis as an opportunity to “establish a foothold in the market” for managing similar CDOs in the future. SAC ¶¶ 6, 51; J.A. 186, 203. Indeed, Putnam was selected by Magnetar to serve as collateral manager for a second Pyxis CDO, Pyxis ABS CDO 2007–1, which closed a few months after Pyxis. IV. Magnetar’s Control Over the Pyxis Portfolio and Pyxis’s Default FGIC alleges that the assets Magnetar directed Putnam to include in the Pyxis portfolio were, on their face, more likely to default than the assets Putnam would have selected had it acted       13       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. independently. Putnam invested half of Pyxis’s cash allocated to CDO investments in four other Magnetar CDOs, even though there were over two hundred asset      backed CDOs issued in 2006 alone in which Putnam could have invested. According to the SAC, Putnam concealed the extent to which Pyxis sold protection on the ABX Index of low      rated RMBS. The ABS Index is an independent benchmark designed to measure the overall value of mortgages made to borrowers with subprime or weak credit. Magnetar pushed Putnam to circumvent the limit represented to Pyxis investors on investment in the ABX Index to a level more than three times the specified concentration limit, which increased the risk profile of the Pyxis portfolio. Putnam also provided FGIC with a “target portfolio” for Pyxis that included $145 million of prime RMBS, but then, without alerting FGIC, replaced all of the prime RMBS with subprime RMBS, which were more likely to default.       14       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. On April 30, 2008, only eighteen months after Pyxis closed, Fitch Ratings Ltd. downgraded the credit rating of the Pyxis Super Senior tranche from AAA to C. Ultimately, Pyxis defaulted and FGIC incurred liability of up to $900 million under the Pyxis Guaranty. V. Proceedings in the District Court FGIC sued Putnam for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and negligence. After FGIC filed the SAC, Putnam moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The District Court granted Putnam’s motion to dismiss. The District Court held that FGIC had failed to state a claim for fraud because the SAC did not contain sufficient allegations to plausibly indicate that “Magnetar’s alleged control of the collateral selection process for Pyxis caused FGIC’s losses, as opposed to the global financial crisis.” FGIC, 2014 WL 1678912, at *10. The District Court also dismissed FGIC’s negligent      misrepresentation and negligence claims on the ground that the SAC did not contain allegations sufficient to establish a       15       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. “special relationship” between FGIC and Putnam. Id. at *13. Putnam timely appealed. DISCUSSION We review de novo a District Court’s grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, “accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.” Walker v. Schult, 717 F.3d 119, 124 (2d Cir. 2013). “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). To state a plausible claim, the complaint’s “[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). We begin by rejecting Putnam’s argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that FGIC lacks standing to sue. Putnam contends that FGIC did not allege a cognizable injury in fact. This point       16       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. merits little discussion because, “[a]t the pleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s conduct may suffice” to establish standing. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992); see Baur v. Veneman, 352 F.3d 625, 631 (2d Cir. 2003) (“[A]t the pleading stage, standing allegations need not be crafted with precise detail, nor must the plaintiff prove his allegations of injury.”). FGIC satisfies this requirement by alleging that it “was required to pay out a huge sum” pursuant to its insurance policy and that it “lost millions” as a result of Pyxis’s default. SAC ¶¶ 1, 90, J.A. 185, 219. FGIC therefore has standing to bring this action. FGIC challenges the dismissal of its complaint for failure to state a claim. With respect to its fraud claim, FGIC contends that it alleged facts sufficient to establish loss causation. FGIC argues, in the alternative, that it is not required to plead loss causation under New York law because (1) it is seeking rescission based on fraud and       17       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. (2) New York Insurance Law § 3105 does not require an insurer to establish loss causation in a claim for fraud in the inducement of an insurance contract. FGIC also argues that the District Court erred in dismissing its negligent      misrepresentation and negligence claims for failure to sufficiently allege a special relationship between it and Putnam. We agree with FGIC that, even if loss causation must be pleaded, its allegations are sufficient to state claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and negligence. We therefore vacate the judgment of the District Court. I. Fraud Claim To state a claim for fraud under New York law, a plaintiff must allege (1) a material misrepresentation or omission of fact; (2) which the defendant knew to be false; (3) which the defendant made with the intent to defraud; (4) upon which the plaintiff reasonably relied; and (5) which caused injury to the plaintiff. See Crigger v. Fahnestock & Co., 443 F.3d 230, 234 (2d Cir. 2006); Wynn v.       18       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. AC Rochester, 273 F.3d 153, 156 (2d Cir. 2001) (per curiam). On this appeal, we primarily focus on the fifth element, causation. To satisfy that element, a plaintiff must allege both that the “defendant’s misrepresentation induced plaintiff to engage in the transaction in question (transaction causation) and that the misrepresentations directly caused the loss about which plaintiff complains (loss causation).” Laub v. Faessel, 745 N.Y.S.2d 534, 536 (1st Dep’t 2002) (citations omitted); see, e.g., Amusement Indus., Inc. v. Stern, 786 F. Supp. 2d 758, 776 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (applying New York law). There is no dispute here that FGIC has sufficiently pleaded transaction causation, as the SAC contains repeated allegations that but for Putnam’s fraudulent misrepresentations, FGIC would not have entered into the transaction. See, e.g., SAC ¶ 11; J.A. 188 (“[H]ad FGIC known the truth about Pyxis . . . it would never have agreed to issue the Pyxis Guaranty.”).       19       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. Loss causation, on the other hand, “is the causal link between the alleged misconduct and the economic harm ultimately suffered by the plaintiff.” Lentell v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 396 F.3d 161, 172 (2d Cir.) (quoting Emergent Capital Inv. Mgmt., LLC v. Stonepath Grp., Inc., 343 F.3d 189, 197 (2d Cir. 2003)) (internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 935 (2005). To plead loss causation, FGIC must allege that the “subject of the fraudulent statement or omission was the cause of the actual loss suffered.” Id. at 173 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Suez Equity Investors, L.P. v. Toronto      Dominion Bank, 250 F.3d 87, 95 (2d Cir. 2001)); see Laub, 745 N.Y.S.2d at 536 (explaining that loss causation is the “fundamental core of the common      law concept of proximate cause”). A. Sufficiency of Loss Causation Allegations A claim for common law fraud is subject to the particularity pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), “which requires that the plaintiff (1) detail the statements (or omissions) that the plaintiff contends are fraudulent, (2) identify the       20       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. speaker, (3) state where and when the statements (or omissions) were made, and (4) explain why the statements (or omissions) are fraudulent.” Eternity Global Master Fund Ltd. v. Morgan Guar. Trust Co. of N.Y., 375 F.3d 168, 187 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The District Court did not apply the heightened pleading standards of Rule 9(b) to FGIC’s loss causation allegations, but on appeal, Putnam argues that Rule 9(b) should apply. We have not yet resolved whether allegations as to loss causation must be pleaded with the specificity required by Rule 9(b). Acticon AG v. China N. E. Petrol. Holdings Ltd., 692 F.3d 34, 37–38 (2d Cir. 2012); see Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 346 (2005) (assuming, but not deciding, that loss causation allegations are governed by ordinary notice pleading standards). We need not decide the question today because we find that FGIC’s loss causation allegations are sufficient even under the heightened pleading standards of Rule 9(b). FGIC has alleged       21       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. particular facts that, when considered as a whole, plausibly allege that Putnam’s alleged misrepresentations and omissions caused at least some of the economic harm it suffered. These allegations include that:        Had Putnam selected the Pyxis collateral itself, as it represented it would do, and had it not acquiesced in Magnetar’s control of collateral selection, Pyxis would not have defaulted as quickly as it did, and may well not have defaulted at all. At a minimum, any losses incurred by Pyxis would have been substantially smaller than they were. Thus, FGIC’s liability for losses incurred by Pyxis would either not have been incurred at all, or would have been substantially smaller.        The purpose of Magnetar’s control of the collateral selection process was to ensure that the assets selected for inclusion in the Pyxis portfolio would be likely to default.        Many of the assets selected for the Pyxis portfolio by Magnetar, on their face, were more liable to default than the assets Putnam would have selected had it acted independently. For example, Putnam’s original target portfolio for Pyxis included $145 million of prime RMBS. At Magnetar’s direction, Putnam replaced these assets in the final portfolio with $145 million of subprime RMBS.        The Magnetar      selected assets in the Pyxis portfolio defaulted more quickly than other assets in the Pyxis portfolio. Based on a preliminary analysis of the       22       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. performance of assets in the Pyxis portfolio for which FGIC has evidence that Magnetar directed selection, all Magnetar      selected assets had defaulted by March 2009, and their average life before default was just 1.5 years. By contrast, the average life before default of the Pyxis collateral for which FGIC does not have direct evidence of Magnetar’s control was 1.85 years.        In general, Magnetar’s CDOs defaulted in greater numbers, and defaulted much more quickly, than comparable CDOs. As of April 2012, all 18 of Magnetar’s 2006      vintage mezzanine CDOs had defaulted while only 72% of 2006       vintage non      Magnetar mezzanine CDOs had defaulted. As of December 2008, when Pyxis defaulted, 94% of Magnetar’s 2006      vintage mezzanine CDOs had defaulted, while only 40% of 2006      vintage non      Magnetar mezzanine CDOs had done so.        Over $95 million of the Magnetar      selected assets defaulted before the financial crisis took hold. The default of these assets substantially contributed to Pyxis’s collapse and to FGIC’s losses under the Pyxis Guaranty. At this preliminary stage, accepting all factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in FGIC’s favor, the SAC alleges a causal connection between Putnam’s fraudulent misrepresentations and FGIC’s losses under the Pyxis Guaranty such that FGIC “would have been spared all or an ascertainable       23       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. portion of that loss absent the fraud.” Lentell, 396 F.3d at 175. The District Court found the SAC’s allegations deficient in part because the “pool of assets alleged to be controlled by Magnetar represented roughly 11% of the $1.5 billion collateral pool, and the SAC does not allege how the selection of safer assets in this 11% pool would have prevented a default.” FGIC, 2014 WL 1678912, at *11. The District Court also determined that FGIC’s allegations did not allow for an inference of loss causation because “[e]ven if the Magnetar      selected assets in the Pyxis portfolio defaulted more quickly than other assets, there is nothing in the SAC that alleges that this . . . was sufficient to cause Pyxis to default ahead of any market      wide downturn or isolates Pyxis’ default in any reasonable manner from the market downturn.” Id. In so concluding, however, the District Court misapplied the standard on a motion to dismiss. The purpose of the loss causation element is to require a plaintiff “to provide a defendant with some       24       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. indication of the loss and the causal connection that the plaintiff has in mind,” not to make a conclusive proof of that causal link. Dura, 544 U.S. at 347; see id. (explaining that the requirement is not intended to “impose a great burden” on a plaintiff). At this stage of the proceedings, FGIC is not required to establish that the collateral it has identified as selected by Magnetar was the exclusive cause of its losses; rather, it need only allege sufficient facts to raise a reasonable inference that Magnetar’s overall involvement caused an ascertainable portion of its loss. In addition, the assets identified in the SAC are only those that, without the benefit of discovery, FGIC claims to have evidence that Magnetar selected. FGIC alleges that Magnetar exercised control over the entire collateral selection process. See, e.g., SAC ¶ 4; J.A. 186. Nor is FGIC required to allege that its losses were caused solely by Putnam’s misrepresentations to satisfy its but      for pleading       25       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. obligations.2 “Of course, if the loss was caused by an intervening event [here, the market downturn] . . . the chain of causation will not have been established. But such is a matter of proof at trial and not to be decided on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.” Emergent Capital, 343 F.3d at 197. At this preliminary stage, accepting all factual allegations in the SAC as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in FGIC’s favor, FGIC has plausibly alleged that Putnam’s misrepresentations caused at least some of its losses. That Pyxis defaulted around the time of a global financial crisis was central to the District Court’s loss causation analysis. Certainly, when a “plaintiff’s loss coincides with a marketwide phenomenon causing comparable losses to other investors, the prospect that the plaintiff’s loss was caused by the fraud” is lessened. See Lentell, 396 F.3d at 174. We observe that there may be circumstances under which a marketwide economic collapse is itself caused by the conduct alleged to have caused a plaintiff’s loss, although the link between any particular defendant’s alleged misconduct and the downturn may be difficult to establish. See, e.g., Fin. Crisis Inquiry Comm’n, The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report 190–95 (2011) (concluding that the role of synthetic CDOs and distorted incentives of CDO managers and hedge funds “contributed significantly” to the financial crisis); Permanent Subcomm. on Investigations of the S. Comm. on Homeland Sec. & Govt’l Affairs, 112th Cong., Wall Street and the Financial Crisis: Anatomy of a Financial Collapse (2011). Because the SAC does not contain factual allegations to this effect, we take no view as to whether such circumstances are presented here. 2       26       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. B. Sufficiency of Other Fraud Allegations On appeal, Putnam asserts other, separate grounds on which to affirm the District Court’s judgment: that the SAC fails to allege a strong inference of fraudulent intent and fails to plead an actionable misrepresentation or omission. These arguments are meritless and warrant little discussion. Putnam contends that FGIC does not provide a “plausible explanation for why Putnam would engage in a billion      dollar fraud.” Brief for Defendant      Appellee at 38. The SAC specifically alleges, however, that Putnam was motivated to cooperate with Magnetar’s scheme in exchange for unusually lucrative collateral management fees and additional business. See SAC ¶¶ 6, 46      52, 110       12; J.A. 186, 201      03, 227      28. Although Putnam argues that these fees did not provide a financial incentive to commit fraud, such an argument raises a factual dispute that is inappropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss.       27       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. We also reject Putnam’s argument that FGIC fails to allege an actionable misrepresentation or omission by Putnam. As described above, FGIC has alleged that Putnam represented that it would select and manage the assets for the Pyxis portfolio independently and in the interests of long investors, representations that FGIC contends were false. II. Negligence Claims FGIC also argues that the District Court erred in dismissing its negligent      misrepresentation and negligence claims for failure to sufficiently allege a special or privity      like relationship between FGIC and Putnam. FGIC’s negligence      based claims require that it establish that Putnam owed it a “duty to speak with care.” Kimmell v. Schaefer, 89 N.Y.2d 257, 263      64 (1996). Under New York law, such a duty exists in the commercial context when “the relationship of the parties, arising out of contract or otherwise, is such that in morals and good conscience the one has the right to rely upon the other for information.” Id. at 263 (quoting Int’l Prods. Co. v. Erie R.R. Co., 244       28       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. N.Y. 331, 338 (1927)); see Anschutz Corp. v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 690 F.3d 98, 114 (2d Cir. 2012) (explaining that New York law strictly limits negligent      misrepresentation claims to “situations involving actual privity of contract between the parties or a relationship so close as to approach that of privity” (internal quotation marks omitted)). It is undisputed that there was no actual contractual privity between FGIC and Putnam. FGIC contends that Putnam nevertheless owed it a duty of care under this Court’s holding in Bayerische Landesbank v. Aladdin Capital Mgmt. LLC, 692 F.3d 42, 59      61 (2d Cir. 2012). In Bayerische, we held that an investor in a CDO could bring a negligence action against the defendant CDO manager in the absence of any contractual privity. In examining the scope of the “orbit of duty” to third parties, we stated that “a plaintiff must establish that (1) the defendant had awareness that its work was to be used for a particular purpose; (2) there was reliance by a third       29       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. party known to the defendant in furtherance of that purpose; and (3) there existed some conduct by the defendant linking it to that known third party evincing the defendant’s understanding of the third party’s reliance.” Id. at 59 (citing Credit Alliance Corp. v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 65 N.Y.2d 536, 551 (1985)). We reasoned that Bayerische had sufficiently alleged that the CDO manager “was aware that its work as Portfolio Manager would be relied on by Bayerische, a non      party to the contract” and that Bayerische had relied on the CDO manager’s representations, made during a meeting at the CDO manager’s offices in New York, that it would “competently and effectively protect Bayerische’s interests.” Id. at 60. The District Court distinguished Bayerische, finding “the investing relationship” between the CDO manager and the third       party notes holder in Bayerische to be “much closer in scope and shared goals than the one a guarantor of a transaction has with a       30       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. CDO manager.” FGIC, 2014 WL 1678912, at *13. We disagree. Just as in Bayerische, FGIC alleges that Putnam repeatedly represented that it would select and manage the assets for the Pyxis portfolio independently and in the interests of long investors, which were aligned with FGIC’s interests. Before FGIC agreed to insure credit protection on Pyxis, it met with Putnam representatives at Putnam’s offices in Boston. FGIC alleges that it relied on representations made by Putnam in issuing the Pyxis Guaranty, and that, without the credit protection it provided, Pyxis would not have closed. We find, therefore, that the SAC plausibly alleges facts evincing Putnam’s understanding that FGIC would “rely on [Putnam’s] care and competence in managing” the Pyxis portfolio. Bayerische, 692 F.3d at 60. Further, to the extent the District Court read Bayerische to recognize a special relationship only where “the end and aim” of the transaction was to benefit the plaintiff, FGIC, 2014 WL 1678912, at       31       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. *13, we here clarify that the “end and aim” language in Bayerische is a useful rephrasing of the three elements of the special      relationship test, but is not an independent requirement. See Bayerische, 692 F.3d at 60 (discussing three elements and stating “[p]ut another way, plaintiff must show that the benefit to the non      party was the end and aim of the transaction” (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Sykes v. RFD Third Ave. 1 Assocs., LLC, 15 N.Y.3d 370, 373 (2010) (discussing three elements for special relationship and omitting mention of “end and aim”). The District Court also noted that statements in the written materials provided to FGIC by Putnam “expressly disclaim any creation of a special duty.” FGIC, 2014 WL 1678912, at *12. The Pyxis pitchbook states that Putnam was not “acting as a financial advisor” or in a “fiduciary capacity” and the Pyxis offering memorandum urges investors to “rely on their own examination of the co      issuers and the terms of the offering, including the merits and       32       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. risks involved.” Id. These disclaimers do not preclude the finding of a special relationship between FGIC and Putnam. First, FGIC’s claims are not premised on Putnam’s acting as a fiduciary or financial advisor to FGIC. FGIC alleges that Putnam fraudulently represented that it would select the collateral for Pyxis and that it would do so independently and in good faith. As these disclaimers do not disclose the possibility that Putnam would cede control of the collateral selection process to other market participants with interests adverse to long investors, they “fall well short of tracking the particular misrepresentations alleged” by FGIC. Caiola v. Citibank, N.A., N.Y., 295 F.3d 312, 330 (2d Cir. 2002) (holding, in context of securities fraud claim, that general disclaimers did not bar plaintiff from relying on defendant’s oral statements); cf. HSH Nordbank AG v. UBS AG, 941 N.Y.S.2d 59 (1st Dep’t 2012) (affirming dismissal of claim where plaintiff alleged defendant bank misrepresented risk involved in transaction but contractual       33       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. documents were “replete with detailed disclosures” of risks involved and defendant’s conflicts of interest). Second, the disclaimers, which urge investors to conduct an “examination” of the terms of the offering, only underscore the significance of Putnam’s representations within those offering documents, which FGIC alleges were themselves fraudulent. See SAC ¶¶ 86      87; J.A. 217. Given that a determination of whether a special relationship exists is a “factual inquiry,” FGIC’s allegations are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. Suez, 250 F.3d at 104 (reversing dismissal of negligent      misrepresentation claim where conflict between alleged oral representations and disclaimer could not “be resolved on the pleadings”). Accordingly, we hold FGIC has plausibly alleged a special relationship between itself and Putnam, sufficient to state claims for negligent misrepresentation and negligence.       34       FIN. GUAR. INS. CO. V. PUTNAM ADVISORY CO. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the District Court’s dismissal of the complaint and remand for further proceedings.       35

OPINION
ROBERT W. SWEET, District Judge.
Defendant Putnam Advisory Company, LLC ("Putnam" or the "Defendant") has moved to compel the production of four categories of documents from Plaintiff Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("FGIC" or the "Plaintiff"). For the reasons set forth below, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.
Prior Proceedings
This is the first major motion since remand in this common-law fraud and misrepresentation case, in which FGIC, a stock insurance company, alleges that Putnam made false representations about, or negligently mismanaged, a collateralized debt obligation ("CDO") named Pyxis ABS CDO 2006-1 ("Pyxis"). (See Second Amended Complaint (the "SAC"), Dkt. No. 22.) An extensive summary of FGIC's claims and allegations is available in the Court's April 28, 2014 Opinion. Fin. Guar. Ins. Co. v. Putnam Advisory Co., LLC, No. 12 Civ. 7372, 2014 WL 1678912, at *1-7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2014).
FGIC initiated this case on October 1, 2012, with the filing of a Complaint that was subsequently amended. (Dkt. Nos. 1 & 4.) On December 21, 2012, the Defendant filed a motion to dismiss (Dkt. No. 9), which was heard on March 21, 2013 and granted by an Opinion dated September 10, 2013. Fin. Guar. Ins. Co. v. Putnam Advisory Co., No. 12 Civ. 7372, 2013 WL 5230818 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 2013). That Opinion gave leave to replead, and FGIC subsequently filed its Second Amended Complaint (Dkt. No. 22), the pleading which remains operative. Putnam filed a new motion to dismiss on October 15, 2013 (Dkt. No. 23), which was heard on November 20, 2013 and granted by the April 24, 2014 Opinion. FGIC, 2014 WL 1678912. The Plaintiff appealed the dismissal to the Second Circuit, which reversed and remanded in an opinion dated April 15, 2015. Fin. Guar. Ins. Co. v. Putnam Advisory Co., LLC, 783 F.3d 395 (2d Cir. 2015). After the case returned to the District Court, Putnam filed its answer on May 15, 2015 (Dkt. No. 45), and discovery commenced.
The instant motion to compel discovery was filed by Putnam on August 25, 2015. (Dkt. No. 52.) FGIC filed its opposition papers on September 1, 2015 (Dkt. No. 55), Putnam replied on September 3, 2015 (Dkt. No. 57), and the motion was heard on October 7, 2015.
Applicable Standard
Federal district courts have broad discretion in deciding motions to compel. See Grand Cent. P'ship. Inc. v. Cuomo, 166 F.3d 473, 488 (2d Cir. 1999). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 states:
Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense-including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any documents or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons who know of any discoverable matter. For good cause, the court may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action.
If a party objects to discovery requests, that party bears the burden of showing why discovery should be denied. Freydl v. Meringolo, 09 Civ. 07196(BSJ) (KNF), 2011 WL 256608-7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2011). Specifically, the resisting party must show how, "despite the broad and liberal construction afforded the federal discovery rules, each request is not relevant, or how each request is overly broad, burdensome, or oppressive, by submitting affidavits or offering evidence revealing the nature of the burden." Sokol v. Wyeth, Inc., No. 07 Civ. 8442, 2008 WL 3166662, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2008). Where the party responding to the motion agrees to provide the discovery requested, a motion to compel becomes moot. See, e.g., Decker v. Nagel Rice LLC, 716 F.Supp.2d 228, 236 (S.D.N.Y. 2010).
The Motion to Compel is Granted in Part and Denied in Part
Putnam seeks to compel FGIC's production of four categories of documents: 1) post-closing documents concerning the Pyxis CDO; 2) documents regarding FGIC's damages, including the deed of settlement that gave rise to the alleged damages in this case, and documents relating to other transactions that might have been included in that settlement; 3) a set of documents concerning FGIC's other investments in CDOs and Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities; and 4) documents relating to a firm of economic consultants used by FGIC to analyze Putnam's management of the Pyxis CDO, whose work FGIC referred to in the SAC and in its Second Circuit briefing.
Post-Closing Documents
In its motion to compel, Putnam seeks documents from FGIC created after the closing of the Pyxis transaction that reflect FGIC's surveillance or monitoring of the Pyxis collateral. (D.'s Br., Dkt. No. 53, at 6.) In its opposition papers, FGIC agreed to turn over the documents requested. (Pl.'s Opp. Br., Dkt. No. 55, at 8.) Putnam's reply papers evince no objections to FGIC's disclosure. (See D.'s Reply Br., Dkt. No. 57, at 9-10.) Since the respondent has agreed to provide the requested discovery, the motion to compel has been mooted. See Stinson v. City of New York, No. 10 Civ. 4228, 2015 WL 4610422, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2015); Decker v. Nagel Rice LLC, 716 F.Supp.2d 228, 236 (S.D.N.Y. 2010).
Damages-Related Documents
Putnam also seeks a category of documents regarding FGIC's alleged damages. Analysis of the merits of this request requires an examination of the structure of the Pyxis transaction, in particular a $900 million credit default swap between the Pyxis CDO and Calyon, the bank that structured and issued the CDO. Under the swap, Calyon performed the role of credit protection buyer, paying premiums to Pyxis in exchange for payments from Pyxis if the assets in Pyxis' portfolio suffered negative credit events.1 (See SAC ¶ 45.) Meanwhile, Calyon sought credit protection from FGIC, engaging in a credit default swap with FGIC's wholly-owned subsidiary, FGIC Credit Products LLC, with FGIC itself insuring all of its subsidiary's payments. (See id. ¶¶ 62-63.) FGIC alleges that the transaction would not have closed without its agreement to provide that insurance (id. ¶ 64) and that it only did so in reliance on Putnam's representations about its management of Pyxis' portfolio. (Id. ¶ 180.)
Of relevance to the instant motion, FGIC stated in its Amended Rule 26(a) disclosures that it seeks damages based on its payments under a Termination Agreement that settled its obligations to Calyon. (Dkt. No. 54, Ex. 2, at 6.) The text of the Termination Agreement, however, indicates that it is a settlement of claims based on Pyxis and [REDACTED\] (Dkt. No. 54, Ex. 4, at 6.) Putnam seeks four subcategories of damages-related documents: 1) a "Deed of Settlement" between FGIC and Calyon which it argues gave rise to the Termination Agreement; 2) documents concerning the [REDACTED\], 3) documents concerning the [REDACTED\], and 4) documents relating to a CDO transaction named Havenrock II, a separate FGIC transaction in which it used Pyxis CDO notes as collateral. (D.'s Br. at 12.)
In its opposition brief, FGIC limits its objections to disclosure of the Deed of Settlement and documents concerning Havenrock II. It contends that the Termination Agreement and the Deed of Settlement are unrelated, and that the latter document is concerned only with the Havenrock II transaction. As to Havenrock II, FGIC concedes that the CDO referenced Pyxis in its portfolio, but notes that the Havenrock transaction took place "mere months after Pyxis closed, and before [FGIC] became aware of Putnam's fraud." (Pl.'s Opp. Br. at 11.) The parties differ as to whether Havenrock is relevant to the damages in this action; FGIC states that the two matters are entirely separate, while Putnam cites in its reply brief to two incidents where FGIC at least implied that Havenrock-related damages made up part of the relief it is seeking in this action. Either way, no matter when the alleged fraud was discovered, FGIC's decision to increase its exposure to Pyxis, several months after closing and presumably after conducting due diligence in evaluating a new investment, does warrant scrutiny. That decision, and the data and reasoning that went into it, is relevant to the extent and reasonableness of its reliance on Putnam's representations.
In its briefing, FGIC indicated its willingness to turn over documents relating to the Havenrock II transaction "to the extent that any . . . reference Pyxis." (Pl.'s Opp. Br. at 11 n.9.) This concession is insufficient; Havenrock documents are subject to discovery if they relate to Pyxis or Putnam, whether or not they reference those terms by name. See U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. PHL Variable Ins. Co., No. 12 Civ. 6811, 2013 WL 1728933, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 22, 2013). As to the Deed of Settlement, although the parties dispute whether it relates to the Termination Agreement, and thus to FGIC's alleged damages, it is FGIC, as the party resisting discovery, that bears the burden of establishing that the document is not relevant, see Sokol v. Wyeth, Inc., No. 07 Civ. 8442, 2008 WL 3166662, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2008). Because FGIC has not carried that burden, the Deed of Settlement must be produced.
Documents Relating to FGIC's Portfolios
Putnam is also seeking documents concerning FGIC's other CDO and RMBS investments, outside of and unrelated to Pyxis. After FGIC objected to these requests as burdensome and overbroad, Putnam agreed to limit its requests to 1) a list of all RMBS or ABS (Asset-backed Securities) CDOs to which FGIC was exposed from January 2006 through the filing of the SAC; 2) documents showing the losses suffered by FGIC on those investments; and 3) any memoranda submitted to FGIC's credit committee, structured finance committee, or other equivalent committee seeking approval of each such transaction. (D.'s Br. at 14-15.) Putnam argues, without citing to any authority in its main brief, that these documents bear on FGIC's sophistication, and on whether it "blindly" relied on Putnam's representations regarding Pyxis. (Id. at 14.) Putnam also contends in its reply brief that these documents are relevant to loss causation. (D.'s Reply Br. at 6.)
Inquiry into this area is denied because FGIC's general knowledge of the market is "too tenuously related to any plausible defense to be a proper subject of discovery." Assured Guar. Mun. Corp. v. UBS Real Estate Sec., Inc., No. 12 Civ. 1579, 2012 WL 5927379, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 21, 2012). FGIC's decisionmaking regarding CDOs that are completely unrelated to Pyxis would have limited probative value, if any, while the documents sought, describing CDO-related losses incurred during a period of financial crisis where such losses were rampant, are likely to be at least significantly burdensome to produce. FGIC shall produce to Putnam a list of the mortgage- and asset-backed CDOs to which it was exposed and a good-faith estimate of the total losses suffered from the area as a whole, but no further discovery into unrelated investments will be required at this time.
FGIC's Economic Analysis
Lastly, Putnam seeks the production of an economic analysis commissioned by FGIC for this litigation. Although expert reports and other such documents prepared for the purpose of litigation are normally covered by the attorney-client and work product privileges, Putnam contends that FGIC waived any such protection when it cited to and quoted from the analysis in the SAC, and when it used the report in its Second Circuit briefing.
In Paragraph 122 of the SAC, FGIC declares that it retained a firm of economic analysts to assess the likelihood that a suspicious pattern of referenced securities in Pyxis and other related CDOs could have occurred by chance, rather than by design. That paragraph also includes three bullet-pointed quotations from the analysis, concluding that the pattern "may indicate that the portfolio selection by independent portfolio managers was influenced by an external factor," that "the probability of this happening by chance across independent portfolio managers is less than 1 in a billion," and that the likelihood was similar to that observed in cases involving fraudulent options backdating. The analysis was referenced in order to show that the selection of financial instruments in Pyxis' portfolio was in fact conducted in conjunction with Magnetar Capital LLC ("Magnetar"), a hedge fund with a short position in Pyxis, with the goal of having Pyxis fail, creating a profit for Magnetar. See id. FGIC also referred to the report in its briefing before the Second Circuit.2
Both the attorney-client and work product privileges may be waived if a party puts the privileged communication at issue by relying on it to support a claim or defense. Koumoulis v. Independent Fin. Mktg. Grp., Inc., 295 F.R.D. 28, 40 (E.D.N.Y. 2013). FGIC has done so here; by utilizing the report in the SAC and before the Second Circuit, it waived its right to object to disclosure of the report's contents. See United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 239-40 (1975); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 219 F.3d 175, 191 (2d Cir. 2000) ("the Court in Nobles found it crucial that the [party] elected to make affirmative use of the report and then shield it from scrutiny").
In its briefing, FGIC attempts to rehabilitate the privilege over the report by promising not to utilize the analysis in the future, including at trial. (Pl.'s Opp. Br. at 17.) It cites to the Appellate Division, First Department's holding in MBIA Insurance Corp. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 93 A.D.3d 574, 575 (1st Dep't 2012) for the proposition that mere reference to a privileged document in a pleading does not amount to a waiver of privilege. However, that opinion also based its holding on the fact that the party asserting the privilege did not "need the privileged materials concerning the review to sustain its causes of action." Id.; see also Ambac Assur. Corp. v. DLJ Mortg. Capital, Inc., 92 A.D.3d 451, 452 (1st Dep't 2012) (finding no at-issue waiver from use of consultant report where the complaint could stand even if all references to it were stricken). Viewed under that standard, the reference to the analysis in FGIC's complaint, standing alone, does not constitute a waiver. However, by referring to the analysis during the Second Circuit's review of this Court's decision on the motion to dismiss — in which the Circuit determined that FGIC's allegations were "sufficient to state claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and negligence," FGIC, 783 F.3d at 402 — FGIC has already used the report to sustain its causes of action, rendering MBIA distinguishable.3 Since FGIC "inject[ed] the contents of a privileged communication into the litigation" by utilizing it in connection with a dispositive motion, the "at issue" waiver applies. See JA Apparel Corp. v. Abboud, No. 07 Civ. 7787, 2008 WL 111006, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 10, 2008); RLS Assocs., LLC v. United Bank of Kuwait, PLC, No. 01 Civ. 1290, 2003 WL 1563330, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2003).4
Having determined that there was a waiver, it is necessary to determine its scope. In its motion to compel, Putnam is seeking "all documents concerning the `economic consultant' analysis," including 1) any reports, 2) any documents provided to the consultants in preparation for the reports, 3) any communications between FGIC, its lawyers, and the consultants, and 4) documents sufficient to identify the consultants and their qualifications. (D.'s Br. at 15, 15 n.6.) The determination of the scope of a waiver of the attorney-client and work-product privileges "lies within the sound discretion of the district court." Convole, Inc. v. Compaq Computer Corp, No. 00 Civ. 5141, 2006 WL 2788234, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2006). Here, the scope of the waiver should be drawn narrowly.
Under Federal Rule of Evidence 502(a), a disclosure of privileged information only extends to undisclosed materials if 1) the waiver was intentional, 2) the disclosed and undisclosed communications or information concern the same subject matter, and 3) they ought in fairness to be considered together. The 2007 advisory committee notes to Rule 502 provide further guidance, explaining that a voluntary disclosure "generally results in a waiver only of the communication or information disclosed; a subject matter waiver [] is reserved for those unusual situations in which fairness requires a further disclosure of related, protected information, in order to prevent a selective and misleading presentation of evidence to the disadvantage of the adversary." These considerations are not present here; although FGIC may have put the analysis itself at issue by utilizing it in litigation, there is no indication that its disclosure was done in an incomplete, manipulative, or misleading manner, and none of the ancillary documents that Putnam seeks were utilized in the SAC or before the Second Circuit. FGIC is therefore only required to produce the analysis document referred to in the SAC.
Conclusion
Putnam's motion to compel is granted in part and denied in part, as set forth above.
It is so ordered.


FootNotes 
1. Calyon then passed its short position (the ability to profit if Pyxis did poorly) on to other parties. See id.

2. Although FGIC did not directly cite to Paragraph 122 of the SAC in its Second Circuit briefing, it does repeatedly assert that it had independently confirmed without discovery that Pyxis' collateral was not selected independently, but rather for Magnetar's benefit, a clear reference to the economic analysis. (See, e.g., FGIC. App. Br., Decl. of Thomas A. Arena, Dkt. No. 58, Ex. 4, at 32.) The briefing also cites Paragraph 158 of the SAC, which also references the analysis. (Id. at 33.)

3. FGIC contends that its discussion of the economic analysis in its appellate papers should carry no weight because the analysis played no role in the Circuit's decision. While Judge Straub's opinion does not directly cite any of the SAC paragraphs that reference the analysis, it does extensively discuss FGIC's allegations that Putnam's selection of the Pyxis collateral was not independent and conducted in favor of Magnetar, an assertion that the analysis was conducted to support. See FGIC, 783 F.3d at 399-401.

4. In its discussion of "at issue" waiver, FGIC cites to only one case in which the party resisting discovery used privileged material in connection with a dispositive motion, as opposed to merely in a pleading. That case, Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 293 F.R.D. 244 (D. Mass. 2013), was decided under Massachusetts law, id. at 254, although it did extensively analyze several New York cases. To the extent that Mass Mutual stands for the proposition that a party cannot place a document at issue by utilizing it in connection with a dispositive pretrial motion, the Court disagrees with that holding.
