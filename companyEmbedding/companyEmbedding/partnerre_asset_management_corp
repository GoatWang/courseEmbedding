											About Us
										

True Partnership






Personally Invested in your Success
Reinsurance is a relationship business and we continually strive to live up to the promise of our name, PartnerRe, and to be the reinsurer that clients and brokers go to for a resourceful risk-discussion partner.  Watch our Brand Story to find out more about how we help insurance companies succeed.  

Partnership Starts with a Conversation
Partnership has always meant long-term stability and delivering on promises. While those qualities remain important, we believe we can do more. We know our experience, expertise and track record are only meaningful if we are able to help our clients, and that is only possible if we know what they want, what they need and what they expect. So our clients can count on us to listen carefully to their goals and challenges and to leverage our deep resources in order to deliver an appropriate solution.
In addition to our core reinsurance offerings, we are able to meet a wide variety of needs. Below are some case studies giving examples of solutions we have tailored to meet the needs of individual clients as well as broader markets.


Cut-through Facility
Protects Key Accounts
A rating downgrade threatened our client’s key accounts. We reacted immediately to help protect their business as they sought to transition back to a stronger financial position.


Data Analytics Achieves
Top Market Position
Despite an exceptional service offering, our client faced strong price competition in a mature market. Our analytics experts unlocked and restructured their data to substantially improve their group life rates and increase their competitiveness.


Loss Portfolio Transfer
Enables Growth
Our client had identified a growth opportunity to enter a new market and line of business. They needed additional capital. A customized LPT was the perfect solution.


New Health Product Answers
the Call of Affordable Care
Our clients were concerned about the assumption of significant risk arising from the Affordable Care Act (ACA). We developed a new, cost-effective ACO insurance product, enabling them to assume extra risk AND invest in important cost-saving initiatives.


Capital for a Recovering
Mortgage Sector
After the financial crisis, we helped mortgage insurers with unique capital relief solutions, ensuring they were well positioned to benefit from new growth opportunities.


New Range of Health Services
to Manage Escalating Costs
With client concerns about mounting medical claims costs, we expanded our risk solution, PULSE + Plus™, to include an even wider range of services for risk assessment, medical and catastrophic claim management and cost containment.

Opinions & Research





This award-winning, free App was developed by PartnerRe for property insurance underwriters, insurance portfolio managers, actuaries and intermediaries. The App visualizes the physical parameters of thousands of worldwide past, and potential future, extreme storm events. It is a valuable go-to reference for comparing storm events with exposures in property insurance portfolios and, where applicable, for considering the potential impact of the current ENSO forecast.
The latest version of PartnerResearch is fully updated with 2015-2016 storm data and includes the newly added functionalities of (1) ENSO tagging and (2) examples of generated extreme storm events that have not occurred within the historical experience period, but which are physically possible.

Wind field of a stochastic 1-in-250 year storm affecting central Europe.Wind field of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 hitting Miami, Florida.

At a touch:

View the path, extent and intensity of over 4,700 historic extreme storm events, some dating back 116 years, from Australia, Central Pacific, Eastern Pacific, North West Pacific, North Atlantic and Europe.
For tropical cyclones, find out whether a storm occurred in an “El Niño”, “La Niña” or “ENSO-neutral” period. For any location, identify exactly how many storms occurred within each ENSO state. Consider what this could mean for a portfolio given the current ENSO forecast.
View the path, extent and intensity of 147 generated “stochastic” storms for the U.S., Europe and the Caribbean – these are exceptional, 1-in-250 year storm events that have not yet been recorded, but which are physically possible. How, for example, do these compare with the historically recorded storms for a location? How might this impact PML calculations?
Easily select, compare and/ or save storms by name, location and year. See how many storms have affected a particular area and how severe they were. How did one storm compare to another? e.g. for Miami, how did the maximum wind speed of Hurricane Donna (1960) compare to Hurricane Andrew (1992)? Or for Japan, how did Typhoon Vera’s geographical footprint (1959) compare to that of Typhoon Mireille (1991)?

The App was developed by PartnerRe, incorporating wind fields from its advanced proprietary models.

											About Us
										

True Partnership






Personally Invested in your Success
Reinsurance is a relationship business and we continually strive to live up to the promise of our name, PartnerRe, and to be the reinsurer that clients and brokers go to for a resourceful risk-discussion partner.  Watch our Brand Story to find out more about how we help insurance companies succeed.  

Partnership Starts with a Conversation
Partnership has always meant long-term stability and delivering on promises. While those qualities remain important, we believe we can do more. We know our experience, expertise and track record are only meaningful if we are able to help our clients, and that is only possible if we know what they want, what they need and what they expect. So our clients can count on us to listen carefully to their goals and challenges and to leverage our deep resources in order to deliver an appropriate solution.
In addition to our core reinsurance offerings, we are able to meet a wide variety of needs. Below are some case studies giving examples of solutions we have tailored to meet the needs of individual clients as well as broader markets.


Cut-through Facility
Protects Key Accounts
A rating downgrade threatened our client’s key accounts. We reacted immediately to help protect their business as they sought to transition back to a stronger financial position.


Data Analytics Achieves
Top Market Position
Despite an exceptional service offering, our client faced strong price competition in a mature market. Our analytics experts unlocked and restructured their data to substantially improve their group life rates and increase their competitiveness.


Loss Portfolio Transfer
Enables Growth
Our client had identified a growth opportunity to enter a new market and line of business. They needed additional capital. A customized LPT was the perfect solution.


New Health Product Answers
the Call of Affordable Care
Our clients were concerned about the assumption of significant risk arising from the Affordable Care Act (ACA). We developed a new, cost-effective ACO insurance product, enabling them to assume extra risk AND invest in important cost-saving initiatives.


Capital for a Recovering
Mortgage Sector
After the financial crisis, we helped mortgage insurers with unique capital relief solutions, ensuring they were well positioned to benefit from new growth opportunities.


New Range of Health Services
to Manage Escalating Costs
With client concerns about mounting medical claims costs, we expanded our risk solution, PULSE + Plus™, to include an even wider range of services for risk assessment, medical and catastrophic claim management and cost containment.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Our Latest Thinking











Identifying the main drivers of long-term change is key to investment success in the 21st century. We believe we are at the beginning of a secular growth phase for the U.S. economy driven largely by the rebalancing of global growth from the developed to the developing world. We focus on the long-term drivers, the macro forces and investment themes at play across industries that are taking us into the next growth cycle.
