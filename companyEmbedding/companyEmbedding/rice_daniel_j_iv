Good morning and welcome to the Rice Energy Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Danvers, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Julie E. Danvers - Director-Investor Relations
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining Rice Energy's Third Quarter Conference Call.
Before we begin I'd like to remind you that our remarks, including the answers to your questions, contain forward-looking statements, and we refer you to our earnings release for a detailed discussion of these forward-looking statements and the associated risks.
In addition, during this call we do make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to applicable GAAP measures can also be found in our earnings release.
A few administrative items to quickly cover. First, we have a new investor presentation available for download on our website that's updated to include third quarter results. Second, we will file our 10-Q after market close this afternoon, which will be accessible through our website or the SEC's EDGAR system. Lastly, we will be presenting in the Jefferies Energy Conference next week in Houston and the Capital One Energy Conference in December in New Orleans and look forward to seeing you there.
I will now turn the call over to Daniel Rice IV, Chief Executive Office of Rice Energy.
Daniel J. Rice IV - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me for our prepared remarks is Gray Lisenby, our Chief Financial Officer. And with us to help answer your questions at the end of today's call are Toby Rice, President and Chief Operating Officer; Derek Rice, Executive Vice President of Exploration; and Rob Wingo, Senior Vice President of Midstream and Marketing.
To briefly recap this morning's announcements, Rice reported strong third quarter results. We increased 2015 production guidance, achieved a $100 million borrowing base increase and successfully completed the dropdown of our Water Services business to Rice Midstream Partners for $200 million.
Similarly, Rice Midstream Partners reported solid third quarter results and announced the pricing of a $175 million private placement of RMP common units. In addition, RMP increased 2015 guidance to reflect the water acquisition and higher gathering throughput, EBITDA and DCF coverage. RMP will host a conference call to discuss these results in more detail at 11:00 AM Eastern today.
Before Gray and I cover our third quarter financial and operational results, I want to briefly speak to our positioning in this challenging commodity price environment, one that's expected to persist into 2016. This market has certainly rendered many Appalachian areas uneconomic and has forced most producers to shift development to other areas or, in the case of producers who have no economic acreage at current prices, suspend their development altogether. As a result, there has been a noticeable shift in producer activity away from liquids-rich and non-core dry gas Marcellus and Utica areas and into the Marcellus and Utica's dry gas cores.

Our company is unique because we haven't needed to change our focus. We're investing in the same areas today as we were when gas prices were much higher. And I think we may be the only company in Appalachia whose strategy and focus has remained the same during this price cycle.
This distinction is important to note because, even though we're in the same commodity price environment as everyone else, each company came into this commodity price environment prepared differently. We think we came in more prepared than most, and our preparation is unique and advantaged in several key ways.
First, 100% of our current and planned investments generate healthy returns of 20% to 30% at strip pricing. Second, we have one of the strongest hedged positions through 2017. Third, our firm transportation portfolio has been properly sized to meet, but never exceed, our production growth. And lastly, we've built and we control a best-in-class midstream business in the dry gas cores of the Marcellus and Utica, with a growing list of customers that value our service and quality of our assets.
Our assets make economic sense in good markets and bad, and this fact shapes our sentiment towards two topics: M&A and the emerging super deep dry gas Utica play in Pennsylvania.
With M&A, we've always considered ourselves an opportunistic company that can move swiftly and aggressively if the right acquisition comes along that makes strategic and economic sense. Even though 100% of our acreage is in areas where producers want to be and we've maintained a pretty deep inventory of drilling locations across these areas, we're always looking for ways to create more value for our shareholders. And therefore, we're always evaluating opportunities in Appalachia, which we happen to be seeing a lot more of in this market. But none that we've seen to-date are more strategic or economic than focusing our efforts on the development of our existing asset base. We'll continue to monitor opportunities, as we feel we are uniquely positioned to capitalize when the right opportunity comes along, but we haven't just seen it yet.
An interesting development that we're monitoring, though, is the Pennsylvania Utica. As we mentioned a few months ago, our pilot hole data from our initial Pennsylvania Utica well, the John Briggs 50U, revealed the rock quality in Southwest Pennsylvania was nearly identical to the world-class Utica we're seeing in Belmont County, Ohio.
The only discernible difference between the two is the more favorable pressures and depths in Pennsylvania, which is approximately 3,500 feet deeper. It's worth mentioning that although this is our first Utica well in Pennsylvania, it's not our first time dealing with this reservoir. We view this well as a natural extension of our Ohio operations and not a completely new play for us.
In order to leverage our knowledge about this reservoir from Belmont County, we designed this Greene County well to have the same parameters as our Bigfoot 9H well in Belmont County, including drilling and completion designs as well as our plan to flow this under a restricted rate. This allows us to expedite our assessment of this well and draw definitive conclusions sooner.
Because of similar rock qualities to what we've observed in Ohio, we expected our first PA Utica well would demonstrate a similar decline profile as our Ohio Utica wells, but starting with a higher flowing casing pressure.
Slide three in this morning's presentation shows this well's performance based on casing pressure versus cumulative production per 1,000 foot of lateral compared to Bigfoot 9H and another peer's Utica well east of us in Greene County, Pennsylvania. Our 5,800 foot lateral took a bit longer to clean up during the initial flowback period, which we think contributed to the steeper drop in casing pressure early on. But our primary focus has been the decline profile once the well has reached a stabilized flow rate. After 60 days of clean-up we've stabilized the flow rate at 12 million cubic feet per day with decline profiles exactly in line with what we've observed from adjacent Greene County wells and our Belmont County Utica wells. Based on our current production and pressure information, we expect this well to produce flat at 12 million cubic feet per day for approximately 750 days.

This well is shaping up to be the strongest well Rice has ever drilled and we're highly encouraged for what this resource could mean for Rice and our Midstream business.
And it's worth talking through our initial game plan for the Pennsylvania Utica. Our first step was determining whether or not the resource was there. The John Briggs 50U answered that one with a resounding yes.
The second step is determining how to increase these wells' economics in order to compete with our capital that's currently being allocated entirely to our deep inventory of high-returning Marcellus and Ohio Utica locations. Based on this well's performance, we think there's more room for improvement on costs than from production and so higher single well returns will need to come from driving down well costs.
Getting up the learning curve with $20 million to $30 million wells is an expensive proposition and we think Pennsylvania Utica has the potential to eventually compete with our Marcellus and Ohio Utica returns, but this isn't the right market to really begin its development.
Our upstream and midstream teams, however, are poised to take advantage of this emerging opportunity. The best part is we don't really need to do much to position ourselves for its success. We already have a sizeable acreage position in the core of the Pennsylvania Utica, of which a decent amount is held by our Marcellus production and we control a midstream business that's built a gathering system that was intentionally oversized to handle any volumes we push their way.
We're excited about this play. We have the right pieces to make it a success and we'll begin developing when that time is right, but for 2016 we'll stick with the development of our low-risk high-return Marcellus and Ohio Utica wells. Our teams will continue to evaluate John Briggs 50U and offset peers' (08:49) wells in preparation for our return to PA Utica.
In terms of near to medium-term supply, since these are Marcellus players diverting capital away from Marcellus development, PA Utica production growth really just replaces what would've otherwise been Marcellus production growth and therefore, we do not believe that this is an additive source of supply to the basin.
Turning over to our operations for the third quarter. Operationally we had a great third quarter, bringing wells online ahead of schedule at or below budget. Our third quarter net production averaged 609 million cubic feet per day, which was a 15% increase from second quarter 2015 and 147% increase relative to third quarter 2014. As we noted in our earnings release, 2.8 Bcf of this net production was a working interest adjustment of which a portion was from a prior quarter. To explain, a non-operated working interest owner in our Digger wells in Ohio couldn't pay their working interest share of well costs and they agreed to trade their acreage in these units for non-strategic undeveloped Utica acreage of ours. And to be clear, the partner in question wasn't Gulfport who continues to show strong conviction to its operations in Belmont County.
In terms of real production during the quarter, we came in slightly ahead of expectations due to a few operated Marcellus wells and Gulfport non-operated Utica wells being turned to sale sooner than anticipated. We updated our 2015 production guidance range to 515 million cubic feet equivalent per day to 525 million cubic feet equivalent per day to reflect these updates.
In the Marcellus during the third quarter we turned 14 wells to sales with an average lateral length of 6,940 feet and these wells are currently producing approximately 120 million cubic feet per day. Our average costs for these wells was approximately $1,029 per lateral foot, achieving our yearend goal of $1,150 per foot.

In late October we turned online two net wells in Washington County, one Marcellus and one Upper Devonian well, with average lateral lengths of approximately 3,700 feet. These wells were designed as pilot test wells to better understand the interaction between the Marcellus and Upper Devonian reservoirs. For the year, we expect to turn to sales 34 net Marcellus wells which is reflected in our updated guidance slide on page seven of our third quarter slide deck.
We continue to be proud of our teams' continued hard work this year staying ahead of schedule and reducing oil costs. As we start sharpening our pencils around 2016 spending and production, we expect to exit 2015 with 21 Marcellus wells in development that will contribute to our 2016 growth.
Shifting to the Ohio Utica. We did a great job in the first half of the year, getting all of our planned 2015 wells to sales when gas prices were better than they are today. And our drilling activity in the second half of 2015 sets the table for production growth in 2016 that's economically advantaged by virtue of our hedge and FT positions.
Through September 30 we have turned to sales 14 gross, 10 net operated Utica wells. Our first Utica well, Bigfoot 9H, has been online since June 2014 and to-date has cumulatively produced over 7 Bcf. Casing pressure is approaching line pressure and the flow rate should begin declining soon. By the time of our next earnings call we will be able to provide some early time data on the well's production decline. It's amazing to think we've been developing the Utica since 2014 and have yet to see any declines from any of our 14 producing Utica wells. I think this really speaks to the quality and consistency of the rock and our execution.
Slide 10 in our presentation includes updated production information as of September 30 for our 16 producing operated Utica wells. Last quarter we shared with you our managed choke test we were conducting on our Gold Digger and Son-Uva-Digger wells to determine flow rates to optimize long-term production. As highlighted in these charts, we choked back the flow rates on our Digger wells by approximately 20%, and in doing so observed a noticeable improvement in pressure declines from each pad.
We have another 90 days of production data from these wells now at these flow rates, and can draw some more definitive conclusions. The first conclusion is choking these wells back results in a longer flat period, which should really come as no surprise, but what we're seeing is we're actually able to produce more during this flat period than we would have produced had we flowed these wells at a higher rate. We haven't yet quantified the impact to EURs, but generally speaking more flat period production should lead to higher EURs.
Now that we've fully transitioned to pad drilling mode, we're able to highlight our team's technical proficiency and capital efficiency in what is emerging as the dry gas core of the Utica shale.
Drilling times have come down relative to 2014, and in 2015 we're averaging 30 days to drill a well compared to 45 days in 2014. We expect to exit 2015 with 26 operated wells in various stages of development, and will finish completing these wells by the middle of 2016. Similar to the Marcellus, we're able to achieve impressive production growth protected by our advantaged hedge position and access to good markets supported by our FT contracts on pipelines such as TETCO and Rockies Express.
Shifting to takeaway in midstream, we're very content with our firm transportation portfolio. And we think we've done a good job selecting our markets and balancing exposure to Appalachian pricing.
We see 12 Bcf to 15 Bcf a day of incremental takeaway capacity coming online through 2017 concurrent with producers slowing their development. Our analysis suggests that long-haul pipeline capacity will eventually surpass in-basin production, which should result in Appalachian basis (14:38) improving faster than expected during the next 24 months. As a result, our expected production growth in excess of our firm transportation will greatly benefit from this anticipated recovery in pricing.

Shifting to our midstream operations, total throughput for the third quarter for our Pennsylvania and Ohio gathering systems increased over 12% above second quarter 2015 to approximately 990,000 dekatherms per day.
Third quarter throughput consisted of 23% third-party volumes, primarily from two of our customers: EQT in Pennsylvania and Gulfport Energy in Ohio. RMP's third quarter throughput was 671,000 dekatherms per day, while our Ohio gathering system gathered 319,000 dekatherms per day. Our Ohio gathering buildout is ahead of schedule, as we completed our main trunkline last quarter, providing total throughput capacity of 2.6 million dekatherms per day that will access TETCO, REX, Dominion East Ohio and ET Rover in order to deliver our gas to the Gulf Coast and Midwest markets.
Our Pennsylvania and Ohio water systems are fully operational, providing fresh water from the Monongahela River, the Ohio River and other regional water sources to Rice and other third-party producers for completions. Our water systems provide meaningful operational and economic benefits by improving the completions process and reducing the need for more expensive water trucking services.
As we announced this morning, we're pleased to announce that we have successfully completed our first dropdown transaction with RMP, as they acquired our water services business. This transaction represents the first of several potential monetization events that we believe will illuminate the value of our extensive and growing midstream systems. Through this accretive dropdown to RMP, we're able to continue funding midstream development without impacting E&P liquidity, including funding our recently-announced planned midstream joint venture with Gulfport in Ohio.
Taking a closer look at the dropdown transaction, RMP acquired Rice's water services business for $200 million, which includes our Pennsylvania and Ohio freshwater distribution systems and related facilities as well as the right to provide fresh water for well completions and handle flowback and produce water. The terms of the agreement include a one-time $25 million earnout payment by RMP, less any associated CapEx once Rice adds 5 million gallons per day of water sources in Ohio by the end of 2017.
In early October, we also announced that Rice entered into a letter of intent with Gulfport Energy to form a midstream joint venture to provide gas gathering, compression and water services to 77,000 acres of Gulfport's Eastern Belmont and Monroe acreage in Ohio, including acreage recently acquired from Paloma and American Energy – Utica. The gas gathering system will have 1.8 million dekatherms a day of design capacity and consist of approximately 165 miles of high and low pressure gathering pipelines with multiple interconnects, including Rockies Express, ET Rover, TETCO and Dominion East Ohio. In addition, the JV will construct a freshwater distribution system to deliver fresh water to Gulfport's pads for well completion operations.
Over the next six years, Rice and Gulfport plan to collectively invest $520 million in gathering and compression assets as well as an addition $120 million in water assets, with each partner funding their respective share. Rice has already commenced construction of certain portions of the system and expects to begin flowing volumes by middle of 2016, with more significant volumes by year-end 2016.
Through this JV, we will expand our relationship with Gulfport across their core position in the Ohio Utica Shale and we believe this business will be one of the largest dry gas gathering systems in the prolific dry gas core of the Utica. This business adds to our attractive inventory of dropdown candidates, further diversifies our midstream customer base, and highlights the quality of our midstream service and ability to leverage our existing assets to obtain additional third-party business.

I'll now turn the call over to Gray to discuss our financial results.
Grayson T. Lisenby - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thanks, Danny. During the quarter, our net production averaged 609 million cubic feet per day, which was a 147% increase over third quarter 2014 and a 15% increase above second quarter 2015. As described in the news release, 30 million a day of our third quarter production was related to buying out the working interest in a few of our Ohio Utica wells from one of our non-operative partners for approximately $25 million.
We brought online a total of 14 net wells during the quarter. Net production exceeded our third quarter guidance also as a result of bringing online an additional eight net wells that were originally planned for the fourth quarter.
Approximately 68% of our third quarter production was Marcellus and 32% Utica. Our pre-hedged realized price was $2.32 per Mcf, which includes our basis differential of negative $0.38; FT, fuel and variable expense of $0.14 per Mcf; and BTU uplift of $0.11 per Mcf.
Including the impact of our hedges, our adjusted post-realized hedge price was $3.18. We generated approximately $119 million in EBITDAX on a consolidated basis and adjusted net income of roughly $4 million or $0.03 per diluted share.
During the third quarter, we incurred approximately $153 million of D&C CapEx, $25 million of organic leasehold and $60 million of midstream CapEx, excluding RMP.
This morning we provided updated 2015 CapEx reflecting slightly reduced spend in the Marcellus and a $60 million increase in our Utica program, attributable to the positive working interest adjustments and accelerated Gulfport operated activity and faster cycle times in our drilling program.
For our retained midstream CapEx budget, we are increasing it from $210 million to $300 million to reflect our new Gulfport midstream joint venture and updated Ohio gathering project activity and costs. These costs are expected to be fully funded by our available borrowings under our retained midstream credit facility and midstream cash flows.
Turning to some recent events, effective October 30, 2015, the borrowing base under our upstream credit facility was increased by $100 million to $750 million dollars, representing a 15% increase. Yesterday, Rice Midstream Holdings received $200 million from RMP as consideration for our water service business acquisition.
Looking at our September 30, 2015 balance sheet and liquidity pro forma'd for the water transaction and private placement, we exited the quarter at 2.2 times third quarter net debt to run rate EBITDA on a fully consolidated basis and 2.6 times on an E&P basis. Our liquidity position was $1.2 billion, consisting of $845 million of E&P liquidity and about $320 million of retainments from liquidity.
Our FT portfolio and active hedge program continues to support our cash flows and protect our strong returns. In the third quarter 76% of our production received favorable Gulf Coast, TCO and Midwest pricing which translated to a basis differential of $0.38 compared to a wider local basis of around $1.50 for the quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2015 we expect to deliver approximately 87% of our gas to more favorable markets outside of Appalachia as a result of an additional 311,000 dekatherms per day of FT projects coming online in late third quarter. We have 95% of our fourth quarter production hedged at a weighted average floor of $3.78 per MMBtu based on the midpoint of our updated guidance. We have a very strong 2016 hedge position and now have approximately 490,000 dekatherms per day hedged at a weighted average floor price of $3.50 per MMBtu.
In terms of guidance, we increased our full year 2015 production guidance to 515 MMcf to 525 MMcf per day and expect to bring online 46 net wells for the year. We expect to come in at the higher end of our production guidance. Also, we increased our E&P G&A expense and lowered our LOE expense guidance for the year.

For the fourth quarter, we expect net production to average 515 million cubic feet per day to 540 million cubic feet per day. This is an 8% decrease from our adjusted third quarter production of approximately 580 million cubic feet per day, excluding the out-of-period working interest adjustments.
Looking ahead to 2016 from a budget perspective, we are still evaluating our plans for next year and we'll release formal guidance in February.
Our D&C investments are predicated on two primary factors: creating economic returns and maintaining an appropriate balance sheet; and we're confident that we'll be able to do that with the plan that we lay out. Based on the way the market looks today, our planned D&C investments in 2016 have a 20% to 30% IRR at current strip prices and will drive cash flow in 2017 through 2019.
On the balance sheet side, we will continue to target 3.5 times E&P leverage and have various ways to manage this metric. Our robust hedging position in 2016 will mute a majority of our EBITDAX at (23:59) gas prices and for us the two biggest levers to manage our debt will be our upstream CapEx and midstream monetizations.
Our midstream value continues to grow and we have a significant amount of retained midstream value in the core of the Utica along with untapped GP value.
To summarize, Rice's financial and strategic goals are to create shareholder value with a focus on returns and downside protection. This is the same consistent goal we've had since IPO. Our returns-centric strategy is 100% focused on core acreage and consistent well execution that predictably and profitably grows our business throughout the commodity cycles. This focus on returns results in cash flow growth, balance sheet improvement and the byproduct, not the driver, is sustained longer term production growth. To protect our economics we're very well hedged and we have a measured firm transportation portfolio that covers the vast majority of volumes, but not in excess of them. On the balance sheet side we are well positioned with current leverage of 2.6 times.
Daniel J. Rice IV - Chief Executive Officer & Director

Question-and-Answer Session

Our first question is from Neal Dingmann at SunTrust.
Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Morning, guys. Danny, I know you don't have official plans out yet for 2016, but I guess just sort of two questions around that versus the kind of 60-ish type of wells you're going to spud this year. Thoughts, given the efficiencies that you've had, I'm just wondering any type of numbers you might have for next year.
And then secondly, as far as areas that you might focus, you mentioned obviously looking at the Utica in PA, your thoughts about potentially drilling such as up in Washington.
Grayson T. Lisenby - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
On the wells, spud will be in the general ballpark of what we did this year. On the second question I'll turn it over to Danny.
Daniel J. Rice IV - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I mean, I think we're becoming somewhat agnostic to whether we're drilling Pennsylvania Marcellus or Ohio Utica wells. The returns there are becoming a lot more comparable now, and so it's really just going to be dictated by the rig schedule that we run in each area.
In terms of Pennsylvania Utica and drilling more wells there, I think we're super content just sitting back and just watching the production data from this first well. I think kind of the nice thing that we have going for us is we're going to have peers that are going to do a lot of the derisking all around our position in Washington and Greene's. So there's really nothing that's compelling us to want to go out there and derisk this area for ourselves when we know that there's going to be other folks around us doing it for us.

Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Sure. That makes sense. And then just secondly, for either you or Gray, just wondered how you think about next year given sort of the leverage you have now and kind of what you're looking at potential out-spend. How do you think about your plan depending on different natural gas price sensitivities out there? Again, you obviously have the dropdown opportunities like we saw today; so how does that factor in on either a leverage ratio you're comfortable with running or a cash flow out-spend type of sensitivity you're ready to do?
Grayson T. Lisenby - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, Neal, we really focus on leverage, first and foremost, and right now, we're well positioned well below 3 times and our target, as it has been since IPO, is to make sure we're targeting around 3.5 times and are confident we'll put out a budget next year that does that. Obviously, we don't put out a budget until February, to take into the second part of your question of what gas prices ultimately turn out to be, but we're very well hedged for next year, so like we said, we're, I think, protected from some of that risk.
Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Got it. Thank you, all.
Grayson T. Lisenby - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President

Our next question comes from Holly Stewart at Scotia Howard Weil.
Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.
Good morning, guys, Julie. First, I guess on the midstream side, you mentioned the release at the Ohio system is ahead of schedule. Any update on timing of that? And then how does that impact your thoughts just around the timing of the drop?
Robert R. Wingo - Senior Vice President-Midstream & Marketing
Sure. Hey, Holly. This is Rob Wingo. So the trunklines in Ohio are all constructed, both the water and the gas. So at this point really all we're going to have are the two mile or less pad connects.
Grayson T. Lisenby - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
On the drop side, we're still targeting back half of next year. Obviously, it will depend on market conditions and a lot of other things, but that's still the general target.
Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.
Okay. And then I guess my follow-up would be on the JV with Gulfport. You've given the CapEx range for the next six years. Can you provide any color just on how that sort of falls, certainly in the earlier years?
Grayson T. Lisenby - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. We're still, again, finalizing that budget for next year as well, but it will definitely be much more front-loaded, especially the first two years, so 2016 and 2017. So that's definitely our expectations. Final numbers, we're still working on.
Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.
Okay. Great. Thank you.
Robert R. Wingo - Senior Vice President-Midstream & Marketing
The only thing I would add is maybe a third of that gets spent next year. That could go up or down based on timing, but assume a third of that $600 million gets spent next year.
Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.
That's good. Thank you, Rob.

The next question comes from Leo Mariani at RBC.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, guys. I was hoping you could kind of walk us through the moving pieces on the lower fourth quarter 2015 production here. Is that just largely driven by a lack of completions? And maybe you could also kind of speak to operated versus non-operated expectations.
Grayson T. Lisenby - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yep. So just the way the year shaped up, we had about a little over 70% of our net wells come online in Q2 and Q3. So that obviously resulted in some higher Q3 production and a little bit lower Q4 production. On the net wells online, it will pretty much all be Marcellus and don't have much Utica either operated or non-operated coming online in the fourth quarter.

Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And I guess looking at your first Pennsylvania Utica well, I guess you guys sound like you're flowing at 12 million cubic feet a day. You guys are flowing some of the Ohio wells at 16 million a day. Are you just limited by gathering infrastructure? I just wanted to get a sense of why their rate is a bit different there.
Daniel J. Rice IV - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. This is Danny. I mean, we typically flow our wells based on a rate per 1,000 foot of lateral. Obviously, the Utica wells we're drilling in Ohio, a lot of them are 9,000 feet, 10,000 feet, up to 12,000 feet and so we're flowing those on a rate per 1,000 foot of lateral. This well, our first well in Pennsylvania Utica, was only a 5,800 foot lateral, and so we're still flowing it at essentially 2 million per 1,000 foot of lateral, which is the same rate that we flowed Bigfoot 9H at. So it's in line with the other wells on a per lateral foot basis and we're super encouraged by what the decline profile looks like at that rate.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Can you guys talk to HBP issues over the next couple of years as well, in terms of what you need to do to manage leasehold?
Daniel J. Rice IV - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I think when we look at just laying out our development plan and just looking at the quality of the rock, both in the Marcellus and the Utica, I think one of the really unique things that we have is because we have such a concentrated acreage position, there's not much just geologic difference across our position. And so for us we have to pick one variable to base our development program around and so the most least arbitrary way to do it was, okay, well, let's prioritize our development based on HBP schedule. Not that we have near-term leasehold expirations, but you have to prioritize your development around something and so that was the metric that we picked our development program around. So we're developing around our HBP but we're still a couple years out before we really start to see any type of leasehold expirations. So it's kind of a non-issue for us, so we're kind of in a good position right now.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thank you.

The next question is from Tim Rezvan at Sterne Agee.
Timothy A. Rezvan - Sterne Agee CRT
Hi. Good morning, folks. Had a question on the dropdown of the water services business. I know you all stated you think the midstream assets are not reflected in the share price possibly from an NAV perspective. But looking at traditional EV EBITDA multiples, sale multiple is well below where your shares trade whether you're looking at 2015 or 2016 estimates. So I guess the question is how do you define this as accretive? And what made you decide that this was the right decision right now?
Grayson T. Lisenby - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yep. First of all, every drop is different. On this particular drop I think one thing to think back to is when the water EBITDA was created about a year ago, this was previously a capitalized item in conjunction with our wells. So 2015 was the first year that we had water EBITDA. So if you think back just on a more holistic and historical basis, we do think it was very accretive because we were taking a capitalized item and creating EBITDA with it that subsequently got dropped for $200 million. So I understand where you're coming at if it had always been a part of our cost structure and our EBITDA profile, but it wasn't a year ago and then it was for 2015 and then we dropped it. So when we think about it in that context, we think it's a great move for both parties.

Timothy A. Rezvan - Sterne Agee CRT
Okay. I appreciate that color. And then I guess moving forward, will we see that impact flowing through on LOE as we move into 2016?
Grayson T. Lisenby - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
No. So this – because late last year we did separate the businesses, these are part of our well cost, and those have been reflected in all of our 15 wells. So you won't see it show up. Our LOEs, or really more primarily, well cost, have already been including the separation of our water business.
Timothy A. Rezvan - Sterne Agee CRT
Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.

The next question is from Kevin Maccurdy at Heikkinen Energy Advisors.
Kevin Moreland Maccurdy - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC
Good morning. I'm curious on how you guys are estimating the ultimate hyperbolic declines on the Utica wells given the continued flat production and if you think how you manage the choke makes a difference to the eventual decline.
Daniel J. Rice IV - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. No, I think that's a great question, Kevin. I think to be honest, it's one that we don't even know what the true answer is going to be until we actually start to see some decline from this Bigfoot well. We are going to start seeing that data hopefully in the next couple of weeks. I think we are just as eager as you guys are to begin really sharpening what our type curve is going to look like for the Utica. But again, it's still early and we are going to let the data really dictate what this thing looks like.
Kevin Moreland Maccurdy - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC
And so you don't think how you manage the choke changes what the eventual decline would be?
Daniel J. Rice IV - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, I think it certainly does. I mean, if we let this well rip from day one at just open flow you are going to have a much higher initial decline. But you are also going to have that much higher initial decline because you are starting from a much higher flow rate to begin with. So when we are choking these wells back, yeah, we are not going to have the same absolute type of decline as a well that's wide open, but on a relative basis, on a percent of decline basis, there's nothing that we are seeing that would suggest that it should be much shallower than those types of wells. But only on a relative basis, if that makes any sense.
Kevin Moreland Maccurdy - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC
Yeah. I appreciate the color. Thanks.
Daniel J. Rice IV - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yep.

The next question is from Gordon Douthat at Wells Fargo.
Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Morning, everybody. I jumped on the call a bit late, so I apologize if you covered this earlier. But my question has to do with on some – the gathering systems in the Pennsylvania side. Some of your peers that have drilled the dry gas Utica have talked about the need for a high-pressure gathering system in addition to one they already have in place for the Marcellus. And if you were to embark on a more robust development program in the Utica on the Pennsylvania side, how do you see that, the pressure differences between the Utica and the Marcellus and the potential need for gathering playing out into that development process?
Robert R. Wingo - Senior Vice President-Midstream & Marketing
Yeah. Sure. This is Rob. We definitely oversized our system both for third-party opportunities and for opportunities like the Utica. So we expect very little capital will be required if we or others turn to Utica then we start gathering it. We might have some short pad connects into suction or compression, but other than that, the pipe's got plenty of capacity and is ready to go.
Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Would the pressures in the Utica being higher than that in the Marcellus constrain some of your Marcellus production? Or how does that dynamic play out?
Robert R. Wingo - Senior Vice President-Midstream & Marketing
Yeah. That's what I was referring to with pad connects into the suction or discharge of compression. We might instead of tying those pads into the low-pressure trunklines, we might just carry them on to the discharge side of the compression. So again, really no impact to our Marcellus wells.
Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.

Our next question is from Dan Braziller at Jefferies.
Daniel C. Braziller - Jefferies LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the water dropdown and results. I was just wondering on slide 18 of the supplemental, I think this is the first time you guys have shown 2017 guidance. It seems to imply very strong growth. Can you just comment on some of the assumptions that went into deriving the 40% in-basin pricing in 2017? Thanks.
Grayson T. Lisenby - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Are you talking about page 11?
Daniel C. Braziller - Jefferies LLC
The basis exposure and realized pricing slide, 40% DTI, M2, M3. Yeah.
Grayson T. Lisenby - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yep. That's just we do expect our production to continue to grow beyond 2016. So we just bake in our expectations into our base exposure to get a realistic number out there.
Daniel C. Braziller - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Sure. It just seems like a fairly large jump to 40% from 23%. Is that mostly just – that's just production growth as opposed to any firm falling off or expiring?
Grayson T. Lisenby - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. There are some projects, some FT projects that come online in late 2017 that we still expect to come online that we've risked the timing for conservatism. So that number could very much shrink. It's not our FT profile necessarily dropping off, but probably just conservatism on our part of when FT comes on. So I think if people stay on time, which is the most likely outcome, I think you'd see that red bar shrink.
Daniel C. Braziller - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Thanks.

Daniel J. Rice III’s Side Business of Natural Gas Production Got Sold for $6.7 billion to EQT Corp

By admin -   June 20, 2017 152 0

Daniel J. Rice III step down from his money-spinning position with BlackRock Inc. five years back due to pressure from the board of directors for running a parallel business with his sons under the name of Rice Energy Inc. But no one thought that the decision would be so profitable for him in today’s time where that business got sold for $6.7 billion to EQT Corp. After the takeover announcement on Monday, EQT Corp Inc. becomes the largest natural gas producing firm in the US exceeding to Exxon Mobil Corp. Daniel Rice III seems to be very happy with the performance of all three sons who are currently the executives of the company.
According to the deal, they would receive $1 billion as a share of a deal for their family’s stake in the Rice energy Inc. Shale production is in high demand in the US and this future prediction of Mr. Rice a decade ago benefited him in the long run. He risked his high profile position and money to enter the shale production sector and sowed the seed of Rice Energy Inc. with the help of his three sons. Daniel J. Rice IV, 36, Toby, 35, and Derek, 32 contributed and supported the dream of Mr. Rice and got that dream come true by converting it into a billion dollar company. Separation from BlackRock Inc. didn’t harm Mr. Rice professionally or financially and proved to be a good decision in his favour. But it didn’t work well for BlackRock Inc. for $12 million. Because they were fined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for not informing or disclosing Rice’s participation in Rice Energy Inc.
But it was too late to catch hold of Rice because he already was on the verge of becoming a billionaire and got his company listed on the stock exchange in January 2014. Rice Energy Inc’s addition to the EQT Corp Inc is going to set the foot print for the company to enhance their skill sets to explore their opportunities to get much ahead of other competitors in the production of shale gas. Their aggressive approach helped them to get deeper to 1 billion cubic feet production of shale gas on a daily basis. They were the first one to utilize high end technology and big data analytics to predict the demand and supply of the shale gas which ensured they always stayed ahead of their competitors in the race.

PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
