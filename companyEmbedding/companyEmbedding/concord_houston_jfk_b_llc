I visited several used car lots in the local  area to see were i might find a good car at an affordable price. Arriving at the caubles auto sales, I was greeted by a verry nice salesman, shook my hand, introduced hiimself and to look around and if i had any questions just let him know. ( now thats what i like, " no pressure") so off i go to splurge the car lot. after viewing several very nice and well maintained cars on the lot, i beganed him the , I  to realize that no matter what car i looked  at or how old the car was they were all only driven between eitght and ten thousand miles a year.  (excellant) . the salesman returned, asked me if i seen anythig that i liked, I showed him the truck that i wanted, he gave me a price, I knew that I saw a couple trucks on other lots a not as nice for a little less maybe, but they had double the miles. I told him my credit was not that great, he said " well eveeryone has some credit , but not all of it can be bad" . the owner worked with me to get in the truck, and I have no regrets. they also were very understandding when i went through hard times and was not able to make a payment. Since then I have bought a car for my wife and my daughter from the caubles and they are the best cars we have ever owned.Toyota Scion of Concordyahoopaul ratedI recently purchased a new 201...I recently purchased a new 2013 Toyota Tacoma from Toyota of Concord. All the initial discussion and negotiation was done via the internet or phone. I drove to the dealer with the the price pre-negotiated and signed the paperwork to finalize the deal. Overall the experience was good and I would recommend this dealer. Communication was good. Expectations were set prior to the transaction. And the salesman facilitated me through the process. I am a picky car buyer, so I insisted the car be specifically what I wanted. The salesman (Titus H.) was able to find the exact truck I wanted in production and have it delivered. Expectations were set ahead of time that it would take several weeks to get the truck from the factory in Texas, but it actually arrived ahead of schedule. I was offered an extended warranty, but the dealer did not try to make a hard sell on it (I declined the extended warranty). Background info: My transaction was a cash transaction without a trade-in, so the transaction was made simple. I also knew exactly what vehicle I wanted when I began the negotiating process, so the salesman didn't have to educate me on Toyota's available vehicles. I can't rate the dealer or salesman on this aspect.Toyota Scion of ConcordOlivia B. ratedMy buying experience with Toyota Scion of Concord was awesome! I had my car over at the VW dealership having a repair done, and decided to go across the street and see what they could do about getting me in a new car. I still owed on my last car, and wasn't really prepared to buy a car when I went in. I figured I wouldn't be able to get out from under the car I was paying on. Josh Cannon, my salesman, said we should take a look at cars and see what they could do for me anyway. He was great. We drove a few cars, and I found one I LOVED. I wouldn't have even seen it if we hadn't walked the used car lot to see what else was out there. He and Dave Parker worked with me and were able to get me into an almost new car for what I was paying on my last car! It really was a GREAT experience all the way around. Everyone was so nice and I spoke to a few other salesman who just stopped to say hi. I will continue to come back here to buy cars, though I hope I won't have to give up my new car any time soon! Thank you so much! Indian Motorcycle ConcordPhil G. ratedWe all know that in sales the sales agent will say whatever it takes to make the sale than you're on your own.   NOT THIS TIME !!!!I HAVE a year old Polaris 4wheeler that is out of warranty for 3 months -  Called Polaris they listened but were not very helpful so I contacted RIDE NOW keeping in mind I was pretty much going to handle the warranty costs myself. At 5:50pm Nicky from P/S called me & turned it all around.   Got me transferred to Casey in service and started the repair process.  Thanks to the unity at the dealership with Nicky, Stephen,  Eric, Casey & Polaris my machine was repaired quickly & professionally at no cost to me.  I would have to say my opening sentence is not the norm at POWER SPORTS.   MY THANKS TO YOU ALL         PHIL Toyota Scion of ConcordOmar M. ratedExcellent customer service and accomodation to nearby mall while awaiting repairs on my vehicle.  The added touch of a complimentary car wash after car repairs is a really nice incentive.  I provided feedback about obtaining coupons specific to my vehicle's upcoming repairs and Management responded.  I am usually afforded a discount because of those coupons.  Donyel Stewart was my Customer Service Representative and he was very pleasant.  He took the time to explain the necessary repairs and did not present himself as the typical salesman.  Although this is a part of the business, his caring disposition overshadowed that aspect.  Great experience and fantastic customer service.  Toyota Scion of ConcordDavid G. ratedOn initially arriving at Hendrick Toyota Scion in Concord i was a bit disappointed that the car I wanted had been sold. We drove 2 1/2 hours from VA so I figured i salvage the trip and at least look around. We were introduced to our sales person Leon. From the time we met, to the time we signed the contract on our 2012 Camry we were respected, listened to, and genuinely felt cared about. I can't thank Leon enough for taking such good care of us, taking the time to answer all of our questions, and treating us respectfully. He is a very knowledgeable and professional sales person. Thank you Leon and Hendrick Toyota for taking care of us. 6+ stars!Toyota Scion of ConcordSylvia R. ratedThis is the first time buying a car (new) and i chose Hendrick Toyota Scion of Concord .Wow ive been into alot of car dealerships and this one won hands down .The sales team member Mark Higdon wanted me to have the car i wanted and after i sign the paper work all the sale men congrad me on my car that made me feel great .There was never a time that  they made me feel like i didnt matter .An i chose to use there  service  dept   an they are so nice and care for me an my car as if i was one of the family .If i had to buy another car this is the place i would go i will always be #teamHendricktoyotaScionofConcordToyota Scion of Concordsharibabee ratedFantastic customer service,  wonderful facility, knowledgeable staff and huge selection of inventory.  Just purchased a 2014 4Runner from Michael Hamrick,  and we love our new 4Runner.  If you are looking for a new car,  start with Toyota Scion Concord, and ask for Michael Hamrick,   you won't be disappointed.  No haggling or pressure,  just honest customer focused.  Additionally if you are in the market for a new car the Hendrick family of dealerships, in my opinion is far superior to any dealership in the Charlotte AreaModern Hyundai Of ConcordJoseph W. ratedI had a great experience at Modern Hyandai the complete opposite of every other dealership I've been to in the last 2 months. I got the car I wanted with a payment I can afford. Jimmy, Justin, and Anane all stayed an hour after they closed to help me and even got me a lower interest rate the day after the sale, who else does that? I love my new Elantra and recommend them highly. Oh, and free NC inspections as long as I own the car, sweet.Speedway Harley-DavidsonMichael C. ratedMy name is Mike Clinton and My wife and I love Speedway Harley Davidson. The staff has been very  helpful, kind and courteous every time we visit, I purchased my first Harley Davidson Fat Boy at Speedway Harley Davidson of Concord and have been very pleased  with my bike. I highly recommend stopping by and checking out their great selection of new and pre owned Harleys as well as their great  selection of apparel
