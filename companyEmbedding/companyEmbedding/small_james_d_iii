Overseas Shipholding Group Appoints James D. Small III As Senior Vice President, Secretary And General Counsel






Business Wire




Feb 17, 2015 8:45 AM EST













 




























































  Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. (NYSE MKT:OSGB) (the "Company" or "OSG") today announced the appointment of James D. Small III as Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel, effective in March. Most recently, Mr. Small was a counsel with Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP ("Cleary Gottlieb") in its New York office, where his practice focused on U.S. securities laws and corporate and financial matters. He replaces James I. Edelson, who will assume responsibility for Governmental Affairs.  "James Small has been a valuable legal advisor to OSG during the transformative events of the past few years, and he has the right background to support the next phase of OSG's corporate development," said Ian T. Blackley, President and CEO of OSG. "His securities law, capital markets, and corporate governance experience will be invaluable to us. He knows the company well, and has the confidence of our Board and management. We all look forward to welcoming him to our executive team."  "I am looking forward to this new role," Mr. Small said. "I have worked with OSG as it made a difficult financial and operational transition, and I believe this is an exciting time to join the Company."  "Jim Edelson has been instrumental in our transition," said Ian Blackley. "He is also important to the Company's future success and we are very pleased to have someone of his experience in this new role while continuing to provide legal advice on maritime, Jones Act and other business matters."  At Cleary Gottlieb, Mr. Small's practice focused on corporate and financial transactions, U.S. securities law matters in U.S. and international capital markets transactions, mergers and acquisitions, and general corporate transactions. Mr. Small was recognized by The Legal 500 U.S. for his capital markets practice.  Mr. Small also advised companies on corporate governance matters and co-authored numerous articles on disclosure practices, securities law and corporate governance.

Overseas Shipholding Group Appoints James D. Small III as Senior Vice 
      President, Secretary and General Counsel






February 17, 2015 08:45 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. (NYSE MKT:OSGB) (the “Company” or 
      “OSG”) today announced the appointment of James D. Small III as Senior 
      Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel, effective in March. Most 
      recently, Mr. Small was a counsel with Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton 
      LLP (“Cleary Gottlieb”) in its New York office, where his practice 
      focused on U.S. securities laws and corporate and financial matters. He 
      replaces James I. Edelson, who will assume responsibility for 
      Governmental Affairs.
    


      “James Small has been a valuable legal advisor to OSG during the 
      transformative events of the past few years, and he has the right 
      background to support the next phase of OSG’s corporate development,” 
      said Ian T. Blackley, President and CEO of OSG. “His securities law, 
      capital markets, and corporate governance experience will be invaluable 
      to us. He knows the company well, and has the confidence of our Board 
      and management. We all look forward to welcoming him to our executive 
      team.”
    

      “I am looking forward to this new role,” Mr. Small said. “I have worked 
      with OSG as it made a difficult financial and operational transition, 
      and I believe this is an exciting time to join the Company.”
    

      “Jim Edelson has been instrumental in our transition,” said Ian 
      Blackley. “He is also important to the Company’s future success and we 
      are very pleased to have someone of his experience in this new role 
      while continuing to provide legal advice on maritime, Jones Act and 
      other business matters.”
    

      At Cleary Gottlieb, Mr. Small's practice focused on corporate and 
      financial transactions, U.S. securities law matters in U.S. and 
      international capital markets transactions, mergers and acquisitions, 
      and general corporate transactions. Mr. Small was recognized by The 
      Legal 500 U.S. for his capital markets practice.
    

      Mr. Small also advised companies on corporate governance matters and 
      co-authored numerous articles on disclosure practices, securities law 
      and corporate governance.
    

      He joined Cleary Gottlieb in 1996, became counsel in 2008, and worked in 
      the firm’s New York, London and Hong Kong offices. Prior to the 
      commencement of his legal career, Mr. Small was an analyst at the 
      Central Intelligence Agency.
    

      Mr. Small received a J.D. (with distinction) from Stanford Law School in 
      1996, where he was the Senior Editor (Ombudsperson) of the Stanford Law 
      Review and a member of the Stanford Journal of International Law. Mr. 
      Small graduated with a B.A. in Astrophysics and Political Science from 
      Williams College in 1990. He is a member of the Bar in New York.

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Conditions TreatedAbdominal DisordersBleeding DisordersBlood DisordersBlood Disorders in PregnancyBone DisordersBrain DisordersBreast DiseasesBreech PositionCancerCervical CancerCervical PolypsCervicitisEctopic PregnancyEncounters for Normal PregnanciesEndometriosisFemale InfertilityGenitourinary Tract Infections in PregnancyGestational DiabetesGynecologic CancerHemorrhoidsHypertensionHypertension Complicating Pregnancy, Childbirth and PostpartumIntrauterine Growth RestrictionMaternal AnemiaMenstrual Disorders (incl.
