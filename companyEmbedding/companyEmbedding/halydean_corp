Perpetual, tax-exempt ownership & civil rule[3]

Halydean had many incarnations, with reorganiszations and even a redomicile. It is unique in that it was founded by the Crown, owned by the Catholic Church, then owned by the state, then owned privately,[7] and is now soon to be listed as a publicly traded company.[8] Under feudalism, Halydean had the legal authority of "pit and gallows," which is to say, to carry out the death sentence. The original charter also specified that the organization was tax exempt. Halydean was rivaled in Scotland only by St Andrews, another barony owned by the Catholic Church. [9]
Name & Etymology[edit]
At the time of its creation, Halydean was owned by the Catholic Church. It was controlled by the Kelso Abbey, in the Royal Burgh of Roxburgh, Scotland. The Dean (Christianity) of the abbey was called the "Holy Dean," and the agricultural & grazing lands given to the Monks of Selkirk became known as The Barony and Lordship of Halydean.[10]
History and age of company[edit]
The company states that it has "more than 100 years of operational history," [11] which refers to the age of its subsidiaries, however, there are well documented legal records showing that the entity had its establishment in 1128 C.E., by the 17th great grandfather of one of the current directors,[12] with holdings primarily consisting of thousands of acres of grazing land.[13][14][15][16][17] This is substantially older than Harvard College, which has been described as the new world's oldest corporation, established in 1636.[18][19] The oldest companies in the world for tea, sake, metalworking, and pharmacy were all established after 1128, the year of Halydean's establishment.[20] Lorillard Tobacco Company is listed as the oldest public American company, having been established in 1760.[21] The Tuttle Farm was established in the 1630s by King Charles II, and is the oldest continually operating business in the US.[22] Based on that information, it can be argued that Halydean is a very old company, although it is unknown whether or not it may hold the claim as the oldest publicly traded company in the world. The company has not made any such claim. The company is on Wikipedia's List of oldest companies. In 1545 Halydean's ownership was appropriated by the Crown, rechartered, and eventually assigned to new owners in 1602,[23][24] and in 2014 Halydean Corporation was organized as a Delaware corporation, as a wholly owned subsidiary of The Barony and Lordship of Halydean (Scotland) by the current Lord of Halydean.[25] Almost immediately following that, numerous other shareholders were appointed, such that the company has to use a stock transfer agent.[26] Halydean Corporation is classified in the UK as a "subsidiary undertaking" of the Barony and Lordship of Halydean, as defined in section 1162 of the Companies Act 2006. [27] This is unclear if Halydean Corporation should lay claim to the title oldest company on Wall Street, but it legally establishes the company as having a dignified pedigree in land holdings that can be traced to the year 1128 C.E.
Today[edit]
Halydean Corporation is an agricultural land holding company that specializes in dairy and beef production. The company invests in the dairy industry.[28] The following SIC codes may apply to Halydean Corporation: 02410000 Dairy farms, 02120000 Beef cattle (except feedlots), 42120102 Farm to market haulage (local), and 51430000 Wholesale Trade - Nondurable Goods Dairy products, except dried or canned. Subsidiaries include trucking / milk hauling, farm land, dairy operations, heifer replacement breeding, academic research, and beef cow breeding using artificial insemination with sexed semen for F1 hybrid crosses.
Environmental Activism[edit]
The company participates in wastewater treatment research. These systems speed up the digestion of manure products into useful co-products such as fertilizer for cleaner air and water.[29] The company promotes environmentalism which is economically profitable.[30]

Notable ownership[edit]
Below is a list of past owners of Halydean Corporation, which is diverse.


Owner
Year
Manner in which held


The Church
1128
Perpetual, tax-exempt ownership & civil rule[3]


The State
1545
Royal Burgh, held by the Crown[4]


Private property
1602
Proprietorship of Barony & Lordship[5]


Corporate shareholders
2014
Corporation owned by many shareholders[6]


Halydean had many incarnations, with reorganiszations and even a redomicile. It is unique in that it was founded by the Crown, owned by the Catholic Church, then owned by the state, then owned privately,[7] and is now soon to be listed as a publicly traded company.[8] Under feudalism, Halydean had the legal authority of "pit and gallows," which is to say, to carry out the death sentence. The original charter also specified that the organization was tax exempt. Halydean was rivaled in Scotland only by St Andrews, another barony owned by the Catholic Church. [9]
Name & Etymology[edit]
At the time of its creation, Halydean was owned by the Catholic Church. It was controlled by the Kelso Abbey, in the Royal Burgh of Roxburgh, Scotland. The Dean (Christianity) of the abbey was called the "Holy Dean," and the agricultural & grazing lands given to the Monks of Selkirk became known as The Barony and Lordship of Halydean.[10]
History and age of company[edit]
The company states that it has "more than 100 years of operational history," [11] which refers to the age of its subsidiaries, however, there are well documented legal records showing that the entity had its establishment in 1128 C.E., by the 17th great grandfather of one of the current directors,[12] with holdings primarily consisting of thousands of acres of grazing land.[13][14][15][16][17] This is substantially older than Harvard College, which has been described as the new world's oldest corporation, established in 1636.[18][19] The oldest companies in the world for tea, sake, metalworking, and pharmacy were all established after 1128, the year of Halydean's establishment.[20] Lorillard Tobacco Company is listed as the oldest public American company, having been established in 1760.[21] The Tuttle Farm was established in the 1630s by King Charles II, and is the oldest continually operating business in the US.[22] Based on that information, it can be argued that Halydean is a very old company, although it is unknown whether or not it may hold the claim as the oldest publicly traded company in the world. The company has not made any such claim. The company is on Wikipedia's List of oldest companies. In 1545 Halydean's ownership was appropriated by the Crown, rechartered, and eventually assigned to new owners in 1602,[23][24] and in 2014 Halydean Corporation was organized as a Delaware corporation, as a wholly owned subsidiary of The Barony and Lordship of Halydean (Scotland) by the current Lord of Halydean.[25] Almost immediately following that, numerous other shareholders were appointed, such that the company has to use a stock transfer agent.[26] Halydean Corporation is classified in the UK as a "subsidiary undertaking" of the Barony and Lordship of Halydean, as defined in section 1162 of the Companies Act 2006. [27] This is unclear if Halydean Corporation should lay claim to the title oldest company on Wall Street, but it legally establishes the company as having a dignified pedigree in land holdings that can be traced to the year 1128 C.E.
Today[edit]
Halydean Corporation is an agricultural land holding company that specializes in dairy and beef production. The company invests in the dairy industry.[28] The following SIC codes may apply to Halydean Corporation: 02410000 Dairy farms, 02120000 Beef cattle (except feedlots), 42120102 Farm to market haulage (local), and 51430000 Wholesale Trade - Nondurable Goods Dairy products, except dried or canned. Subsidiaries include trucking / milk hauling, farm land, dairy operations, heifer replacement breeding, academic research, and beef cow breeding using artificial insemination with sexed semen for F1 hybrid crosses.
Environmental Activism[edit]
The company participates in wastewater treatment research. These systems speed up the digestion of manure products into useful co-products such as fertilizer for cleaner air and water.[29] The company promotes environmentalism which is economically profitable.[30]

		Products & Services

The US is both the largest importer of beef, and the largest consumer of beef in the world. This is due to the rising popularity of consuming beef and hamburger. Dairy cows are also involved in the production of beef. However, unlike a beef cow, a dairy cow produces profit the whole time while she is in "inventory." In order to continue producing milk, every year a milk cow has to have a calf. Through the use of sexed semen and F-1 genetic crosses, Halydean can help to produce a higher quantity of beef cows to help meet the rising demand for quality US beef.
A general list of our farm products & co-products:-  US Milk Production-  Traditional Beef Cuts-  Ground Beef-  Veal-  Calves / breeding operations-  Specialty breeding F1 crosses-  Hay-  Silage-  Corn-  Beans-  Grass Fed Beef-  Clean Water-  Methane (energy production)-  Natural Fertilizer

		Sustainability Statement

Setting an environmental example, you’ll find no leafy logos or other “greenwashing” attempts to make our company appear to be on the pseudo-environmental bandwagon. A look at any company’s actions will reveal its true colors.Company CEO Ron Braatz is an avid outdoorsman. In fact, he enjoys the forest so much that he and his wife live in a beautiful log cabin in the lush woods of Wisconsin.The company director who shares his name with the company, once lived in a national forest and spent his morning walks cleaning trails and has even taught college level courses on environmental sustainability. He owns solar panels and says, “Good business is good for people and the environment, and both should win. We practice stewardship. My scoutmaster taught me when I was a kid, ‘leave it better than you found it.’ That’s a good model for just about everything in life too.”Another company director has personally donated to purchase thousands of fruit trees for an orphanage project in South America. Carlos has worked on projects in the past to create energy from waste and practices energy conservation. He says, “Energy conservation is smart. It saves money. You don’t have to be an environmentalist to see the common sense in that.”IMPROVING EXISTING FARMSWhere we can, we seek to improve existing dairies by modernization to include healthier and more humane conditions for animals and workers alike. We seek to implement waste-to-energy systems such as methane digesters and water reclamation systems such as membrane filtration to clean up existing projects that we may acquire.RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENTA portion of the earnings from each dairy operation is dedicated to improve its own local impact and make its micro-environment a cleaner place. This may include waste-to-energy, water reclamation, and exploration of various means to reduce odor, including methane reduction and reclamation, as well as “mob grazing” and other new ideas that are more profitable as well as healthier.CHARITABLE DONATIONSAt present, more than 10% of our stock is owned by non-profit organizations and foundations and a portion of our gains will benefit an organization that is planting fruit trees to feed orphans. This is caring for humanity as well as helping to make our world a more beautiful place. Aside from helping people to eat healthier, trees planted in South America can produce year-round and do far- more good than trees in the North of the USA. We were planting trees before we worked here and with improved resources we will continue to plant more orchards because it is a cost-effective, sustainable and healthy way to feed people.

Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements
The SEC encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company's future prospects and make informed investment decisions. The information on this website contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often include words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "intends," "plans," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance in connection with discussions of future operating or financial performance.
The Company's forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions regarding the Company's business and performance, the economy and other future conditions and forecasts of future events, circumstances and results. As with any projection or forecast, forward-looking statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. The Company's actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those in its forward-looking statements include government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions and the following factors:
•   recent and future changes in technology, services and standards, including, but not limited to, alternative methods for the delivery, storage and consumption of products and evolving food storage, distribution, logistics, and consumption patterns;•   changes in consumer behavior, including changes in spending behavior and changes in when, where and how food products are consumed;

•   competitive pressures, including as a result of consumer fragmentation and changes in technology;
•   the Company's ability to deal effectively with economic slowdowns or other economic or market difficulties;
•   changes in advertising market conditions or advertising expenditures due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes in consumer  behavior, pressure from public interest groups, changes in laws and regulations and other societal or political developments;
•   Theft, misrepresentations, and the Company's ability to exploit and protect its property rights in and to its assets, its common stock, and other products;
•   lower than expected valuations associated with the cash flows and revenues at Halydean Corporation's reporting units, which could result in Halydean Corporation's inability to realize the value recorded for intangible assets and goodwill at those reporting units;
•   increased volatility or decreased liquidity in the capital markets, including any limitation on the Company's ability to access the capital markets for debt securities, refinance its outstanding indebtedness or obtain bank financings on acceptable terms;
•   the effects of any significant acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions by the Company, and the Company's ability to close expected acquisitions;
•   the failure to meet earnings expectations;
•   the adequacy of the Company's risk management framework;
•   changes in U.S. GAAP or other applicable accounting policies;
•   the impact of terrorist acts, hostilities, natural disasters (including extreme weather) and pandemic viruses;
•   a disruption or failure of the Company's or its vendors' network and information systems or other technology relied on by the Company;
•   the effect of union or labor disputes or worker disputes affecting the company's workforce;
•   changes in tax, federal communication and other laws and regulations;
•   currency exchange restrictions and currency devaluation risks in some foreign countries, including, but not limited to, Venezuela;
•   changes in foreign exchange rates; and
•   the other risks and uncertainties detailed in the company's S-1 registration, which will be available on the SEC's website ("EDGAR") Any forward-looking statement made by the Company speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The Company is under no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any obligation to, update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise.

		Halydean is the future of dairy.

Halydean Corporation is an agricultural land and livestock holding company, specializing in dairy with a bonus product of beef. We are seeking to help provide more dairy and beef for the world, because “everyone must eat.” We want to provide for our families with something real: brick & mortar, thousands of acres of farm land, cattle, and true wealth that can profit from inflation and stand the test of time, by lasting for generations to come. As a Halydean Corporation, we are several families working together to preserve our family’s heritage, prospering together through the economy of scale, powerful technology, and a more diverse skill set; including the sophistication to be able to maximize value for the families of our shareholders.
Halydean is positioned to be the top industry leader based on three factors: Its high ROI business model, its technical advantages in an expanding industry, and its opportunity to profit from paradigm shifts.
   1) The US dairy industry is a fragmented industry. Halydean is on the cutting edge and is structured to be the industry leader with this opportunity. By technology and an innovative business model, the company is positioned to become a world leader in efficient, large-scale dairy and beef production. A strong capital return is possible by owning land-based farms with vertical integration, investing in the expansion and modernization of existing facilities.
   2) Dairy farms create large amounts of data throughout the day. The power to intelligently use this data will create great advances in production.  Halydean's proprietary technology, which is being created, plans to change the industry and be made available to license to other brands.  Halydean has now begun the first stages of organizing the data that is created on these  farms. With decades of industry experience, a number of disciplines are coming together to make this happen, including business analytics, decision analysis, and cost-to-scale benefits. Halydean has joined with industry developers to make it work. This will simplify the whole decision making process, increasing efficiencies that are not yet realized in this industry, which has remained fragmented even through the industrial revolution. Halydean strives to increase the world food supply with the most complete dairy management, analysis, and tracking system.
   3) Eastern nations are Americanizing the way they live and eat. As nations like Korea and China change their diets, consuming more ground beef and learning to love things like pizza, the demand for beef and dairy grows at a rate faster than world population growth. Dairy is the #1 protein delivery food source. The company has numerous new acquisitions in process, but at this time it is premature to make public announcements. Please visit our page often to watch for updates on the company's growth and expansion.

The US dairy industry is a fragmented industry. Halydean is on the cutting edge and is structured to be the industry leader with this opportunity. By technology and an innovative business model, the company is positioned to become a world leader in efficient, large-scale dairy and beef production. A strong capital return is possible by owning land-based farms with vertical integration, investing in the expansion and modernization of existing facilities.

Dairy farms create large amounts of data throughout the day. The power to intelligently use this data will create great advances in production. Halydean’s proprietary technology, which is being created, plans to change the industry and be made available to license to other brands. Halydean has now begun the first stages of organizing the data that is created on these farms. With decades of industry experience, a number of disciplines are coming together to make this happen, including business analytics, decision analysis, and cost-to-scale benefits. Halydean has joined with industry developers to make it work. This will simplify the whole decision making process, increasing efficiencies that are not yet realized in this industry, which has remained fragmented even through the industrial revolution. Halydean strives to increase the world food supply with the most complete dairy management, analysis, and tracking system.

Eastern nations are Americanizing the way they live and eat. As nations like Korea and China change their diets, consuming more ground beef and learning to love things like pizza, the demand for beef and dairy grows at a rate faster than world population growth. Dairy is the #1 protein delivery food source.
Dairy farms offer a wealth of information that can be used to optimize all sorts of management decisions about how to run the farm. Numerous small improvements add up over time, and result in large savings through efficiency. Decision analysis software is routinely used in other industries every day to provide a competitive edge and to achieve the optimum balance of maximum savings and maximum productivity. Halydean is bringing this high-tech style of modern management to the dairy industry to help move a less efficient industry further into the future.
Halydean is in the coding stages of what will become the most complete analytical dairy farm tracking system available. This puts Halydean on the path to being the most efficient research center available for dairy farming innovation. A great benefit of this focus on research will be improved stability and consistency of output in agriculture. 
As an example, research has shown that many calves are not receiving enough nutrition during their first month of life, and that this has a significant affect on their ability to produce milk as full grown cows. Thousands of bits of information such as this can help our farms to maximize every opportunity for better animal husbandry.
HALYDEAN’S GOAL IS TO BE THE PREMIER AGRICULTURAL AND LAND HOLDING COMPANY IN THE WORLD, WITH A FOCUS OF MAKING THE IT WORK FOR THE FAMILY FARMS & SHAREHOLDERS WHILE FEEDING THE WORLDMORE INFORMATIONAPPLICATION
