What are analysts saying about Lincoln Electric Holdings stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Lincoln Electric Holdings stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Lincoln Electric will benefit from focus on customers and execution of its 2020 vision. The company’s focus on investment in long-term, profitable growth, with its broad range of product launches and strategic acquisitions, will also aid growth. It will also gain from consistent focus on cost reduction and strong cash flow generation. Despite increase in interest expenses, the company’s strong balance sheet position and share repurchases will drive its performance. Lincoln Electric also has a positive record of earnings surprises in the last few quarters. Driven by these positives, the stock outperformed the broader industry in the past one year. However, Lincoln Electric's results will be hurt by higher interest expenses, stronger U.S. dollar and weakness in industrial production. Ongoing declines in the energy and heavy fabrication sectors also remain headwinds." (7/19/2017)
2. Stifel Nicolaus analysts commented, "We are transferring coverage of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. to Nathan Jones from Stanley Elliott.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Lincoln Electric Holdings (NASDAQ:LECO) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 8 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.11)Consensus Price Target: $84.00 (10.03% downside)
