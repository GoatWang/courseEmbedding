desires to ensure that it will continue to have the benefit of
Executive’s services; and


     WHEREAS, the Bank
wishes to assist Executive in providing for the financial
requirements of Executive in the event of his retirement or
termination of employment.


     NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as
follows:




 


     1. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT .


          A.
Retirement Benefit . Following Executive’s completion
of five (5) years of Service or earlier Separation from
Service by reason of Disability, Executive will be entitled to
receive pursuant to this Agreement an annual Retirement Benefit of
Thirty-Five Thousand Dollars ($35,000) payable for twenty
(20) years; provided, however, in the event that
Executive’s Separation from Service shall occur prior to his
attainment of age sixty (60) for any reason other than:
(i) death as provided in Section 1.B;
(ii) Disability; or (iii) termination by the Bank without
Cause or termination by Executive for Good Reason, regardless of
whether any such termination occurs after a Change in Control, such
annual Retirement Benefit shall be reduced at a rate of five
percent (5%) per year for each twelve (12)-month period or portion
thereof that Executive’s Separation from Service precedes his
attainment of age sixty-five (65), with any pro rata reduction for
periods of fewer than twelve (12) months to be determined by
disregarding any partial months.


          B.
Death Benefit . In the event of Executive’s death
while in the employ of the Bank, regardless of whether Executive
shall have completed five (5) years of Service as of the date
of his death, Executive’s Beneficiary shall be entitled to
receive the Retirement Benefit that would otherwise have been
provided to Executive pursuant to Section 1.A. above. In the
event of the death of Executive after the commencement of payment
of the Retirement Benefit provided pursuant to Section 1.A.
above, payment shall continue to be made to the Executive’s
Beneficiary in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the
annual benefit that the

2



 


Executive was
receiving at the time of death until such annual benefit shall have
been paid to Executive and his Beneficiary for a total period of
twenty (20) years. Executive shall have the right, at any
time, to designate Beneficiary(ies) (both primary as well as
contingent) to receive the Death Benefit payable under this
Section 1.B. The Beneficiary designated under this Agreement
may be the same as or different from the beneficiary designated
under any other plan of or agreement with the Bank. The Executive
shall designate his Beneficiary by completing and signing the
Beneficiary designation form attached hereto as Exhibit A and
returning it to the Vice President, Human Resources Officer for the
Bank. Executive shall have the right to change his Beneficiary by
completing, signing and otherwise complying with the terms of the
Beneficiary designation form attached hereto as Exhibit A.
Upon the acceptance by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources
Officer of the Bank of a new Beneficiary designation form, all
Beneficiary designations previously filed shall be canceled. The
Bank shall be entitled to rely on the last Beneficiary designation
form filed by Executive and accepted by the Vice President, Human
Resources Officer of the Bank prior to Executive’s death. In
the event of the death of Executive without a designated
Beneficiary, any benefits remaining to be paid under this Agreement
to Executive shall be paid to Executive’s estate.


     2.  TIME
AND FORM OF PAYMENT . Except as otherwise provided in
Section 3.B., the annual Retirement Benefit payable in
accordance with Section 1.A. hereof shall be paid in
substantially equal monthly installments on the first day of each
month commencing on the first day of the month immediately
following the later of Executive’s attainment of age 60
or

3



 


Separation from
Service. The annual Death Benefit payable in accordance with
Section 1.B. hereof shall be paid in substantially equal
monthly installments on the first day of each month commencing on
the first day of the month immediately following Executive’s
death. Monthly installments of benefits shall cease to be paid
after 240 months of installments have been paid to Executive,
his Beneficiary or both, as the case may be. Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, payments to be made
under this Agreement upon Executive’s Separation from Service
which are subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be delayed
for six (6) months following such Separation from Service if
Executive is a Specified Employee on the date of his Separation
from Service. Any payment due within such six (6)-month period (the
“delayed payments”) will be delayed to the end of such
six (6)-month period. There will be no adjustment in the delayed
payments to reflect the deferred payment date. The Bank will pay
the aggregate delayed payments in a lump sum at the beginning of
the seventh month following Executive’s Separation from
Service. In the event of Executive’s death during such six
(6)-month period, payment of any delayed payments will be made in
the payroll period next following the payroll period in which
Executive’s death occurs.


     3. 
FORFEITURE UPON TERMINATION FOR CAUSE; PAYMENT UPON CHANGE IN
CONTROL .


     A. 
Forfeiture Upon Termination for Cause .


     Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if Executive’s
employment is terminated for Cause, the annual benefit payable in
accordance with Section 1.A. or Section

4



 


1.B. hereof
shall be forfeited. If Executive or his Beneficiary has received
any monthly installments of the annual benefit payable in
accordance with Section 1.A. or Section 1.B. hereof and
it is subsequently determined that the Executive was terminated for
Cause, then the monthly installments previously paid shall be
returned by Executive or his Beneficiary, as the case may be, to
the Bank, and no further monthly installments shall be payable
under this Agreement.


     B. 
Payment Upon Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason After
a Change in Control.


     Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if the Bank terminates
Executive’s employment without Cause within two
(2) years after a Change in Control or if Executive terminates
his employment for Good Reason within two (2) years after a
Change in Control, Executive shall be deemed to have completed five
(5) years of Service as of his Separation from Service for
purposes of determining his entitlement to the Retirement Benefit
provided in Section 1.A. and payment shall commence to be made
on the first day of the month immediately following
Executive’s Separation from Service regardless of whether he
shall have attained age sixty (60), subject, however, to a six (6)-
month delay in payment under Section 409A of the Code as
described in Section 2 if Executive is a Specified Employee on
the date of his Separation from Service.


     4. 
ABSENCE OF FUNDING . Benefits payable pursuant to this
Agreement shall not be funded, and the Bank shall not be required
to segregate or earmark any of its assets for the benefit of
Executive. Such benefits shall not be subject in any manner to
anticipation, alienation,

5



 


transfer or
assignment by Executive, and any attempt to anticipate, alienate,
transfer or assign these benefits shall be void. Executive shall
have only the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Bank
for the benefits hereunder.


     5. 
DEFINITIONS


     Capitalized terms
used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined shall have the
following meanings:


     “
Beneficiary ” shall mean one or more persons, estates
or other entities designated on Exhibit A to this Agreement
that are entitled to receive the Death Benefit payable under
Section 1.B. of this Agreement upon the death of
Executive.


     “
Board ” shall mean the Board of Directors of Rockville
Bank.


     “
Cause ” shall mean Executive’s willful and
continued failure to substantially perform his duties as Senior
Vice President of the Bank (other than any such failure resulting
from incapacity due to physical or mental illness or Disability)
which failure is demonstrably and materially damaging to the
financial condition or reputation of the Bank and/or its
affiliates, and which failure continues more than forty-eight
(48) hours after a written demand for substantial performance
is delivered to Executive by the Board, which demand specifically
identifies the manner in which the Board believes that Executive
has not substantially performed his duties and the demonstrable and
material damage caused thereby; or the willful engaging by
Executive in conduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious
to the Bank or its affiliates, monetarily or otherwise. No act, or
failure to act, on the part of Executive shall be deemed

6



 


“willful” unless done, or omitted to
be done, by Executive not in good faith and without reasonable
belief that his action or omission was in the best interest of the
Bank. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall not be deemed
to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have
been delivered to Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by
the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters (3/4) of the
entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board (after
reasonable notice to Executive and an opportunity for Executive,
together with Executive’s counsel, to be heard before the
Board) finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board,
Executive was guilty of conduct set forth above in this definition
and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.


     “ Change
in Control. ” A “Change in Control” shall be
deemed to have occurred if, during the term of this
Agreement:


     (i) the
Company, or the mutual holding company parent of the Company,
whether it remains a mutual holding company or converts to the
stock form of organization (the “Mutual Holding
Company”), merges into or conso
