Good day and welcome to the Q3 2016 DSP Group Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Daniel Amir, Corporate Vice President for Business Development at DSP Group. Please go ahead sir. 
Daniel Amir
Thank you. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. I’m Daniel Amir, Corporate Vice President for Business Development at DSP Group. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On today’s call, we also have with us Mr. Ofer Elyakim, Chief Executive Officer; and Dror Levy, Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements about our financial projections for the fourth quarter of 2016, including by segment and full year 2016 preliminary composition of revenues for 2017, anticipated gross margin improvement, gradual recovery of the cordless business, and the anticipated general annual or secular decline of such business. Our ability to secure additional design wins, mass production time tables and general market demand for products that incorporate our technologies in the market. 
We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. For more information about the risks and factors that could affect the forward-looking statements made herein, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our 2015 Form 10-K and other SEC reports we have filed.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Ofer Elyakim, our Chief Executive Officer. Ofer, the floor is yours.
Ofer Elyakim
Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope that you have the opportunity to read our press release that we distributed earlier today. I would like to begin by reviewing our results for the third quarter, commenting on the progression of our business plan, and providing context for our outlook. In a short while, Dror will provide you with detailed comments on our financial results and outlook for the fourth quarter of 2016.
We achieved third quarter financial results that were well ahead of our guidance in almost every financial metric. Our performance reflect record revenue contributions from new product, propelling an overall 10% year-over-year revenue growth, record new product revenues of $16.6 million which grew by 70% year-over-year, demonstrate the transition of our business model towards new product initiative including mobile, voice and the IoT product segment. 
These new products accounted for 43% of third quarter revenues and supported the 340 basis point annual expansion in both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins of 44.8% and 45% respectively. The improved third quarter operating profitability also reflected a continued focus on achieving operating leverage. Our GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins increased by 1,350 and 720 basis points respectively when compared to the third quarter of 2015 to 13.5% of revenues and 11.9% of revenues respectively, driving our GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.23 and $0.19 respectively. 
Third quarter revenues of approximately $38.8 million grew by 10% year-over-year and by 7% sequentially. Revenue growth by better than expected revenues in our voice and mobile segments, as well as by gradual sequential improvement in our cordless phone business. Looking forward, we expect to successfully accomplish our 2016 new product goals for revenue growth of approximately 50% evidencing our successful expansion in to the new market verticals and diversifying our revenue base. 

While we project year-over-year revenue growth to continue in the fourth quarter, we expect that our fourth quarter revenue results will be negatively impacted by some weakness in our mobile segment. In the third quarter, we made solid progress across all of our new product initiatives and continued to gain traction with both existing and newer tier one OEMs and leading service provides. 
We remain optimistic regarding our business outlook for both the short and long term periods, as our new product across office, mobile, home and IoP more widely adopted in driving increased interest in a solid design pipeline. We anticipate that these categories will comprise the majority of our revenues in the year 2017. 
Now I’d like to provide you with specific updates about the progress in each segment starting with mobile. During the quarter we generated better than expected revenues of approximately $4.6 million from sales of HDClear products, which represented the small sequential increase over the second quarter driven by better than expected demand from our tier one customers. 
We’re happy to inform you that in addition to the design win we announced last quarter, we have secured another design win for a known smartphone application with a leading North American OEM that is expected to launch in the mid of 2017. We are excited about the market dynamics and especially the green field opportunity for voice activation and control. There is a growing demand for incorporating voice user interface in to a wide range of products and voice activation is becoming a preferred way for interacting with an activating devices.
As an example, we believe that the digital assistant market alone would increase ten folds in the next three years and with the recent design wins we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend. 
Our DBMP and HDClear product offer the lowest power consumption and best-in-class performance for enhancing voice user interface and including noise suppression, barging or (inaudible) with listening voice trigger and voice command. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to meet our annual mobile revenue target of $15 million, although we anticipate a sequential decline in mobile revenues for the fourth quarter due to the unanticipated termination of our flagship product by a leading mobile OEM. We therefore forecast fourth quarter mobile revenues to be in the range of $1.5 million to $2.5 million.
Moving to the Voice over IP and office segment, we continue to solidify our leadership in the enterprise standalone market as demonstrated by strong and growing design pipeline with tier one OEM and other leading customers. 
For the third quarter we achieved record quarterly revenues of $7.7 million representing an increase of 23% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. This result was well ahead of our previous guidance of $6 million to $7 million. Contributing to the better results was stronger than expected ramp of one of our tier one OEMs and stronger overall market demand. 
During the quarter we secured an additional design win with a leading tier one OEM for high-end conferencing system supporting both voice and video communication. Moreover, several customers launched new products based on our VoIP SoCs. As an example, Grandstream launched its new DP750 and DP720 DECT IP phones in a complete new lineup of ATA products based on our Voice-over-IP SoC. 
Moreover, Panasonic launched its new KXHDP 330 and 430 series including high-end color and video IP phones based on our DVF99 SoC. For the fourth quarter, we expect both VoIP revenues to be in the range of $6.5 million to $7.5 million suggesting a sequential decline mainly as a result of the faster than expected ramp that we experienced from our new tier-one OEM customer in the second and third quarters. 

We initially expected this ramp up to take place mostly during the third and fourth quarters. We are optimistic about the outlook for our VoIP business and the strength of our design pipeline and our offering which cover both high to low-end solutions and believe that this segment is well positioned for solid revenue growth. 
Now to an update on the home segment which includes home gateways, IoT, Spark PA and cordless. I will start with home gateways; third quarter revenues of $3.1 million increased by 36% year-over-year and by 18% sequentially, and were ahead of our expectations. The additional demand was largely due to an initial ramp of a leading Australian service provider that launched DECT enabled home gateways and bundled CAT-iq handsets. Both based on our DECT and CAT-iq SoCs.
Moreover, ADB a leading European provider and system and software for connected home solutions integrated our DECT/CAT-iq SoC for its latest lines of home gateways. We expect fourth quarter home gateway revenues to be slightly down on a sequential basis, but to further accelerate in 2017 coinciding new product launches by a number of telecom operators. 
The underlying market trend behind is the integration of DECT in to home gateways and the growing adoption of HD Voice, such as upgrading their infrastructure and a customer premises equipment to support HD Voice which provides us with ample growth opportunities. Moreover, we are seeing a growing number of telecom service providers that are already leveraging their DECT enabled home gateway infrastructure as a hope to over subscribers out-of-the-box IoT services which are easy to install and plug and play and at a much lower cost of ownership. 
Now turning to IoT, during the third quarter we generated $1.2 million in revenues from our IoT, representing growth of 5% year-over-year and a decline of 9% on a sequential basis. During the quarter, we continued expand our IoT ecosystem and announced a number of new design win a first with EUROtronic, a leading German manufacturer of wireless smart home solutions and we selected ULE SoC for its new smart home product that includes thermostat, wall switch, door and window contacts, all of which are targeted for tier one European service provider. 
Second, Sercomm, a leading manufacturer of telecom and broadband equipment announced a full series of smart home sensors that are based on DSP groups DECT ULE and targeted for a leading tier one service provider. In addition, Roc Connect, a leading smart homer services platform announced that it will offer its channel partners ULE support across its smart home hub. 
We expect a strong momentum in our IoT business to continue and demand from customers to accelerate in the fourth quarter, propelled by preparations for smart home service launch by two leading service providers. We are therefore optimistic that we will surpass our previous 2016 annual revenue expectation of $4 million to $5 million in the IoT segment. 
ULE is gaining traction as an IoT connectivity technology due to its strong technical merits that include better coverage and longer range, interference free and dedicated and natural support for two-way data, voice and video. Moreover, we are seeing growing interest from customers for adding voice user interface to smart home systems, viewed as the preferred user interface for the home environment. 
This represents another meaningful growth opportunity for ULE technology, which is designed to support high quality two-way voice, and audio and best-in-class range and propagation. 
Now to an update on the Spark PA, in the beginning of the year we unveiled a new and highly innovative product category that leverages our decades of CMOS RF design expertise. Spark PA is a 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi power amplifier or PA with the highest RF transmit power and best linearity in CMOS technology. 

Spark PA also supports Wave 2 and Wave 3 802.11ac access point requirement, multi-user MIMO of 4x4 or 8x8 topologies as well as the future 1024 QAM modulation scheme. 
During this past quarter, we continue to enhance our offering and provide full front end solutions that incorporate our PA, LNA and switch. We continue to engage with selected customers that are undergoing an evaluation phase of our PA and same products.
And now to an update of the cordless phone market; all figures and comparison in this section are for cordless phone SoCs only and do not include revenues from gateways and IoCs. Our third quarter cordless revenues continue to recover, following the inventory correction earlier this year, albeit at a slower pace than we originally anticipated. 
Cordless revenues declined by 13% year-over-year but increased 9% on a sequential basis and accounted for 57% of third quarter revenues. The year-over-year decline was in line with the cordless phone market decline trend of 10% to 15%. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate that our cordless revenues will be down slightly on a sequential basis due to seasonal factors that remain below the 10% to 15% year-over-year secular market decline trend, as the gradual inventory adjustment recover continues. 
And now to an update on our outlook; based on our revenue expectations across our new product initiatives, while taking in to consideration a sequential decline in HDClear and cordless telephony revenues, we expect year-over-year revenue growth to continue in the fourth quarter. Although, fourth quarter revenues will be down on a sequential basis. 
We expect revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 to be in the range of $34 million to $36 million, which at the mid-point of the range is just 4% year-over-year increase. To summarize, we are very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter which highlights solid execution that included revenue growth both sequentially and year-over-year, solid margin expansion, both in our growth and operating line.
During the third quarter, we successfully executed on our business objectives which are primarily focused on driving accelerated growth by expanding the market adoption of our new products in voice, mobile and IoT. We also experience a gradual improvement in the cordless telephony segment during the quarter. 
Despite our expectation for a sequentially down fourth quarter, we are optimistic that our business outlook for both the short and long term and as our new product across the three segments are more widely adopted in driving the increased demand, we anticipate that these categories will comprise a majority of our revenues in 2017. 
Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Dror, our Chief Financial Officer. Dror, the floor is yours.
Dror Levy
Thank you Ofer. I will now review the income statement for the third quarter of 2016 from top to bottom. For each line item, I will provide the US GAAP results as well as the equity based compensation expenses included in the line item and the expenses related to previous acquisition. 
Our revenue for the third quarter of 2016 were $38.8 million. Gross margin for the quarter was 44.8%. Gross margin for the quarter included equity based compensation expenses in the amount of $0.1 million. R&D expenses were $8.5 million including equity based compensation expenses in the amount of 0.7 million. 
Operating expenses for the quarter were $12 million including equity based compensation expenses in the amount of $1.4 million and amortization of acquired intangible assets in the amount of 0.4 million. Our operating expenses for the quarter were net of $2.5 million of other income, resulting from the lack of previous acquisition related provision due to the exploration of applicable statutes of limitation. This reversal of provision has no cash flow effect on our quarter. 

Our financial income for the quarter was $0.3 million. Income tax expenses for the quarter were $0.3 million and included an income tax benefit resulting from the amortization of a deferred tax liability related to intangible assets to the amount of $0.1 million. 
Net income was $5.3 million including equity based compensation expenses of $1.5 million, amortization intangible assets of $0.4 million, other income from the reversal of provision in the amount of $2.5 million and a tax benefit resulting from the amortization of deferred tax liability in the amount of 0.1 million. Non-GAAP net income excluding these items I’ve just described was $4.5 million. 
GAAP net income per share for this quarter was $0.23. A negative impact of equity based compensation expenses on the EPS was $0.06. The negative impact towards the amortization of acquired intangible assets on EPS was $0.02. The positive impact or the reversal of the provision on the EPS was $0.11. The positive impact on the tax benefit resulting from amortization of deferred tax liability was $0.01 and the non-GAAP net income per share excluding the item I just described was $0.19.
This is the current report on 8-K that we filed with the SEC this morning for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP presentation to the GAAP presentation.
Now turning to the balance sheet; accounts receivable at the end of the third quarter of 2016 increased to $22.8 million compared to 17.1 million at the end of the second quarter, representing a level of 53 days of sales. 
Our inventory decreased from $12.9 million at the end of the second quarter to 9.9 million, representing a level of 42 days. Our total cash and marketable securities decreased by $2.2 million during the third quarter and were at the level of $120.6 million as of September 30, 2016. 
Our cash and marketable securities position during the quarter was affected by the following; $1.2 million of cash was received from operations; $0.5 million was used for purchase of property and equipment; $0.7 million of cash was used for acquisitions of the remaining 86% of the outstanding shares of a company in Asia, which was acting as our representative for the last couple of years. This acquisition brings our holding to 100% of this company and will help us to strengthen our strategic position in this region. 
$2.2 million was used for repurchase of approximately 200,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $11.1 per share. $0.5 million of cash was received from exercise of option by employees and $5.5 million was a change in the market value and amortization of marketable securities. 
Now, I would like to provide you with our projection for the fourth quarter of 2016. Our fourth quarter projections on the US GAAP basis including the impact of equity-based compensation expenses and the acquisition related amortization expenses are as follows: revenues are expected to be in the range of $34 million to $36 million. We expect our gross margins to be in the range of 43% to 45%. 
R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $8 million to $9.5 million and total operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $14 million to $16 million. Financial income is expected to be in the range of $250,000 to $350,000. Provision for income tax for the fourth quarter is expected to be in the range of $200,000 to $300,000. Our shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 23.5 million shares. 
Our fourth quarter projections include approximately 0.4 million of amortization of intangible assets. Our fourth quarter projections also include the following amount [focused] on for equity based compensation expenses. Cost of goods include $0.1 million, R&D expenses include $0.5 million to $0.7 million, and total operating expenses include $1.2 million to $1.4 million.

Now, we’d like to open up the line for questions and answers. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question; it comes from Mr. Jaeson Schmidt from Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. 
Jaeson Schmidt
Just a quick clarification on the new mobile win with a non-smartphone application, that’s in addition to the one you announced back in Q2 as well? 
Ofer Elyakim
Yes, the win is an additional design win. So one in Q2 and the other one in Q3, and as we’ve indicated we see a very nice market opportunity in the area of IoT and smart sticker and a smart audio type of devices, and we believe that this represents a very nice opportunity and a great fit for the offering that we have around voice user interface and all the announcements including noise cancellation to margin capabilities, acoustic echo cancelling etcetera, etcetera and of course always on voice which is becoming a critical factor to enable a voice user interface on battery operated devices. 
Jaeson Schmidt
And are you seeing anything different from a competitive landscape or selling strategy within that market compared to the traditional handset market?
Ofer Elyakim
Of course the smartphone market is fairly well established market place with fairly sizeable OEMs that have their generations of the product and the annual type launch schedule etcetera. And on the other hand the IoT market which includes a lot of the devices around IoT from wearable to home type of devices and systems to some outdoor categories as well is a fairly new and vibrant market which today is evolving at a very fast pace with a lot of focus by all major OEMs and is expected to become a market which will have billions of units. 
Based on kind of what we see out there, we see a tremendous amount of interest for what we and the technologies that we have developed as well as the product, the silicon component that we have. And the market dynamic is basically suggesting that - and devices like Amazon Echo are kind of leading the market and has created a new market nature that’s enabling people without any other interface just voice to do a perfect interaction and do search and listen all kinds of content and we believe that there is a great fit for what we have and there is as I said a tremendous amount of opportunity out there. 
Our focus continues to be on all the fronts from mobile to wearable to IoT and we are doing our best to engage and take it to the finish line. 
Jaeson Schmidt
How should we think about OpEx trending next year, are you guys going to need to make significant investment for some of these newer opportunities?
Ofer Elyakim
I think that on the OpEx front as you’ve seen from last year to this year, there were some incremental additional investment. We expect to have to see some incremental additional investment going forward, but nothing at a very large scale. 
Operator
We would now take our next question; it comes from Mr. Matt Ramsay from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. 
Matt Ramsay
Very well done on the quarter, congrats. I guess on the guidance obviously there is the impact from Samsung, maybe you could help us quantify that a little bit in the mobile revenue for the fourth quarter and how you’re thinking about mobile revenue growth in to 2017?
Ofer Elyakim
So around the guidance, especially around mobile, as you know we’ve indicated during the last quarter that our annual revenue goal was to be above $15 million for the year. We did of course also expect a slower Q3 than we actually had reported 4.6 the midpoint of our expectation was around 3.5. And this came ahead, I believe as Samsung began to ramp up in expectation of Note 7. However, the unfortunate termination of the model thus have an impact on our Q4 number, and what we hope that we will see in terms of demand in Q4.

The way we see going forward especially around the fourth quarter is that we are also in the Galaxy S7 as one of the key vehicles for growth and this has been contributing most of our revenues this year. That a lot of replacements will go to Galaxy S7 and by that we will be able to benefit it. Very hard to call exactly how the demand will be in the fourth quarter, of course right now it’s kind of more on the defensive side as there is a lot of blurring in the supply chain and uncertainty around the demand, and what self-determination we’ll have and we will of course try to do our best to fulfill the demand and support the customer in the best way we can. 
With respect to 2017, I believe it it’s too early to quantify because we are in engagement process, but we need that to be concluded in order to be able to provide better color on how should we think about mobile in to next year. One thing that we are working on is the diversification to be able to get design wins with additional leading customers on a variety of segments and we have been updating you guys about the progress we’re making. I do expect that we will make an additional progress in the quarters to come, as we see a great fit what we have and what the market wants. And I think what we’ve achieved in 2015 and ’16 is a great plan to enable us to monetize the momentum in to the market demand as well as in to additional smartphone and customers and wearable vendors. 
Matt Ramsay
Thank you for the color, that’s helpful. I understand the situation at Samsung was certainly not - no one was really able to forecast that so I appreciate that. Outside of that mobile part of the business, maybe you could talk a little bit about visibility. I know it’s always a challenge in the home telephony back to markets, but the seasonality this year as you guys have talked about a recovery in the back half of the year was maybe a hair different that I had modeled. But maybe you could talk a little about trends you’re seeing there and the health of the channel in that market going in to the fourth quarter and in to next year that would really help? Thank you.
Ofer Elyakim
So around quarter’s telephony, so as a general benchmark for all this market, and again the benchmark is really based on what we see coming from the point of sale data and the key to end markets; one is North America and the other one is Europe. We see a market decline rate of about 10% to 15%. I would say Europe is more towards a high single digit, US is more in the low to mid-teens and that has not changed. 
What has changed is really the health of the supply chain and as you know we’re starting in late third early fourth quarter of 2016 going in to the first quarter of 2016, we saw a major inventory correction cycle that started in the North America market and then moved to the European market and from second quarter we are in a gradual improvement mode that we expect to continue.
As we said, you’ve seen a sequential increases in Q2 to Q3 and we see right now slightly sequentially down, but that doesn’t really change the picture. The gradual improvement is ongoing and we believe that this will continue. About what to expect in to next year, assuming the secular trends to not change and where we are this year? It was not as that different if we have to look back in to the trends of 2015 or ’14, this was the level.
We expect this if we take in to account that these levels would change, we hope to see a reversion to the main, somewhat right like if you take a look at our revenues for this year they are down in the north of 20% for quarters. If we take nine months actual plus the guidance that we gave, so hope to see better trends next year. 
At the end of the day there should be a reversion to where the market is and the market is 10% to 15% down. 

Operator
We will take our next question; it comes from Mr. Matt Robinson from Wunderlich. Please go ahead. Your line is open. 
Matt Robinson
On the voice activation design wins, are they all with customers that have cloud resources for speech recognition?
Ofer Elyakim
So around the additional design wins in mobile and mainly you’re asking about the non-mobile design wins as we’ve announced. So these are with products coming I would say from IoT smart speaker wearable type of front. I would say the majority of wins are with companies that do have a cloud, and some of these products are actually going to be a cloud operated, but some could also be operated in a standalone model through additional connectivity capabilities. 
I think that as we look at our pipeline and the opportunity to fly ahead, it is basically a mix of both connected or cloud based type of voice engines and the ability to voice user interface and naturally speaking, and also some ability to run a limited voice user interface vocabulary locally. So I would say there is a good mix of that like when we look at the opportunities out there on both ends. 
But there is also a lot of interest around how do we enhance the capabilities of voice to be heard with noises, with the fact that many of these devices also carry in addition to microphone speakers and how do you support barging, how do you do good acoustic echo cancellation. A lot of these types of dynamics of making voice just better and making it work with very good performance. So that - from the threshold of user experience, it will basically be able to meet where the market leading machines are. The real benchmark is of course Alexa or Amazon Echo.
Matt Robinson
Have they gotten very far along in coming up with interface mechanisms to enable the supply chain to offer customer premise devices that are fully viable for facing the cloud. Obviously the smartphone universe has gotten pretty good there, but just curious how far along the residential type functions have gone or if its pretty cut and dry. 
Ofer Elyakim
I think there’s a very big difference between OEMs are trying to achieve on the premise equipment or the residential market and the industrial market. And what we have today is smartphone which is a much more of a near filed type of an interaction. Typically you’re within a yard or so from your phone, but in the residential or industrial type of environment, first of all you are prone to many kind of noises that in a smartphone sim you have let’s say hopefully more control or at least an alternative user interface. 
And number two is the distance from the device itself and how does it need to work when there is perhaps several other people in the same room subject to noises reverberations etcetera, etcetera while you are fairly far away from the device. So all of that accounts for additional used cases and another hurdle in terms of enabling better performance from voice user interface on these types of new devices. I hope that helps?
Matt Robinson
But what’s the timeframe for these guys to get in to production with your initial designs?
Ofer Elyakim
Right now the way we see these gradually throughout ’17, I’d say the best way to model it is that these devices move to production in the middle of the year or so. 
Matt Robinson
And how should we think about the market size for this? Is it comparable to home gateway to over a period of some years?
Ofer Elyakim
I think that the opportunity is much greater than where we are in home gateways today over the years. We are right now at the starting line, so we’ve just started these diversifications and started getting design wins and we have a fairly nice pipeline of engagement that we are working on. But the opportunity is by far larger than gateways. Even the units that we see today and we have a belief that this is what we see a lot of from the market research, by talking to customers, their expectations are for this market to grow fairly rapidly. 

Matt Robinson
You mentioned certain times talking about Spark, which was a nice update. Is there - have you had any progress in the last quarter, it seems like we’re kind of looking for something maybe by the end of next year for production, but that’s far enough out. It seems like it’s a pretty uncertain estimate. Is there any - can you talk about the progress if anything there’s been in the last quarter?
Ofer Elyakim
Yes, absolutely. We did make a significant progress during the last six months, as this product started to sample and get evaluated by customers or by potential customers. And our goal as we’ve indicated is to see revenues in ’17 and so for that we need to land the design win during the next six months to make it to production in to ’17. Where we are definitely is engagement process with a number of vendors. Some of them are more on the Wi-Fi sub-system to be part of the reference design and some are direct engagement with an OEM to be the PA or a [fan] in a future solution. 
So on both ends we’re making progress in terms of the engagement side, and what we need to do is carry that through the finish line or to be either a land of designing or be far to the reference design that will enable us to move to of course move to the next step which will be to start commercial shipments and realize revenues. So right now we believe that by late 2017, there seems to be right now a goal to see revenue or an initial shipments from the Spark PA. 
Operator
We will now take our next question; it comes from Charlie Anderson from Dougherty & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. 
Charlie Anderson
I wanted to focus on really strong gross margin performance. I wondered if you could speak to like for like margins, was there any change there on products or was that just a feature of mix. And then moving forward the sustainability of some of these margins and the long term margin model, if you want to talk about that that would be great. 
Ofer Elyakim
On gross margins I think we’ve indicated that our near term goals are to move in to mid-40s. We have over the last three years we’ve kind of gradually step by step saw these margin improvement cycle happening from high 30s in to the low 40s and now this third quarter of course represent a near term high 45. And I think this is where we want to be at these mid-40s. Of course it will be really hard to estimate accurately every quarter, as you know this is of course a calculation based on the mix of products and that each and every one of them has its own margin profile. 
But the real dynamic behind it is the fact that our new products which are of course - there’s a very strong correlation and not by case, because our new products are carrying a much better gross margins than our cordless telephony products. And as these revenues are representing a bigger part of the mix and as our revenues grow and in our cost of good some of our cost of goods are fixed. So as revenues grow the fixed cost becomes less meaningful. All of that contributes to strengthening in gross margins and we hope that we are definitely staying in kind of mid-40s. 
With respect to moving beyond the mid-40s, I think that we will need to see revenue growth associated also with business and once we see that, that could help us to focus and realize better margins. But right now I would say that we want to be at the area of mid-40s and I hope that we are there. And all of that is of course benefiting from the new product category which as I said a much higher margins than the cordless telephony business.
Charlie Anderson
And then want to focus on VoIP for a second, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that in addition to a customer ramp a little bit earlier in Q3 there was also general market strength. And I wondered if you could address that, what you’re seeing in that market in terms of overall demand and size of the market?

Ofer Elyakim
On the Voice-over-IP market, indeed when we reported second quarter results, our expectations were for a lower type of revenue quarter, and we gave 6 million to 7 million or 6.5 million at the midpoint. Right now we’ve reported $7.7 million. What we’re seeing is just the buildup of lead times, all those etcetera and all of that translates to the quarterly revenues. I think that the overall picture has not changed a bit. We have said, for us it is a strong market that we can become the market leader. We have all the tools and technologies and capabilities to be the SoC in this market, and I think what we have done is really focused on getting designs wins and building the strong pipeline, thereafter that is translating to a commercial shipment and of course that fulfills revenue etcetera, etcetera. 
Our view has not changed, this is a market of $150 million or north in SoC value, and we are only I would say less than one-third of the way in to the penetration. This year we expect, as you can understand from the guidance, so also from the actual high-20s, I believe that this will continue to be growth market for us in the next couple of years and it will translate as these new tier one OEMs prove out full annual type of shipment volume which is very different let’s say than the ramp up, which is always a gamble between how much inventory they have of the old silicon product versus how much they will take from the new design. 
And once we’re pass these rounds, we’ll hopefully see the full run rate and that of course will translate to further revenue growth, and we hope that with a design pipeline that we have, more launches will happen in 2017, which will fuel additional growth in ’18 and so on and so forth. So for us this continues to be a very strong and promising market opportunity and I think right now we have the most comprehensive set of solutions and SoC to capture these opportunities. 
Operator
We will now take our next question Suji Desilva, ROTH Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. 
Suji Desilva
On the mobile, I just want to understand the support intensity of some of these wins and your ability to support additional wins or the customers you’ve won to date requires you guys to focus fairly heavily or is this scalable with the support you have to scale to more mobile wins?
Ofer Elyakim
Around the mobile wins, as you know from the very beginning our offering around the HDClear was around silicon and a lot of softer algorithms including noise suppression, acoustic echo cancellation, always on-voice with very low power consumption. All of these ingredients are highly sought after both in where we are today handsets as well as in the IoC segments or as we say smart speakers, wearable and other IoC products. 
And I think that there’s very strong correlation between what we have and what customers need. Of course the ability to branch out and support more engagement with new customers and all of the customers that we are supporting and the two customers that we’ve included in our announcement and also in the previous quarter, and our new customers and of course to support these new OEMs and make sure we are successful and they are successful doesn’t tell a strong commitment from our side, but I would say that we are well positioned to tackle and win and broaden the pipeline of designs of customers that we are actively supporting. And I think we’re getting to where there’s a lot of commonality between what each of these customers’ needs from us and also what we have on hand in terms of development. I think we will be successful in handling and fulfilling the needs that are necessary by the customers and with our technology and support. 
Suji Desilva
Good now looking for the diversification there. And then on the PA product in particular, what is the timing of customer wins being secured for the product. I know it’s a later ramp, but I’m curious what timeframe is for the design wins there?

Ofer Elyakim
So what we’ve indicated is right now there is an engagement an active engagement process going on with both the Wi-Fi subsystems and as well as we’ve been with customers mainly around access points and mainly are also high end. And the way we’re thinking about it is that these need to continue in to designing design wins probably in to the next year, and hopefully in order to be in production and actually secure revenues we hope that these will concluding design wins, I would say early second half or so and that could then translate to revenues. 
As you know in the PA market or at least these are more of components, there’s no software associated with the design timeline or let’s say from design win to production is more a hardware type of an exercise rather than a full system software type of an exercise. So it’s (inaudible) big time than what we have in most of our other products. 
Suji Desilva
Understood. And then a last quick question, what’s the typical [1Q] seasonality we should be thinking about?
Ofer Elyakim
Suji, can you ask the question again, it was about --.
Suji Desilva
Sure, the typical seasonality you see in the first quarter on average?
Ofer Elyakim
It’s very hard to call the quarters, but I would say that every year has been different. We could see that seasonality will be down in to the first quarter. A lot of it is going to depend on how exactly the mix is. I would say quarters does depend on how holiday season concludes in Europe and the US. In addition we have seen I would say in the last two years that Voice-over-IP starts the year on the low end and gradually improves and we’ve seen that in 2015 and also in 2016. So that’s perhaps the way to think about the seasonality next year. 
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question; it comes from Mr. Robert Mertens from Needham & Company. Please go ahead sir, your line is now open. 
Robert Mertens
Hi, this is Robert Mertens on behalf Rajvindra Gill. First, congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. You mentioned earlier that the Internet of Things revenue was expected to be higher than previous guidance for the year, I believe within the home automation segment. Could you give me a little bit more clarity on the momentum within this product launch?
Ofer Elyakim
So around the IoT or - of course its mainly around technology which is called ULE which is a connectivity technology for smartphone monitoring security etcetera. The way we modeled or at least our expectation coming in to the year was for about $4 million to $5 million of revenues in the IoT segment. 
But what we’re seeing is that there is a momentum of very nice demand which is kind of requested in to the fourth quarter in expectation for a smart home service launch by two leading service provider. And that of course creates some upside in to the fourth quarter or let’s say better than expected in the fourth quarter that makes us optimistic about our ability to surpass this expectation of $4 million to $5 million. 
The way this IoT business is layered is through existing designs that have translated to retail product launches, and some other service provider wins that have translated to commercial shipment. And the way the buildup will happen is by additional - either consumer type of OEM that we launched kind of a home in the box or a security system in the box and then place it in retail or by leading service providers that we launch in a more managed type of services that will be offered to their subscriber base and through getting more subscribers, if this is going to help them out to be growing. 
And right now what we are seeing is that there will be two meaningful service provider launches that should carry ULE revenues up to the next level, and right now we see the beginning of that trend taking place.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Daniel Amir, Corporate Vice President for Business Development at DSP Group. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will also have with us Mr. Ofer Elyakim, Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Dror Levy, Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements about our financial projections for the second quarter of 2017 including by segment, preliminary composition of revenues for 2017, anticipated gross margin improvements, gradual recovery of the cordless business, and the anticipated general annual secular decline of such business, our ability to secure additional design wins, mass production timetables and result revenues and general market demand for products and incorporated technologies in the market. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. For more information about the risks and factors that could affect the forward-looking statements made herein, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our 2016 Form 10-K and other SEC reports we have filed.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Ofer Elyakim, our Chief Executive Officer. Ofer, the floor is yours.
Ofer Elyakim
Thank you, Daniel. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope that you had the opportunity to read our press release that we distributed earlier today.
I would like to begin by reviewing our results for the first quarter, commenting on the progression of our business plan and providing context for our outlook. In a short while, Dror will provide you with detailed comments on our financial results and outlook for the second quarter of 2017.
We achieved first quarter financial results that were ahead of guidance on most metrics. Our performance reflects continued execution of our new product strategy as evidenced by solid year-over-year revenue growth of 30% in office VoIP segment and 42% for our IoT products, respectively, and reflected in the 160 basis points improvement in non-GAAP gross margin. 
We ended the quarter with total revenues of $27.9 million, representing an increase of 1% versus the first quarter of 2016, despite an expected revenue shortfall in our mobile business as higher revenues in VoIP, IoT and cordless sufficiently offset this decline. 
New products revenues were $11.2 million and accounted for 40% of sales. New product revenues declined by 12% year-over-year and by 21% sequentially, hurt by the temporary weakness in our mobile segment. We believe that our first quarter was a revenue trough for the year, and expect our revenues to gradually improve from this level. Looking forward, we expect a sequential revenue increase in the second quarter, propelled by improvements in new product revenues and increased demands for cordless telephony SoCs. 
Specifically, we believe that we are seeing early signs of revenue recovery in our mobile segment, as the design wins we have announced in previous quarters are expected to reach commercial shipments earlier than initially anticipated. Moreover, we are excited about the numerous opportunities and engagements that we are addressing in each of the new product segments, namely, VoIP, IoT and Mobile, that are expected to materialize into revenues in the second half of 2017 and beyond.

Now, I would like to provide specific update about our progress in each segment. Starting with Mobile. During the quarter, sales of HDClear products totaled $0.38 million. The lower revenues were expected and mainly an outcome of much softer demand from our Tier 1 mobile customer. Nevertheless, we are working diligently to diversify and reinvigorate our mobile business, and we are happy to inform you that during the first quarter, we secured an additional design win for a non-smartphone application with a leading North American OEM for a product that is expected to launch in the second half of this year. 
In addition, we had a number of noteworthy announcements, including a partnership with STMicroelectronics, a global semiconductor leader, by revealing a new smart microphone, which is power efficient and delivers keyword detection capabilities in a compact package for small battery-operated devices incorporating our HDClear technology. 
Second, with Liberty Wireless, a leading embedded WiFi and wireless solution provider that integrated our DECT and voice activation solutions into its voice assistant speaker to enable telephony calls. This feature is in high demand for smart speaker vendors that would like to marry smart speakers, artificial intelligence and telephony capabilities. 
The third was with Emza Visual Sense, a developer of miniature machine vision devices, that announced the industry's first battery-powered intelligent computer vision always-on visual sensor for residential security and smart building application, which is based on our HDClear technology.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate a sequential increase in our mobile revenues as we begin shipments to two known smartphone OEMs. Based on our assessments, we project second quarter mobile revenues to be in the range of $0.5 million to $0.8 million. And more importantly, we are uniquely positioned to become a leader in the burgeoning markets for voice user interface, leveraging our proven leadership and expertise in voice processing and low-power design. 
We have successfully built a promising and diverse engagement pipeline with leading OEMs, covering a variety of application ranging from smartphones, smart audio to IoT application. This pipeline is just starting to materialize and paving a promising path to future growth.
Now moving to the VoIP and office segments. In the first quarter, we achieved quarterly revenues of $6.6 million, representing an increase of 30% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. During the quarter, one of our leading Tier 1 customers began shipments of its new conferencing system based on our DVF99 and DCX81 SoCs. Second, another Tier 1 customer launched a new series of premium IP phones based on our DVF99 SoC. 
These product launches go hand-in-hand with our anticipation for increased traction with Tier 1 customers and an expansion of the addressable market. We are confident that with our current product roadmap and design pipeline, we are well positioned to see solid revenue growth this year and beyond. For the second quarter, we expect VoIP revenues to grow on a sequential basis and to be in the range of $7 million to $8 million.
Now to an update on the home segment, which includes home gateways, IoT and cordless. I will start with home gateways. First quarter home gateway revenues were $2.7 million, up by 5% sequentially and roughly flat year over year. We continue to see solid traction from telecom service providers interested in integrating high-definition voice into their home gateways, and during this quarter too, a new European service provider has launched gateways incorporating our DECT/CAT-iq solution. Proximus, Belgium's largest telco and Sunrise, a leading telecom operator in Switzerland started shipping DECT enabled on gateways based on our technology. We expect second quarter home gateway revenues to increase on a sequential basis to $2.7 million and $3 million, and to further accelerate as the year progresses, coinciding with new product launches by a number of new telecom service providers.

Turning now to IoT. During the first quarter, we generated revenues of $1.5 million from our IoT products, representing growth of 42% year over year and a 34% decrease on a sequential basis following an expected pause by a large European telco that builds strong inventory already in the fourth quarter of last year. 
We are excited to share with you that during the quarter, QIVICON, Deutsche Telekom's smartphone platform launched its home-based two gateways. It's an IoT hub that incorporates our DECT ULE technology. In connection with the product launch, the new QIVICON gateways are offered with bundled ULE-based sensors, and based on our check, these new products are well-received in the German market. 
Moreover, propelled by the recent ULE-based smarthome launches by leading service providers, we are experiencing increased interest and strong momentum for ULE technology and consequently a continued expansion in our IoT ecosystem. As an example, LEEDARSON, the world leader in IoT product manufacturing has announced that it decided to integrate ULE into its lighting solutions, security and intelligent lighting controls, all using our ULE model, enabling fast time-to-market and easy integration. 
Moreover, we are seeing growing interest in adding voices or interface to IoT sensors. The voice is viewed as the prevailing user interface for the smart home environment. This represents another meaningful growth opportunity as our offering includes all the necessary building blocks for voice user interface and wireless connectivity. 
ULE technology is designed to support high-quality two-way voice and video and best-in-class range and propagation interference-free. Looking at the second quarter, we expect IoT revenues to grow on a sequential basis, and to be in the range of $1.5 million to $2 million. 
In summary, we began the year with a record number of IoT programs, concentrated on leading service providers and OEMs. We anticipate the strong momentum to continue during the remainder of 2017 and to generate solid revenue growth.
And now, for an update on the cordless phone market. Our first quarter cordless revenues were in line with our guidance for modest year-over-year improvement. Cordless revenues increased by 13% year over year, recovering from the inventory correction we experienced in the first quarter of 2016, and declined by 21% on a sequential basis, and accounted for 60% of first quarter total revenues. For the second quarter, we expect cordless revenues to be more aligned with the general cordless market decline of approximately 10% to 15% on an annual basis.
And now, to an update on our outlook. Based on our revenue expectations across our new product initiatives, we expect our second quarter 2017 revenues to be in the range of $30 million to $32 million, which at the midpoint of the guidance was just solid sequential growth. Looking ahead, we are very excited with our future prospects and are uniquely positioned to live and thrive in the burgeoning market for voice user interface. Moreover, we believe that our new product strategy will continue to position us well for a long-term revenue growth and positively contribute to the bottom line.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dror, our Chief Financial Officer. Dror, the floor is yours.
Dror Levy
Thank you, Ofer. I will now review the income statement for the first quarter of 2017 from top to bottom. For each line item, I will provide the U.S. GAAP results as well as the equity-based compensation expenses included in that line item and expenses related to previous acquisitions.
Our revenues for the first quarter of 2017 were $27.9 million. Gross margin for the quarter was 43.8%. Gross margin for the quarter included equity-based compensation expenses in the amount of $0.1 million. R&D expenses were $9.2 million, including equity-based compensation expenses in the amount of $0.6 million. 

Operating expenses for the quarter were $15.7 million, including equity-based compensation expenses in the amount of $1.4 million and amortization of acquired intangible assets in the amount of $0.4 million. Financial income for the quarter was $0.4 million. Income tax for the quarter included tax benefit in the amount of $0.2 million, resulting from the amortization of deferred tax liability related to intangible assets and the tax benefits related to equity-based compensation. The tax benefit for the quarter excluding these items, was in the amount of $0.1 million. 
Net loss was $2.9 million, including equity-based compensation expenses of $1.5 million, amortization of intangible assets of $0.4 million and tax benefit in the amount of $0.2 million. Non-GAAP net loss, excluding these items I just described was $1.1 million. GAAP loss per share for the quarter was $0.13. The negative impact of equity-based compensation expenses on the loss per share was $0.07. The negative impact on the amortization of acquired intangible assets was $0.02, and the positive impact of the tax benefit was $0.01. 
Non-GAAP loss per share, excluding the item I just described, was $0.05. Please see the current report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC this morning for a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP presentation to the GAAP presentation.
Now turning to the balance sheet. Accounts receivable at the end of the first quarter of 2017 decreased to $18.2 million compared to $19.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, representing a level of 59 days of sales. Inventory decreased from $9.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter to $9.2 million, representing a level of 53 days. Our cash and marketable securities decreased by $5.2 million during the first quarter and were in the level of $119.8 million as of the end of March.
Our cash and marketable securities position during the quarter was affected by the following: $4.1 million of cash was used for operations, representing mostly working capital changes; $0.4 million of cash was used for purchase of property and equipment; $1.3 million was used for repurchase of approximately 124,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $10.6 per share; and $0.6 million of cash was received from exercises of options by employees.
Now I would like to provide you with our projections for the second quarter of 2017. Our second quarter projections on U.S. GAAP basis, including impact of equity-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related amortization expenses, are as follows. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $30 million to $32 million. We expect our gross margin to be in the range of 43% and 46%. R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $8 million to $10 million. Operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $14.5 million and $16.5 million. Financial income is expected to be in the range of $0.3 million to $0.4 million. Provision for income taxes for the second quarter is expected to be approximately $0.1 million on a pro forma basis. Our share outstanding are expected to be approximately 22 million shares on a GAAP basis and 23.5 million shares on fully diluted non-GAAP basis. 
Our second quarter projections include approximately $0.4 million of amortization of intangible assets. Our second quarter projections also include the following amount forecasted for equity-based compensation expenses: cost of goods include approximately $0.1 million; R&D expenses include $0.5 million to $0.7 million; and operating expenses include $1.4 million to $1.6 million.
And now, we'd like to open up the line for questions and answers. Operator, please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Jaeson Schmidt from Lake Capital Markets.

Jaeson Schmidt 
Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. Wondering if you could just talk about the competitive landscape you're seeing in mobile, and some of the reasons why you're finding so much success against your competitor in non-handset applications?
Ofer Elyakim
Yes, Jaeson, and thank you for the question. So regarding the competitive landscape, look, first of all, we have a pretty comprehensive portfolio today of these type of processors, ranging from more of the high performance, with the ability to process a lot of different algorithms that could be either our own or the OEMs as well as ultra-low processors that could basically enable any device to do always-on voice and to incorporate voice user interface -- acting or being activated by a battery. So I think that first of all, we have a pretty comprehensive portfolio. Number two, I think that the portfolio of the algorithms that we provide are achieving to date a very good performance and being recognized by the market. And I think that we're also today enabling a lot of devices, starting from smartphones and going into wearable products, smart watches, into kind of smart speakers and IoT. So all of that is, I think, a pretty unique proposition. With respect to the other vendors, of course, this domain is attracting many additional software vendors, algorithm vendors and also silicon tech providers. But we do see that we are actually seeing a very nice traction and success in a variety of a different products, and we hope to continue with this momentum and then thrive and grow.
Jaeson Schmidt 
Okay. That's helpful. And just following up on that. I think in last quarter you mentioned your outlook for mobile was in that $5 million to $8 million range. Are you guys still expecting revenue to be in that ballpark?
Ofer Elyakim
Yes. Yes, we are. I think that's a fair kind of range for the year.
Jaeson Schmidt
And then, the last one from me, and I'll jump back into queue. How should we think about OpEx trending going forward?
Ofer Elyakim
So I think that the -- with the OpEx guide that we provided for this -- for the second quarter, you can see that kind of the midpoint of that...
Dror Levy
The midpoint is around $13.5 million pro forma, which is slightly lower than when we were in Q1, and for the second half of the year, it should be more or less in the same range, $13.5 million per quarter.
Operator 
We will now take our next question from Robert Mertens from Needham & Company. 
Robert Mertens 
Sorry about that. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to get a little bit more clarity about how we should think about cash flow, and if you're thinking about anymore of share buyback?
Dror Levy
Yes. So I'm going to start with the cash flow. So the cash flow for the first quarter was negative, and this is also a phenomena that we had in the first quarter of last year. However, we do expect that for the remainder of the year and for sure for the year as a whole, we will have a positive cash flow. So in the last couple of years, our cash flow [indiscernible] and was even like higher than our EBITDA. So I would believe that this will also be the trend for this year. 
And in terms of buybacks, we had the latest authorization was, if I recall, for 2016. We got authorization for $10 million worth of shares, out of which, up until the end of the quarter, we did around $8 million. So as of today, as of the end of the quarter we still had about $2 million of authorization for buyback, and I assume that we'll need to deal with that and to increase it sometime during the second quarter.
Operator 
We will now take our next question from Rajvi Gill from Needham & Company.
Rajvindra Gill 
Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on good results with solid execution. The question I had on the OpEx, just a follow up. How much kind of OpEx savings are you expected to generate from the closure of the PA business? And can you maybe describe the savings from the closure of that particular segment line?

Dror Levy
Yes. So first, this is already included in the numbers that we have provided. So as the second quarter being at $13.5 million, which is slightly lower than the first quarter, this already takes into account this closure of this activity. Overall, this activity consumed, I would say, couple of million, even less than that -- not more than $1 million to $2 million per year and less than that. So this should not have a significant impact on the OpEx.
Rajvindra Gill 
All right, that's included. And if you look at -- if we're looking at the Voice over IP market, I just wanted to get a sense of the -- your current market share and your expectations for that market share going forward. You talked about in the past that the Enterprise, Voice over IP, SAM is in the $150 million to $200 million per year, and that's growing at a 12% or 15% CAGR. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about kind of the market share dynamics across Broadcom and TI and yourself, and how we should be looking at kind of the long-term growth rate in that business?
Ofer Elyakim
Yes. Hi Rajvi, this is Ofer. With respect to the market, so yes, you're correct about the kind of the sizing of the market, that we said it's about $150 million in silicon SoC value. And the market is growing on at the eccentrics or kind of the UCA side of the cloud-based Voice over IP or voice and video services. And in a way, it's kind of more in the kind of flattish to maybe slightly growing or around that trend in the on-prem side, which is kind of the large enterprise market. And we are and have been, during the last couple of years, increasing our market share pretty gradually as we've entered really from the low-end side, which suggests kind of lower ASP type of a product for our first few. And as we continue and expand our market share and grow, we're actually kind of getting into more of the mid-range, high-end product, and then we're in a way improving the ASP. 
So if you were to ask me around kind of, what is our market share today on the unit volume perspective, I would say it's around 30%. If you asked me about what is the -- what is our market share on the revenue side, I would say it's kind of more in the 20s, and so it means that we have a lot of room still to grow. The market is a market that is characterized by low turnover. So each product that is in the market lasts for a number of the year, and hence, also the design cycle is fairly slow. We still see competition from the other two vendors that you've mentioned, mainly Broadcom, but we believe that today we have, by far and large, the most comprehensive set of solutions for this market, all the right and necessary focus from the software side, the algorithm side and the voice engine side. So I think we are really kind of uniquely positioned to continue and expand and be the market leader in this market. So we have got a very good feeling about our future in this market.
Rajvindra Gill 
That's helpful. And the other question I had was, if you can be maybe elaborate on your partnership with Emza Visual Sense to create this always-on intelligent vision sensor for security, monitoring -- smart city monitoring. Another semiconductor company, Himax, is also working with them. So I was wondering kind of, what was the rationale for the partnership? And how you think we should kind of look at the opportunity in computer vision and what you're bringing to the table with respect to that partnership?
Ofer Elyakim
So first of all, the relationship and the partnership is about marrying the unique silicon design that we have in one of our mobile-targeted SoCs, which basically can run very efficiently and effectively algorithms at a very low power and in a way enable the always-on functionality. And this is mainly kind of desired if you want to make battery-operated devices, utilize this type of characteristics for processes to run always and do that very efficiently. And in a way Emza brings in their expertise on the more of the ISP side, so the imaging processing front. We're great believers in this front or via visual sensing and processing. And I think that this is a market and a trend that we will continue to be very focused on and continue to do that via forming partnerships or doing our own investments, and I think that we're also well positioned there.

Rajvindra Gill 
And just last question from me and I'll hop back on. And this is a follow up as well on the competitive landscape. So I just wanted to get is -- try to get a sense in terms of your -- how you're distinguishing between your low-power voice processors where you are competing with companies like Cirrus Logic, and the entry into noise cancellation market, where you see digital headsets now or adapted noise cancellation headsets starting to include noise cancellation codecs, which is a pretty untapped market. Most of these headphones, headsets or analog. So there's some transition from analog headsets to digital headsets, which has a lot of software algorithms based on that. So I just wanted to get a sense of how we should distinguish between the low-powered voice processor and noise cancellation or they are all kind of part and parcel of the larger product portfolio?
Ofer Elyakim
Yes, Rajvi, thank you. So -- yes, indeed, maybe some clarification is required here just to avoid the confusion. So when we look at the voice user interface domain, we're talking about connecting microphones, which in a way are supposed to be always on and looking for a voice command, looking for the speaker to use a certain trigger, and then after that activate the device and start processing speech and going to the cloud or going locally, converting it back to text, then using NLP and all kinds of additional other algorithms. And in this market, it's really about connecting microphones, a processor and then working together with the speaker, so that you can actually achieve a very good accuracy when the trigger word is being announced. And then also create a great experience for the noise cancellation front, whether it's ambient noise in the room, whether it's noise coming from the speaker while a person is speaking to the microphone via acoustical echo cancellation, and all kinds of other technologies and algorithms. 
And in this market, it ranges from very low power battery-operated device, the single microphone, two microphones, to a high power, high processing multi-microphones, beam forming, et cetera. So in a way, we support all the use cases from kind of a near field, midfield and also far field. And so this is kind of one market. And in this market, you can categorize smartphone, smart watches, smart speakers, all kinds of IoT devices that are incorporating voice activation, automotive as well. 
And in the other part of your questions, when you really address the headset market and rightfully saying that, in a way, there is today a trend of conversions from analog to digital, here I believe you're -- when you say noise cancellation, you mainly mean ANC, which is more of the active noise cancellation or just trying to cancel noise by kind of creating an inverse signal to benefit the person who is using the headset. And in that market today, what we have is more of the far field noise cancellation and less the ANC. But, of course, these features and requirements is part of our roadmap and part of our initiative on the audio codec front and to go further into this market. I would say that the demand and requirement today for digital headset is on the rise, but it is a fairly small base today. As you know, mainly one, maybe 1.5 vendors are today embracing this trend of a digital type of connection of the headset into the phone. But, of course, it is part of where we want to be. And I think that in the next couple of years, you're going to see us also incorporating these capabilities, which is very close to where we're coming from. We have, and we still today, a lot of these kind of high-quality analog stuff in every Voice over IP phone in every video conferencing phone and every, even, desk phone.

Operator 
We will now take our next question from Matt Ramsay from Canaccord.
Matt Ramsay 
I just wanted to ask a little bit over about the integration or the overlap between VoIP business and the emerging ULE or IoT business, particularly HDClear and ULE products for voice-activated or voice-controlled IoT or connected home applications and just wanted to understand a little bit more the strategy of bringing the product to market, and is that a clear differentiator for your ULE program as it starts to ramp into bigger volumes over time?
Ofer Elyakim
Hi Matt, and thanks for the great question. So this is indeed, I would say, kind of one of the key themes that we do see around IoT, is the understanding that it's not just about processing, connectivity, sensing. It's also about the ability to control and activate. And when we look at smart homes or smart offices, et cetera, I think, kind of the -- we see a consensus coming from all the vendors, ranging from the OEMs themselves to the service providers, that are in a way kind of designing the next services and are truly trying to find what is the best way that's going to -- consumers will start embracing these devices and methods. And I think kind of the consensus is that the voice is going to be the prevailing user interface. 
We see that -- in a way, kind of technology has made a -- it's kind of ripe and ready, and the performance is really good, and you can see it in devices like Amazon Echo and the Google Home and the way they understand and get kind of keywords and are able to process commands and convert them into text in natural language. So I think this is kind of where the world of smart home and smart offices is heading. And I think that by combining both ULE, which is a protocol or a technology that was made for kind of always for real time, always type of communication, supporting voice two way et cetera, is uniquely positioned, both from the fact that it supports great range, so it means that you can really be mobile and roaming through kind of your apartment, home, backyard et cetera, and still be able to connect and continue the dialogue. You can do that interference-free, which is one of the key assets that the ULE technology has. So that means that there is no interference at all with any other short range wireless technology. 
And on the other side, when we go now into the voice activation side, we do it at very low power assumption. We have today a great ecosystem of additional device vendors ranging from all kinds of smart mix to our own solutions, to our capabilities to drive also all the algorithms for far field and noise cancellation. So all of that kind of bundles into a pretty comprehensive package that we believe kind of will carry ULE forward. And you know, the embracement of this technology will also include a lot of voice activation, and pretty much adding the microphone and the speaker to every sensor.
Matt Ramsay 
That's really interesting for context. And thank you for that. I guess, my follow-up question is just a bigger picture one, with some of the headwinds in the mobile business here in the very near term. The growth, as a percentage of the company, of the new products has stagnated a bit. But obviously, the intention is for those new products to become the vast majority of business over the next few years. But if you could just -- either of you guys give a bit of an outlook for the next few years as to where you think that mix goes? And just a reminder of what that means for the gross margin for the company, because things have moved around and perturbated a bit here with some of the disruptions at Samsung, but I think the overall track of the business seems to be moving in that -- in the right direction. And just understanding that timing of that mix shift is important in the longer-term. I appreciate the color.

Ofer Elyakim
Yes, Matt, thanks. So with respect to more kind of longer-term guidance, of course, we're not giving kind of any guidance for the next couple of years. But just to bring things into context. So what we've said also in the prepared remarks is that, right now we're very excited about where the future is taking us, and especially in the mobile segment. And this is a domain where we did see some headwinds -- some temporary headwinds that we predicted in the first half. And also, when you kind of look at our guide for '17 versus the results that we achieved in '16, that also suggest some weakness. 
But we have been able to successfully get a pretty extensive set of design wins as well as a fairly, I would say, promising engagement with leading OEMs. And we're going to see that translate into significant growth in the next two years. So we're very excited and believe that the pipeline has never been more promising. So we're really, really excited with the where the future is going to take us, and I think that it's very different from where we were in 2016, having just one big customer, we have today a fairly diversified pipeline. And that is also going to be the case in '18 and '19. And I think as we said, we are a fairly fortunate and uniquely positioned to have all the technology and all the capabilities, and really fit very well in these voice user interface domain. I think we've demonstrated that we are able in any type of -- voice processing type of market to build the right portfolio solution, and then get the right market strategy, get the designing in place and drive revenue. And I think this market is also a market that fits really well with the technologies and the products that we have. And we see that happening, we see that coming. And just perhaps takes some patience to see that in revenue growth and -- but I would say that right now, the pipeline is looking really, really promising.
Operator 
We will now take our next question from Scott Searle from Benchmark.
Scott Searle
Just a quick follow-up on the VoIP business and then I had a couple of additional questions. But could you comment on Avaya? There have been some headwinds and concerns over the last several months. If you're starting to see that recover and pick up and we're kind of through the woods on that front?
Ofer Elyakim
Hi Scott and welcome to the call. Yes, so the question was on VoIP. As you can tell, since the second half of last year, we had seen some weakness in one of kind of these new Tier 1 OEMs that started to ship in mass production with our DVF SoC. It was Avaya and, of course, the recent announcement and the status today, that suggested that there are some headwinds and we are seeing some of that. But we are hopeful and I think we do see some recovery ahead, and nothing is stepping stone. But I think, kind of the momentum or at least kind of the trend over the last couple of weeks, months, has been on the positive front. And we do hope that Avaya will continue to be successful and we will see our designs and the products that we're shipping today reach nice volume. 
I would say though that today, the portfolio of Voice over IP solutions that we have and the way they're translated into designs and shipments across the different vendors and SKUs, et cetera, makes us pretty -- kind of diversified. And so today, we have kind of very -- fairly good coverage on the on-prem side. We have fairly good coverage also on the UCA side or the cloud-based type of VoIP front. So in a way, you can understand that this is a market where if one company has temporary weakness, then others are beneficiaries. And so I would say that we are designed fairly well. Of course in the future things can happen. But, so far I think, we've been fairly successful in winning more business. I think we're -- we've been diversifying and adding a lot more customers and designs. The focus still is on kind of the Tier 1s of this market, and we hope to see continued progress and gradual growth over the next quarters.

Scott Searle 
And then just a follow up on HDClear front. It sounds like it's very exciting in terms of the pipeline building there. It's a diverse set of customers. But I was wondering if we could get some more granularity in terms of some of the end product categories? I know, it's been a lot of talk about Alexa-like devices, but I thought I heard smart watch in there. And I know you've, or I thought you were engaging as well with some additional smartphone vendors. So how that's kind of parsing out, if you will? And maybe -- and this is possibly dangerous territory, but the design wins that you're getting, kind of the dollar amounts that are attached with that if these products actually go into production? And then to follow-up on one of the earlier questions as well, it seems like there is some combination with ULE bundling. I'm wondering how much of the HDClear success and traction now was coming from bundling on the ULE front?
Ofer Elyakim
So with respect to the kind of the key categories where HDClear designs are focused on. So they're focused on smartphones. And today, we are shipping with the Galaxy S7, which is one of the kind of the key products that we go design into. In the smart watch category, we were -- we did -- we have been designed into the Gear product that are shipping, and this was shipping already since late 2016. And now, we are -- we've started also shipments that we -- with two new OEMs that are basically shipping devices that are more kind of in the smart speaker, smart audio type of front. And we believe that the kind of portfolio of different solutions or different end products is going to continue and expand to all kinds of, kind of activity type of gear to a more smart speakers and more a kind of IoT, smart home type of applications, more smartphones. 
And so the voice user interface is, basically, touching every device in the market. And the battery-operated ones do require a fairly efficient voice processor that will basically connect the microphones and provide all the capabilities to the larger devices that do -- that won't function and create a great user experience will require a lot of mics and processing capabilities. And also for that, today we have good solutions that meet these requirements. We believe that this product category will, despite the kind of the weakness that we've encountered, is a growth -- is a solid growth category that has a lot of potential starting this year, with these new products that are starting shipping and to gradually grow, and we would see a lot of more product that are, and a lot more OEMs that are selecting our solutions, and we see a very good future for this category.
Scott Searle 
Last question, just on the gross margin front. It sounds like there was wide range there, 43% to 46%. I'm assuming some of that potential uptick is related to VoIP. But wondering if there are any other mix issues or anything to be aware of that's kind of impacting that range?
Dror Levy
No, this is Dror. So I would say that this would depend somewhat on the range and also in the level of revenues. As you know we do have like a portion of the gross margin that is a result of fixed expenses. So the higher the total revenues are, this portion has like smaller in terms of percentages. So I would say, these are the two things, the mix and the total revenue.
Operator 
We will now take our next question from Matt Robison from Wunderlich.
Matt Robinson 
A couple of questions. One is, in the babble of the local area interfaces and IoT interfaces, have you -- can you kind of describe the progress of ULE over the past year or so versus the three or four or maybe more other interfaces that are kind of vying for these applications, and if there has been a particular milestone that has led to relative success for ULE? And the other question I had is, as it relates to HDClear and Mobile, it seems like sometimes the two are used interchangeably where that -- I believe in essence Mobile is sort of a subset of the HDClear opportunity. I wanted to clarify if you said in your earlier comments that you had a mobile device design win that's starting this year or if that -- if it's more just some of the other broader scope of HDClear opportunities that you've been more specific about?

Ofer Elyakim
Yes, Matt. Thanks. So let’s talk first with ULE. So ULE was a technology that, DSPG and some other silicon vendors that had root injected, develop and kind of the technology kind of went live in 2014, '15. And kind of the general competition was for kind of the last meter of IoT. So this is a short range that wireless that is supposed to connect devices, mainly kind of indoors, offices, homes, buildings, et cetera. And kind of the most immediate competition were standards like -- or I would say, established standards like ZigBee, Z-Wave. 
And then, over the years, what we have, and also the other kind of ecosystem partners have tried to do is, really make a market and prove the use of the -- that the use of ULE actually does solve a lot of issues that others have encountered in this domain. And I think that ULE was able and was very successful to address two key things. The first one was to show that range is not a problem. Indoor range is something that you can very easily address by utilizing ULE, and this is very different in the other technologies. The other issue is that this technology solved was the interference issue. And when you have two technologies that are interfering, it's impossible to solve unless it's really solved at the silicon level. And that is not only just by a single vendor. That's kind of an industry-wide type of a solution. 
And in technologies that operate in high SAM [ph] band, it's pretty much impossible that these technologies will always be very friendly to one another because technologies are something that are in constant development. And so, DECT ULE, because it operates on a licensed spectrum, because it's the only short-range wireless technology to operate in this frequency band, does guarantee very high stability and no interference. So I think these were kind of the first things that the technology started proving out. I would if you ask for milestone, I would say that this was one of the milestones and I think, a leading service providers like Turkcell, like Deutsche Telekom acknowledged that, companies like Ooma as well, acknowledged that, and that took them to the next level to actually make a bold decision and not go with the selection that everyone else was going with, and actually, put the bet on this technology. And I think that they're seeing very good result for that. 
I would say that the next milestone after that was really the utilization of voice over ULE, and the fact that you can actually create a voice-enabled sensors. And voice-enabled sensors are not just tell people to do communication and not just for people to activate and control devices or computers, they are also to listen to what's happening in the home and actually be context-aware and be able to identify all kinds of noises, from a door that's being opened, the steps or the number of people that are entering a premise and you know like a dog barking, gunshots, a car that is driving into the garage, et cetera, et cetera. So it's like really an -- the amount of use cases that can be supported are endless. 
And I think one of our key customers was kind of the first to pick that up, and this was Securitas Direct and Verisure that they have launched a DECT for the security market. And I think this is kind of another milestone, which is now also being converted into a lot of a voice-enabled devices at home that are -- could be smart speakers, could be kind of embedded in every device to do listening, to enable through a voice communication, et cetera, et cetera. So I think all of that is kind of acting as kind of the second milestone. I would say the third milestone is really to marry that with artificial intelligence, and this is part of the examples that we gave today. I think Emza was one of them, and the other one was the partnership with Liberty Wireless.

Matt Robinson 
Now with regards to the Mobile versus other category?
Ofer Elyakim
Yes. Sure, so first of all, you're right. So we are kind of mixing Mobile and HDClear. It means the same. So in this segment where we sell the DBM chipset and the HDClear suite of algorithms, and all of that we call HDClear. This is kind of where we are making the designs and the engagement, et cetera. So in a way, it's confusing, but it is interchangeable. So they mean the same exact thing. 
Now with respect to the design wins or design in, today we have a number of like prospect design-ins for mobile handsets, so more than one. Of course, as this is a fairly competitive unpredictive market, et cetera, we will not choose or elect to choose the word design win up until it's in production, up until we see the CO, but there are a number of these type of designs in progress. So we call it either prospect or design in. And we hope that this will translate into production and volume already into '17, and also improve and grow into 2018.
Operator 
[Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Charlie Anderson from Dougherty & Co.
Charlie Anderson 
Thank you for taking my question. We got a lot of good questions asked already. So I'll just sneak in a quick one, which is, Ofer you had mentioned some renewed interest in ULE. I wondered if you would characterize that as primarily European still, or we seeing any in the U.S. at this point?
Ofer Elyakim
Hi Charlie. So I would say most of the interest today is in Europe, and we have seen three European service providers basically utilize this technology for smart home, and I think that we're going to see a few more in the next 24 months. But gradually, and in parallel, the technology has been noted in these type of selections and fact that the ecosystem today also offers ULE. This has been noticed by the -- by also the North American side. Ooma, as in ITSP, an internet telephony service provider, which is gradually also moving into smart home services, has launched a solution based on ULE in the North American market. But if you're talking about kind of more of the -- a established telco service providers in the U.S. or security vendors, I think that this is in progress. 
So of course, there is interest. Of course, there are -- there's an engagement, but I would say, we're still not at the level where there is going to be a launch in the near term. But I would say that we have some very good and nice engagement that I hope that within, kind of 12 to 18 months, could materialize into launches.
End of Q&A
Operator 
There are no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back for any additional or closing remarks.
Daniel Amir
Yes. Thank you for dialing into the call. We're looking forward to providing an update in 90 days. DSP Group will participate in the Jefferies Technology Conference on May 9, in Miami. Thank you for dialing in, and have a great day.

 Management Comments:Commenting on the results, Ofer Elyakim, CEO of DSP Group, stated, “We are pleased with our second quarter results that reflect an improved product mix driven by new product revenues. Such revenues accounted for 47% of our total sales, thereby propelling GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin to a ten year high of 46.3% and 46.6%, respectively. Moreover, we are delighted by the solid market traction for our new products and their contribution to our revenue and profit, with Office/VoIP and IoT posting record revenues of $8.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively.” Mr. Elyakim added, “Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect a sequential increase in revenues, propelled by an increase in shipments of our SmartVoice products for voice user interface in non-smartphone applications and demand for Office/VoIP products. More importantly, DSP Group is uniquely positioned to become a leader in the bourgeoning market of voice user interface by leveraging our proven leadership and expertise in voice processing and low power design. We are making solid progress in augmenting our diverse engagement pipeline with leading OEMs. This pipeline is materializing, evidenced by commercial shipments to two new customers, and paving a promising path for long term growth.” Second Quarter Product and Market Highlights:  
New product revenues of $14.7 million, 47% of total revenues
Office/VoIP revenues of $8.6 million, a year-over-year increase of 17%

Second Quarter Non-GAAP Results:Non-GAAP net income and earnings per share for the second quarter of 2017 were $1.4 million and $0.06, respectively, as compared to non-GAAP net income and earnings per share of $2.6 million and $0.11, respectively, for the second quarter of 2016.  Non-GAAP net income and earnings per share for the second quarter of 2017 exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets in the amount of $425,000 associated with previous acquisitions; equity-based compensation expenses of $1.6 million; and changes in deferred taxes in the amount of $20,000 related to intangible assets and equity-based compensation expenses.  Non-GAAP net income and earnings per share for the second quarter of 2016 exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets of $321,000 associated with previous acquisitions; equity-based compensation expenses of $1.3 million; and changes in deferred taxes in the amount of $80,000 related to intangible assets.

To listen to the session, please dial +1 719 457 0820, domestically or +44 20 7660 0134 (international) and enter the company access code: 2006615# Presentation on Non-GAAP Net Income CalculationThe Company believes that the non-GAAP presentation of net income and diluted earnings per share presented in this press release is useful to investors in comparing results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 to the same period in 2016 because the exclusion of the above noted expenses may provide a more meaningful analysis of the Company’s core operating results. Further, the Company believes it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses associated with equity-based compensation are reflected in its statements of income. Forward Looking Statements This press release contains statements that qualify as “forward-looking statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including Mr. Elyakim’s statements (i) about the market traction for the company’s new products (ii) that the company expects a sequential increase in revenues for the third quarter of 2017, propelled by shipments of its SmartVoice products for non-smartphone applications and demand for its Office/VoIP products, (iii) that the company is uniquely positioned to become a leader in the bourgeoning market of voice user interface by leveraging its proven leadership and expertise in voice processing and low power design, and (iv) the company is making solid progress in augmenting its diverse engagement pipeline with leading OEMs and this materializing pipeline is paving a promising path for long term growth.  The results from these statements may not actually arise as a result of various factors, including the market penetration of new products such as products with SmartVoice/HDClear, VoIP, ULE and Home Gateway products; unexpected delays in the commercial launch of new products; speed of decline in the cordless market; DSP Group's ability to manage costs; DSP Group’s ability to develop and produce new products at competitive costs and in a timely manner and the ability of such products to achieve broad market acceptance; and general market demand for products that incorporate DSP Group’s technology in the market. These factors and other factors which may affect future operating results or DSP Group’s stock price are discussed under “RISK FACTORS” in the Form 10-K for fiscal 2016, as well as other reports DSP Group has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and which are available on DSP Group’s website (www.dspg.com) under Investor Relations.
