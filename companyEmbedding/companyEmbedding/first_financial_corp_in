Orange County Title Company (1889–1960)[edit]
First American traces its roots to 1889, when Orange County, California—a rural, undeveloped area at the time—split off from the county of Los Angeles. Two firms opened to handle title matters in the brand-new county. Five years later, Charles Edward Parker (C.E. Parker), a local businessman, succeeded in merging the two competitors into a single entity—Orange County Title Company. C.E. Parker became the president of Orange County Title, which, starting in 1909, would pay a cash dividend every year for the rest of the century and would become one of the first abstract companies in California to qualify to issue title insurance policies.[3]
Donald Parker Kennedy (D.P. Kennedy), grandson of C.E. Parker, joined Orange County Title in 1948. D.P. Kennedy developed a plan to expand the company beyond Orange County, which was approved by the board of directors in 1957.

Orange County Title Company (1889–1960)[edit]
First American traces its roots to 1889, when Orange County, California—a rural, undeveloped area at the time—split off from the county of Los Angeles. Two firms opened to handle title matters in the brand-new county. Five years later, Charles Edward Parker (C.E. Parker), a local businessman, succeeded in merging the two competitors into a single entity—Orange County Title Company. C.E. Parker became the president of Orange County Title, which, starting in 1909, would pay a cash dividend every year for the rest of the century and would become one of the first abstract companies in California to qualify to issue title insurance policies.[3]
Donald Parker Kennedy (D.P. Kennedy), grandson of C.E. Parker, joined Orange County Title in 1948. D.P. Kennedy developed a plan to expand the company beyond Orange County, which was approved by the board of directors in 1957.

            In 1834, a branch of the Second State Bank of Indiana - the earliest ancestor of First Financial Bank - 

opened to serve the people who had settled in Vigo County and the Wabash River Valley. Today, First 

Financial Bank is the oldest national bank in Indiana and the fifth oldest in the United States, still holding 

the 47th charter granted in the United States

Anticipating passage of a state law that would allow multi-bank holding companies, the bank applied for

approval from the Federal Reserve Board to establish such an entity. It received that approval in February 

1983, and First Financial Corporation became the holding company for what was then Terre Haute First 

National Bank. In August 1984, First Financial Corporation became the first multi-bank holding company 

in the state of Indiana. The Corporation is the only publicly traded company headquartered in Vigo County 

and has been ranked among the top 100 most efficient bank holding companies in the United States.


Through growth and mergers, First Financial became a strong group of community banks. In 2003, unification of affiliate banks as First Financial Bank began. The Morris Plan of Terre Haute was not included in the unification. The Corporation provides a financial services delivery system consisting of 68 banking centers in eastern Illinois and western Indiana and more than 100 FirstPlus ATMs. More than one thousand people work together to support, manage and staff First Financial facilities in Indiana and Illinois.


The headquarters of First Financial and its holding company, First Financial Corporation, has remained in 

Terre Haute, making First Financial Bank the oldest continually operated business serving the area. 

First Financial Corporation stock is traded under the NASDAQ National Market System symbol of THFF.
