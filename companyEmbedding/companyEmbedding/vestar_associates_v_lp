July 28, 2010
Health Grades, Inc., Agrees to be Acquired by Affiliate of Vestar Capital Partners V, L.P.
GOLDEN, Colo. & NEW YORK, Jul 28, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE) — Vestar Capital Partners V, L.P. (“Vestar”) and Health Grades, Inc. (“HealthGrades”) today announced a definitive agreement for an affiliate of Vestar to acquire all of the outstanding shares of HealthGrades for $8.20 per share, which represents a premium of approximately 32% over HealthGrades’ 30-day average closing stock price, and a premium of approximately 29% over the closing price of HealthGrades’ common stock on July 27, 2010, the last trading day prior to today’s announcement. The aggregate purchase price for the equity of HealthGrades is approximately $294 million (which consists of approximately 35.9 million shares, inclusive of all shares of common stock outstanding, securities convertible into common stock and shares of common stock issuable pursuant to a noncompete agreement with an executive officer).
Under the terms of an agreement unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of HealthGrades, an affiliate of Vestar will commence an all-cash tender offer no later than August 10, 2010. The offer will be conditioned upon the acquisition by Vestar’s affiliate of at least a majority of HealthGrades’ shares on a fully-diluted basis pursuant to the tender offer and purchases pursuant to tender and support agreements, and other customary closing conditions including regulatory approval. Executive officers of HealthGrades beneficially owning approximately 21% of HealthGrades’ fully diluted shares have entered into agreements to support the transaction and to tender or otherwise sell shares to Vestar’s affiliate. Following completion of the tender offer, the affiliate of Vestar will acquire all of the remaining publicly-held shares of HealthGrades at $8.20 per share through a second-step merger.
Kerry Hicks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of HealthGrades, stated, “We are pleased to announce an agreement of HealthGrades to be acquired by Vestar Capital Partners. We believe the acquisition price of $8.20 per share, which represents a premium of approximately 32% over our 30-day average closing stock price, represents a strong return for our stockholders and is a great confirmation of all of the efforts of our management team and all of our employees.”
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is serving as financial advisor to HealthGrades. Shearman & Sterling LLP and Faegre & Benson LLP are serving as legal counsel to HealthGrades. Kirkland & Ellis LLP is serving as legal counsel to Vestar.
Conference Call and Webcast
HealthGrades will hold a conference call, which will also be broadcast live over the Internet, to discuss its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010, at 4:15 p.m. Eastern Time/2:15 p.m. Mountain Time on July 28, 2010. Details regarding accessing the conference call broadcast are available on HealthGrades’ website located at www.healthgrades.com.

Additional Information and Where to Find It
This announcement is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. The tender offer for the outstanding shares of HealthGrades’ common stock described in this announcement has not commenced.
At the time the offer is commenced, an affiliate of Vestar (“Merger Sub”) will file a Schedule TO Tender Offer Statement (including an offer to purchase, a related letter of transmittal, and other offer documents) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and HealthGrades will file a Schedule 14D-9 Solicitation/Recommendation Statement, with respect to the offer. Holders of shares of HealthGrades are urged to read the relevant tender offer documents when they become available because they will contain important information that holders of HealthGrades securities should consider before making any decision regarding tendering their securities.
Those materials and all other documents filed by Vestar or Merger Sub with the SEC will be available at no charge on the SEC’s web site at www.sec.gov.
The Schedule TO Tender Offer Statement, Schedule 14D-9 Solicitation/Recommendation Statement and related materials may be obtained for free by directing such requests to Innisfree M&A Incorporated, 501 Madison Avenue, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10022, Toll-Free Telephone:
