Objective
Delaware Tax-Free USA Fund seeks as high a level of current interest income exempt from federal income tax as is available from municipal obligations and as is consistent with prudent investment management and preservation of capital.
Strategy
The Fund primarily invests in US state and local municipal bonds issued to raise funds for public purposes such as hospitals, schools, and general capital expenses.

The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.


Total returns may reflect waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the manager and/or distributor for some or all of the periods shown. Performance would have been lower without such waivers and reimbursements.

Delaware Tax-Free USA Quarterly commentary June 30, 2017
Overview
The Fund’s benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index, returned 1.96% for the second quarter of 2017 as yields declined across all maturity segments despite the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) decision in June to raise the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points to a range of 1.00% to 1.25%. Although performance was driven primarily by strong technical factors, markets also were influenced by soft economic data that caused the municipal yield curve to flatten. Yields bottomed in early June before rebounding to end the quarter at 1.83% on the 10-year bond and 2.66% on the 30-year issue. Municipal credit spreads widened by a mere 0.01 percentage points.
Second-quarter municipal supply decreased by 18% compared to the second quarter of 2016. Refunding supply, in particular, slowed sharply with monthly year-over-year decreases of 50%, 38%, and 48% in April, May, and June, respectively. Demand, as measured by mutual fund flows, was positive. According to Lipper, municipal mutual funds took in approximately $5.8 billion during the second quarter, with the heaviest inflows accruing to intermediate-term funds. 
On the economic front, survey results continued to appear stronger than the hard data. First quarter gross domestic product (GDP) was reported at only 1.2%, three-month average payroll growth fell from 201,000 to 120,000, and consumer inflation eased for three consecutive months. However, the FOMC viewed the apparent slowing of economic activity as transitory, with minutes of its May meeting suggesting a June rate hike. The US Federal Reserve’s reinvestment of its Treasurys, agency-backed securities (ABS), and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are expected to be tapered over time. 
Illinois general obligation bonds were downgraded by Standard & Poor’s (from BBB to BBB-) and Moody’s Investors Service (from Baa2 to Baa3) due to the state’s two-year budget standoff. The downgrade caused yields to widen, though Illinois bonds still managed a 1.31% gain for the quarter. Elsewhere, an Oversight Board created by the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) used Title III (bankruptcy-like provisions) to address years of weak economic performance that caused Puerto Rico to default on the majority of its debt. A federal judge was appointed to resolve conflicts between creditors, pensioners, and the Commonwealth. Puerto Rico bonds returned -7.33% for the second quarter and -7.99% year to date. Importantly, however, both Illinois and Puerto Rico were isolated rather than systemic issues within the municipal market.  
Within the Fund
Contributing to performance was the Fund’s exposure to long-term bonds (22-plus years), which was the strongest-performing maturity segment within the benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index, returning 2.75%. Despite the Fund’s modestly lower return of 2.71% in the long bond segment, a 15.62-percentage-point overweight resulted in a positive relative contribution. Additionally, a 16.26% out-of-benchmark position in below-investment-grade bonds contributed to performance by returning 2.88% versus the benchmark return of 1.96%, while the Bloomberg Barclays High-Yield Municipal Bond Index returned 1.99%.
Meanwhile, the Fund’s exposure in the 20-year segment (17-22 years) was a modest detractor, returning 2.14% versus the benchmark’s 20-year segment return of 2.47%. The underperformance could be attributed to a duration that was 0.59 years shorter than the benchmark in the 20-year segment. However, the Fund’s 3.25-percentage-point overweight helped offset a portion of the underperformance. 
Outlook
As we enter the third quarter of 2017, the market consensus is for the FOMC to raise the federal funds rate one more time in 2017 and to begin tapering the Fed’s balance sheet positions in Treasurys and mortgages. Those moves are largely expected to occur at the Fed’s September and December meetings, although the sequence could depend on incoming data over the summer months. While the FOMC has signaled its desire to normalize the federal funds rate sooner rather than later, we believe the recent easing in inflation may cause policy makers to pause rate hikes in September, thus allowing more time to gather economic data points. The trajectory of rate increases is important, since it not only signals the direction of rates but also the slope of the yield curve. A pause may cause the curve to steepen, while continued tightening should result in additional flattening of the curve.
We believe the slowing in inflation and the recent weakness in nonfarm payrolls are signs that the economy continues to muddle along. Annual economic growth of about 2% has been the operative number over the past few years and we do not foresee a significant change. Therefore, we think the FOMC may continue to raise the federal funds rate slowly with long-term yields remaining range-bound. If long rates stay in a range and short rates rise only slowly, we expect the yield curve should continue to flatten and spread product — such as our portfolio overweights to A-rated, BBB-rated and below-investment-grade securities — should continue to provide excess return. 
This document may mention bond ratings published by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs) Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service, and Fitch, Inc. For securities rated by an NRSRO other than S&P, the rating is converted to the equivalent S&P credit rating. Bonds rated AAA are rated as having the highest quality and are generally considered to have the lowest degree of investment risk. Bonds rated AA are considered to be of high quality, but with a slightly higher degree of risk than bonds rated AAA. Bonds rated A are considered to have many favorable investment qualities, though they are somewhat more susceptible to adverse economic conditions. Bonds rated BBB are believed to be of medium-grade quality and generally riskier over the long term. Bonds rated BB, B, and CCC are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics, with BB indicating the least degree of speculation of the three.
The Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index measures the total return performance of the long-term, investment grade tax-exempt bond market.
The Bloomberg Barclays High-Yield Municipal Bond Index measures the total return performance of the long-term, noninvestment grade tax-exempt bond market.

This and other information can be found in the Fund’s prospectus and its summary prospectus, which may be obtained by clicking the prospectus link located in the right-hand sidebar or calling 877 693-3546. Investors should read the prospectus and the summary prospectus carefully before investing.

Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.

Fixed income securities and bond funds can lose value, and investors can lose principal, as interest rates rise. They also may be affected by economic conditions that hinder an issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments on its debt.
The Fund may also be subject to prepayment risk, the risk that the principal of a bond that is held by a portfolio will be prepaid prior to maturity, at the time when interest rates are lower than what the bond was paying. A portfolio may then have to reinvest that money at a lower interest rate.


High yielding, non-investment-grade bonds (junk bonds) involve higher risk than investment grade bonds.


Substantially all dividend income derived from tax-free funds is exempt from federal income tax. Some income may be subject to state or local taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT) that applies to certain investors. Capital gains, if any, are taxable.


Duration number will change as market conditions change. Therefore, duration should not be solely relied upon to indicate a municipal bond fund’s potential volatility.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
