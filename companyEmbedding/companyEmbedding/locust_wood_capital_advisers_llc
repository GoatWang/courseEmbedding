capitals as a historical architectural elements 
Emotions such as "come in" or "I am jubilant" were expressed with the animals 
and plants that adorned the capitals sitting atop of the columns. Columns 
adorned with capitals became visual �words� in the 
Greek culture, certain columns and capitals fit certain building sizes, shapes, 
and look. Columns were not always placed within different spaces, they were put 
with different amount of space between them and it created a rhythm when looking 
upon the design. Capitals revamped the Greek architectural language. It is so 
easy to bring home the feel the past decades, easily adding elaboration to your 
entrance way or a grand room...read more about capitals as a historical architectural elements

Wood Onlays - making your home a memorable place to visit and an inviting place to live
An onlay is a term that describes an object that decorates the surface of another object. 
In other words, the decorative treatment will literally lay on the object's surface. When 
onlays are carved from wood, the goal is to create the illusion that the onlay is carved from 
the wooden surface it adorns. 


Carved wood onlays are also known as 
applied wood carvings (wooden appliques). Onlays are 
typically used to beautify millwork, which tends to be featureless and bland because it is mass 
produced. Applying onlays is a wonderful way to add interesting detail to woodwork and lend a 
customized touch to your home. American architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe famously declared 
that "God is in the details." Breathe life into your home's architecture and apply onlays to your 
woodwork.
Your home will be imparted with your personalized essence, making your home a memorable 
place to visit and an inviting place to live.

Wood carvings are commonly used for creative interior design projects. You can create beautiful designs using wood 
carvings on fireplace mantels and pediments (over door panels). By incorporating wood onlays into pilasters or wall panels 
you will be able to add your unique personal touch to your interiors. 



Quality carvings can enrich virtually any surface of your home. Wood onlays create a splendid look on any door or ceiling panel, 
in combination with other architectural products (medallions, moldings etc.) wood carvings can be used in creation of an 
impressive ceiling designs. 

Triple sanded smooth surface of our wood onlays allows for perfect finish. All wood onlays can 
be finished using stain to enhance the natural look of the wood. Or you can finish your wood carvings by painting 
them with any household paint. All and all, for a person with imagination and creativity there are endless opportunities of 
bringing the energy and beauty of wood carvings into your life. 
(preparing your space for wood carvings installation).
Presently, the art of carving wood by hand is making a strong 
comeback. Man-made, modern materials cannot replicate the warmth and beauty of 
natural wood. History tells us that ancient societies from all over the world 
have engaged in the worship of trees, some believing that the gods lived in trees. 

While the present day saying "knock on wood" is a luck charm with direct 
roots to these ancient beliefs, the positive energy that emanates from trees 
cannot be denied. Wood's texture is pleasing to the eye, whether in a raw, 
natural state, or constructed into a piece of furniture.


Our beautiful carved wood onlays come in a range of traditional styles and classic motifs proven to 
withstand the test of time. The carved wood onlays featured on this page are elegant, timeless designs 
that enhance many decors. The impressive designs are embedded in historical traditions of adornment 
and architecture; translating into the graceful details that will give your home a distinguished look.
The need for beauty is a trait unique to the human experience. Ornamental wood 
carving is a consistently visible presence throughout history because it 
satisfies this desire for the aesthetic. Wood carving is an age-old, artistic 
process where wood is ornamented with design by means of sharp cutting hand 
tools.
 




 





wood rosettes as perfect finishing touches
How wood rosettes can add maximum impact of your decor. Small in stature but mighty in the way that they can provide enhancement to their environment, 
carved wood rosettes are likely one of the most highly versatile of all 
architectural embellishments. 
It's likely that you've seen these intricate rosettes at the upper corners of 
door or window casings, but to confine these decorative gems just to this single 
use would be a crime. There's a place for wood rosettes in almost every room in 
your home... read more
