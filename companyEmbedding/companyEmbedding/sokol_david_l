Early life[edit]
The youngest of five children, David L Sokol was born in 1956 in Omaha, Nebraska. His father managed a grocery store in Omaha when he was born. He attended Catholic grade school and public high school.[3] "My parents had been married for 25 years by the time I came along," says Sokol. "My oldest sibling is 23 years older than me, so there were times when it seemed like I had more than just two parents."
Sokol's father was focused on the positive side of life. It was his habit on weekends to go through the newspaper looking for articles that would inspire his family. "We were all expected to sit together for dinner on Sundays," says Sokol. "My father would ask us to read aloud the stories he had circled. They were always about a local businessman who had done well, or maybe about someone who had given money to help resolve a problem. He instilled in us a belief that we, too, could do the great things we read about in the paper. His parents came over from Poland and he was a 100 percent believer in America-that if you apply yourself in this country, you can do anything. I was raised with that philosophy, and I agree with my father."
Sokol describes his mother as traditional and loving. Even though their home was modest, she made it comfortable and welcoming. "She was the kind of mother who had cookies warm out of the oven when you came home from school," says Sokol. "She focused on our care and education." Sokol's parents would not be able to pay for their children's college education, but it was expected that each of them would go. "My father expected us to work our way through school, but he didn't think that was a bad thing. He believed you learned a lot from working."
When Sokol was 11, his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. To help out with expenses, Sokol worked as a paperboy, as a caddie at a golf course, and as a janitor in a hardware store. He also helped local farmers bale hay. In high school, he worked as a maintenance manager for an apartment complex. He also worked for a local grocery store, starting as a bagger and then in less than two years becoming the night manager.
Sokol was able to keep this job when he entered the University of Nebraska. His life was busy and focused. He lived at home, went to school during the day, and worked at night. Sokol was an able student who got progressively better as he got older. He had been involved in football, wrestling, and track in high school and went on to play football in college. When he realized he couldn't have a career in football, he began to take school more seriously.
Shortly before the end of his junior year in college, Sokol married. He moved out of his parents' home and into a trailer with his bride, Peggy. By the time he graduated, he had a child on the way. "At that time, my main goal was to get my salary above my age," he says. Sokol graduated in 1978 and went to work as a structural engineer for an engineering company in America, HDR, Inc.[4]
Professional career[edit]
Previously, Sokol served as the Chief Executive Officer of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (formerly CalEnergy Company Inc.) a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. from April 19, 1993 to April 16, 2008. He served as the President of MidAmerican Energy Holdings from April 19, 1993 to January 21, 1995. Formerly, among other positions held in the independent power industry, Sokol served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Kiewit Energy Company, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc., and Ogden Projects Inc. Sokol served as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Managers of MidAmerican Funding LLC, a subsidiary of MidAmerican Energy Holdings, since its formation in March 1999. He served as a Manager of Berkshire.
Sokol serves as the Chairman of the Board of Ce Casecnan Water & Energy Co., Inc. He serves as Chairman of Omaha Metropolitan Entertainment and Convention Authority. He served as the Chairman of the Board of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company since May 1994. He served as Chairman of HomeServices of America, Inc. (formerly HomeServices.Com Inc.) since inception in July 1999. He served as Chairman of Northern Electric PLC. He has been a director of HomeServices of America, Inc., since July 1999. He serves as a director of Ce Casecnan Water & Energy Co., Inc., and Omaha Airport Authority. He has been Director of MidAmerican Energy Holdings since March 1991. He served as a director of MidAmerican Funding LLC, since formation in March 1999. He served as Non-executive Director of BYD Company Ltd.,from August 4, 2009 to April 1, 2011.
He served as a director of Northern Electric PLC from January 1997 to June 1, 2007. He also served as a director of CE Electric UK Funding Company until June 1, 2007. He holds Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from University of Nebraska, Omaha in 1978 and Honorary Doctorate from Bellevue University Bellevue Nebraska.[5] In 2008, he authored and self-published "Pleased But Not Satisfied", which described his business philosophy.
Involvement with Berkshire Hathaway[edit]
Prior to his abrupt resignation in March 2011, David Sokol was widely regarded as the likely successor to Warren Buffett.[6] Often referred to as Buffett's Mr. Fix-It,[7] Sokol was tasked with rescuing underperforming Berkshire divisions Johns Manville and NetJets. Under Sokol's leadership Johns Manville was brought back on track and NetJets swung from a $157 million loss in 2009 to a $207 million gain in 2010.[8]
Sokol was also integral in the selection of acquisition targets at Berkshire. In 2008, Sokol flew to China to research car manufacturer BYD, which resulted in Berkshire acquiring a $230 million stake. This position was worth over $1.5 billion in 2010. Later in 2008, Sokol engineered the acquisition of Constellation for $4.7 billion, sparing the energy company from bankruptcy.[7]
Lawsuits[edit]
In April 2010, a Douglas County judge[9] found that Sokol, who was the CEO of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, decided to change future profit calculations in such a way that it eliminated the stake in a 1990s Philippines project for San Lorenzo Ruiz Builders & Developers Group. The judge said that Sokol and MidAmerican had acted "willfully and intentionally".[9] The court levied a $32 million[10] ruling against MidAmerican. This ruling may be worth $140 million in future profits.
In a second case, courts in San Francisco and Omaha ruled against MidAmerican for a total of $52 million[9] in past profits, while also restoring ownership to La Prairie and San Lorenzo. These rights could amount to $280 million in future profits.
The third lawsuit for $150 million alleges that Sokol "secretly resumed negotiations"[9] that led to a lower projected profit.
Resignation and Lubrizol-related share activity[edit]
Sokol purchased 96,060 shares of Lubrizol at a limit price of $104 per share between January 5 and 7, 2011. He presented the idea of Berkshire's acquiring Lubrizol to Buffett on January 14 or 15, 2011, and again after a January 25 meeting with Lubrizol's CEO. Berkshire Hathaway's board voted to acquire Lubrizol at $135 per share on March 13, 2011.[11]
On March 28, 2011, Sokol tendered his resignation from Berkshire Hathaway. In his press release detailing the resignation, Mr. Buffett detailed trading activity surrounding the Lubrizol acquisition, emphasizing that he did not believe anything unlawful transpired.[11]

Sokol was an able student who got progressively better as he got older. He had been involved in football, wrestling, and track in high school and went on to play football in college. When he realized he couldn't have a career in football, he began to take school more seriously.
Shortly before the end of his junior year in college, Sokol married. He moved out of his parents' home and into a trailer with his bride, Peggy. By the time he graduated, he had a child on the way. "At that time, my main goal was to get my salary above my age," he says. Sokol graduated in 1978 and went to work as a structural engineer for an engineering company in America, HDR, Inc.[4]
Professional career[edit]
Previously, Sokol served as the Chief Executive Officer of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (formerly CalEnergy Company Inc.) a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. from April 19, 1993 to April 16, 2008. He served as the President of MidAmerican Energy Holdings from April 19, 1993 to January 21, 1995. Formerly, among other positions held in the independent power industry, Sokol served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Kiewit Energy Company, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc., and Ogden Projects Inc. Sokol served as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Managers of MidAmerican Funding LLC, a subsidiary of MidAmerican Energy Holdings, since its formation in March 1999. He served as a Manager of Berkshire.

He served as the Chairman of the Board of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company since May 1994. He served as Chairman of HomeServices of America, Inc. (formerly HomeServices.Com Inc.) since inception in July 1999. He served as Chairman of Northern Electric PLC. He has been a director of HomeServices of America, Inc., since July 1999.

He holds Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from University of Nebraska, Omaha in 1978 and Honorary Doctorate from Bellevue University Bellevue Nebraska.[5] In 2008, he authored and self-published "Pleased But Not Satisfied", which described his business philosophy.
Involvement with Berkshire Hathaway[edit]
Prior to his abrupt resignation in March 2011, David Sokol was widely regarded as the likely successor to Warren Buffett.[6] Often referred to as Buffett's Mr. Fix-It,[7] Sokol was tasked with rescuing underperforming Berkshire divisions Johns Manville and NetJets. Under Sokol's leadership Johns Manville was brought back on track and NetJets swung from a $157 million loss in 2009 to a $207 million gain in 2010.[8]
Sokol was also integral in the selection of acquisition targets at Berkshire. In 2008, Sokol flew to China to research car manufacturer BYD, which resulted in Berkshire acquiring a $230 million stake. This position was worth over $1.5 billion in 2010. Later in 2008, Sokol engineered the acquisition of Constellation for $4.7 billion, sparing the energy company from bankruptcy.[7]
Lawsuits[edit]
In April 2010, a Douglas County judge[9] found that Sokol, who was the CEO of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, decided to change future profit calculations in such a way that it eliminated the stake in a 1990s Philippines project for San Lorenzo Ruiz Builders & Developers Group. The judge said that Sokol and MidAmerican had acted "willfully and intentionally".[9] The court levied a $32 million[10] ruling against MidAmerican. This ruling may be worth $140 million in future profits.
In a second case, courts in San Francisco and Omaha ruled against MidAmerican for a total of $52 million[9] in past profits, while also restoring ownership to La Prairie and San Lorenzo. These rights could amount to $280 million in future profits.
The third lawsuit for $150 million alleges that Sokol "secretly resumed negotiations"[9] that led to a lower projected profit.
Resignation and Lubrizol-related share activity[edit]
Sokol purchased 96,060 shares of Lubrizol at a limit price of $104 per share between January 5 and 7, 2011. He presented the idea of Berkshire's acquiring Lubrizol to Buffett on January 14 or 15, 2011, and again after a January 25 meeting with Lubrizol's CEO. Berkshire Hathaway's board voted to acquire Lubrizol at $135 per share on March 13, 2011.[11]
On March 28, 2011, Sokol tendered his resignation from Berkshire Hathaway. In his press release detailing the resignation, Mr. Buffett detailed trading activity surrounding the Lubrizol acquisition, emphasizing that he did not believe anything unlawful transpired.[11]

Early life[edit]
The youngest of five children, David L Sokol was born in 1956 in Omaha, Nebraska. His father managed a grocery store in Omaha when he was born. He attended Catholic grade school and public high school.[3] "My parents had been married for 25 years by the time I came along," says Sokol. "My oldest sibling is 23 years older than me, so there were times when it seemed like I had more than just two parents."
Sokol's father was focused on the positive side of life. It was his habit on weekends to go through the newspaper looking for articles that would inspire his family. "We were all expected to sit together for dinner on Sundays," says Sokol. "My father would ask us to read aloud the stories he had circled. They were always about a local businessman who had done well, or maybe about someone who had given money to help resolve a problem. He instilled in us a belief that we, too, could do the great things we read about in the paper. His parents came over from Poland and he was a 100 percent believer in America-that if you apply yourself in this country, you can do anything. I was raised with that philosophy, and I agree with my father."
Sokol describes his mother as traditional and loving. Even though their home was modest, she made it comfortable and welcoming. "She was the kind of mother who had cookies warm out of the oven when you came home from school," says Sokol. "She focused on our care and education." Sokol's parents would not be able to pay for their children's college education, but it was expected that each of them would go. "My father expected us to work our way through school, but he didn't think that was a bad thing. He believed you learned a lot from working."
When Sokol was 11, his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. To help out with expenses, Sokol worked as a paperboy, as a caddie at a golf course, and as a janitor in a hardware store. He also helped local farmers bale hay. In high school, he worked as a maintenance manager for an apartment complex. He also worked for a local grocery store, starting as a bagger and then in less than two years becoming the night manager.
Sokol was able to keep this job when he entered the University of Nebraska. His life was busy and focused. He lived at home, went to school during the day, and worked at night. Sokol was an able student who got progressively better as he got older. He had been involved in football, wrestling, and track in high school and went on to play football in college. When he realized he couldn't have a career in football, he began to take school more seriously.
Shortly before the end of his junior year in college, Sokol married. He moved out of his parents' home and into a trailer with his bride, Peggy. By the time he graduated, he had a child on the way. "At that time, my main goal was to get my salary above my age," he says. Sokol graduated in 1978 and went to work as a structural engineer for an engineering company in America, HDR, Inc.[4]

David Sokol: Buffett's Right-Hand Man's Management PhilosophyHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0David Sokol: Buffett's Right-Hand Man's Management PhilosophyRyan C. FuhrmannInvestopediaMarch 2, 2011ReblogShareTweetShareBack in 1999, an investor group including Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway helped Berkshire make its first foray into the energy business. The acquisition was of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, and the investor group included a gentleman by the name of David L. Sokol, MidAmerican's CEO. In letters to shareholders, Buffett has since described Sokol as a "brilliant" and "terrific" manager who is "the enormously talented builder and operator of MidAmerican Energy."Sokol has frequently been mentioned as Warren Buffett's "Mr. Fix-It," and as a potential successor to Buffett when it's time for The Oracle of Omaha to step down from the helm of Berkshire Hathaway. The admiration of one the world's best businessmen is certainly notable, so it is worth digging into what has made Mr. Sokol such a resounding success over the years.Sokol laid out many of the details of his management philosophy in his book, "Pleased but Not Satisfied" (2008). The title refers to a mindset of continuous and incremental improvements on both a personal and professional level. As such, it contains many insights that individuals can apply to their own lives and professions. Like Sokol himself, his philosophy is very detailed and covers major and minor points, including carrying out employee evaluations, six principles to adhere to when running a business, goal setting, budgeting, individual improvement and how to balance personal and business lives. The lessons provide valuable business insight and also give clues as to how Berkshire Hathaway might be run after Buffett hands over the reins for good.Background on David SokolSokol has earned the status as Buffett's right-hand man since the MidAmerican Energy acquisition, after Sokol built MidAmerican into the large utility it is today. In 1991, the company was just a geothermal business known as CalEnergy, with an estimated $28 million in sales. Sokol, through over 20 years of acquisitions, eventually created MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, with over $7 billion in revenue. Since the acquisition, Sokol has been called in to turnaround other Berkshire companies, including roofing company Johns Manville, executive jet firm NetJets, and he has also been asked to look at other investments such as battery and car firm BYD in China and the rescue package for Constellation Energy Group.Sokol was mentioned as a potential successor to Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway in 2010 and 2011, but his personality differs sharply from Buffett. Sokol is known to have a direct, to-the-point management style and takes a systematic, candid and objective approach to running businesses. His engineering background is illustrative of the constant measurement and attention to detail he applies to business management.Management PhilosophySokol's management philosophy can most visibly be observed through the advice he provides in regard to running a company and adopting a set of enduring principles. He has developed a set of core principles for running MidAmerican energy and has boiled them down to what he refers to as six business principles. The six commandments are offered in no particular order as each is seen as equally important. As such, they are simply detailed in alphabetical order.Commitment to the CustomerThe first consists of customer commitment. Sokol has used the perspective of MidAmerican Energy, which, as a regulated utility, has a captive customer audience that is obligated to uses its electricity and pay for it on a monthly basis no matter what happens to their jobs or income levels. In many cases, monopolies start to ignore customer commitment as customers have no choice but to use their products or services. In addition to utilities, telephone firms and cable companies come to mind and are notorious for being difficult to deal with and neglectful of serving the customer. Sokol refers to the opportunity (as opposed to the obligation) to serve customers by "providing the highest-quality service in a fairly priced and safe manner."Employee Commitment and TransparencyTo Sokol, employee commitment consists of a two-way street where employers and employees communicate with each other honestly and in a forthright manner. He details that employees can expect competitive salaries, training, support and a safe work environment, which is important for utility operators and other labor-intensive jobs. In addition, management has an obligation to run its business properly. Cases where this did not occur include the auto industry where "employees were laid off – not because of an event, but due to many years of questionable management decisions." And finally, candor is important and providing immediate performance feedback, as opposed to year-end reviews of dubious value to either managers or workers. Sokol believes in constant feedback and continuously ranks his managers from best to worst.Firms that possess financial strength serve both the company and employees well. Returning again to the auto industry example, Sokol's advice runs core to Berkshire Hathaway's philosophy in that it is focused on producing a product and service that customers demand and delivering it in an efficient and low-cost manner to stay sufficiently profitable. Staying vigilant on the cost front can be a competitive advantage that is exploited to beat the competition and ensure operating success regardless of a boom or downturn in the business cycle.Employer and Employee IntegritySokol frequently cites Buffett when referring to integrity, which boils down to finding employees that possess integrity, intellect and passion for their jobs. Integrity is very necessary, as Enron and Tyco had business leaders with high intellect and passion for growing their firms but lacked integrity to do it in an honest and ethical manner. Sokol states that integrity is doing the right thing when nobody is looking, and Buffett has suggested imagining that anything an individual does could show up on the front page of his or her local newspaper as motivation to maintain high integrity. Environmental respect is closely related to integrity, and also customer commitment when considering that society as a whole can be considered the end customer for many companies. Again, a regulated utility is a prime example given the need to generate and distribute electricity and natural gas in an environmentally friendly manner.Minimizing MistakesIn Sokol's mind, operational excellence consists of paying attention to detail and minimizing the making of mistakes or other small problems that could turn into big issues. For example, some oil companies have been cited numerous times for a lack of attention to seemingly small manners, and that have resulted in oil pipeline leaks or oil well explosions. In many cases, these damaging events might have been less severe, or could even been prevented with attention to seemingly minor maintenance activities. Because of a lack of attention to detail, the last oil company might experience huge declines in its reputation and profits. Openness and candidness are other key ingredients to excellence, according to Sokol. In his words, "the more uncomfortable the situation, the more valuable a candid conversation becomes."Personal PrinciplesSuccessfully managing other individuals and a company would not be possible without first committing oneself to individual improvement. Sokol lists four traits he sees as predictive of successful corporate managers. These include giving a 110% commitment to all activities, maintaining professionalism, trusting one's instincts and accepting accountability for one's actions. He cites individuals including Einstein and Tiger Woods, who are gifted with great natural talents in their professions, but have coupled this with hard work to become truly exceptional in their fields.Sokol details that it "is amazing how much luckier you will become if you approach every day well-prepared and willing to outwork the competition." Basic blocking and tackling is a cornerstone of this philosophy and includes showing up on time for meetings (being late shows disrespect as it demonstrates your time is more important than others at the meeting), treating people with respect at all times, and being honest and again candid in communicating with others.Balancing business and personal life is a final component to success, according to Sokol. Like many of his fellow Berkshire business leaders, the business life remains front and center, but he does provide suggestions on how to still balance in family life. Again, core principles used in business life are cited and include being candid with your spouse and children, and constantly working out compromises.The Bottom LineSokol's overriding advice is that one must "get the basics right and the success will follow." Sokol contrasts sharply with Buffett's management style, but he is clearly a capable individual with many successful business accomplishments that could help Berkshire thrive once Buffett decides to move on.ReblogShareTweetSharePopular in the CommunityTwitter Hack or Authentic?

David Sokol, Ex-Warren Buffett Exec, Slams Billionaire, Saying He'll 'Leave His Verdict To A Higher Power'






By Caroline Fairchild

One of Warren Buffett's ex-employees is lashing out against his former boss. 
David Sokol, a man who once seemed on-track to succeed Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway, called out the billionaire in a Wall Street Journal story over the weekend. 
"I will never understand why Mr. Buffett chose to hurt my family in such a way, but given that he is rapidly approaching his judgement [sic] day I will leave his verdict to a higher power," Mr. Sokol wrote in an emailed response to the WSJ.
Sokol's statement comes almost two years after he left Buffett's company over questionable stock trades and just days after Sokol's lawyer announced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would not charge Sokol with insider trading. Back in 2011, immediately following his departure, Buffett called Sokol’s actions “inexplicable and inexcusable.” 
It's rare for an ex-employee to lash out against Buffett. The self-made billionaire generally has a great relationship with his executives and "gives them lots of room to manage their companies," according to the WSJ. The Berkshire CEO, sometimes called the Oracle of Omaha, is also beloved in the financial community, with investors, financial media and even President Obama touting his ideas.
Sokol, an Omaha native just like Buffett, appeared to be in the Buffett-loving camp until he resigned. Buffett had formerly called Sokol  "an enormously talented builder and operator,"according to the AP. 
After leaving Berkshire Hathaway, Sokol went on to start a private equity firm called Teton Capital. Sokol says he has no plans to rekindle his relationship with Buffett anytime soon, Fox Business reports.
“I haven’t spoken to Warren and I don’t want to...the notion that I violated some company policy is absurd,” Sokol told Fox Business.

Sokol net worth:$200 Million David Sokol Net Worth: David Sokol is an American businessman who has a net worth of $200 million. Born David L. Sokol in 1956, Omaha, Nebraska, he made the headlines as the Warren Buffet's disgraced ex-heir as he left the magnate's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in 2011 amid accusations of violating insider-trading rules. Prior to his fall from grace, Sokol held the positions of Chairman, President and CEO at NetJets and Chairman at MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company. These being just two of the several main Berkshire Hathaway units in which the company holds a 100% and 89.8% stake accordingly. A young man that was dedicated to getting his salary above his age at the time of his graduation in 1978, he started his career as a structural engineer at HDR, Inc. It was in the early 1990's that he started to work for Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. earning more and more recognitions with each achievement that he made. Most notably, David Sokol was the one who turned around Johns Manville, an insulated sinking company, as well as he did due diligence for Berkshire on BYD, a Chinese battery company in which Berkshire invested. Especially appreciated for his work at NetJets and MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, Sokol is now receiving $1 million annually from the company in retirement payments. Even though he was regarded to be a leading candidate to take over from Mr. Buffett, Sokol had no other choice but to resign from Berkshire Hathaway on March 28, 2011 following charges for breaching insider-trading rules.

Early life[edit]
The youngest of five children, David L Sokol was born in 1956 in Omaha, Nebraska. His father managed a grocery store in Omaha when he was born. He attended Catholic grade school and public high school.[3] "My parents had been married for 25 years by the time I came along," says Sokol. "My oldest sibling is 23 years older than me, so there were times when it seemed like I had more than just two parents."
Sokol's father was focused on the positive side of life. It was his habit on weekends to go through the newspaper looking for articles that would inspire his family. "We were all expected to sit together for dinner on Sundays," says Sokol. "My father would ask us to read aloud the stories he had circled. They were always about a local businessman who had done well, or maybe about someone who had given money to help resolve a problem. He instilled in us a belief that we, too, could do the great things we read about in the paper. His parents came over from Poland and he was a 100 percent believer in America-that if you apply yourself in this country, you can do anything. I was raised with that philosophy, and I agree with my father."
Sokol describes his mother as traditional and loving. Even though their home was modest, she made it comfortable and welcoming. "She was the kind of mother who had cookies warm out of the oven when you came home from school," says Sokol. "She focused on our care and education." Sokol's parents would not be able to pay for their children's college education, but it was expected that each of them would go. "My father expected us to work our way through school, but he didn't think that was a bad thing. He believed you learned a lot from working."
When Sokol was 11, his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. To help out with expenses, Sokol worked as a paperboy, as a caddie at a golf course, and as a janitor in a hardware store. He also helped local farmers bale hay. In high school, he worked as a maintenance manager for an apartment complex. He also worked for a local grocery store, starting as a bagger and then in less than two years becoming the night manager.
Sokol was able to keep this job when he entered the University of Nebraska. His life was busy and focused. He lived at home, went to school during the day, and worked at night. Sokol was an able student who got progressively better as he got older. He had been involved in football, wrestling, and track in high school and went on to play football in college. When he realized he couldn't have a career in football, he began to take school more seriously.
Shortly before the end of his junior year in college, Sokol married. He moved out of his parents' home and into a trailer with his bride, Peggy. By the time he graduated, he had a child on the way. "At that time, my main goal was to get my salary above my age," he says. Sokol graduated in 1978 and went to work as a structural engineer for an engineering company in America, HDR, Inc.[4]
Professional career[edit]
Previously, Sokol served as the Chief Executive Officer of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (formerly CalEnergy Company Inc.) a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. from April 19, 1993 to April 16, 2008. He served as the President of MidAmerican Energy Holdings from April 19, 1993 to January 21, 1995. Formerly, among other positions held in the independent power industry, Sokol served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Kiewit Energy Company, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc., and Ogden Projects Inc. Sokol served as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Managers of MidAmerican Funding LLC, a subsidiary of MidAmerican Energy Holdings, since its formation in March 1999. He served as a Manager of Berkshire.
Sokol serves as the Chairman of the Board of Ce Casecnan Water & Energy Co., Inc. He serves as Chairman of Omaha Metropolitan Entertainment and Convention Authority. He served as the Chairman of the Board of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company since May 1994. He served as Chairman of HomeServices of America, Inc. (formerly HomeServices.Com Inc.) since inception in July 1999. He served as Chairman of Northern Electric PLC. He has been a director of HomeServices of America, Inc., since July 1999. He serves as a director of Ce Casecnan Water & Energy Co., Inc., and Omaha Airport Authority. He has been Director of MidAmerican Energy Holdings since March 1991. He served as a director of MidAmerican Funding LLC, since formation in March 1999. He served as Non-executive Director of BYD Company Ltd.,from August 4, 2009 to April 1, 2011.
He served as a director of Northern Electric PLC from January 1997 to June 1, 2007. He also served as a director of CE Electric UK Funding Company until June 1, 2007. He holds Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from University of Nebraska, Omaha in 1978 and Honorary Doctorate from Bellevue University Bellevue Nebraska.[5] In 2008, he authored and self-published "Pleased But Not Satisfied", which described his business philosophy.
Involvement with Berkshire Hathaway[edit]
Prior to his abrupt resignation in March 2011, David Sokol was widely regarded as the likely successor to Warren Buffett.[6] Often referred to as Buffett's Mr. Fix-It,[7] Sokol was tasked with rescuing underperforming Berkshire divisions Johns Manville and NetJets. Under Sokol's leadership Johns Manville was brought back on track and NetJets swung from a $157 million loss in 2009 to a $207 million gain in 2010.[8]
Sokol was also integral in the selection of acquisition targets at Berkshire. In 2008, Sokol flew to China to research car manufacturer BYD, which resulted in Berkshire acquiring a $230 million stake. This position was worth over $1.5 billion in 2010. Later in 2008, Sokol engineered the acquisition of Constellation for $4.7 billion, sparing the energy company from bankruptcy.[7]
Lawsuits[edit]
In April 2010, a Douglas County judge[9] found that Sokol, who was the CEO of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, decided to change future profit calculations in such a way that it eliminated the stake in a 1990s Philippines project for San Lorenzo Ruiz Builders & Developers Group. The judge said that Sokol and MidAmerican had acted "willfully and intentionally".[9] The court levied a $32 million[10] ruling against MidAmerican. This ruling may be worth $140 million in future profits.
In a second case, courts in San Francisco and Omaha ruled against MidAmerican for a total of $52 million[9] in past profits, while also restoring ownership to La Prairie and San Lorenzo. These rights could amount to $280 million in future profits.
The third lawsuit for $150 million alleges that Sokol "secretly resumed negotiations"[9] that led to a lower projected profit.
Resignation and Lubrizol-related share activity[edit]
Sokol purchased 96,060 shares of Lubrizol at a limit price of $104 per share between January 5 and 7, 2011. He presented the idea of Berkshire's acquiring Lubrizol to Buffett on January 14 or 15, 2011, and again after a January 25 meeting with Lubrizol's CEO. Berkshire Hathaway's board voted to acquire Lubrizol at $135 per share on March 13, 2011.[11]
On March 28, 2011, Sokol tendered his resignation from Berkshire Hathaway. In his press release detailing the resignation, Mr. Buffett detailed trading activity surrounding the Lubrizol acquisition, emphasizing that he did not believe anything unlawful transpired.[11]

Early life[edit]
The youngest of five children, David L Sokol was born in 1956 in Omaha, Nebraska. His father managed a grocery store in Omaha when he was born. He attended Catholic grade school and public high school.[3] "My parents had been married for 25 years by the time I came along," says Sokol. "My oldest sibling is 23 years older than me, so there were times when it seemed like I had more than just two parents."
Sokol's father was focused on the positive side of life. It was his habit on weekends to go through the newspaper looking for articles that would inspire his family. "We were all expected to sit together for dinner on Sundays," says Sokol. "My father would ask us to read aloud the stories he had circled. They were always about a local businessman who had done well, or maybe about someone who had given money to help resolve a problem. He instilled in us a belief that we, too, could do the great things we read about in the paper. His parents came over from Poland and he was a 100 percent believer in America-that if you apply yourself in this country, you can do anything. I was raised with that philosophy, and I agree with my father."
Sokol describes his mother as traditional and loving. Even though their home was modest, she made it comfortable and welcoming. "She was the kind of mother who had cookies warm out of the oven when you came home from school," says Sokol. "She focused on our care and education." Sokol's parents would not be able to pay for their children's college education, but it was expected that each of them would go. "My father expected us to work our way through school, but he didn't think that was a bad thing. He believed you learned a lot from working."
When Sokol was 11, his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. To help out with expenses, Sokol worked as a paperboy, as a caddie at a golf course, and as a janitor in a hardware store. He also helped local farmers bale hay. In high school, he worked as a maintenance manager for an apartment complex. He also worked for a local grocery store, starting as a bagger and then in less than two years becoming the night manager.
Sokol was able to keep this job when he entered the University of Nebraska. His life was busy and focused. He lived at home, went to school during the day, and worked at night. Sokol was an able student who got progressively better as he got older. He had been involved in football, wrestling, and track in high school and went on to play football in college. When he realized he couldn't have a career in football, he began to take school more seriously.
Shortly before the end of his junior year in college, Sokol married. He moved out of his parents' home and into a trailer with his bride, Peggy. By the time he graduated, he had a child on the way. "At that time, my main goal was to get my salary above my age," he says. Sokol graduated in 1978 and went to work as a structural engineer for an engineering company in America, HDR, Inc.[4]
Professional career[edit]
Previously, Sokol served as the Chief Executive Officer of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (formerly CalEnergy Company Inc.) a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. from April 19, 1993 to April 16, 2008.

Involvement with Berkshire Hathaway[edit]
Prior to his abrupt resignation in March 2011, David Sokol was widely regarded as the likely successor to Warren Buffett.[6] Often referred to as Buffett's Mr. Fix-It,[7] Sokol was tasked with rescuing underperforming Berkshire divisions Johns Manville and NetJets. Under Sokol's leadership Johns Manville was brought back on track and NetJets swung from a $157 million loss in 2009 to a $207 million gain in 2010.[8]
Sokol was also integral in the selection of acquisition targets at Berkshire. In 2008, Sokol flew to China to research car manufacturer BYD, which resulted in Berkshire acquiring a $230 million stake. This position was worth over $1.5 billion in 2010. Later in 2008, Sokol engineered the acquisition of Constellation for $4.7 billion, sparing the energy company from bankruptcy.[7]
Lawsuits[edit]
In April 2010, a Douglas County judge[9] found that Sokol, who was the CEO of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, decided to change future profit calculations in such a way that it eliminated the stake in a 1990s Philippines project for San Lorenzo Ruiz Builders & Developers Group. The judge said that Sokol and MidAmerican had acted "willfully and intentionally".[9] The court levied a $32 million[10] ruling against MidAmerican. This ruling may be worth $140 million in future profits.
In a second case, courts in San Francisco and Omaha ruled against MidAmerican for a total of $52 million[9] in past profits, while also restoring ownership to La Prairie and San Lorenzo. These rights could amount to $280 million in future profits.
The third lawsuit for $150 million alleges that Sokol "secretly resumed negotiations"[9] that led to a lower projected profit.
Resignation and Lubrizol-related share activity[edit]
Sokol purchased 96,060 shares of Lubrizol at a limit price of $104 per share between January 5 and 7, 2011. He presented the idea of Berkshire's acquiring Lubrizol to Buffett on January 14 or 15, 2011, and again after a January 25 meeting with Lubrizol's CEO. Berkshire Hathaway's board voted to acquire Lubrizol at $135 per share on March 13, 2011.[11]
On March 28, 2011, Sokol tendered his resignation from Berkshire Hathaway. In his press release detailing the resignation, Mr. Buffett detailed trading activity surrounding the Lubrizol acquisition, emphasizing that he did not believe anything unlawful transpired.[11]

Early life[edit]
The youngest of five children, David L Sokol was born in 1956 in Omaha, Nebraska. His father managed a grocery store in Omaha when he was born. He attended Catholic grade school and public high school.[3] "My parents had been married for 25 years by the time I came along," says Sokol. "My oldest sibling is 23 years older than me, so there were times when it seemed like I had more than just two parents."
Sokol's father was focused on the positive side of life. It was his habit on weekends to go through the newspaper looking for articles that would inspire his family. "We were all expected to sit together for dinner on Sundays," says Sokol. "My father would ask us to read aloud the stories he had circled. They were always about a local businessman who had done well, or maybe about someone who had given money to help resolve a problem. He instilled in us a belief that we, too, could do the great things we read about in the paper. His parents came over from Poland and he was a 100 percent believer in America-that if you apply yourself in this country, you can do anything. I was raised with that philosophy, and I agree with my father."
Sokol describes his mother as traditional and loving. Even though their home was modest, she made it comfortable and welcoming. "She was the kind of mother who had cookies warm out of the oven when you came home from school," says Sokol. "She focused on our care and education." Sokol's parents would not be able to pay for their children's college education, but it was expected that each of them would go. "My father expected us to work our way through school, but he didn't think that was a bad thing. He believed you learned a lot from working."
When Sokol was 11, his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. To help out with expenses, Sokol worked as a paperboy, as a caddie at a golf course, and as a janitor in a hardware store. He also helped local farmers bale hay. In high school, he worked as a maintenance manager for an apartment complex. He also worked for a local grocery store, starting as a bagger and then in less than two years becoming the night manager.
Sokol was able to keep this job when he entered the University of Nebraska. His life was busy and focused. He lived at home, went to school during the day, and worked at night. Sokol was an able student who got progressively better as he got older. He had been involved in football, wrestling, and track in high school and went on to play football in college. When he realized he couldn't have a career in football, he began to take school more seriously.
Shortly before the end of his junior year in college, Sokol married. He moved out of his parents' home and into a trailer with his bride, Peggy. By the time he graduated, he had a child on the way. "At that time, my main goal was to get my salary above my age," he says. Sokol graduated in 1978 and went to work as a structural engineer for an engineering company in America, HDR, Inc.[4]

Sokol net worth:$200 Million David Sokol Net Worth: David Sokol is an American businessman who has a net worth of $200 million. Born David L. Sokol in 1956, Omaha, Nebraska, he made the headlines as the Warren Buffet's disgraced ex-heir as he left the magnate's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in 2011 amid accusations of violating insider-trading rules. Prior to his fall from grace, Sokol held the positions of Chairman, President and CEO at NetJets and Chairman at MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company. These being just two of the several main Berkshire Hathaway units in which the company holds a 100% and 89.8% stake accordingly. A young man that was dedicated to getting his salary above his age at the time of his graduation in 1978, he started his career as a structural engineer at HDR, Inc. It was in the early 1990's that he started to work for Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. earning more and more recognitions with each achievement that he made. Most notably, David Sokol was the one who turned around Johns Manville, an insulated sinking company, as well as he did due diligence for Berkshire on BYD, a Chinese battery company in which Berkshire invested. Especially appreciated for his work at NetJets and MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, Sokol is now receiving $1 million annually from the company in retirement payments. Even though he was regarded to be a leading candidate to take over from Mr. Buffett, Sokol had no other choice but to resign from Berkshire Hathaway on March 28, 2011 following charges for breaching insider-trading rules.

 View full sizeAP fileDavid SokolOMAHA, Neb. -- A 
top executive of Berkshire Hathaway who was believed to have had the 
inside track to one day succeed billionaire Warren Buffett as CEO has 
suddenly resigned.Buffett said Wednesday that David Sokol's 
resignation letter, delivered by his assistant late Monday, came as a 
"total surprise." Buffett said Sokol, who had been serving as chairman 
of Berkshire's MidAmerican Energy, NetJets and Johns Manville units, 
indicated that he wants to spend more time on philanthropy."As I 
have mentioned to you in the past, it is my goal to utilize the time 
remaining in my career to invest my family's resources in such a way as 
to create enduring equity value and hopefully an enterprise which will 
provide opportunity for my descendents and funding for my philanthropic 
interests," Sokol wrote. Buffett said twice before, most recently about 
two years ago, Sokol had spoken to him of resigning for similar reasons 
but Buffett and other board members convinced him to stay with the 
company. He has accepted Sokol's resignation this time.Buffett 
did said that he learned earlier this month that Sokol bought nearly 
100,000 shares of Lubrizol stock before recommending that Berkshire buy 
the chemical company. Buffett said he doesn't believe those stock 
purchases were illegal, and didn't ask Sokol to resign.Buffett 
has regularly praised Sokol's work, and many investors have speculated 
that Sokol was on the short list to succeed Buffett at the Omaha, 
Neb.-based company.Due to Sokol's departure, Buffett said Greg 
Abel, current president and CEO of MidAmerican Holding Co., will become 
its chairman; Todd Raba, president and CEO of Johns Manville, will 
become its chairman; and Jordan Hansell, President of NetJets, will 
become that unit's chairman and CEO.Buffett declined to comment beyond his statement. Sokol did not immediately respond to a message left Wednesday.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
