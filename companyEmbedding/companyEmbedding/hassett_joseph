As a Christ-centered educational community, St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute ministers to both the educational and religious needs of high school young men by preparing them in the formation of individual responsibility, by cultivating the positive attitudes of mutual respect, compassion, interdependence, and service within the Church and the larger community. In keeping with its Lasallian mission, St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute is committed to promoting positive social relations within a diverse group of students, establishing a school environment of respectful and culturally sensitive interactions between students and between students and faculty. SJCI creates an inclusive Catholic educational program and pedagogy, fostering respect for individual, cultural, and socioeconomic differences, developing commitment to social responsibility, equity, and justice. SJCI recognizes the value of diversity within its school community. Therefore, we seek to ensure the inclusion of these identities within the culture of our school as a major component in preparing our students for active and positive participation in our global world. St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute is a Lasallian college-preparatory school for young men that is dedicated to responding to the needs of each student. Touching the hearts and minds of our students for lives of accomplishment and service.

Stars Of The South - 2010







 Joseph M. Hassett
Joseph Hassett balances his achievements in law with a passion for Irish culture and academia. He is both an accomplished lawyer and Yeats scholar. His new book, W.B. Yeats and the Muses, published by Oxford University Press, will be reviewed in our next issue.
A graduate of Canisius College, Harvard University and University College, Dublin, where he earned his MA and PhD, Joe is a member of the bar in Washington, D.C. and New York and has argued in   appellate courts all over the country and in the United States Supreme Court. He is currently with Hogan Lovells, a firm based in D.C., with offices worldwide and a long history of being committed to recruiting, retaining, and promoting lawyers and others with diverse backgrounds and experiences.
A proud Irish American whose great-grandparents emigrated from counties Clare and Cork, Joe lives in Washington, D.C. with his wife, Carol Melton (the couple has two children) and serves as counsel to the Embassy of Ireland.
His interest in W.B. Yeats stems from the generosity of Irish Americans in his hometown of Buffalo, New York, who funded a scholarship that took him to the Yeats International Summer School in Sligo following his junior year in college in 1963.
Joe has lectured on Yeats and other Irish writers at such venues as the Yeats International Summer School in Sligo, the James Joyce Summer School in Dublin, the Princess Grace Irish Library in Monaco, and Oxford University.

 Hassett, Joseph Michael 65 Nov. 27, 1947 Feb. 13, 2013 Joseph Michael Hassett, M.D., died on Feb. 13, 2013. Dr. Hassett was born in New York City on Nov. 27, 1947, to James and Julia (nee Hallinan) Hassett. He graduated with honors from Canisius High School, Buffalo, N.Y., in 1965, and attended Columbia University, receiving a B.A. in 1969. Service with an ambulance corps in the U.S. Army led to Dr. Hassett's interest in practicing medicine. Dr. Hassett graduated with honors from Rutgers Medical School in 1977 and trained as an intern and resident at Mt. Sinai Medical Center, New York. Dr. Hassett was awarded the AAS Bella Trachtenberg Award for House Staff Excellence at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in 1981. Dr. Hassett was appointed Chief Medical Resident at Mt. Sinai and, after completing a fellowship in Clinical Immunology, held numerous academic and clinical appointments at Mt. Sinai over the next 14 years, including Director of the Flow Cytometry Laboratory and Director of the Clinical Immunology Fellowship Program. In 1998, he received the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine Distinguished Service Award. Dr. Hassett's research and clinical practice at Mt. Sinai made substantial contributions to the treatment of HIV, and during this period of his professional career he was repeatedly recognized as one of the "Best Physicians in New York." Dr. Hassett was board certified in internal medicine, allergy and Immunology and diagnostic laboratory immunology. In 1996, Dr. Hassett relocated to Portland and began a clinical practice with Allergy Asthma and Dermatology Associates. He served on the Executive Council of the Oregon State Asthma, Allergy and Immunology Association and served on the Board of Directors and as President of the Western Asthma, Allergy and Immunology Association. Focusing on a patient-centered model of care, Dr. Hassett was recognized multiple times as one of the Best Doctors in America and one of the Best Doctors in Portland. In 2007, Dr. Hassett started his own practice as AAIM Care and, in conjunction with the dedicated medical team at AAIM Care, was able to achieve his goal of in-depth care to help patients understand and manage their immunological conditions. Dr. Hassett is survived by his wife, Yi (Yvonne) Zhou; children, Alana and Alex; and siblings, Julie (Lee) Vaughan (deceased), James (Linda) Hassett, Annemarie Hassett (Joel Belasco), Patrick (Christine) Hassett and Eileen Hassett (Martin Casstevens). Visitation on Feb. 19 from 1-5 p.m. and Feb. 20 from 12-1 p.m. at Skyline Memorial Garden and Funeral Home, 4101 NW Skyline Blvd., Portland, OR. A memorial service at the same location on Feb. 20 at 1 p.m., followed by a reception 2-3:30 p.m. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Dr. Hassett's memory to the Western Asthma, Allergy and Immunology Association.

Stars Of The South - 2010







 Joseph M. Hassett
Joseph Hassett balances his achievements in law with a passion for Irish culture and academia. He is both an accomplished lawyer and Yeats scholar. His new book, W.B. Yeats and the Muses, published by Oxford University Press, will be reviewed in our next issue.
A graduate of Canisius College, Harvard University and University College, Dublin, where he earned his MA and PhD, Joe is a member of the bar in Washington, D.C. and New York and has argued in   appellate courts all over the country and in the United States Supreme Court. He is currently with Hogan Lovells, a firm based in D.C., with offices worldwide and a long history of being committed to recruiting, retaining, and promoting lawyers and others with diverse backgrounds and experiences.
A proud Irish American whose great-grandparents emigrated from counties Clare and Cork, Joe lives in Washington, D.C. with his wife, Carol Melton (the couple has two children) and serves as counsel to the Embassy of Ireland.
His interest in W.B. Yeats stems from the generosity of Irish Americans in his hometown of Buffalo, New York, who funded a scholarship that took him to the Yeats International Summer School in Sligo following his junior year in college in 1963.
Joe has lectured on Yeats and other Irish writers at such venues as the Yeats International Summer School in Sligo, the James Joyce Summer School in Dublin, the Princess Grace Irish Library in Monaco, and Oxford University.

W.B. Yeats and the Muses
Joseph M. Hassett


Relates Yeats's theories of poetic inspiration to the Greek notion of the Muses
Uses newly available letters and manuscripts to interpret classic poems
Examines what Yeats's Muses thought about their role in the creation of the poetry








W.B. Yeats and the Muses
Joseph M. Hassett



Description



W.B. Yeats and the Muses explores how nine fascinating women inspired much of W.B. Yeats's poetry. These women are particularly important because Yeats perceived them in terms of beliefs about poetic inspiration akin to the Greek notion that a great poet is inspired and possessed by the feminine voices of the Muses. Influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite idea of woman as 'romantic and mysterious, still the priestess of her shrine', Yeats found his Muses in living women. His extraordinarily long and fruitful poetic career was fuelled by passionate relationships with women to and about whom he wrote some of his most compelling poetry. The book summarizes the different Muse traditions that were congenial to Yeats and shows how his perception of these women as Muses underlies his poetry. Newly available letters and manuscripts are used to explore the creative process and interpret the poems.Because Yeats believed that lyric poetry 'is no rootless flower, but the speech of a man,' exploring the relationship between poem and Muse brings new coherence to the poetry, illuminates the process of its creation, and unlocks the 'second beauty' to which Yeats referred when he claimed that 'works of lyric genius, when the circumstances of their origin is known, gain a second a beauty, passing as it were out of literature and becoming life.' As life emerges from the literature, the Muses are shown to be vibrant, multi-faceted personalities who shatter the idea of the Muse as a passive stereotype and take their proper place as begetters of timeless poetry.

Reviews and Awards


"A subtle, suggestive study of inspiration, based on penetrating readings of the poems and a close exploration of the texture of the poet's biography; it weaves life, love and work together in a quintessentially Yeatsian manner, full of insight." --Roy Foster, Carroll Professor of Irish History, Hertford College, Oxford
"Hassett's elegant book manages to give a summary and compelling account of the extraordinary sequence of distinguished women that Yeats was inspired by throughout his life, tracing fully all the eccentricities of those connections. This is one of those books which leaves you marveling that the world left room for it to be written: a delight from start to finish." --Bernard O'Donoghue, Fellow in English, Wadham College, Oxford
"Joseph Hassett's W.B. Yeats and the Muses is a valuable addition to both the critical and biographical literature on Yeats. Equipped with shrewdly evaluated, often new, biographical material, his scrupulous engagement with the relevant poems provides convincing critical illuminations, original slants, and fresh ways of seeing. Since this work brings the Classical as well as the Romantic notion of the Muse to modern discourse in a responsible way, it's hard to imagine the poems being read in the future without reference to Hassett's extended insights into one of the most fruitful and provoking zones in all of Yeats's' work." --Eamon Grennan, Emeritus Professor of English, Vassar College
"A brilliant and magisterial work of scholarship...A magnificent achievement. What [Hassett] demonstrates with clarity, discretion and profound insight is that Yeats is a consummate poet of love. Through his careful analysis of how the love and sexual passion of a great artist can infuse his creative life with inspiration and power, Hassett has made a major contribution not only to Yeats studies but also to a more enlightened understanding of how ordinary human beings can live more productively engaged and fulfilled lives...Like his subject, Hassett's book is a work of great intellectual and human significance that will stand the test of time." --Professor James Flannery, Irish America
"[A] deeply informed and fascinating book...An exceptionally lucid work of criticism." --Michael Dirda, The Weekly Standard
"Joseph Hassett's beautifully written study follows a strong yet subtle argument through widely researched and scrupulously detailed individual chapters. The Yeats who emerges from it is clearly driven by the needs of his work as a poet; to that end all others are subservient." --Dublin Review of Books
"Even to the sophisticated reader of Yeats, these explorations of Yeats's personal life and the symbiosis of his Muses confirm 'a second beauty' and 'new coherence' to Yeats's poems. These insights are the result of Joseph M. Hassett's able scholarship." --Studies Irish Review
