AbstractThis study aimed to evaluate the degradation profile and pathways, and identify unknown impurities of moxidectin under stress conditions. During the experiments, moxidectin samples were stressed using acid, alkali, heat and oxidation, and chromatographic profiles were compared with known impurities given in European Pharmacopeia (EP) monograph. Moxidectin has shown good stability under heat, while reaction with alkali produced 2-epi and ∆2,3 isomers (impurities D and E in EP) by characteristic reactions of the oxahydrindene (hexahydrobenzofuran) portion of the macrocyclic lactone. Two new, previously unreported, unknown degradation products, i.e. impurity 1 and impurity 2, detected after acid hydrolysis of moxidectin (impurity 2 was also observed to a lesser extent after oxidation), were isolated from sample matrices and identified using liquid chromatography, NMR, high-resolution FT-ICR MS, and hydrogen/deuterium exchange studies. FTMS analysis showed accurate mass of molecular ion peaks for moxidectin at m/z 640.38412, impurity 1 at m/z 656.37952 and impurity 2 at m/z 611.35684, giving rise to daughter ions traceable up to the seventh levels of MSn experiments and supporting the proposed structures. Both unknown impurities along with moxidectin were fully characterized by 1H, 13C, 1D HMBC and 2D (NOESY, COSY and HSQC) NMR experiments. The interpretation of experimental data positively identified impurity 1 as 3,4-epoxy-moxidectin and impurity 2 as 23-keto-nemadectin. The identification of new impurities and correlation of their chromatographic profiles with the EP method is very useful to establish the stability profile of moxidectin and its preparations, as well as add value to the forthcoming moxidectin finished product European Pharmacopeia monographs.Open image in new windowFigureAcid catalyzed degradation of moxidectin into 23-keto-moxidectin and 3,4-epoxy-moxidectinKeywordsMoxidectin degradation product High-resolution FT-MS and MSn H/D exchange NMR Stress study Macrocyclic lactone Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00216-012-6393-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Supplementary material216_2012_6393_MOESM1_ESM.pdf (2.1 mb)ESM 1(PDF 2.09 mb)References1.Rock DW, Delay RL, Gliddon MJ (2002) In: Vercruysse J, Rew RS (eds) Macrocyclic Lactones in Antiparasitic Therapy.

                    Belleville is a city located approximately 15 miles southeast of Ann Arbor. There you will find a 2-square-mile all sports lake called Belleville Lake. This lake is great for fishing, boating, and waterskiing. During the summer you'll find many of the lake enthusiasts anchored at one of the sandbars socializing. If you want to grab a bite to eat you can visit Johnny's on the Lake and enjoy the outside dinning. They offer docking spaces for boats too. You might even see the University of Michigan rowing team practicing, as their boathouse is located on the lake. Belleville gives easy access to Lower Huron Metropark. Visitors have the opportunity to bike, run, or walk on paved trails. The park also offers camping, kayaking, and swimming. Every year on the third weekend in June Belleville hosts its annual National Strawberry Festival. During this 3 day festival attendees can enjoy the parade, car show, live entertainment, and of course, strawberry desserts. This city has a lot to offer!
