 today announced that the Broker-Dealer Rates Group of its wholly owned subsidiary, INTL FCStone Financial Inc. ("the Company"), has formed a Securitized Products Group in order to enhance its already successful Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities operations. This initiative furthers the Company's commitment to providing its institutional client base with liquidity, execution efficiency and expert insight in these markets.


                                        








The Securitized Products Group supports INTL FCStone Financial's dedication to providing dealer and market maker services to buy-side clients. Its formation strengthens the Company's ongoing efforts across Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities, Collateralized Mortgage Obligations, Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities, and Asset-Backed Securities.


                                        








Anthony Di Ciollo, Senior Managing Director, Head of Securitized Trading at the Broker-Dealer Rates Group of INTL FCStone Financial Inc., commented on today's news, "The buy-side has experienced a dramatic change in coverage as the majority of securities industry participants trend towards generalization and divert resources away from traditional Mortgage products, which negatively impacts market liquidity. With the formation of the Securitized Products Group, we continue to utilize our longstanding expertise trading Mortgage products to uniquely benefit the strategies and trading parameters of our clients."


                                        








The establishment of the Securitized Products Group enables INTL FCStone Financial to provide even stronger insight, execution efficiency and liquidity to its institutional client base operating in the Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities markets. Building strong customer relationships lies at the heart of the Company's business model, and the Securitized Products team utilizes its expertise to provide trade ideas, commentaries, in-depth sector analysis, and market color to enhance clients' objectives.


                                        








Robert LaForte, Senior Managing Director, Head of Sales at the Broker-Dealer Rates Group of INTL FCStone Financial Inc., concluded, "We make it our business to build strong relationships with our customers, and work diligently to understand their unique needs and strategies in order to offer consistent value. We are dedicated to furthering the Securitized Products Group's growth trajectory without compromising our dedication to offering the highest level of value within each market we trade. Our success is intertwined with that of our customers, and we remain committed to providing them with personalized service even as we continue to grow."

History[edit]
FCStone Group Inc.[edit]
Founded in 1978, the firm was known as the Farmers Commodities Corporation until 2002. FCStone Group provided integrated risk management services such as market intelligence and analysis to help commodity traders in industries like agriculture, renewable fuels, energy, food service, carbon credits, and forest products. In 2007, the company went public raising $95 million. FCStone executed more than 100 million derivative contracts in 2008 and was a clearing member on all major US future exchanges. The Group served commercial commodity intermediaries, end-users, and producers around the world. As of Sept. 30th, 2009, FCStone Group operates as a subsidiary of International Assets Holding Corp.[3][10][11]
International Assets Holding Corporation[edit]
IAHC began as the International Assets Advisory Corporation in 1981. The company started in Winter Haven, Florida in 1981 and was headed by Diego J. Veitia, a graduate of the Thunderbird School of Global Management. The firm’s initial focus was the private placements of stocks and bonds of foreign companies. IAAC then turned its attention to high-net-worth clients, including individuals and financial institutions, and diversifying their investment portfolios through the sales of equity securities and global debt. In 1987, Veitia created a holding company called International Assets Holding Corporation and went public in 1994. IAHC transitioned into becoming a market maker of international equity securities in the early 2000s and is now a global financial services provider operating through wholly owned subsidiaries in the US, Dubai, Singapore, Argentina, the UK, Brazil, and Uruguay.[12]
Merger[edit]
FCStone Group Inc. and the International Assets Holding Corporation merged in 2009. FCStone operates as an independent business unit of IAHC, ceased trading stock on Sept. 30th, and brings over $229.3 million in operation revenues. IAAC officially became INTL FCStone in Feb. 2011.[12]
INTL FCStone Inc. serves more than 20,000 accounts in more than 130 countries through a network of 40 offices around the world. Its combined market capitalization is $285 million. Within a month of the merger, IAHC expanded operations to the Pacific Rim with a new office in Sydney, Australia.[12]

History[edit]
FCStone Group Inc.[edit]
Founded in 1978, the firm was known as the Farmers Commodities Corporation until 2002. FCStone Group provided integrated risk management services such as market intelligence and analysis to help commodity traders in industries like agriculture, renewable fuels, energy, food service, carbon credits, and forest products. In 2007, the company went public raising $95 million. FCStone executed more than 100 million derivative contracts in 2008 and was a clearing member on all major US future exchanges. The Group served commercial commodity intermediaries, end-users, and producers around the world. As of Sept. 30th, 2009, FCStone Group operates as a subsidiary of International Assets Holding Corp.[3][10][11]
International Assets Holding Corporation[edit]
IAHC began as the International Assets Advisory Corporation in 1981. The company started in Winter Haven, Florida in 1981 and was headed by Diego J. Veitia, a graduate of the Thunderbird School of Global Management. The firm’s initial focus was the private placements of stocks and bonds of foreign companies. IAAC then turned its attention to high-net-worth clients, including individuals and financial institutions, and diversifying their investment portfolios through the sales of equity securities and global debt. In 1987, Veitia created a holding company called International Assets Holding Corporation and went public in 1994. IAHC transitioned into becoming a market maker of international equity securities in the early 2000s and is now a global financial services provider operating through wholly owned subsidiaries in the US, Dubai, Singapore, Argentina, the UK, Brazil, and Uruguay.[12]
Merger[edit]
FCStone Group Inc. and the International Assets Holding Corporation merged in 2009. FCStone operates as an independent business unit of IAHC, ceased trading stock on Sept. 30th, and brings over $229.3 million in operation revenues. IAAC officially became INTL FCStone in Feb. 2011.[12]
INTL FCStone Inc. serves more than 20,000 accounts in more than 130 countries through a network of 40 offices around the world. Its combined market capitalization is $285 million. Within a month of the merger, IAHC expanded operations to the Pacific Rim with a new office in Sydney, Australia.[12]

INTL FCSTONE Protecting the Perfect Pie












































For pizza restaurants who focus on providing their customers with quality over quantity, rising ingredient prices can gobble up margins quickly – especially because skimping on ingredient quality simply isn’t an option.


Fortunately, restaurant operators can protect both product quality and profit margins – if they understand how to use proven ingredient price risk management strategies. And improving that understanding has never been easier, thanks to the new paper, Protecting the Perfect Pie: How Commodity Price Risk Management Can Help Pizza Restaurants Maintain Product Quality…and Margins. Developed by expert consultants and economists at INTL FCStone Financial Inc. – FCM Division, this paper goes beyond the typical purchaser’s ingredient basket to provide a comprehensive picture of input cost drivers – from cheese and meats to paper and energy prices to the costs of credit, labor and benefits. The key: understand which prices risks you can manage, which ones you can’t, and how to maximize your opportunities regarding those you can.


Get started on protecting your perfect pie – and your margins – by downloading the FREE paper today.

Arlan Suderman's Market Outlook Webinar


















































Arlan Suderman Webinars: To get ahead of the markets, sometimes you need to take a step back – and look at the big picture. To help you with this view, Chief Commodities Economist, Arlan Suderman, is presenting monthly webinars. Each installment will provide a global perspective on the commodity markets. Mr. Suderman will examine the entire spectrum of commodities focused on, but not limited to: corn, soybean and wheat. Mr. Suderman will also examine global supply and demand fundamentals, discussing how the global currency, and financial and equity markets tie into the global commodities outlook.


August 10th Report: USDA’s August crop report is the first of the season that utilizes corn and soybean yield estimates based on actual field surveys. As such, it will be the first report to give us USDA’s sense of the damage done by this year’s adverse weather and set the tone for the fall new-crop balance sheets.


About the Presenter: Arlan Suderman is the Chief Commodities Economist for the INTL FCStone Financial Inc. - FCM Division. Mr. Suderman provides leadership for a dedicated team that develops daily and big-picture analysis for the INTL FCStone trading staff and clients in the commodity sector, utilizing INTL FCStone's vast global resources. Mr. Suderman's team brings together supply and demand fundamentals and macro-market money flow dynamics to assess market conditions to provide unique world-class market intelligence.

INTL FCSTONE Protecting the Perfect Pie












































For pizza restaurants who focus on providing their customers with quality over quantity, rising ingredient prices can gobble up margins quickly – especially because skimping on ingredient quality simply isn’t an option.


Fortunately, restaurant operators can protect both product quality and profit margins – if they understand how to use proven ingredient price risk management strategies. And improving that understanding has never been easier, thanks to the new paper, Protecting the Perfect Pie: How Commodity Price Risk Management Can Help Pizza Restaurants Maintain Product Quality…and Margins. Developed by expert consultants and economists at INTL FCStone Financial Inc. – FCM Division, this paper goes beyond the typical purchaser’s ingredient basket to provide a comprehensive picture of input cost drivers – from cheese and meats to paper and energy prices to the costs of credit, labor and benefits. The key: understand which prices risks you can manage, which ones you can’t, and how to maximize your opportunities regarding those you can.


Get started on protecting your perfect pie – and your margins – by downloading the FREE paper today.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
