We offer a complete line of direct-to-garment printing solutions that range from commercial to mass production level.  We have also revolutionized the roll-to-roll textile printing industry: digital printing with a single ink set onto multiple types of fabric with no additional finishing processes. 

Founded in 2003, Kornit Digital is a global company, headquartered in Israel with offices in the USA, Europe and Asia Pacific, and serves customers in more than 100 countries worldwide.

Our vision
Addressing the emerging global trend of personalization


Kornit is focused on enabling the mass customization of printed textile products. We believe that our unique technology and leading solutions for textile printing are fundamental to fulfilling the emerging global trends of personalization, online shopping, social media impact, as well as consumer awareness for sustainability and how garments and textiles are made.

Kornit offers an atypical ability to produce high quality, high production capacity in short and micro runs (in garments and fabrics), and to do it within the target market, thereby shortening the supply chain to days instead of months, and reducing the negative impact on the environment

We insist that customers should enjoy the best of the best from start to finish – software, support and high-end technology - all in an environmentally-sustainable way.

With our immense experience in the direct-to-garment market, we are also revolutionizing the roll-to-roll fabric industry with our unique, single-step, roll-to-roll solution suitable for the fashion and home textile industry.  

Our superior solution enables printing with one ink set on all types of fabric and with no additional finishing process.  Kornit’s printing solutions are fully integrated and fully made by Kornit, ensuring superior quality, reliability and highest value to our customers. We provide the full solution: the printing systems, the inks and consumables, software, pallets and accessories, technical and application support and services.

Waterless
The number one environmental risk factor in textiles is water pollution.  Did you know that the volume of water used in conventional dyeing and textile print processes could fill the Mediterranean Sea every two years! The amount of water currently used, wasted, and polluted is staggering. The industry shift towards digital printing goes a long way towards reducing its environmental impact, and Kornit’s technologies are leading this effort with a 100% waterless process utilized in every single printing system we manufacture.  No pretreatments, steaming or washing required.






Neo Pigment Inks
Our water-based NeoPigment™ inks are absolutely free of heavy metals, formaldehyde and Alkylphenol Ethoxylates (APE), making them non-hazardous, non-toxic and 100% biodegradable. As part of our waterless printing system, our biodegradable ink and energy saving process makes Kornit the most eco-friendly printing solution in the market.
Read more




Compliance
Protecting the environment is not just a trend; it has been part of our global strategy since day one.  One of our most serious commitments is to follow new research and public campaigns focused on the environmental impact of textile dyeing and printing facilities.  We strive to reduce the footprint of our company, our partners, and our customers. Through constant innovation, adjustments and dedication, we aim to not only meet the ever-changing industry standards, but surpass them. 




Safe Products
Many companies in the textile and apparel supply chain are proactively working to ensure their products are free of restricted substances. They subsequently receive relevant certifications providing assurances that printing on their textiles and garments will not involve hazardous substances, and deem their products safe and sellable everywhere. Moving to digital printing is an environmental, cost-effective and higher quality option for your apparel and textile printing needs and is the first step in leaving the toxic trail behind forever.

Consistently introducing cutting edge innovations, Kornit was the first to enable digital printing on dark garments in 2006. The full portfolio of products support a wide range of applications and market segments. Kornit is staffed by some of the world's most capable executives. The multidisciplinary team boasts tremendous international hi-tech experience with deep roots in the garment printing industry. in 2004 – Kornit first presentation of printers at SGIA 2004 in Minneapolis, a global exhibition: Kornit 930 and Kornit 931. in 2005 – Kornit first delivery of 931–002: Timberline, Colorado. in 2006 Kornit creates White Ink and is the first to enable digital printing on dark garments. in 2006 Cafe Press buys 20 Kornit printers. 2007 Kornit Digital North America opens. 2008 Kornit HQ moves to the Afek Industrial Park in Rosh Ha'Ayin, Israel. 2009 Kornit Breeze is launched, providing an entry-level digital solution. 2010 Kornit Digital Asia-Pacific and Kornit Digital Europe open. 2010 – Kornit Avalanche is launched, enabling digital mass production. 2011 Kornit's launches V223, the first organic ink, to address the growing sustainability trend. 2012 Approaching the Roll to Roll market with the development of the Kornit Allegro. 2015 Kornit Digital goes public Nasdaq: NASDAQ: KRNT.[4]
Facilities[edit]
Kornit maintains a staff of 350 employees and a network of distributors worldwide. Headquarters are located in Rosh Haayin, Israel, with a fully owned manufacturing plant in Kiryat Gat. Subsidiaries are located in Hong Kong, Milwaukee, Dusseldorf, and there is a sales and business development office in Shanghai.
Products and technologies[edit]
Kornit Digital's sells direct to garment printers of different varieties.[5] Its printers come with RIP software customized to each machine.
Kornit's machines use a pre-treatment wetting process that is integrated into the printer, which it calls The PreT System.[6] This enables printing on the garment without the need for manual pre-treatment of any kind, by applying a fixation agent automatically on press, immediately prior to the print process. This process makes wet-on-wet printing possible, reducing time usually spent on manual pre-treatment.
The company also provides a process which enables printing on dark garments.[6] This process includes coating finished garments with a white coat of ink created from patented inks formed from CMYK.[7] Kornit's ink plant in Kiryat Gat produces CMYK and white ink for its customers.[8]
Its inks have received Oeko-Tex approval in the industry.[9]
Kornit offers a full line of DTG printers for all business sizes, and a single-step printing process for a wide range of roll to roll applications. The system offers excellent printing performance on any material, including light and dark fabric. Patented biodegradable ink and energy saving process results in a low eco-footprint. All of Kornit's DTG products leverage an integrated pre-treatment process, providing significant reductions in equipment, time and manpower costs. Garments arrive ready to print – there's no need for pre-treatment fluids or heat press, with an increased processing speed. The company manufactures a full line of printers for a scalable, integrated and seamless solution.
Kornit's Patented NeoPigment Solution[edit]
Designed especially to for Kornit's printers, the patented Neopigment "wet-on-wet" process integrates fixation fluids directly into the printing procedure, completely eliminating the need for pre-treatment. Pigment is integrated directly into printhead nozzles – saving time, money and manpower. Fluid is dispersed on printed area only – for a clean and precise operation, and smaller drops of ink result in a better handfeel, and a cost effective process. The patented water based ink produces vivid color prints, an unprecedented gamut range, deeper black (K) and brilliant white performance – exceeding industry standards for color quality and fastness on any fabric. This results in fast, cost-efficient and exact production and an end product with exceptional printing quality, and a velvety handfeel.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Kornit Digital serves an addressable market of $165B annual output of printed textiles, and has demonstrated a CAGE growth rate of 30% over the last 3 years. An attractive business model contributes to significant revenue growth with substantial recurring revenues, and the company invests in research & development sales & marketing to support growth. Financial flexibility is driven by debt-free minimal working capital & capex and a long-term favorable tax position balance sheet. In April 2015 Kornit went public, launching its IPO and trading on Nasdaq: NASDAQ: KRNT
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Kornit has developed an eco-oriented printing process. The sustainable products and energy saving process incorporate a fixation fluid into the printing system, significantly reduces mess, waste and material costs and makes Kornit an eco-friendly printing solution. Kornit complies with industry standards Oeko-Tex 100, Global Organic Textile (GOTS), and American Association of Textile Chemists & Colorists (AATCC).

Kornit's machines use a pre-treatment wetting process that is integrated into the printer, which it calls The PreT System.[6] This enables printing on the garment without the need for manual pre-treatment of any kind, by applying a fixation agent automatically on press, immediately prior to the print process. This process makes wet-on-wet printing possible, reducing time usually spent on manual pre-treatment.
The company also provides a process which enables printing on dark garments.[6] This process includes coating finished garments with a white coat of ink created from patented inks formed from CMYK.[7] Kornit's ink plant in Kiryat Gat produces CMYK and white ink for its customers.[8]
Its inks have received Oeko-Tex approval in the industry.[9]
Kornit offers a full line of DTG printers for all business sizes, and a single-step printing process for a wide range of roll to roll applications. The system offers excellent printing performance on any material, including light and dark fabric. Patented biodegradable ink and energy saving process results in a low eco-footprint. All of Kornit's DTG products leverage an integrated pre-treatment process, providing significant reductions in equipment, time and manpower costs. Garments arrive ready to print – there's no need for pre-treatment fluids or heat press, with an increased processing speed. The company manufactures a full line of printers for a scalable, integrated and seamless solution.
Kornit's Patented NeoPigment Solution[edit]
Designed especially to for Kornit's printers, the patented Neopigment "wet-on-wet" process integrates fixation fluids directly into the printing procedure, completely eliminating the need for pre-treatment. Pigment is integrated directly into printhead nozzles – saving time, money and manpower. Fluid is dispersed on printed area only – for a clean and precise operation, and smaller drops of ink result in a better handfeel, and a cost effective process. The patented water based ink produces vivid color prints, an unprecedented gamut range, deeper black (K) and brilliant white performance – exceeding industry standards for color quality and fastness on any fabric. This results in fast, cost-efficient and exact production and an end product with exceptional printing quality, and a velvety handfeel.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Kornit Digital serves an addressable market of $165B annual output of printed textiles, and has demonstrated a CAGE growth rate of 30% over the last 3 years. An attractive business model contributes to significant revenue growth with substantial recurring revenues, and the company invests in research & development sales & marketing to support growth. Financial flexibility is driven by debt-free minimal working capital & capex and a long-term favorable tax position balance sheet. In April 2015 Kornit went public, launching its IPO and trading on Nasdaq: NASDAQ: KRNT
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Kornit has developed an eco-oriented printing process. The sustainable products and energy saving process incorporate a fixation fluid into the printing system, significantly reduces mess, waste and material costs and makes Kornit an eco-friendly printing solution. Kornit complies with industry standards Oeko-Tex 100, Global Organic Textile (GOTS), and American Association of Textile Chemists & Colorists (AATCC).

Style Scores:



F Value | B Growth | F Momentum | F VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 2003 by workers previously in the digital printing field. The company uses the same technology used in digital printing and has applied it to digital textile printing, which has developed more slowly than the field of digital printing. Consistently introducing cutting edge innovations, Kornit was the first to enable digital printing on dark garments in 2006. The full portfolio of products support a wide range of applications and market segments. Kornit is staffed by some of the world's most capable executives. The multidisciplinary team boasts tremendous international hi-tech experience with deep roots in the garment printing industry. in 2004 – Kornit first presentation of printers at SGIA 2004 in Minneapolis, a global exhibition: Kornit 930 and Kornit 931. in 2005 – Kornit first delivery of 931–002: Timberline, Colorado. in 2006 Kornit creates White Ink and is the first to enable digital printing on dark garments. in 2006 Cafe Press buys 20 Kornit printers. 2007 Kornit Digital North America opens. 2008 Kornit HQ moves to the Afek Industrial Park in Rosh Ha'Ayin, Israel. 2009 Kornit Breeze is launched, providing an entry-level digital solution. 2010 Kornit Digital Asia-Pacific and Kornit Digital Europe open. 2010 – Kornit Avalanche is launched, enabling digital mass production. 2011 Kornit's launches V223, the first organic ink, to address the growing sustainability trend. 2012 Approaching the Roll to Roll market with the development of the Kornit Allegro. 2015 Kornit Digital goes public Nasdaq: NASDAQ: KRNT.[4]
Facilities[edit]
Kornit maintains a staff of 350 employees and a network of distributors worldwide. Headquarters are located in Rosh Haayin, Israel, with a fully owned manufacturing plant in Kiryat Gat. Subsidiaries are located in Hong Kong, Milwaukee, Dusseldorf, and there is a sales and business development office in Shanghai.
Products and technologies[edit]
Kornit Digital's sells direct to garment printers of different varieties.[5] Its printers come with RIP software customized to each machine.
Kornit's machines use a pre-treatment wetting process that is integrated into the printer, which it calls The PreT System.[6] This enables printing on the garment without the need for manual pre-treatment of any kind, by applying a fixation agent automatically on press, immediately prior to the print process. This process makes wet-on-wet printing possible, reducing time usually spent on manual pre-treatment.
The company also provides a process which enables printing on dark garments.[6] This process includes coating finished garments with a white coat of ink created from patented inks formed from CMYK.[7] Kornit's ink plant in Kiryat Gat produces CMYK and white ink for its customers.[8]
Its inks have received Oeko-Tex approval in the industry.[9]
Kornit offers a full line of DTG printers for all business sizes, and a single-step printing process for a wide range of roll to roll applications. The system offers excellent printing performance on any material, including light and dark fabric. Patented biodegradable ink and energy saving process results in a low eco-footprint. All of Kornit's DTG products leverage an integrated pre-treatment process, providing significant reductions in equipment, time and manpower costs. Garments arrive ready to print – there's no need for pre-treatment fluids or heat press, with an increased processing speed. The company manufactures a full line of printers for a scalable, integrated and seamless solution.
Kornit's Patented NeoPigment Solution[edit]
Designed especially to for Kornit's printers, the patented Neopigment "wet-on-wet" process integrates fixation fluids directly into the printing procedure, completely eliminating the need for pre-treatment. Pigment is integrated directly into printhead nozzles – saving time, money and manpower. Fluid is dispersed on printed area only – for a clean and precise operation, and smaller drops of ink result in a better handfeel, and a cost effective process. The patented water based ink produces vivid color prints, an unprecedented gamut range, deeper black (K) and brilliant white performance – exceeding industry standards for color quality and fastness on any fabric. This results in fast, cost-efficient and exact production and an end product with exceptional printing quality, and a velvety handfeel.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Kornit Digital serves an addressable market of $165B annual output of printed textiles, and has demonstrated a CAGE growth rate of 30% over the last 3 years. An attractive business model contributes to significant revenue growth with substantial recurring revenues, and the company invests in research & development sales & marketing to support growth. Financial flexibility is driven by debt-free minimal working capital & capex and a long-term favorable tax position balance sheet. In April 2015 Kornit went public, launching its IPO and trading on Nasdaq: NASDAQ: KRNT
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Kornit has developed an eco-oriented printing process. The sustainable products and energy saving process incorporate a fixation fluid into the printing system, significantly reduces mess, waste and material costs and makes Kornit an eco-friendly printing solution. Kornit complies with industry standards Oeko-Tex 100, Global Organic Textile (GOTS), and American Association of Textile Chemists & Colorists (AATCC).

History[edit]
The company was founded in 2003 by workers previously in the digital printing field. The company uses the same technology used in digital printing and has applied it to digital textile printing, which has developed more slowly than the field of digital printing. Consistently introducing cutting edge innovations, Kornit was the first to enable digital printing on dark garments in 2006. The full portfolio of products support a wide range of applications and market segments. Kornit is staffed by some of the world's most capable executives. The multidisciplinary team boasts tremendous international hi-tech experience with deep roots in the garment printing industry. in 2004 – Kornit first presentation of printers at SGIA 2004 in Minneapolis, a global exhibition: Kornit 930 and Kornit 931. in 2005 – Kornit first delivery of 931–002: Timberline, Colorado. in 2006 Kornit creates White Ink and is the first to enable digital printing on dark garments. in 2006 Cafe Press buys 20 Kornit printers. 2007 Kornit Digital North America opens. 2008 Kornit HQ moves to the Afek Industrial Park in Rosh Ha'Ayin, Israel. 2009 Kornit Breeze is launched, providing an entry-level digital solution. 2010 Kornit Digital Asia-Pacific and Kornit Digital Europe open. 2010 – Kornit Avalanche is launched, enabling digital mass production. 2011 Kornit's launches V223, the first organic ink, to address the growing sustainability trend. 2012 Approaching the Roll to Roll market with the development of the Kornit Allegro. 2015 Kornit Digital goes public Nasdaq: NASDAQ: KRNT.[4]
Facilities[edit]
Kornit maintains a staff of 350 employees and a network of distributors worldwide. Headquarters are located in Rosh Haayin, Israel, with a fully owned manufacturing plant in Kiryat Gat. Subsidiaries are located in Hong Kong, Milwaukee, Dusseldorf, and there is a sales and business development office in Shanghai.
Products and technologies[edit]
Kornit Digital's sells direct to garment printers of different varieties.[5] Its printers come with RIP software customized to each machine.
Kornit's machines use a pre-treatment wetting process that is integrated into the printer, which it calls The PreT System.[6] This enables printing on the garment without the need for manual pre-treatment of any kind, by applying a fixation agent automatically on press, immediately prior to the print process. This process makes wet-on-wet printing possible, reducing time usually spent on manual pre-treatment.
The company also provides a process which enables printing on dark garments.[6] This process includes coating finished garments with a white coat of ink created from patented inks formed from CMYK.[7] Kornit's ink plant in Kiryat Gat produces CMYK and white ink for its customers.[8]
Its inks have received Oeko-Tex approval in the industry.[9]
Kornit offers a full line of DTG printers for all business sizes, and a single-step printing process for a wide range of roll to roll applications. The system offers excellent printing performance on any material, including light and dark fabric. Patented biodegradable ink and energy saving process results in a low eco-footprint. All of Kornit's DTG products leverage an integrated pre-treatment process, providing significant reductions in equipment, time and manpower costs. Garments arrive ready to print – there's no need for pre-treatment fluids or heat press, with an increased processing speed. The company manufactures a full line of printers for a scalable, integrated and seamless solution.
Kornit's Patented NeoPigment Solution[edit]
Designed especially to for Kornit's printers, the patented Neopigment "wet-on-wet" process integrates fixation fluids directly into the printing procedure, completely eliminating the need for pre-treatment. Pigment is integrated directly into printhead nozzles – saving time, money and manpower. Fluid is dispersed on printed area only – for a clean and precise operation, and smaller drops of ink result in a better handfeel, and a cost effective process. The patented water based ink produces vivid color prints, an unprecedented gamut range, deeper black (K) and brilliant white performance – exceeding industry standards for color quality and fastness on any fabric. This results in fast, cost-efficient and exact production and an end product with exceptional printing quality, and a velvety handfeel.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Kornit Digital serves an addressable market of $165B annual output of printed textiles, and has demonstrated a CAGE growth rate of 30% over the last 3 years. An attractive business model contributes to significant revenue growth with substantial recurring revenues, and the company invests in research & development sales & marketing to support growth. Financial flexibility is driven by debt-free minimal working capital & capex and a long-term favorable tax position balance sheet. In April 2015 Kornit went public, launching its IPO and trading on Nasdaq: NASDAQ: KRNT
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Kornit has developed an eco-oriented printing process. The sustainable products and energy saving process incorporate a fixation fluid into the printing system, significantly reduces mess, waste and material costs and makes Kornit an eco-friendly printing solution. Kornit complies with industry standards Oeko-Tex 100, Global Organic Textile (GOTS), and American Association of Textile Chemists & Colorists (AATCC).

History[edit]
The company was founded in 2003 by workers previously in the digital printing field. The company uses the same technology used in digital printing and has applied it to digital textile printing, which has developed more slowly than the field of digital printing. Consistently introducing cutting edge innovations, Kornit was the first to enable digital printing on dark garments in 2006. The full portfolio of products support a wide range of applications and market segments. Kornit is staffed by some of the world's most capable executives. The multidisciplinary team boasts tremendous international hi-tech experience with deep roots in the garment printing industry. in 2004 – Kornit first presentation of printers at SGIA 2004 in Minneapolis, a global exhibition: Kornit 930 and Kornit 931. in 2005 – Kornit first delivery of 931–002: Timberline, Colorado. in 2006 Kornit creates White Ink and is the first to enable digital printing on dark garments. in 2006 Cafe Press buys 20 Kornit printers. 2007 Kornit Digital North America opens. 2008 Kornit HQ moves to the Afek Industrial Park in Rosh Ha'Ayin, Israel. 2009 Kornit Breeze is launched, providing an entry-level digital solution. 2010 Kornit Digital Asia-Pacific and Kornit Digital Europe open. 2010 – Kornit Avalanche is launched, enabling digital mass production. 2011 Kornit's launches V223, the first organic ink, to address the growing sustainability trend. 2012 Approaching the Roll to Roll market with the development of the Kornit Allegro. 2015 Kornit Digital goes public Nasdaq: NASDAQ: KRNT.[4]
Facilities[edit]
Kornit maintains a staff of 350 employees and a network of distributors worldwide. Headquarters are located in Rosh Haayin, Israel, with a fully owned manufacturing plant in Kiryat Gat. Subsidiaries are located in Hong Kong, Milwaukee, Dusseldorf, and there is a sales and business development office in Shanghai.
Products and technologies[edit]
Kornit Digital's sells direct to garment printers of different varieties.[5] Its printers come with RIP software customized to each machine.
Kornit's machines use a pre-treatment wetting process that is integrated into the printer, which it calls The PreT System.[6] This enables printing on the garment without the need for manual pre-treatment of any kind, by applying a fixation agent automatically on press, immediately prior to the print process. This process makes wet-on-wet printing possible, reducing time usually spent on manual pre-treatment.
The company also provides a process which enables printing on dark garments.[6] This process includes coating finished garments with a white coat of ink created from patented inks formed from CMYK.[7] Kornit's ink plant in Kiryat Gat produces CMYK and white ink for its customers.[8]
Its inks have received Oeko-Tex approval in the industry.[9]
Kornit offers a full line of DTG printers for all business sizes, and a single-step printing process for a wide range of roll to roll applications. The system offers excellent printing performance on any material, including light and dark fabric. Patented biodegradable ink and energy saving process results in a low eco-footprint. All of Kornit's DTG products leverage an integrated pre-treatment process, providing significant reductions in equipment, time and manpower costs. Garments arrive ready to print – there's no need for pre-treatment fluids or heat press, with an increased processing speed. The company manufactures a full line of printers for a scalable, integrated and seamless solution.
Kornit's Patented NeoPigment Solution[edit]
Designed especially to for Kornit's printers, the patented Neopigment "wet-on-wet" process integrates fixation fluids directly into the printing procedure, completely eliminating the need for pre-treatment. Pigment is integrated directly into printhead nozzles – saving time, money and manpower. Fluid is dispersed on printed area only – for a clean and precise operation, and smaller drops of ink result in a better handfeel, and a cost effective process. The patented water based ink produces vivid color prints, an unprecedented gamut range, deeper black (K) and brilliant white performance – exceeding industry standards for color quality and fastness on any fabric. This results in fast, cost-efficient and exact production and an end product with exceptional printing quality, and a velvety handfeel.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Kornit Digital serves an addressable market of $165B annual output of printed textiles, and has demonstrated a CAGE growth rate of 30% over the last 3 years. An attractive business model contributes to significant revenue growth with substantial recurring revenues, and the company invests in research & development sales & marketing to support growth. Financial flexibility is driven by debt-free minimal working capital & capex and a long-term favorable tax position balance sheet. In April 2015 Kornit went public, launching its IPO and trading on Nasdaq: NASDAQ: KRNT
Corporate responsibility[edit]
Kornit has developed an eco-oriented printing process. The sustainable products and energy saving process incorporate a fixation fluid into the printing system, significantly reduces mess, waste and material costs and makes Kornit an eco-friendly printing solution. Kornit complies with industry standards Oeko-Tex 100, Global Organic Textile (GOTS), and American Association of Textile Chemists & Colorists (AATCC).
