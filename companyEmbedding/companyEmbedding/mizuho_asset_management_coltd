Asset Management Company


Newly established Asset Management One* will work together with Mizuho's banking, trust banking, and securities functions to provide customers with products and services that will respond to a broad range of their needs

The Asset Management Company works together with its banking, trust banking, securities and companies providing asset management to serve the needs of a wide range of customers, from individuals to institutional investors (pension funds, financial institutions, business corporations, etc.) by providing products and services of the highest quality.
A new asset management company was formed from the integration of DIAM, the asset management functions of MHTB, MHAM and Shinko Asset Management and plays a central role in the Company. This company, named "Asset Management One," began operations in October 2016.

Asset Management One brings together their asset management know–how in the domains of investment trusts, investment advisory, trust banking and life insurance. It will offer products and services that will aim to substantially increase customer satisfaction.
In addition, MHBK and MHTB are in charge of management and administration for DC pension plans*1, which are long–term and tax–exempt asset scheme.
Furthermore, MHTB administers DB pension plans*2, while MHSC is responsible for management of wrap accounts*3 to meet the asset management needs of a wide range of customers.

*1.Defined Contribution Pension Plan
*2.Defined Benefit Pension Plan
*3.Under wrap accounts, individual customers sign discretionary asset management contracts with securities companies or trust banks, and they provide services covering from asset management to administration services.


Assets under management as of September 30, 2016





Key Aspects of the Company

Conditions in the External Environment


Expansion of the range of long–term and tax–exempt asset building schemes, including introduction of NISA* and DC pension plan reforms
Ongoing shift from savings to investment/asset building
Possibility that public pension payments may be cut in the future due to the decline in the birthrate and demographic aging of the population
Introduction of a negative interest rate policy by the Bank of Japan

*NISA: Japanese new tax exemption scheme for investment by individuals





Issues


Strengthening its capabilities for providing products and services to accelerate the shift from savings to investments/asset building among individual customers
Strengthening the offerings of high–value–added products and services as well as its consulting functions for institutional investors




Strengths


Strong capabilities for asset management and product offerings of Asset Management One in which Mizuho's asset management know–how in investment trusts, investment advisory, trust banking, and life insurance were integrated.





Interim Results for Fiscal 2016

Developing product capabilities which is the driver for the asset management business

For individual customers who need stable asset building and solutions for coping with negative interest rates, the Company has provided high–quality products and services that draw on the strengths developed in a variety of business lines of the companies integrated into Asset Management One. These products and services include investment instruments which will be suitable to medium– to long–term asset building as well as products which can substitute for deposits, thus encouraging a shift from savings to investments/asset building.
For institutional investors who have sophisticated asset management needs such as further portfolio diversification and stabilization and identifying alternatives to investments in government bonds, the Company has made full use of the asset management know–how of Asset Management One.
Furthermore, MHTB is staying ahead of developments in Japan's pension fund system, where major changes are taking place, and has expanded its portfolio of consulting services in the pension field, including the launch of fiduciary management services that take over authority and responsibility for asset management on behalf of pension funds.
As a result of these and other initiatives, net business profits for the interim period of fiscal 2016 amounted to JPY 9.0 billion.



Net Business Profit for Fiscal 2018 (Plan)



*Before head office expense deduction




Net Increase in Funds for Domestic Institutional Investors*



*Net increase in privately placed investment trusts, investment advisory, pension trusts, and publicly offered ETFs for the group as a whole (excluding overseas and public pension funds)







TOPIC

Commencement of fiduciary management services

To respond to the needs of pension funds to outsource asset management to external organizations to fulfill their own fiduciary duties, MHTB has begun to offer fiduciary management services.
A dedicated department was formed in April 2016 for analyzing and reviewing customers' pension portfolios, advising on establishing and reviewing policy asset mix, as well as offering support for examining the concept of pension governance, and overall administration of pension funds.
To implement the original objective of pension funds, which is to provide pension fund members and beneficiaries with stable pension benefits, we will offer services that draw on our experience and know–how as professionals.

Divisions and brands[edit]
Mizuho splits its business into four distinct divisions, on a global basis:
Retail Group[edit]
Mizuho is active in retail banking with 515 branches and over 11,000 automated teller machines (ATMs). Mizuho Bank is the only bank, other than Japan Post Bank, to have branches in every prefecture in Japan. It serves over 26 million Japanese households, 90,000 SME customers, and retail brokerage clients under the name Mizuho Investors Securities nationwide.

Mizuho Investors Securities
Mizuho Capital

Global Corporate Group[edit]
Mizuho predecessors, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), the Fuji Bank (Fuji) and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), had great control over many Japanese companies through keiretsu system. The three banks led the DKB Group, Fuyo Group and the IBJ Group respectively. The Fuyo Group traces its history as far back as the old Yasuda zaibatsu. Even now, seven out of ten companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange have dealings with Mizuho.[5]

History[edit]
Mizuho was established originally as Mizuho Holdings, Inc. by the merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Japan in 2000.
Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. was established in January 2003 to become the parent company to Mizuho Holdings, Inc. in preparation for its restructuring of businesses. Subsequently, through a share exchange on March 12, 2003, Mizuho Financial Group became the sole shareholder of Mizuho Holdings, which in turn served as the holding company of all of the group's banking and securities units.
On October 1, 2005, all subsidiaries of Mizuho Holdings were transferred to the direct control of Mizuho Financial Group. Mizuho Holdings, no longer a bank holding company, was then renamed Mizuho Financial Strategy, which now focuses on providing advisory services.
Mizuho, through its operations in New York, became involved in the subprime mortgage crisis and lost 7 billion dollars on the sale of collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mortgages. Its entry was late, in December 2006; it did not participate in gains; only suffered losses. It is the Asian bank which suffered the most losses due to the crisis. The venture into this field has been traced to the employment of Alexander Rekeda, a specialist in this field hired away from Calyon, a unit of Crédit Agricole. Rekeda was made "head of structured credit in the Americas" where he floated several deals that turned toxic. He was later fired and Mizuho shut down its US CDO business. Examples of these included the Aardvark, Tigris, and Delphinius CDOs.[7] The latter two involved the Magnetar hedge fund.[8] Ironically, Calyon had sued Mizuho for hiring away Rekeda and other CDO experts in 2007.[9]

Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. (株式会社みずほフィナンシャルグループ, Kabushiki-gaisha Mizuho Finansharu Gurūpu), abbreviated as MHFG, or simply called Mizuho, is a banking holding company headquartered in the Ōtemachi district of Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan. The name "mizuho (瑞穂)" literally means "abundant rice" in Japanese and "harvest" in the figurative sense.
It holds assets in excess of $1.6 trillion US dollars through its control of Mizuho Bank, Mizuho Corporate Bank, and other operating subsidiaries.[1] The company's combined holdings form the second largest financial services group in Japan. Its banking businesses rank the third in Japan after Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, and the 13th in the world by total assets as of June 2016.[2] It is the 106th largest company in the world according to Forbes rankings [3] Its shares have a primary listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Mizuho offers a range of financial services, including banking, securities, trust and asset management services, employing more than 56,000 people in 900 offices.[4]

Divisions and brands[edit]
Mizuho splits its business into four distinct divisions, on a global basis:
Retail Group[edit]
Mizuho is active in retail banking with 515 branches and over 11,000 automated teller machines (ATMs). Mizuho Bank is the only bank, other than Japan Post Bank, to have branches in every prefecture in Japan. It serves over 26 million Japanese households, 90,000 SME customers, and retail brokerage clients under the name Mizuho Investors Securities nationwide.

Mizuho Investors Securities
Mizuho Capital

Global Corporate Group[edit]
Mizuho predecessors, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), the Fuji Bank (Fuji) and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), had great control over many Japanese companies through keiretsu system. The three banks led the DKB Group, Fuyo Group and the IBJ Group respectively. The Fuyo Group traces its history as far back as the old Yasuda zaibatsu. Even now, seven out of ten companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange have dealings with Mizuho.[5]

History[edit]
Mizuho was established originally as Mizuho Holdings, Inc. by the merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Japan in 2000.
Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. was established in January 2003 to become the parent company to Mizuho Holdings, Inc. in preparation for its restructuring of businesses. Subsequently, through a share exchange on March 12, 2003, Mizuho Financial Group became the sole shareholder of Mizuho Holdings, which in turn served as the holding company of all of the group's banking and securities units.
On October 1, 2005, all subsidiaries of Mizuho Holdings were transferred to the direct control of Mizuho Financial Group. Mizuho Holdings, no longer a bank holding company, was then renamed Mizuho Financial Strategy, which now focuses on providing advisory services.
Mizuho, through its operations in New York, became involved in the subprime mortgage crisis and lost 7 billion dollars on the sale of collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mortgages. Its entry was late, in December 2006; it did not participate in gains; only suffered losses. It is the Asian bank which suffered the most losses due to the crisis. The venture into this field has been traced to the employment of Alexander Rekeda, a specialist in this field hired away from Calyon, a unit of Crédit Agricole. Rekeda was made "head of structured credit in the Americas" where he floated several deals that turned toxic. He was later fired and Mizuho shut down its US CDO business. Examples of these included the Aardvark, Tigris, and Delphinius CDOs.[7] The latter two involved the Magnetar hedge fund.[8] Ironically, Calyon had sued Mizuho for hiring away Rekeda and other CDO experts in 2007.[9]

Retail Group[edit]
Mizuho is active in retail banking with 515 branches and over 11,000 automated teller machines (ATMs).

Global Corporate Group[edit]
Mizuho predecessors, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), the Fuji Bank (Fuji) and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), had great control over many Japanese companies through keiretsu system. The three banks led the DKB Group, Fuyo Group and the IBJ Group respectively. The Fuyo Group traces its history as far back as the old Yasuda zaibatsu. Even now, seven out of ten companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange have dealings with Mizuho.[5]

History[edit]
Mizuho was established originally as Mizuho Holdings, Inc. by the merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Japan in 2000.
Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. was established in January 2003 to become the parent company to Mizuho Holdings, Inc. in preparation for its restructuring of businesses. Subsequently, through a share exchange on March 12, 2003, Mizuho Financial Group became the sole shareholder of Mizuho Holdings, which in turn served as the holding company of all of the group's banking and securities units.
On October 1, 2005, all subsidiaries of Mizuho Holdings were transferred to the direct control of Mizuho Financial Group. Mizuho Holdings, no longer a bank holding company, was then renamed Mizuho Financial Strategy, which now focuses on providing advisory services.
Mizuho, through its operations in New York, became involved in the subprime mortgage crisis and lost 7 billion dollars on the sale of collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mortgages. Its entry was late, in December 2006; it did not participate in gains; only suffered losses. It is the Asian bank which suffered the most losses due to the crisis. The venture into this field has been traced to the employment of Alexander Rekeda, a specialist in this field hired away from Calyon, a unit of Crédit Agricole. Rekeda was made "head of structured credit in the Americas" where he floated several deals that turned toxic. He was later fired and Mizuho shut down its US CDO business. Examples of these included the Aardvark, Tigris, and Delphinius CDOs.[7] The latter two involved the Magnetar hedge fund.[8] Ironically, Calyon had sued Mizuho for hiring away Rekeda and other CDO experts in 2007.[9]

Retail Group[edit]
Mizuho is active in retail banking with 515 branches and over 11,000 automated teller machines (ATMs).

Global Corporate Group[edit]
Mizuho predecessors, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), the Fuji Bank (Fuji) and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), had great control over many Japanese companies through keiretsu system. The three banks led the DKB Group, Fuyo Group and the IBJ Group respectively. The Fuyo Group traces its history as far back as the old Yasuda zaibatsu. Even now, seven out of ten companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange have dealings with Mizuho.[5]

History[edit]
Mizuho was established originally as Mizuho Holdings, Inc. by the merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Japan in 2000.
Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. was established in January 2003 to become the parent company to Mizuho Holdings, Inc. in preparation for its restructuring of businesses. Subsequently, through a share exchange on March 12, 2003, Mizuho Financial Group became the sole shareholder of Mizuho Holdings, which in turn served as the holding company of all of the group's banking and securities units.
On October 1, 2005, all subsidiaries of Mizuho Holdings were transferred to the direct control of Mizuho Financial Group. Mizuho Holdings, no longer a bank holding company, was then renamed Mizuho Financial Strategy, which now focuses on providing advisory services.
Mizuho, through its operations in New York, became involved in the subprime mortgage crisis and lost 7 billion dollars on the sale of collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mortgages. Its entry was late, in December 2006; it did not participate in gains; only suffered losses. It is the Asian bank which suffered the most losses due to the crisis. The venture into this field has been traced to the employment of Alexander Rekeda, a specialist in this field hired away from Calyon, a unit of Crédit Agricole. Rekeda was made "head of structured credit in the Americas" where he floated several deals that turned toxic. He was later fired and Mizuho shut down its US CDO business. Examples of these included the Aardvark, Tigris, and Delphinius CDOs.[7] The latter two involved the Magnetar hedge fund.[8] Ironically, Calyon had sued Mizuho for hiring away Rekeda and other CDO experts in 2007.[9]

The representation based on Article 37 of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law in Japan

Company Name:
Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., Ltd.
Registered Financial Institution Registration Number:
No.34 Director-General of the Kanto Local Finance Bureau of Ministry of Finance
Memberships:
Japan Securities Dealers Association
The Financial Futures Association of Japan
Japan Investment Advisers Association
Fees and Costs:
The trust fee is calculated by multiplying the prescribed rate by the trust amount, and is collected from the asset under management. The prescribed rate is determined individually depending on the client's needs, the investment policies and the trust amount, and such rate varies from case to case. If the commission amount is shown before tax, the consumption tax will be added to it.
Transactions of commingled accounts require a prescribed amount of retention money for the trust assets (the amount of retention money varies depending on the investment strategy).
Indirect fees payable include the brokerage commission (the commission on futures transactions or option transactions is included) and its tax equivalent, a custody fee for assets in foreign currencies, a trust fee concerning the beneficiary's right of investment trust and other commissions (these commissions vary depending on the investment strategy or the amount of the assets under management due to differences in the investment situation or custody conditions).
In the case of a commingled account which includes stock lending transactions, the prescribed handling commissions will be received after lending commissions are deducted. In addition, taxes and other public charges associated with stock lending transactions and fees required for trust operations will be deducted from the assets under management or be paid by the trustors.
Also, when investing in Hedge Fund (HF) or Fund of Hedge Funds (FOHF), constitutional expenses of the fund and/or trust fees etc. (the kinds of these commissions are wide-ranging and varied depending on the investment strategy or the amount of the assets under management due to differences in the investment situation or custody conditions) may be charged.
Risk on Loss of Principal:
Since the investment strategies listed on this site mainly involve investment in financial products (e.g., equities, fixed income, currencies, real estate in investment trusts and commodities etc.), investment in these strategies involves many risks (e.g., fluctuation risk in stock prices, fluctuation risk in bond prices, fluctuation risk in yields, currency risk,credit risk, counterparty risk, country risk, risks of futures trading, fluctuation risk of the real estate market, fluctuation risk of the commodity market, risk of impossibility of collecting of lending securities and risk of re-investment of cash collateral) and thus the relevant value of the principal may be diminished.
In addition, in cases where the investment strategy involves a benchmark, the relevant value of the principal may be diminished because of fluctuations of the index price.
Other Significant Matters:
FOHF or a fund with a similar investment strategy may require a long period of time from when they receive a cancellation notice to when the investor may obtain their cash. If the amount subject to the cancellation notice accounts for a certain weight of the fund itself (i.e. over 10% of the fund), the cancellation will be limited and the investment will be converted to cash on or after the next payment date. Moreover, the times at which investments can be made in FOHF may be limited.
In general, there are no limitations on investment or cancellation except for the funds following investment strategies mentioned above. However, a certain period of time may be necessary for cancellation in some cases due to unavoidable reasons. If the cancellation amount requested accounts for a considerable percentage of the total amount of the fund, the cancellation may be divided into parts (e.g., in two or three parts) considering the trading volumes on the market. In such case, it may take around a month for completion of cancellation (cancellation will require longer periods of time where it exerts considerable influence on the fund).

Who We Are







Mizuho Americas is the financial institution that combines seemingly disparate things—Japanese culture and American talent, considered risk mitigation and a creative approach, local market knowledge and global reach—to act faster, see further and adapt better in every decision, every day.

Our parent company—Mizuho Financial Group—came together in late 2002, merging three of the largest banks in Japan. With our backing as a financial powerhouse in Asia and our growing presence across the Americas, we’re able to meet local market needs with a combination of truly customized care and $1.8 trillion in assets (as of March 31, 2016).
Today, as part of one of the largest financial institutions in the world, Mizuho Americas leans on that Japanese heritage and diligence that saw us through the past years of financial turmoil. We honor our namesake “Mizuho” meaning “golden ears of rice”—a poetic term for Japan itself—and at the same time, embrace our local markets’ taste for success and a flair for innovation. The result is a hybrid style of thinking and execution, that’s entirely our own. 








Stability and that extra edge
Our long-standing client relationships are our greatest point of pride. We offer strategic solutions and consulting for the increasingly sophisticated and technological needs of our large client base—primarily corporations, financial institutions, pensions, hedge funds and public sector entities.
Our services dive deep into industry and client needs. They’re guided by a mix of careful decision-making and creative approaches to the complexity of our clients’ financial goals and the countries where they do business.
There’s no product assembly line here. We help clients find different angles on issues and opportunities so we can pull in the right pieces for a perfect hybrid solution.
