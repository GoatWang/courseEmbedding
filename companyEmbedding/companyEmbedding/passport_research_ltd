Donald Tannenbaum


Fluid, on time and easy to navigate.  When I had a question it was responded to on time and felt cared for.  My passport and visa came a little earlier than projected.  My relationship manager took the angst out of what can be a nerve-racking process.  Highly recommended.

Global E-passport and E-visa Market 2015-2019



Published: December 24, 2014
Content info: 83 Pages














Description

About E-passport and E-visa
E-passports and e-visas are used to authenticate a traveler's identity when crossing borders or entering into another country. This technology stores data about the traveler on a smart chip, which includes a unique identification number and a digital signature. It is more secure than traditional paper technology as it prevents data alteration and duplication. The data stored electronically on the chip is authenticated by PKI, thus making e-passport forgeries impossible. Facial, fingerprint, and iris recognition are major biometric modalities used for this process.
TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global E-passport and E-visa market to grow at a CAGR of 30.17 percent over the period 2014-2019.
