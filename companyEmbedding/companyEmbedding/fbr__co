STROLL




Collective Architecture yields great returns on FBR’s investment in a striking new headquarters.
When investment bank FBR & Co. forecast the need for new Washington, D.C. headquarters, they chartered Collective Architecture to handle the search. The winning location: three floors of an existing LEED Silver building with bullish views of the Capitol.
The client’s technology-driven business called for a mixture of open and closed work environments. Collective Architecture’s Liz Turncliff chose layers of glass to maximize the views and allow natural light to flow throughout the space. A cool floor palette of Avant’s Strut and Glow patterns promotes a cohesive relationship between conference and executive spaces, while contrasting warm-toned materials complete the space.
Avant flooring supports the building’s green status, one of many assets in Turncliff’s dynamic open office design. By any analysis, the new FBR & Co. headquarters is a hot commodity.
