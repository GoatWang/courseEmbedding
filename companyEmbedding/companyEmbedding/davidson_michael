A Few of Our Testimonials & Success Stories




Hot/Cold Therapy Brace

I was inspired to create my idea because I was getting pains in my wrists. -Robert



"I couldn't believe that Davison actually kept working on my idea even after I gave up on it because I didn't have the capital to put into it anymore.
You and your staff made us feel like we were part of your family and for that I thank you. We were nothing but amazed when you took us into Inventionland; it was the most amazing sight I have ever seen. It is a wondrous place that anyone would enjoy seeing. So, in closing thanks again for a marvelous time, one that we will always treasure."-Robert Huffman
Robert and his wife visited Davison in August. Davison rolled out the red carpet and welcomed them with a tour of InventionLand.

The BikeBoard

I was inspired to create my idea because I wanted to put smiles on kids faces. -John



"I want to express my sincere gratitude for the role Davison has played in launching the BikeBoard with me. The design and prototyping resources you supplied were instrumental in demonstrating the validity of the product. Moreover, my ongoing interaction with your business development staff provided effective consultation regarding manufacturing and strategies to bring the project to fruition.
As you know, it was not an overnight process, but the commitment and persistence we shared on this project ultimately brought us to this point. As an inventor and entrepreneur, I appreciate the belief and support of my vision as well as your continued support of the project. I look forward to our continuing work together in the future." - John Iavarone

Twister Bolts

I was inspired to create my idea because my toilet bowl caps kept popping off. -Ruth & Gary



"When Ruth and I contacted your company a year ago, we were naturally skeptical as to how Davison would respond to our needs and concerns regarding our invention. All our concerns soon diminished as Davison proved their professionalism to us.
We experienced excellent written communication, scheduled telephone conversations that were always on time. Friendly professional representatives convinced us we were working with a company that truly cares about their clients.
The Davison Way made a small idea become a reality for both of us. It has been an overwhelming experience.

			Thank you Davison and your team of professionals that made this happen." - Gary

The landmark facility is the only one of its kind in the world and it's been toured by clients, the media and the community.

Adam Davidson: and Michael Parks Two Pipe Set with Leather Bag




Product Number: 002-437-0051


          Some months ago I found myself sitting in Adam Davidson's workshop, watching him and Michael Parks doodling pipe designs onto raw briar - the first step in creating a fine artisanal smoker. When I say raw briar, mind you, I mean a single piece of it, onto which they were sketching, scratching out, and adjusting the prospective shaping of not one, but two pipes. These two pipes, in point of fact, each the creation of one of North America's most renowned pipemakers, and both shaped from the same block of plateau.

Concept-wise, they're a matched set, having begun as mirror-image sketches. However, it was important to both Adam and Michael that they'd each feel free to take the design, finish, and final presentation of both pipes where ever their inclinations and individual styles as artisans may lead, instead of trying compromise either pipe into some manner of Davidson/Parks hybrid. They'd both play to their own strengths, and produce the best they could.

It worked, as you can see. The Michael Parks is unmistakably a Michael Parks - dynamic, rugged, and scoured with a sandblast of remarkably depth and definition. Adam's, likewise, is unmistakably Adam's, A Danish-influenced beauty with an easy (if quite deep) flow, a light, fine sandblast, and one hell of a horn accent. And yes, though the lengths of stem and shank do differ between the two, chamber breadth is matched, and depth varies by only a few hundredths of an inch.

Of course, Michael being an avid outdoorsman, and Adam being a fellow who is very keen on the Revolutionary War period, your usual presentation box or stand just wasn't sufficient. They wanted something for the presentation that reflected a common ground between both their inclinations and personalities. Well, fortunately enough, along with forging, glass-blowing, and briar-shaping, Adam also happens to have good hand for fashioning leather goods. Thus, included with the set is a high-quality, hand-stitched leather bag of rustic design, for which Adam took inspiration from the hunting pouches carried by colonists and frontiersmen of the 18th century. And like good briar, the leather itself is well-aged; it'd been following Adam from move to move for fifteen years, being the spare half of a hide he'd made a blacksmith's apron from as a teenager.

- Eric N. Squires

Michael Flynn and the Trump Administrationâs Lobbyist Secrets | The New YorkerShopSign in|Link your subscriptionAmy Davidson SorkinMichael Flynn and the Trump Administrationâs Lobbyist SecretsBy Amy Davidson SorkinMay 23, 2017If ever there was a case illustrating why a history of lobbying and other conflicts might matter, it is the case of Michael Flynn, the Trump Administrationâs former national-security adviser.PHOTOGRAPH BY JABIN BOTSFORD / THE WASHINGTON POST / GETTYThis week, there have already been reminders of how much the upholding of government ethics relies on access to open informationâand of how little Donald Trumpâs Administration cares about either. Some of those reminders have come in the case of Michael Flynn, the Presidentâs first national-security adviser. Others have come in the Administrationâs clumsy attempt to tell WalterÂ Shaub, the head of the Office of Government Ethics, not to do his job. The Administration had said loudly that it would not allow lobbyists to take positions relating to their âparticularâ lobbying-market niche. It also said, more quietly, that it could issue waivers. And it had, in total silence, issued an unknown number of waivers, as evidenced by lobbyists popping up, without other explanation, at various agencies. (When the Obama Administration issued such waivers, it not only said so but indicated why, in writing.) Shaub had asked various agencies to send him, by June 1st, a list of those waivers, a âdata callâ of the sort that he is explicitly authorized to make. The White House doesnât seem to have liked that.The Presidentâs designated messenger was Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Office of Management and Budget. Mulvaney, in a letter to Shaub that the Times obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (a reminder that openness takes work), said that agencies had asked the White House about the data call, and that he was giving them some âguidance.â His instructions amounted to letting the agencies know thatÂ White House lawyers might have a problem with them giving out information, and a ârequestâ to Shaub that he âstay the data callââthat is, that he just stop asking. The Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department needed to figure out the âpotential legal questionsâ that the request raised, Mulvaney wrote. But there are no legal questionsâother than, perhaps, those that might arise from whatever the waivers revealed.Shaub said no to Mulvaneyâs request. In a ten-page reply, he said that he did not do so lightly but because he did not know how to comply in a way that would not be a renunciation of his officeâs history and its mandate. He included footnotes and citations regarding his legal authority, for Mulvaneyâs âedification.â Mulvaney had complained about the âuniquenessâ of Shaubâs data call, but Shaub made it clear that it was Mulvaneyâs action that was highly unusual.And if ever there wereÂ a case illustrating why a history of lobbying and other conflictsâfactors that the waivers are meant to at least acknowledgeâmight matter, it is the case of Michael Flynn. He has been implicated in the investigation into Russiaâs role in the 2016 election and its possible connections to the Trump campaign, but there are also questions regarding money that his firm took from Turkish interests as an unacknowledged lobbyist for Recep Tayyip ErdoÄanâs regime. (Flynn Â registered as a foreign lobbyist only after the fact.) According to another report this week, Flynn withheld information about his Russian contacts from the Obama Administration, in which he had served as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, before being pushed out when his security clearances were being renewed. Flynn is reportedly planning to invoke the Fifth Amendment when he is called to testify, which is his right, and one of the few legitimate and reasonable uses of silence in this story. But his former colleagues in the Administration should not suppose that his potential invocation of the Fifth magically extends to their offices, in terms of a refusal to, for example, produce documents that Congress or investigators might require. And some of those documents may be significant. Among the most disturbing Flynn stories have been those indicating that the Trump transition team knew about Flynnâs conflictsâand even that he was under federal investigationâbut signed him up anyway. That is not just stonewalling; it is incompetence. It is of a piece with the entire Trump operationâone canât talk about the lack of disclosure without noting that the public still hasnât seen the Presidentâs tax returns. For that matter, the congressional Republicans tried to start their spree of legislating, with the support of a President of the same party, by sidelining its ethical overseer.But there is something distinctly dangerous about a government that thinks that what it can hide and lie about does not, for practical purposes, existâthat if no one knows about it, itâs not a problem, even internally.Â People in government, even under the best Administrations, tend to care less about things that are bad if they think that no one will ever find outÂ about them. There is an impulse to hide, rather than to fix. But the Trump Administration seems to have stopped caring at all. The alarming possibility is that the White House doesnât just think that when something is out of sight it is out of the publicâs mind but that it then vanishes from the minds of the President and his aides, as well.The White Houseâs evident indifference raises the question of whether, prior to Shaubâs inquiry, anyone there was even keeping track of how many waivers were being granted, and where, and at what cost, or if they were just left out for the taking, like office-party doughnuts. It is, at any rate, a good guess that the Shaub-Mulvaney conflict prefigures any number of fights to come. Some will end up in court, and may have to be resolved by a reÃ«xamination, by the Supreme Court, of the meaning of executive privilege.Non-disclosure can also involve a false assertion that there is no information to disclose. The Washington Post reported that President Trump asked the heads of intelligence agencies to publicly deny that there was anything to the Russian investigation. (They apparently demurred.) By his own admission, Trump fired James Comey because that inquiry annoyed him. And then there are the Administrationâs arguments, in support of its travel ban, that the courts should allow the White House to pretend that the ban has nothing to do with Muslims. But this kind of thing never works for long, or at least it shouldnât, in a democracy.Trump and his circle may prefer a different model. On Monday, Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, appeared on CNBC, discussing the Presidentâs visit to Saudi Arabia. He found it âfascinatingâ that there was not âa single hint of a protester anywhere there during the whole time we were there.â So much more pleasant than here! And, really, blind nonsense: Saudi Arabia is a repressive regime that silences dissent, with a reputation for corruption that has fuelled discontent and provided fodder for extremists. (Secrets come out, in one form or the other.) Becky Quick, the Â interviewer, suggested as much to Ross. He agreed that âin theoryâ fear may have been a factor, âbut, boy, there was certainly no sign of it,â he said. âThe mood was genuinely good.â Perhaps the mood was helped by the giant portraits of Trump projected on buildings around Riyadh, among the golden hotels and palaces.Most Popular1.Ryan LizzaAnthony Scaramucci Called Me to Unload About White House Leakers, Reince Priebus, and Steve BannonBy Ryan Lizza2.Daily CommentDonald Trumpâs State of Mind, and OursBy Evan Osnos3.Daily ShoutsNewly Discovered Very Illegal Thing Will Finally Bring Down Trump (Or Be Another Cute Tile in the Mosaic of Democracyâs Demise, I Guess)By Broti Gupta4.Satire from The Borowitz ReportGirl Scouts Obtain Restraining Order Against TrumpBy Andy Borowitz5.Amy Davidson SorkinWhen Anthony Scaramucci Fell in Love with Donald TrumpBy Amy Davidson Sorkinour thirty most popularVideoPlay VideoHow Will Trumpâs Presidency End?In the first of an ongoing series of panel discussions called âPublic Forum: A Well-Ordered Nation,â David Remnick asks Salman Rushdie, Tony Kushner, and Claudia Rankine how they envision the final days of the Trump Administration.Recommended StoriesAmy Davidson SorkinH.

Publisher's Descriptionâ¼â²
In this classic work, the author joins the dots between three of the most powerful words in language: life, judgment and inheritance. Unless we understand all three of these words, we will find ourselves at a disadvantage in trying to pay the cost of discipleship. We will find ourselves unable to achieve the goal of godly passion, which is intimacy. The journey from the New Birth to the New Jerusalem is called "life." It is our life that determines our rank in the eternal city. You will never look at life in the same way again after reading this book. You will discover the role that intimacy plays in the grand scheme of things and find practical ways to achieve it. Judgment is not a word to be feared. One of the wisest things we can do is look at the manner in which God will assess our lives. Our purpose is to discover the things that please Him here, that we may better enjoy Him there. The goal is to enter fully into the inheritance that God has destined for us. The Invitation is both deeply inspirational and profoundly insightful. It is packed with new thoughts that move the reader both spiritually and metaphorically from life, through judgment, to the wedding feast of the Lamb. Michael Davidson is a church elder, worship leader, and Bible teacher. His ministry passion is to see Christians reach their destiny in Christ. He and his wife, Irene, have two married children, and live in Prince George, B.C., Canada.
