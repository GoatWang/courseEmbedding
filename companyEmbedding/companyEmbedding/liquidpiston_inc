LiquidPiston is HIRING.  $5,000 reward offered for referral for Chief Engineer position.



 








How It Works
LiquidPiston’s X Engine is a non-Wankel rotary embodiment of the company’s innovative High Efficiency Hybrid Cycle (HEHC). The X Engine has few parts and three combustion events per rotor revolution, resulting in tremendous power density.


This video shows an X engine operating on compression-ignition HEHC. The spark-ignition HEHC, X Mini, has a similar architecture but operates at a lower compression ratio.
The X Engine’s few moving parts consist of a rotor (the primary work-producing component) and an eccentric shaft. Except for ancillary parts such as injectors, fuel pumps, and oil pumps, there are no other moving parts, making the X Engine extremely simple and elegant.
LiquidPiston’s X Engine architecture geometry allows for standard materials and 2-D manufacturing to be used, greatly decreasing the design, build and testing cycle.
While it is a rotary engine, LiquidPiston’s X Engine is NOT a Wankel engine. It has a fundamentally different thermodynamic cycle, architecture and operation.

Combustion Engines Haven't Been Updated in 100 Years

Over 120 years ago, the thermodynamic cycles for Otto (gasoline) and Diesel cycles for internal combustion
     engines were developed — and the piston engine design hasn’t changed much since the days of Henry Ford. 
     Liquid Piston has designed a totally new type of rotary internal combustion engine technology. 
     The design is new. The thermodynamic cycle is new; the approach is rooted in physics and optimization. The engine is up to 2x more efficient than comparable powered gasoline engines in production today, and up to 10x smaller and lighter than comparable Diesel engines.
  





 


 

 



Multi-Fuel Capable

Much like a piston engine can be configured to run on different fuels, the LiquidPiston engine can do the same. We have demonstrated the engine on gasoline, Diesel, kerosene, and JP8 fuels. Our most advanced engine prototype, the 70cc Spark-Ignited XMv3 engine, has successfully run multiple types of fuel in a single configuration, including gasoline and kerosene.   Our 300cc X4 concept is intended to run Compression Ignition on Diesel.      


Piston Engine vs. LiquidPiston

Today’s gasoline engines, in a typical automotive drive cycle, only convert about 20% of the available energy in the fuel into useful mechanical work, and 80% of the energy is then wasted as heat
     in the exhaust, or out the radiator. 

Our approach fundamentally changes the thermodynamic cycle of the engine, to make a much more efficient engine. As a result, our engine has the potential to be up to 2x more efficient vs. a gasoline engine, while also being incredibly power dense – about 10 times smaller and lighter than any other diesel engine out there; it, is also quieter, and has near zero vibration.
 
     In addition, the X Engine is incredibly simple – it has just two primary moving parts, and yet 
     it achieves three combustion events per rotor revolution, resulting in tremendous power density.




Video: Old School Engine Inefficiency


The traditional combustion process is far from ideal. Today’s engines rely on injecting, mixing, and burning the fuel while the piston is near “Top Dead Center”, but it takes a long time. By the time the engine is actually burning the fuel, the piston is already expanding and the pressures are dropping due to expansion which fight the combustion, so the engine is not efficiently converting the heat from combustion into mechanical work.
 

 
Video: Liquid Piston Efficiency 

The ‘X’ rotary engine allows for a longer period to burn all of the fuel at a nearly constant combustion chamber volume. The arc of the rotor matches the arc of the housing, which means that the rotor can continue turning at high speed while the combustion chamber volume remains approximately constant for a longer period. This gives the engine more time to burn the fuel resulting in a much more complete combustion process before it starts expanding the gases. Constant Volume combustion has been shown, thermodynamically, to improve efficiency by 50% over a Diesel engine.

"Today, a 30kw diesel generator weighs 2750 pounds. Imagine the impact if we can reduce that to less than 200 pounds!  Such an ultra-portable generator can be used in new applications, for example to charge the battery of an Electric Vehicle (REV), or enable hybrid electric drones."




Alexander Shkolnik
Founder & CEO Liquid Piston




LiquidPiston vs. Wankel Rotary Engine






See How it works

        The X engine is simple, having only 2 moving parts – a rotor and a shaft, yet it executes the optimized High Efficiency Hybrid Cycle – potentially doubling the fuel economy of the engine, while the it also achieves 3 combustion events per revolution, making the engine incredible compact, up to 10x smaller and lighter than today’s comparable power diesel engine.  The low part count and reduced raw material could make the engine significantly cheaper as well when volume production is reached.
    






How It Works






Built and Tested




LiquidPiston in Action

       In June of 2016, the X-mini engine has been successfully installed into a vehicle demonstrator (e.g. a "Go-Kart"), marking a significant milestone in development.  This milestone is the first time the engine is run outside the lab, and shows the engine powering something tangible that users can feel. 
      Significant development was required to move the engine from the lab and into this application, especially in cooling the engine so it does not overheat, developing the controls and mapping the engine across its operating band, etc.
    






Go Kart Demo (Short)






Go Kart Demo (Long)




Immediate Use Cases

Over the past two years, LiquidPiston has developed the XMv3 "X-Mini" 70cc Spark Ignited engine, which is the Company’s most advanced demonstrator to date.  An engine of this size could power everyday items like handheld lawn equipment, including chainsaws or brush cutters, small generators, or small vehicles including mopeds, go-karts, etc (as shown by our go-kart video above). This engine is demonstrated in and out of the lab, and is already showing excellent power density, low-vibration, good fuel economy, and ability to run on multiple fuels including gasoline or JP-8. 
  

This is just the beginning; our next engine platform will be the 30kW X4 Diesel rotary engine.  The objective of the X4 program, for which we are seeking DoD development funding, is to make a 30kW engine that will fit in a 10x8x8" box, weigh just 30 pounds, and operate at 45% brake thermal efficiency - better efficiency than a heavy duty truck, from an engine the size of a shoebox!  In addition to ultra compact and efficient generators, and power for things like drones, companies that produce electric vehicles (including ground and air vehicles) may also be interested to use our small ultra efficient engine as a range extender to charge their batteries and dramatically extend range, or enable EVs that use small, cheap, lightweight battery packs, but still offer the consumer the range and ability to rapidly refuel their vehicles that drivers expect – all at a potentially lower CO2 footprint as compared to plugging your EV into the U.S. Power Grid!
  
Ultimately, we see our engine platform replacing any engine in use today, addressing a $460 Billion market opportunity.   Before addressing the larger automotive and trucking markets, our strategy is to identify initial niche applications, where customers have an immediate and painful need for higher power to weight Diesel engines, and more fuel efficient engines.  To that end, the company already has a lot of traction with the military, which could be a great beachhead customer. They need improved engines for vehicles, generators, drones, power for other land, sea, and air vehicles, robotics systems, etc.

Letter from Alexander Shkolnik (CEO) to Potential Investors
September 7, 2016


We are a father and son team: Nick, a physicist and accomplished inventor, and Alec, an MIT-trained computer scientist. We set out 12 years ago to fundamentally improve combustion engines in order to make an impact that will last for generations to come. The reality of today’s engines is that ~80% of the energy in fuel is wasted as unutilized heat. That’s unnecessary, and results in far too much CO2, CO, NOx and other emissions that negatively impact our environment. There have been many incremental improvements to engines over the last century – but few breakthroughs have had significant impact.




Our approach is rooted in physics. We started with defining a new thermodynamic cycle, and then experimented with different engine architectures to embody this cycle using available tools and materials. After more than 10 years, and $20M invested in development, our fourth generation engine architecture, the “X” Engine, is ready for launch. The implications are profound. In an era where we are emitting too much CO2 and other pollutants, and where the US imports 1/3 of our fuel from global sources, our technology can have ramifications on the climate, on national security, as well as on consumer’s pocketbooks, as we can save $ Billions for consumers at the pump.

We all recognize that trucks and automobiles are a dominant consumer of fuel, and the past several years have seen a focus on “Zero Emission” vehicles, e.g. electric vehicles (EVs). Unfortunately, the reality is that the electricity comes mainly from burning oil, gas and coal – with significant CO2 footprints. EVs have additional issues – batteries are expensive and contain toxic materials; motors use rare earth magnets; etc. Ironically, we do believe that electric cars will be the future – just not exactly how Tesla’s Elon Musk envisions it. We see our technology complementing, e.g. “range-extending”, an EV utilizing a small, lightweight, inexpensive battery pack. Such an approach can lower the CO2 footprint of the vehicle compared to charging a “pure” electric vehicle on the U.S. power grid. Drivers would retain the range they are accustomed to and the ability to refuel rapidly, at any fuel station, using existing infrastructure, while 90% of one’s daily driving could be accomplished in a single battery charge - a winning solution for everyone.


The irony does not escape us – we are proponents of electric vehicles who have started an internal combustion engine company. We believe that the global economy will be dependent on fossil fuels for many decades and that engines used in transportation applications, if optimized, will complement electric power systems for optimal efficiency, reliability and environmental sustainability. With a range extended system, we can take advantage of the benefits of both types of power generation.



Unfortunately, the design-in time to adopt a new powertrain technology into the automobile industry can take up to 20 years. This is not an appropriate time scale for a startup. For this reason, we have developed a phased technology roadmap that starts with engines that can serve the military. Our military forces have an immediate need for lighter, smaller, more efficient Diesel (heavy fuel) engines. Our initial product lines will include a 2-3kW (3-5 HP) engine/generator, and a 30kW (40 HP) engine. Both of these products will find commercial applications beyond the military – in handheld power products, small vehicles, generators, etc. We currently have the X-Mini engine powering a go-kart as a vehicle demonstrator. Our strategy is to prove the engine in these “niche” applications, which, by the way, have Total Available Markets measured in the tens of billions of dollars, before launching a product for the automotive market. Thus, we start with very big markets, and end with huge markets.


The combustion engine market is ripe for a disruption. Your investment can help make it happen. We welcome your support to take this revolutionary new engine technology from prototype to productization and use in real world applications.

                  What are you guys building?
                  



We’re developing a new type of engine. We’re making a totally new type of rotary internal combustion engine technology, innovating in both the physics (thermodynamics) and design of how current engines work.

It’s been over 100 years since the fundamental thermodynamic cycles for a combustion engine --  basically how all heat engines operate -- were introduced to the market. The cycle describes the underlying physics of the engine. Not only have we developed an optimized cycle, but we’ve built prototype engines to implement this new cycle, and we are now ready to commercialize the technology. That can be truly disruptive on a global scale!

Our technology is really grounded in physics, and we’re trying to fundamentally change the thermodynamics of the engine, to make a much more efficient cycle. We’re also embodying that cycle in a new type of engine design that offers still more efficiency, while also being extremely compact and lightweight. Our engine will be up to 10 times smaller and lighter than any other diesel engine out there, is quieter, and has near zero vibration, while potentially doubling the fuel efficiency over a gasoline engine.




                  How is it better than the current internal combustion engine?
                  



We’re changing the physics processes of how the engine operates to make them more efficient. Today’s engines, in a typical automotive drive cycle, only convert about 20% of the available energy in the fuel into useful mechanical work, and 80% of the energy is wasted as heat through exhaust, friction, and cooling losses. Consider the Diesel engine, which is known to be more efficient than a gasoline engine; in reality, the Diesel combustion process is far from ideal. Diesels rely on injecting, mixing, and burning of the fuel while the piston is near “Top Dead Center”, but these processes actually take a long time. By the time the engine is actually burning the fuel, the piston is already expanding and the pressures are dropping, so the engine is not converting all of the heat addition into useful work – its literally wasting this heat in the exhaust. Ideally, the engine would try to bring the piston to a dead halt at the top dead center position, to allow the fuel time to mix and burn, but that’s almost impossible to do with a conventional piston architecture.

Instead, we are using a rotary engine, which allows us a lot of flexibility in the geometry to allow for a longer period to burn all the fuel. If you look at the operation of our engine, you will see the arc of the rotor matches the arc of the housing. This means that the rotor continues turning at high speed, but near Top Dead Center position, the volume remains approximately constant for a longer period. This gives the engine more time, and therefore a much more complete combustion process before it starts expanding the gases. Even just applying this one feature of Constant Volume Combustion, the engine can extract 50% more energy vs a Diesel engine.

The thermodynamics is described by the High Efficiency Hybrid Cycle (HEHC) that we developed. It utilizes 1) a high compression ratio; 2) constant volume combustion; and 3) over-expansion of gas until approximately atmospheric pressure is attained. The result is a 74% thermodynamic efficiency, which is significantly improved over gasoline or Diesel piston engines in use today. For comparison, the Diesel cycle has a thermodynamic efficiency of 57%.   Efficiency is important because it translates to lower cost (less fuel consumption) for users, and longer range for mobile applications. 

Typical engine development is incremental, and may change a single parameter, often at the expense of another. . We’re really trying to improve the engine in all parameters, so we can combine a potential 2x improvement in fuel economy with up to a 10x reduction in size and weight over a diesel engine. And because it’s 10x less material, in volume production it’s anticipated to be quite a bit cheaper than today’s engines, in a package that has little to no vibration, is well balanced and responsive, and relatively quiet.




                  What are the initial use cases?
                  



We have two versions of the engine under development – the tiny 70cc Spark Ignited X-Mini v3 (XMv3), which is working in the lab now as a proven engine prototype; and a larger 300cc Compression Ignited (Diesel / JP8), “X4” engine concept.   The X4 weighs a meager 30 pounds, and fits in a 10x8x8” box – while producing 40 HP of power.  The X4 is a more optimized, refined, and longer term engine development program, which is just in initial stages of the design phase.

Ultimately, we see the engine potentially replacing any combustion engine in use today. But we’re starting with the military as a first potential customer. We have a lot of traction with them already, as they have such an immediate, dire need for an improved engine. Right now, the military relies on JP-8 fuel, which is a heavy fuel - so they are forced to use Diesel engines, which are big and heavy. Furthermore, consider that it can take up to 99 gallons of fuel to deliver a single gallon to the frontline. It’s not just expensive in terms of dollars; this oil must be protected on its journey, and we lose soldiers some times in protecting this fuel on its way to the frontline. With the military, costs can literally be measured in human lives, so efficiency is especially critical. They are a good customer for us, because they are willing to help pay for development, and in the long term, are willing to purchase large numbers of engines to power all of their equipment. In fact, a single generator contract (for one engine size) can be on the order of $200M, enough to build a viable business.

Within the military, there are a number of applications that our engine can serve, with similar immediate and painful needs for better power systems. For example, consider the standard 30kW Diesel generators that power mobile command centers today - they weigh 2700 pounds, and we could reduce this to < 200 pounds. A few people could lift and move this, rather than a whole truck, so it’s a really game changing technology.

We’re also looking at other applications, for example drones, power for other land, sea, and air vehicles, robotics systems, etc. there’s just so many applications even within that one target customer. Of course, the military is just a starting point - there are similar applications on the commercial side that we can move into when ready.




                  In the long term, what kind of products will use your engine?
                  



The first product/application pathway is a prototype engine which we have been working on and which is running in the lab right now, called the “X mini”. This engine could be used to power, for example, various types of lawn equipment, like chainsaws or leaf blowers. The X-mini is a Spark-Ignited engine that displaces 70cc, has 3 firing chambers (despite of having just two moving parts), is about the size of a grapefruit and weighs about 4 pounds. Even though it’s so tiny, it’s produces 3hp right now, and it’s on its way to producing up to 5 hp when fully developed. Still, even at 3hp, it’s already far better than anything out there today. You’d get a lot more power, lower the weight, and because there’s no vibration, you can use handheld equipment for longer without feeling like your hand will fall off. We can also see applications in small vehicles, like mopeds, and drones, which could also benefit from their light weight and lessened vibration.

We are also in discussions with the DoD to develop a slightly larger engine. This is a 300cc displacement engine that is expected to produce about 40 hp. This engine will fit in a 10x8x8” box, and weigh less than 30 pounds. While the military applications (e.g. drones and generators) are obvious, consider that cars are widely predicted to move more toward autonomous driving, and electrification of the drivetrain, and we want to incorporate our engines into future vehicles in a way that takes advantage of these changes.

There are electric cars with a 200-300 mile range, but this range comes at the cost of having  large, heavy and expensive battery packs, and  and charging outside the home is a hassle. We envision a car that has a small battery pack that can cover 95% of your daily driving needs, and if you need longer range, our generator would kick in. It’d be lightweight and you could even have it as an “attachment” sitting in a little box in your trunk. You could use that to charge up your batteries and then, every couple hundred miles, you could refuel the generator itself at any standard gas station, rather than having to find a special charging station. We therefore make EVs affordable for everyone, while allowing consumers the ability to rapidly refuel and the range they are accustomed to. However, perhaps even more important - as our engine is so efficient, you’d actually have a lower CO2 footprint if you charge your battery with our engine, rather than plugging into the US power grid. This is because the power grid relies on significant sources of fossil fuel, and generation, transmission, distribution, and charging networks turn out to be less efficient than a small generator based on our engine.




                  How long have you been working on this?
                  



Nick’s been working on the physics of the engine for something like 20 years. As a physicist, the inefficiency of present-day engines always bothered him, and he saw this opportunity to make a much more efficient engine. In the late 1990s, while he was a clean energy program manager working at an innovation think tank, he did an analysis of what would be the most probable path of development for power conversion devices (evaluating fuel cells, supercapacitors, batteries, etc.), and concluded that, basically, engines are here to stay. This conclusion has been affirmed by a number of studies, and that’s when he decided to really make a push to invent a better engine that wasn’t so inefficient, large, and polluting.

We [Nick and Alec] teamed up in 2004 and applied physics and optimization to improve the efficiency and fundamental operation of the combustion engine. We think there’s a lot of room for improvement, and that engines can be pushed to convert at least half of the fuel energy to actual work, as opposed to the current 20%. That’s a two to three time improvement in efficiency, which can have a very big impact.

We were always targeting this ultra high efficiency, and we’ve been actively working on this for about a decade. When we first started out in 2004, we thought we were going to do an auxiliary power unit for long-haul trucks. It wasn’t until last year that we found out about this incredible need within the military, and last year we entered into a contract with DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), which is basically the research arm of the military. So far, close to $18 million has been invested in the technology, through venture capital and $1M through DARPA. We are now on our fourth completely new generation of the engine architecture. This is the final configuration, and embodies the same thermodynamic cycle as the original “LiquidPiston” engine, but each iteration got simpler, easier to seal, and you just can’t get any simpler than the ‘X’ engine that we have right now.




                  How technically challenging is what you’ve built?
                  



The ‘X’ rotary engine is an incredibly simple device that has just two moving parts: the rotor and the shaft. Still, it implements all of the attributes of our optimized thermodynamic cycle. That was the first thing we had to work out: how to capture our cycle with a new kind of engine. If you look at the Wankel engine, it has a peanut-shaped housing and a triangular rotor. Our engine has the opposite - a peanut rotor inside a three-lobed housing. Because of this inversion, we can achieve a higher compression ratio, constant volume combustion, and over expansion (the processes that characterize our improved high efficiency cycle).

Second was the most critical aspect of any kind of rotary engine -- the sealing, which prevents gas from leaving your high-pressure chamber. When trying to achieve high efficiency, it’s really important to keep the gas in the chamber. Unlike the Wankel engine, our apex seals are stationary, so they don’t have the dynamics challenges that the old Wankel engine did. In addition, we’re able to supply lubricant directly to these areas, so the engine can be really durable. We can reduce oil consumption by a full order of magnitude by directly lubricating the seals, as opposed to consuming oil in the combustion chamber which is what the Wankel does. We can therefore solve the fuel consumption, lubrication, emissions and durability challenges experienced by the old Wankel, while sharing the inherent simplicity and compact operation of the rotary engine.

So, it's been quite the process, first in selecting the most appropriate architecture to embody our cycle, and then getting all of the implementation details right. In fact, most of the focus of our work with DARPA this past year was focused around sealing. Once we figured that out, we automatically have a much better combustion system.




                  Will you manufacture the engines yourself or outsource it?
                  



We’re not planning to take our engines into high-volume production directly. We are opting for a capital-efficient business model that leverages our intellectual property position. We will establish partnerships in the industry and in the defense base, and work with manufacturers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to bring our products to market. Ultimately, we’re going to be designing custom engines and providing engineering and testing services as a subcontractor for the manufacturer. This is pretty standard in the industry, for example GM will usually subcontract their engine development as well to one of a handful of engine design houses (like FEV, AVL, Ricardo, or IAV). We will ask them to fund our development for each program. In addition – and in the long term, this would become the largest income stream for the business, we will also charge royalties and upfront license fees for engines produced by partners.

For us, it’s incredibly important to find a first partner that will adopt and embrace the technology and take it to market, and that is what we are working to achieve with highest priority.




                  How many patents do you have and what stage are they in?
                  



The company has 27 patents that are issued or pending, which cover the technology. We are working with a great IP attorney, Bruce Sunstein, out of Boston, who is famous for patenting the Segway. Our portfolio is deep - at the top, we have issued patents that cover the entire thermodynamic cycle. One layer down from the cycle, we have issued patents that cover the ‘X’ engine architecture. The next layer covers implementation details - for example the strategies for cooling, lubricating and controlling the engine.




                  Do you have customers right now?
                  



Right now, we have two potential contracts with the DoD that are in final stages of proposal evaluation. These contracts could total up to over 12 million dollars, and those could come through later this year. These contracts don’t pay for everything, but if we can get some of these military contracts with non-dilutive funding in place, it’ll really help us and investors along.

One of these funding sources takes technologies that are demonstrated but not quite to the point where they are ready to be embraced, and they try to cross them over into that tipping point where they can be adopted. That’s a $3 million program that we submitted, in partnership with two major defense contractors - one of which is very well-known for making drones, and the other is a leader in providing military generator sets. This is really great for us, because not only does it fund our development of the product, but we’ll also have a partnership with a manufacturer with the sales distribution and manufacturing channels to sell the product to the military. At the end of this 24 month program and $3 million effort, we’ll have a working, running diesel generator that builds on our existing technology, will be field-tested by the Army, will be environmentally tested by our development partners, and we will be lined up perfectly with a potential future strategic partner.




                  Why is the military an ideal first customer for you?
                  



A single generator contract in the military can be on the order of about $200 million. That’s for a single contract for about a five year period. And they’ll issue a new contract for every different engine size. We can build a lucrative business just in this DoD genset application. We view it as a stepping stone to an ultimate vision, but you can see how we can build a very nice and sustainable business here.

And they have relatively low barriers to entry. In order to produce a new type of engine, a company must meet emission standards, warranty suitable durability for the customer’s application and a reasonable price to enter the market. The military has clear performance needs and, depending on the application, durability and emissions standards that are generally more lax than the general consumer market, making this early hurdle of production easier to get over. It saves time and money at this stage to not have to worry about such stringent qualifications.  In the long term we are confident that the engine can meet today’s emissions and durability expectations, but its beneficial to have a first customer that can relax these requirements.




                  What technical challenges do you still need to solve?
                  



In the development process we have at least two phases: research, which is inventive, and development, which is more focused on engineering and productization. For the XMv3 line (where efficiency is less optimized), our research is mostly done, and we’re entering into the development stage where most of the problems become engineering tasks. It’s a standard engineering development focused on durability and emission that will require time and resources but the major inventive processes have already been accomplished.

Our next major phase will focus on increasing and providing durability. All our efforts to-date have been improving the performance and efficiency of our engine. We have the engine running in steady-state, so that it won’t overheat when you run it for a long period of time. On our most recent engine, we were able to run it for about 15 hours. Our next goal is 50 hours, which is the basic requirement for EPA certification as a handheld engine. Our ultimate goal is to have it run for hundreds or thousands of hours, but that will require additional development.

For DARPA, we also have another program under way, which is really pushing the limits of efficiency and the power density and tightly integrating the entire engine into a neat package. So far, we’ve been very focused on the engine core, and have yet to focus on the package, but the DARPA program may cover that.




                  Who are your competitors?
                  



There are a couple other startups doing combustion engines. Most of them focus on relatively large engines because they’re going after the automotive and trucking industry, which is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. But even a very good, proven technology can take about 20 years to be adopted into the general automotive space, which is why we’ve moved away from that.

We’re focused on much smaller engines, where there’s much less development. But even though, right now, this is a step away from the auto industry, we see a lot of room for growth even within that industry as more and more cars become self-driving vehicles. Then, you’ll really be looking for lighter vehicles and smaller engines, and we’ll be well-positioned for that.




                  How big is the market?
                  



The market is $400 billion for combustion engines. About 75% of that is cars and trucks, but that still leaves over $100 billion for other applications. That non-automotive market is where we’ll initially enter. Still, though, that’s a huge market, and you can carve out really niche applications that are still sizeable enough to build a business. As an example, the handheld equipment engine market is itself a $7 billion market.

Longer-term, as we noted earlier, LiquidPiston plans to be in the range-extender engine market as the automotive industry increasingly becomes hybrid electric. Our power density and high-efficiency will make our engine an ideal fit for that application.




                  How much will your engine cost?
                  



In single quantity our 3-5 HP engine would cost about $30,000, and in fact we are planning on making limited quantities of “development kits” available to select strategic partners. In a quantity of 500,000, the manufacturing cost of the engine core drops to a much lower number, that’s competitive with piston engines, except that we’re going to have a lot more power coming out of the package.




                  Why are you guys the right team?
                  



We have a really solid partnership and team, with really complementary backgrounds. I’m [Nick] a mechanical engineer and physicist with a PhD in physics from the University of Connecticut. All my life, I have been interested in energy conversion devices and, specifically, engines.

My [Alec’s] background is primarily technical. I studied at Emory University in computer science, mathematics, neuroscience, and behavioral biology, and did my Masters jointly at Georgia Tech. Then, I got my PhD at MIT in computer science with a focus on robotics, funded by DARPA. I see all these things as being similar: neurons and robots and engines. They’re all technical systems with complicated dynamics. I just like solving tough technical challenges and playing with models. That’s what motivates me.

We founded the company while Alec was doing his PhD at MIT. While there, we competed in the 50K Competition, and took second place, beating over 100 teams. Our advisor in the competition became our first venture capital investor a few years later, which really helped form the company.

From our background, you can clearly see that we, the founders, are outsiders of the engine industry. We believe this to be a great asset for the company as it is very difficult for people within the engine industry to overcome the psychological inertia that is inherent to all engineers and, more generally, to humans. Sometimes it takes an outsiders to see the world in a different light and to come up with understanding of problems and, correspondingly, with solutions, which are “hidden” to insiders. TRIZ – (Russian acronym that stands for Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) – helped us a lot in this process. Having said this, we also recognize the fact that being outsiders (read “amateurs”) could be a great detriment to the company. This is why, from day one of our company existence, we have surrounded ourselves with true experts in engine technology. Together, we formed a winning combination of inventiveness, rigorous analysis and methodical engineering, which allowed us to solve myriads of technical challenges and, finally, to build a fully functional, operating engine.

We have a few other people on the management team: Per Suneby, who got an MBA from Harvard Business School, and worked for GE and Motorola doing program management. About 20 years ago, he jumped into startups and since then, he’s been an entrepreneur working with various startups including LiquidPiston, as well as spending some time as a Venture Partner with a leading venture capital firm.

The other person to highlight is Dr. Tony Tether, the former director of DARPA. He was the longest serving director in DARPA’s history, and managed over $25 billion in various technology development programs during his tenure. We are honored to welcome Tony to our board of directors and, being really connected in the industry, he can help connect us with potential military contractor partners.




                  What results show the improved efficiency?
                  



State of the art automotive gasoline engines reach peak efficiencies around 38% Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE), however their average efficiency over a typical drive cycle is only on the order of 20% because efficiency drops when the engine is not running in its sweet spot, which it almost never is. Our XMv3 engine is a tiny engine – with an effective compression displacement of only 19cc per chamber  (the entire engine displaces 70cc, but each individual chamber compresses only 19cc).  We have measured 18% BTE on gasoline, and extrapolated result of 21% BTE on diesel (based on firing one chamber).  For reference, a competitive 23cc handheld gasoline engine, documented in Gordan Blair’s textbook on engines, achieves only 12% BTE – so the XMv3 shows a 50% improvement already.   The XMv3, however, was designed for low cost lawn and garden applications – it was not designed for optimal efficiency. Supported by various thermodynamic modeling tools, extrapolating our engine to a larger size in the model, when the X engine is scaled up to automotive size and operating on diesel fuel in Compression Ignition mode, the engine can reach a peak efficiency of 47-57% and, most importantly, the average efficiency on the order of 40-50%. The fuel consumption of the vehicle is directly proportional to this average efficiency.
